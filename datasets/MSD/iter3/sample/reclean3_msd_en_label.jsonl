Complications include cardiovascular disorders (particularly in people with excess abdominal fat), diabetes mellitus, certain cancers, cholelithiasis, fatty liver, cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, reproductive disorders in men and women, psychologic disorders, and, for people with BMI ≥ 35, premature death. Diagnosis is based on BMI. Treatment includes lifestyle modification (eg, in diet, physical activity, and behavior) and, for certain patients, drugs or bariatric (weight-loss) surgery.  Prevalence of obesity in the US is high in all age groups . In 2017-2018, 42.4% of adults were obese (1 General reference Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. Prevalence was lowest among non-Hispanic Asian adults (17.4%) as compared to non-Hispanic black (49.6%), Hispanic (44.8%), and non-Hispanic white (42.2%) adults. There were no significant differences in prevalence between men and women among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, or Hispanic adults; however, prevalence among non-Hispanic black women (56.9%) was higher than all other groups.  In the US, obesity and its complications cause as many as 300,000 premature deaths each year, making it second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death. General reference 1. Hales CM, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, et al: Prevalence of obesity and severe obesity among adults: United States, 2017–2018. NCHS Data Brief, no 360. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics, 2020. Etiology of Obesity Causes of obesity are probably multifactorial and include genetic predisposition. Ultimately, obesity results from a long-standing imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, including energy utilization for basic metabolic processes and energy expenditure from physical activity. However, many other factors appear to increase a person's predisposition to obesity, including endocrine disruptors (eg, bisphenol A [BPA]), gut microbiome, sleep/wake cycles, and environmental factors. Genetic factors Heritability of BMI is about 66%. Genetic factors may affect the many signaling molecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract to regulate food intake . Genetic factors can be inherited or result from conditions in utero (called genetic imprinting). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin) or abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor). Pathways Regulating Food Intake Preabsorptive and postabsorptive signals from the gastrointestinal tract and changes in plasma nutrient levels provide short- and long-term feedback to regulate food intake: Gastrointestinal hormones (eg, glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], cholecystokinin [CCK], peptide YY [PYY]) reduce food intake. Ghrelin, secreted primarily by the stomach, increases food intake. Leptin, secreted from adipose tissue, informs the brain how much fat is stored. Leptin suppresses appetite in normal-weight people, but high leptin levels correlate with increased body fat. Leptin levels can decrease when weight is lost and then send a hunger signal to the brain. The hypothalamus integrates various signals involved in the regulation of energy balance and then activates pathways that increase or decrease food intake: Neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (ARP), alpha-melanocyte–stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART), orexin, and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) increase food intake. Corticotropic hormone (CRH) and urocortin decrease it. The limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex) mediates the hedonistic pathway for food intake, including cravings, habit, and reward. The desire to eat can override homeostatic pathways because emotion and stress have been shown to affect regulatory peptides such as ghrelin. These effects are mediated by dopamine. Genetic factors also regulate energy expenditure, including basal metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, and nonvoluntary activity–associated thermogenesis. Genetic factors may have a greater effect on the distribution of body fat, particularly abdominal fat (which increases the risk of metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Environmental factors Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important determinants of energy intake include Portion sizes The energy density of the food High-calorie foods (eg, processed foods), diets high in refined carbohydrates, and consumption of soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote weight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins, with water as the main fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain. Regulatory factors Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, and intrauterine growth restriction can disturb weight regulation and contribute to weight gain during childhood and later. Obesity that persists beyond early childhood makes weight loss in later life more difficult. The composition of the gut microbiome also appears to be an important factor; early use of antibiotics and other factors that alter the composition of the gut microbiome may promote weight gain and obesity later in life (1 Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. Early exposure to obesogens, a type of endocrine-disrupting chemical (eg, cigarette smoke, bisphenol A, air pollution, flame retardants, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls) can alter metabolic set points through epigenetics or nuclear activation, increasing the propensity of developing obesity (2 Regulatory factors ). Adverse childhood events or abuse in early childhood increase risk of several disorders, including obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's adverse childhood events study demonstrated that childhood history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse predicted an 8% increase risk of BMI ≥ 30 and 17.3% of BMI ≥ to 40. Certain types of abuse carried the strongest risk. For example, frequent verbal abuse had the largest increase in risk (88%) for BMI > 40. Being often hit and injured increased the risk of BMI > 30 by 71% (3 Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. Cited mechanisms for the association between abuse and obesity include neurobiologic and epigenetic phenomena (4 Etiology references Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. About 15% of women permanently gain ≥ 20 lb with each pregnancy. Insufficient sleep (usually considered < 6 to 8 hours/night) can result in weight gain by changing the levels of satiety hormones that promote hunger. Drugs, including corticosteroids, lithium, traditional antidepressants (tricyclics, tetracyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]), benzodiazepines, antiseizure drugs, thiazolidinediones (eg, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), beta-blockers, and antipsychotic drugs, can cause weight gain. Uncommonly, weight gain is caused by one of the following disorders: Brain damage caused by a tumor (especially a craniopharyngioma) or an infection (particularly those affecting the hypothalamus), which can stimulate consumption of excess calories Hyperinsulinism due to pancreatic tumors Overview of Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors Pancreatic endocrine tumors arise from islet and gastrin-producing cells and often produce many hormones.Hypercortisolism due to Cushing syndrome Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.Eating disorders At least 2 pathologic eating patterns may be associated with obesity: Binge eating disorder Binge Eating Disorder Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large amounts of food with a feeling of loss of control. This disorder does not include compensatory behaviors, such as vomiting. Binge eating disorder occurs in about 3.5% of women and 2% of men during their lifetime and in about 10 to 20% of people entering weight reduction programs. Obesity is usually severe, large amounts of weight are frequently gained or lost, and pronounced psychologic disturbances are present. Night-eating syndrome consists of morning anorexia, evening hyperphagia, and insomnia, with eating in the middle of the night. At least 25 to 50% of daily intake occurs after the evening meal. About 10% of people seeking treatment for severe obesity may have this disorder. Rarely, a similar disorder is induced by use of a hypnotic such as zolpidem. Similar but less extreme patterns probably contribute to excess weight gain in more people. For example, eating after the evening meal contributes to excess weight gain in many people who do not have night-eating syndrome. Complications of Obesity Complications of obesity include the following: Metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.Diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Cardiovascular disorders Liver disorders (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes.Cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.Gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder. In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones.Gastroesophageal reflux Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, causing burning pain.Reproductive system disorders, including infertility Overview of Infertility is usually defined as the inability to conceive after 1 year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse.Many cancers (especially colon cancer Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is extremely common. Symptoms include blood in the stool and change in bowel habits. Screening using one of several methods is recommended for appropriate populations.Breast Cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation)Tendon and fascial disorders Skin disorders (eg, intertriginous infections Intertrigo is skin maceration in intertriginous areas caused by moisture and/or infection. Diagnosis is typically by clinical appearance.Social, economic, and psychologic problems Depression Diagnosis Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Insulin resistance Type 2 diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. These complications are more likely in patients with fat that is concentrated abdominally (visceral fat), a high serum triglyceride level, a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus or premature cardiovascular disease, or a combination of these risk factors. Breathing stops for moments, as often as hundreds of times a night. This disorder, often undiagnosed, can cause loud snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness and increases the risk of Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Obesity may cause the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome). Impaired breathing leads to hypercapnia, reduced sensitivity to carbon dioxide in stimulating respiration, hypoxia, cor pulmonale, and risk of premature death. This syndrome may occur alone or secondary to obstructive sleep apnea. Skin disorders are common; increased sweat and skin secretions, trapped in thick folds of skin, are conducive to fungal and bacterial growth, making intertriginous infections especially common. Being overweight probably predisposes to gout is a disorder caused by hyperuricemia (serum urate > 6.8 mg/dL [> 0Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis. Obesity leads to social, economic, and psychologic problems as a result of prejudice, discrimination, poor body image, and low self-esteem. For example, people may be underemployed or unemployed. Diagnosis of Obesity Body mass index (BMI) Waist circumference Sometimes body composition analysis In adults, BMI, defined as weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m2), is used to screen for overweight or obesity  ): Overweight = 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 Obesity = ≥ 30 kg/m2 However, BMI is a crude screening tool and has limitations in many subpopulations. Some experts think that BMI cutoffs should vary based on ethnicity, sex, and age. For example, in certain nonwhite populations, complications of obesity develop at a much lower BMI than in whites. In children and adolescents, overweight is defined as BMI at the ≥ 95th percentile, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's age- and sex-specific growth charts. Table Asians and many aboriginal populations have a lower cut-off (23 kg/m2) for overweight. In addition, BMI may be high in muscular athletes, who lack excess body fat, and may be normal or low in formerly overweight people who have lost muscle mass. Waist circumference and the presence of metabolic syndrome appear to predict risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications better than BMI does. The waist circumference that increases risk of complications due to obesity varies by ethnic group and sex. Body composition analysis Body composition—the percentage of body fat and muscle—is also considered when obesity is diagnosed. Although probably unnecessary in routine clinical practice, body composition analysis can be helpful if clinicians question whether elevated BMI is due to muscle or excessive fat. The percentage of body fat can be estimated by measuring skinfold thickness (usually over the triceps) or determining mid upper arm muscle area Physical examination . Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can estimate percentage of body fat simply and noninvasively. BIA estimates percentage of total body water directly; percentage of body fat is derived indirectly. BIA is most reliable in healthy people and in people with only a few chronic disorders that do not change the percentage of total body water (eg, moderate obesity, diabetes mellitus). Whether measuring BIA poses risks in people with implanted defibrillators is unclear. Underwater (hydrostatic) weighing is the most accurate method for measuring percentage of body fat. Costly and time-consuming, it is used more often in research than in clinical care. To be weighed accurately while submerged, people must fully exhale beforehand. Imaging procedures, including CT, MRI, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), can also estimate the percentage and distribution of body fat but are usually used only for research.Screening for diabetes mellitus Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes.Diagnosis Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. Obstructive sleep apnea is often underdiagnosed, and obesity increases the risk. Prognosis of Obesity Untreated, obesity tends to progress. The probability and severity of complications are proportional to The absolute amount of fat The distribution of the fat Absolute muscle mass After weight loss, most people return to their pretreatment weight within 5 years, and accordingly, obesity requires a lifelong management program similar to that for any other chronic disorder. Treatment of Obesity Dietary management Physical activity Behavioral interventions Drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat, lorcaserin [not available in US because of possible cancer risk], phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion extended-release, liraglutide, semaglutide) Bariatric surgery Weight loss of even 5 to 10% improves overall health, helps reduce risk of developing cardiovascular complications (eg, Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Type 2 diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes.Overview of Infertility is usually defined as the inability to conceive after 1 year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse.Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. Support from health care practitioners, peers, and family members and various structured programs can help with weight loss and weight maintenance. Diet Balanced eating is important for weight loss and maintenance. Strategies include Eating small meals and avoiding or carefully choosing snacks Substituting fresh fruits and vegetables and salads for refined carbohydrates and processed food Substituting water for soft drinks or juices Limiting alcohol consumption to moderate levels Including no- or low-fat dairy products, which are part of a healthy diet and help provide an adequate amount of vitamin D Low-calorie, high-fiber diets that modestly restrict calories (by 600 kcal/day) and that incorporate lean protein appear to have the best long-term outcome. Foods with a low glycemic index . Use of meal replacements can help with weight loss and maintenance; these products can be used regularly or intermittently. Diets that are overly restrictive are unlikely to be maintained or to result in long-term weight loss. Diets that limit caloric intake to < 50% of basal energy expenditure Energy expenditure Many undernourished patients need nutritional support, which aims to increase lean body mass.BEE), described as very low calorie diets, can have as few as 800 kcal/day. A very low calorie diet may be indicated for obese patients; however, such diets must be supervised by a physician, and after weight is lost, intake must be increased gradually to prevent patients from regaining weight. Physical activity Exercise increases energy expenditure, basal metabolic rate, and diet-induced thermogenesis. Exercise also seems to regulate appetite to more closely match caloric needs. Other benefits associated with physical activity include Increased insulin sensitivity Improved lipid profile Lower blood pressure Better aerobic fitness Improved psychologic well-being Decreased risk of breast and colon cancer Increased life expectancy Exercise, including strengthening (resistance) exercises, increases muscle mass. Because muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than does fat tissue, increasing muscle mass produces lasting increases in basal metabolic rate. Exercise that is interesting and enjoyable is more likely to be sustained. A combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is better than either alone. Guidelines suggest physical activity of 150 minutes/week for health benefits and 300 to 360 minutes/week for weight loss and maintenance. Developing a more physically active lifestyle can help with weight loss and maintenance. Behavioral interventions Clinicians can recommend various behavioral interventions to help patients lose weight. They include Support Self-monitoring Stress management Contingency management Problem solving Stimulus control Support may come from a group, a buddy, or family members. Participation in a support group can improve adherence to lifestyle changes and thus increase weight loss. The more frequently people attend group meetings, the greater the support, motivation, and supervision they receive and the greater their accountability, resulting in greater weight loss. Self-monitoring may include keeping a food log (including the number of calories in foods), weighing regularly, and observing and recording behavioral patterns. Other useful information to record includes time and location of food consumption, the presence or absence of other people, and mood. Clinicians can provide feedback about how patients may improve their eating habits. Stress management involves teaching patients to identify stressful situations and to develop strategies to manage stress that do not involve eating (eg, going for a walk, meditating, deep breathing). Contingency management involves providing tangible rewards for positive behaviors (eg, for increasing time spent walking or reducing consumption of certain foods). Rewards may be given by other people (eg, from members of a support group or a health care practitioner) or by the person (eg, purchase of new clothing or tickets to a concert). Verbal rewards (praise) may also be useful. Problem solving involves identifying and planning ahead for situations that increase the risk of unhealthy eating (eg, travelling, going out to dinner) or that reduce the opportunity for physical activity (eg, driving across country). Stimulus control involves identifying obstacles to healthy eating and an active lifestyle and developing strategies to overcome them. For example, people may avoid going by a fast food restaurant or not keep sweets in the house. For a more active lifestyle, they may take up an active hobby (eg, gardening), enroll in scheduled group activities (eg, exercise classes, sports teams), walk more, make a habit of taking the stairs instead of elevators, and park at the far end of parking lots (resulting in a longer walk). Internet resources, applications for mobile devices, and other technological devices may also help with adherence to lifestyle changes and weight loss. Applications can help patients set a weight-loss goal, monitor their progress, track food consumption, and record physical activity. Drugs (eg, orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, liraglutide, semaglutide, lorcaserin [not available in US]) may be used if BMI is ≥ 30 or if BMI is ≥ 27 in patients who have complications (eg, Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Type 2 diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. Usually, drug treatment results in modest (5 to 10%) weight loss. Orlistat inhibits intestinal lipase, decreasing fat absorption and improving blood glucose and lipids. Because orlistat is not absorbed, systemic effects are rare. Flatus, oily stools, and diarrhea are common but tend to resolve during the 2nd year of treatment. A dose of 120 mg orally 3 times a day should be taken with meals that include fat. A vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after taking orlistat. Malabsorption and cholestasis are contraindications; irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders may make orlistat difficult to tolerate. Orlistat is available over-the-counter. Phentermine is a centrally acting appetite suppressant for short-term use ( ≤ 3 months). Usual starting dose is 15 mg once/day, and dose may be increased to 30 mg once/day, 37.5 mg once/day, 15 mg twice a day, or 8 mg 3 times a day before meals. Common side effects include elevated blood pressure and heart rate, insomnia, anxiety, and constipation. Phentermine should not be used in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disorders, poorly controlled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or a history of drug abuse or addiction. Twice a day dosing may help control appetite better throughout the day. The combination of phentermine and topiramate (used to treat seizures and migraines) is approved for long-term use. This combination drug results in weight loss for up to 2 years. The starting dose of the extended-release form (phentermine 3.75 mg/topiramate 23 mg) should be increased to 7.5 mg/46 mg after 2 weeks; then the dose can be gradually increased to a maximum of 15 mg/92 mg if needed to maintain weight loss. Because birth defects are a risk, the combination should be given to women of reproductive age only if they are using contraception and are tested monthly for pregnancy. Other potential adverse effects include sleep problems, cognitive impairment, and increased heart rate. Long-term cardiovascular effects are unknown, and postmarketing studies are ongoing. Lorcaserin (not available in the US) suppresses appetite via selective agonism of serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) brain receptors. Unlike serotonergic drugs previously used for weight loss, lorcaserin selectively targets 5-HT2C receptors in the hypothalamus, which, when targeted, result in hypophagia; it does not to stimulate the 5-HT2B receptors on heart valves. In clinical studies, incidence of valvulopathy was not significantly increased in patients taking lorcaserin compared with those taking placebo. The usual and maximum dose of lorcaserin is 10 mg orally every 12 hours. The most common adverse effects in patients without diabetes are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, and constipation; these effects are usually self-limited. Lorcaserin should not be used with serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), because serotonin syndrome Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from increased central nervous system serotonergic activity that is usually drug related. Lorcaserin was withdrawn from the US market after an increased cancer risk was identified in a postmarketing trial. Naltrexone/bupropion extended-release tablets can be used as a weight-loss adjunct. Naltrexone (used to aid in alcohol cessation) is an opioid antagonist and is thought to block negative feedback on satiety pathways in the brain. Bupropion (used to treat depression and aid in smoking cessation) can induce hypophagia by adrenergic and dopaminergic activity in the hypothalamus. The starting dose is a single tablet of naltrexone 8 mg/bupropion 90 mg; dose is titrated over 4 weeks to the maximum dose of 2 tablets twice a day. The most common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 1 to 3 mm Hg. Contraindications to this drug include uncontrolled hypertension and a history of or risk factors for seizures because bupropion reduces the seizure threshold. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used initially in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide augments glucose-mediated insulin release from the pancreas to induce glycemic control; liraglutide also stimulates satiety and reduces food intake. Studies have shown that liraglutide 3 mg daily results in a 12.2% weight loss after 56 weeks. The initial dose is 0.6 mg injected subcutaneously once/day; the dose is increased 0.6 mg/week to the maximum dose of 3 mg once/day. Liraglutide must be given by injection. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting; liraglutide has warnings that include acute pancreatitis and risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide augments glucose-mediated insulin release and reduces appetite and energy intake via effects on appetite centers in the hypothalamus. Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously has resulted in a mean body weight loss of 14.9% at 68 weeks as compared to 2.4% in patients treated with placebo (1 Treatment reference Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. Patients on semaglutide also had greater improvements in cardiovascular risk factors as well as patient-reported physical functioning. Like liraglutide, the most common adverse effects of semaglutide include nausea and diarrhea, which are usually transient and mild to moderate in severity. Warnings for semaglutide include thyroid tumors and pancreatitis. The starting dose is 0.25 mg once a week for 4 weeks, increasing every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once a week by week 17. Weight-loss drugs should be stopped if patients do not have documented weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment. Most over-the-counter weight-loss drugs are not recommended because they have not been shown to be effective. Examples of such drugs are brindleberry, L-carnitine, chitosan, pectin, grapeseed extract, horse chestnut, chromium picolinate, fucus vesiculosus, and ginkgo biloba. Some (eg, caffeine, ephedrine, guarana, phenylpropanolamine) have adverse effects that outweigh their advantages. Also, some of these drugs are adulterated or contain harmful substances banned by the US Food and Drug Administration (eg, ephedra, bitter orange, sibutramine). Surgery Bariatric surgery Bariatric Surgery Bariatric surgery is the surgical alteration of the stomach, intestine, or both to cause weight loss. In the US, about 250,000 bariatric operations are done in each year. Special Populations Obesity is a particular concern in children and older adults. Children For obese children, complications are more likely to develop because they are obese longer. More than 25% of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Tobacco use is a major individual and public health problem. Dependence develops rapidly. After puberty, food intake increases; in boys, the extra calories are used to increase protein deposition, but in girls, fat storage is increased. For obese children, psychologic complications (eg, poor self-esteem, social difficulties, depression) and musculoskeletal complications can develop early. Some musculoskeletal complications, such as slipped capital femoral epiphyses Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is movement of the femoral neck upward and forward on the femoral epiphysis. Diagnosis is with x-rays of both hips; sometimes other imaging is needed. Other early complications may include obstructive sleep apnea Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Children Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is episodes of partial or complete closure of the upper airway that occur during sleep and lead to breathing cessation.Type 2 diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes. Risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, hepatic, and other obesity-related complications increases when these children become adults. Risk of obesity persisting into adulthood depends partly on when obesity first develops: During infancy: Low risk Between 6 months and 5 years: 25% After 6 years: > 50% During adolescence if a parent is obese: > 80% In children, preventing further weight gain, rather than losing weight, is a reasonable goal. Diet should be modified, and physical activity increased. Increasing general activities and play is more likely to be effective than a structured exercise program. Participating in physical activities during childhood may promote a lifelong physically active lifestyle. Limiting sedentary activities (eg, watching TV, using the computer or handheld devices) can also help. Drugs and surgery are avoided but, if complications of obesity are life threatening, may be warranted. Measures that control weight and prevent obesity in children may have the largest public health benefits. Such measures should be implemented in the family, schools, and primary care programs. Older adults In the US, the percentage of obese older people has been increasing. With age, body fat increases and is redistributed to the abdomen, and muscle mass is lost, largely because of physical inactivity, but decreased androgens and growth hormone (which are anabolic) and inflammatory cytokines produced in obesity may also play a role. Risk of complications depends on Body fat distribution (increasing with a predominantly abdominal distribution) Duration and severity of obesity Associated sarcopenia Increased waist circumference, suggesting abdominal fat distribution, predicts morbidity (eg, Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.BMI. With aging, fat tends to accumulate more in the waist. For older adults, physicians may recommend that caloric intake be reduced and physical activity be increased. However, if older patients wish to substantially reduce their caloric intake, their diet should be supervised by a physician. Physical activity also improves muscle strength, endurance, and overall well-being and reduces the risk of developing chronic disorders such as diabetes. Activity should include strengthening and endurance exercises. Regardless of whether caloric restriction is considered necessary, nutrition should be optimized. Weight-loss drugs are often not studied specifically in older adults, and possible benefits may not outweigh the adverse effects. However, orlistat may be useful for obese older patients, particularly those with diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Surgery can be considered in healthy older patients with good functional status. Prevention of Obesity Regular physical activity and healthy eating improve general fitness, can control weight, and help prevent diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. Even without weight loss, exercise decreases the risk of cardiovascular disorders. Dietary fiber decreases the risk of colon cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Sufficient and good-quality sleep, management of stress, and moderation of alcohol intake are also important. Key Points Obesity increases the risk of many common health problems and causes up to 300,000 premature deaths each year in the US, making it second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death. Excess caloric intake and too little physical activity contribute the most to obesity, but genetic susceptibility and various disorders (including eating disorders) may also contribute. Screen patients using BMI and waist circumference and, when body composition analysis is indicated, by measuring skinfold thickness or using bioelectrical impedance analysis.

It usually occurs in people who wear contact lenses. Amebic keratitis causes painful sores on the cornea, and vision is usually impaired. Doctors take a sample of tissue from the cornea to be examined and cultured. To help prevent this infection, people should keep their contact lens in a sterile solution and should not wear contact lenses while swimming, in hot tubs, or when taking a shower. Eye doctors remove infected and damaged cells if sores are superficial and treat the infection with biguanide-chlorhexidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide (used to disinfect contact lenses) eye drops plus either propamidine or hexamidine eye drops.  and benefits (for example, by getting nutrients) from the host at the host's expense. Free-living amebas are protozoa that live in soil or water and do not need to live in people or animals. Although they rarely cause human infection, certain types of these amebas can cause serious, life-threatening brain infections in addition to amebic keratitis. Amebic keratitis may be progressively destructive. Most (85%) infected people wear contact lenses. Infection is more likely if lenses are worn during swimming or if lens cleaning solution is unsterile. Some infections develop after the cornea is accidentally scratched. Symptoms of Amebic Keratitis Typically, a painful sore develops on the cornea. Symptoms of amebic keratitis include eye redness, excess tear production, sensation of a foreign body, and pain when the eyes are exposed to bright light. Vision is usually impaired. Diagnosis of Amebic Keratitis Examination and culture of a sample taken from the cornea To diagnose amebic keratitis, doctors take a sample of tissue from the cornea to be examined under a microscope and cultured. Prevention of Amebic Keratitis To help prevent amebic keratitis, people should clean and store their contact lenses following the recommendations of eye care providers and manufacturers. People who wear contact lenses should wash their hands thoroughly before handling contacts and should keep storage solution fresh, not reused, and not topped off. They should not use a homemade solution or tap water. Also, people should not wear contact lenses while swimming, in hot tubs, or when taking a shower. Treatment of Amebic Keratitis Antimicrobial drugs An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) should promptly start treatment of amebic keratitis. Early, superficial infection can be treated more easily. If sores are superficial, doctors use a cotton-tipped applicator to remove infected and damaged cells. Doctors treat amebic keratitis with the following antimicrobial drugs applied as eye drops for 6 months to a year: Chlorhexidine (a disinfectant) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (a disinfectant which is used in some cleaning products for contact lenses) with or without Propamidine or hexamidine These drugs are applied every hour or two when treatment is started. Treatment is intensive the first month, then gradually decreased as healing occurs. Treatment often lasts 6 to 12 months. If treatment is stopped too soon, the infection is likely to recur.

The cartilage pads (menisci), which act as shock absorbers in the knee, may also be injured. Knee sprains are often caused by bending or twisting the knee when the foot is planted on the ground. The knee is usually painful and swollen. The diagnosis is usually based on results of the physical examination. Resting and keeping the knee immobile are often the only treatment needed, but sometimes severe injuries must be repaired surgically.  Several ligaments help hold the knee in place: Collateral ligaments: These ligaments, located on either side of the knee prevent the knee from moving from side to side too much. The medial collateral ligament is located on the inside of the leg, and the lateral collateral ligament is located on the outside of the leg. Cruciate ligaments: These ligaments prevent the knee from moving forward or backward too much. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) crosses in front of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) to form an X. Cartilage pads (menisci) fill in the space between the thighbone (femur) and shinbone (tibia). They help stabilize and cushion the knee joint. Holding the Knee Together Two ligaments, one on either side of the knee, prevent the knee from moving from side to side too much: Medial collateral ligament, which is on the inside of the leg Lateral collateral ligament, which is on the outside of the leg Two ligaments inside the joint (cruciate ligaments) prevent the knee from moving forward or backward too much: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) The ACL crosses in front of the PCL, forming an X. The menisci are pads of cartilage that act as cushions between the thighbone (femur) and larger lower leg bone (tibia), which form part of the knee joint. The most commonly injured structures in the knee are The medial collateral ligament The anterior cruciate ligament Which structures are torn depends on the direction of the force against the knee: Medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments: One or both of these ligaments can be torn the knee is hit from the side while people have their weight on one foot that is firmly planted on the ground, as occurs during a football tackle. Damage is more likely if the knee also twists. Lateral collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments: These ligaments can be damaged when force against the knee is directed outward. This type of injury can occur when the leg is pushed from the inside. Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments: These ligaments can be damaged when the knee is forcefully straightened. Menisci: The menisci can be damaged when people have their weight on a foot and their knee twists as it is injured. Anterior Cruciate Ligament VIDEO Medial Meniscus Injury VIDEO Symptoms of Knee Sprains and Related Injuries Occasionally, people hear or feel a pop in the knee when the injury occurs. This pop usually indicates that a ligament (particularly the anterior cruciate ligament) is torn. The knee is painful, swollen, stiff, and sometimes bruised. Where the pain is depends on which structure is injured. The knee may feel unstable, as if it will buckle. Muscle spasms—unintended contraction of muscles around the knee—may occur. When the symptoms develop and how severe they are depend on the severity of the injury: Mild: Swelling develops over the first few hours but may take more than 24 hours. Pain is usually mild or moderate. Moderate: Pain is moderate or severe, particularly when people move or bend their knee. Severe: Pain may be severe, moderate, or mild, and some people cannot walk unaided. Sometimes a torn meniscus prevents the knee from bending (called locking). Sometimes the force that causes a knee sprain also causes bones to be broken and/or damages tendons in the knee (knee extensor injuries Knee Extensor Injuries Knee extensor injuries occur when people try to straighten (extend) their knee and an obstacle prevents them from doing so. Diagnosis of Knee Sprains and Related Injuries A doctor's evaluation X-rays to check for broken bones Sometimes magnetic resonance imaging Doctors suspect a knee sprain when people have typical symptoms (such as a swelling) and have had an injury that is likely to cause a sprain. Stress testing Doctors check for a torn ligament in the knee by moving the leg in certain ways (called stress testing). A thorough examination, including stress testing, usually enables doctors to identify knee injuries. However, stress testing is typically delayed because the knee is usually too painful to test when doctors first evaluate a person. Also, substantial swelling and muscle spasms may make evaluation of the knee difficult. Stress testing can be done a few days later, when the symptoms lessen. Imaging tests If the knee is very painful or swollen, doctors usually take an x-ray before stress testing to check for broken bones. Certain findings make broken bones more likely: Intense pain is felt in certain areas of the knee joint. People cannot bend their knee. People cannot put any weight on the injured leg because of the pain. The person is over 55. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually not done at first. It may be done if A severe injury is suspected. Symptoms do not resolve after several weeks of protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE). Treatment of Knee Sprains and Related Injuries Sometimes drainage of fluid Protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation A splint or knee immobilizer and crutches Sometimes surgery If a large amount of fluid has built up in the knee, doctors sometimes drain the fluid to help relieve the pain and muscle spasms. Most mild or moderate injuries can be treated initially with protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE Sprains are tears in ligaments (tissues that connect one bone to another). Range-of-motion exercises are started early. If the sprain is severe, some people need to wear a knee immobilizer for 6 weeks or longer. Some severe injuries of ligaments or menisci require surgical repair by an orthopedic surgeon. Surgical repair is usually done through a small incision and a small flexible tube—a procedure called arthroscopic surgery Through a Keyhole . Exercises to strengthen the knee Treatment Factors such as weak thigh muscles, excessive pronation, and tight leg muscles and tendons can cause pain in the front part of the knee.

Depending on the infecting species, abdominal symptoms (Angiostrongylus costaricensis) or neural involvement with eosinophilic meningitis (A. cantonensis) result. Diagnosis is suspected by history and presence of eosinophilia in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or blood. Anthelmintics are either ineffective or deleterious.  Angiostrongylus are parasites of rats (rat lung worms). Excreted larvae are taken up by intermediate hosts (land snails and slugs) and paratenic or transport hosts (hosts that are not required for the parasite's development but that can transmit infection to humans). Human infection is acquired by ingestion of raw or undercooked snails or slugs or transport hosts (certain land crabs, freshwater shrimp and prawns, frogs, or toads); it is unclear whether larval contamination of vegetables (eg, in slime from snails or slugs that crawl on the food) can cause infection. A. cantonensis infection (neural angiostrongyliasis) occurs predominantly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin, although infection has been reported elsewhere, including the Caribbean, Hawaii, and parts of the southern United States. The larvae migrate from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the meninges, where they cause eosinophilic meningitis, with fever, headache, and meningismus, accompanied by eosinophilia is defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count > 500/mc.L (> 0.5 × 109/L). Occasionally, ocular invasion occurs. costaricensis infection (abdominal angiostrongyliasis) occurs in the Americas, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Adult worms reside in arterioles of the ileocecal area, and eggs can be released into the intestinal tissues, resulting in local inflammation with abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever; this infection can mimic appendicitis. Abdominal angiostrongyliasis is often accompanied by eosinophilia is defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count > 500/mc.L (> 0.5 × 109/L). Diagnosis of Angiostrongyliasis If meningitis signs are present, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and complete blood count (A. cantonensis) Sometimes identification of eggs and larvae in tissue obtained during abdominal surgery (A. costaricensis) Angiostrongyliasis is suspected based on a history of ingesting potentially contaminated material, including land snails, slugs, or transfer hosts such as certain land crabs, frogs, toads, or freshwater prawns or shrimp.CSF pressure, protein, and white cells with eosinophils > 10%. Complete blood count shows eosinophilia is defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count > 500/mc.L (> 0.5 × 109/L)A. cantonensis parasites are rarely visible. Focal lesions are not usually seen in CT of the brain. cantonensis larvae and eggs are not present in stool. Diagnosis of gastrointestinal infection due to A. costaricensis is difficult because larvae and eggs are not present in stool; however, if surgery is done (eg, for suspected appendicitis), eggs and larvae can be identified in tissues removed during surgery. A high percentage of eosinophils (>10%) may be present in blood. Immunoassays are not widely available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. cantonensis in CSF; molecular tests for A. costaricensis are available only in research laboratories. Treatment of Angiostrongyliasis For meningitis, analgesics, corticosteroids, and removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A. cantonensis meningitis is treated with analgesics, removal of CSF at frequent intervals to reduce central nervous system (CNS) pressure; corticosteroids can decrease the frequency of therapeutic lumbar puncture. Anthelmintic therapy may increase the inflammatory response because it results in the release of parasite antigens. Most patients have a self-limited course and recover completely. There is no specific treatment for A. costaricensis infection; most infections resolve spontaneously. Anthelmintics do not appear to be effective and may lead to additional migration of worms and worsening symptoms. Prevention of Angiostrongyliasis People who live in or travel to areas with A. cantonensis should avoid eating raw or undercooked snails, slugs, freshwater shrimp, land crabs, frogs, centipedes, and lizards, as well as potentially contaminated vegetables and vegetable juices. People who live in or travel to areas with A. costaricensis should avoid eating raw or undercooked slugs and potentially contaminated vegetables or juices. Key Points Humans acquire Angiostrongylus when they consume raw or undercooked snails or slugs or the organisms' transport hosts (certain land crabs, frogs, toads, or freshwater prawns or shrimp). cantonensis larvae migrate from the gastrointestinal tract to the meninges, where they cause eosinophilic meningitis; A. costaricensis eggs can be released into the intestinal tissues, causing abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Eggs are not present in the stool of patients with angiostrongyliasis. Treat A. cantonensis neural infection with meningitis with analgesics, corticosteroids, and, if intracranial pressure is elevated, removal of cerebrospinal fluid at frequent intervals.

It can be asymptomatic or cause urethritis, vaginitis, or occasionally cystitis, epididymitis, or prostatitis. Diagnosis is by direct microscopic examination, dipstick tests, or nucleic acid amplification tests of vaginal secretions or by urine or urethral culture. Patients and sex partners are treated with metronidazole or tinidazole Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated, sexually transmitted protozoan that more often infects women than men; in the US in 2013–2016, among individuals ages 14 to 59 years, prevalence was 2.1% among women and 0.5% among men (1 Reference Trichomoniasis is infection of the vagina or male genital tract with Trichomonas vaginalis. Infection may be asymptomatic in either sex. In men, the organism may persist for long periods in the genitourinary tract without causing symptoms and may be transmitted to sex partners. Trichomoniasis may account for up to 5% of nongonococcal, nonchlamydial urethritis in men in some areas. Coinfection with gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.STIs) is common. Symptoms and Signs of Trichomoniasis In women, symptoms of trichomoniasis range from none to copious, yellow-green, frothy vaginal discharge with a fishy odor, and soreness of the vulva and perineum, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Asymptomatic infection may become symptomatic at any time as the vulva and perineum become inflamed and edema develops in the labia. The vaginal walls and surface of the cervix may have punctate, red “strawberry” spots. Urethritis and possibly cystitis may also occur. Men are usually asymptomatic; however, sometimes urethritis results in a discharge that may be transient, frothy, or purulent or that causes dysuria and frequency, usually early in the morning. Often, urethritis is mild and causes only minimal urethral irritation and occasional moisture at the urethral meatus, under the foreskin, or both. Epididymitis and prostatitis are rare complications. Diagnosis of Trichomoniasis Vaginal testing with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), wet-mount microscopic examination, rapid-antigen dipstick tests, or sometimes culture or cervical cytology Culture of urine or urethral swabs from men Trichomoniasis should be suspected in women with vaginitis, in men with urethritis, and in their sex partners. Suspicion is high if symptoms persist after patients have been evaluated and treated for other infections such as gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Chlamydia and Mycoplasmal Mucosal Infections Sexually transmitted urethritis, cervicitis, proctitis, and pharyngitis (that are not due to gonorrhea) are caused predominantly by chlamydiae and less frequently by mycoplasmas. In women, one of the following diagnostic tests of vaginal secretions may be done: NAAT Vaginal pH and wet mount microscopy Immunochromatographic flow dipstick test NAATs are more sensitive than microscopic examination or culture for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in women. Immunochromatographic flow dipstick tests are also available for point of care testing in women. Cervical cytology (Pap test) is not used to test for trichomoniasis, but infection is sometimes detected incidentally. Microscopic examination enables clinicians to evaluate for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow. Vaginal secretions are obtained from the posterior fornix. The pH is measured. Secretions are then placed on 2 slides; they are diluted with 10% potassium hydroxide on one slide (KOH wet mount) and with 0.9% sodium chloride on the other (saline wet mount). For the whiff test, the KOH wet mount is checked for a fishy odor, which results from amines produced in bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow. The saline wet mount is examined microscopically as soon as possible to detect trichomonads, which can become immotile and more difficult to recognize within minutes after slide preparation. (Trichomonads are pear-shaped with flagella, often motile, and average 7 to 10 micrometers—about the size of white blood cells—but occasionally reach 25 micrometers.) If trichomoniasis is present, numerous neutrophils are also present. Trichomoniasis is also commonly diagnosed by seeing the organism when a Papanicolaou (Pap) test is done. Culture of urine or urethral swabs is the only validated test for detecting T. vaginalis in men. In men, microscopy of urine is insensitive, and NAATs are not currently cleared by the FDA but could be available if local laboratories have done internal validation studies. As with diagnosis of any STI, patients with trichomoniasis should be tested to exclude other common STIs such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Treatment of Trichomoniasis Oral metronidazole or tinidazole Treatment of sex partners Women with trichomoniasis should receive metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. Men should receive metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. An alternative treatment for women and men is tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. If infection persists in women and reinfection by sex partners has been excluded, women should be retreated with metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 7 days or tinidazole 2 g orally once a day for 7 days. Metronidazole may cause leukopenia, disulfiram-like reactions to alcohol, or candidal superinfections. It is relatively contraindicated during early pregnancy, although it may not be dangerous to the fetus after the 1st trimester. Tinidazole has not been established as safe during pregnancy and so is not used. Sex partners should be seen and treated for trichomoniasis with the same regimens based on sex and should be screened for other STIs. If poor adherence to follow-up by sex partners is likely, treatment can be initiated in sex partners of patients with documented trichomoniasis without confirming the diagnosis in the partner. Key Points Trichomoniasis can be asymptomatic, particularly in men, or cause vaginitis or sometimes urethritis.

People may feel short of breath or faint, or they may have fever or weight loss or develop heart failure or abnormal heart rhythms. Doctors use imaging studies to confirm a heart tumor. Surgery is not helpful, but chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy may be useful. Only a few cancers develop in the heart  or noncancerous (benign). Those that develop in the heart are called primary heart tumors. The most common primary cancerous heart tumors are sarcomas that develop from connective tissue. Most cancerous heart tumors originate in some other part of the body—usually the lungs, breasts, kidneys, blood, or skin—and then spread (metastasize) to the heart. Metastatic heart tumors are 30 to 40 times more common than primary heart tumors but are still uncommon. Cancers in the chest, such as lung or breast cancer, may spread to the heart by direct invasion, often into the sac that surrounds the heart (pericardium). Cancers may also spread to heart muscle and chambers through the bloodstream or through the lymph system Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system. Symptoms of Cancerous Heart Tumors The symptoms of cancerous heart tumors are essentially the same as those of noncancerous heart tumors Symptoms A tumor is any type of abnormal growth, whether cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). However, the symptoms of cancerous tumors tend to worsen more quickly than those of noncancerous tumors because cancerous tumors grow much faster. Symptoms of a metastatic heart tumor occur along with symptoms caused by the original tumor and by any metastases elsewhere in the body. For example, people who have lung cancer that has metastasized to the heart may have trouble breathing, fatigue, and coughing up of blood. Primary cancerous heart tumors themselves may spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Metastases may be to the spine (causing pain), nearby tissues, or organs such as the lungs (causing trouble breathing and coughing up of blood) and brain (causing abnormal nervous system function). Diagnosis of Cancerous Heart Tumors Imaging studies The procedures used to diagnose cancerous heart tumors are the same as those used for noncancerous heart tumors Diagnosis A tumor is any type of abnormal growth, whether cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).

Findings include tachypnea, rales and rhonchi, and cyanosis or desaturation. Diagnosis is suspected when there is respiratory distress after delivery through meconium-containing amniotic fluid and is confirmed by chest x-ray. Infants with respiratory distress are often intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Treatment of severely affected infants with surfactant decreases the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but does not affect mortality (1 Treatment references Intrapartum meconium aspiration can cause inflammatory pneumonitis and mechanical bronchial obstruction, causing a syndrome of respiratory distress.Treatment references Intrapartum meconium aspiration can cause inflammatory pneumonitis and mechanical bronchial obstruction, causing a syndrome of respiratory distress. Prognosis depends on the underlying physiologic stressors.  Extensive physiologic changes Perinatal Physiology The transition from life in utero to life outside the womb involves multiple changes in physiology and function. Also see Perinatal Problems. For that reason, a person with neonatal resuscitation Neonatal Resuscitation Extensive physiologic changes accompany the birth process, sometimes unmasking conditions that posed no problem during intrauterine life. Gestational age Gestational Age Gestational age and growth parameters help identify the risk of neonatal pathology. Gestational age is the primary determinant of organ maturity.Growth Parameters in Neonates Growth parameters and gestational age help identify the risk of neonatal pathology. Growth is influenced by genetic and nutritional factors as well as intrauterine conditions. Etiology Physiologic stress at the time of labor and delivery (eg, due to hypoxia and/or acidosis caused by umbilical cord compression or placental insufficiency or caused by infection) may cause the fetus to pass meconium into the amniotic fluid before delivery. Meconium passage also may be normal before birth, particularly in term or postterm infants; meconium passage is noted in about 10 to 15% of births. However, it is never normal for meconium to be noted at the delivery of a premature infant. During delivery, perhaps 5% of neonates with meconium passage aspirate the meconium, triggering lung injury and respiratory distress, termed meconium aspiration syndrome.PPH) caused by the prenatal and postnatal acidosis and/or hypoxia is equally or even more compromising. Pathophysiology The mechanisms by which aspiration induces the clinical syndrome probably include Nonspecific cytokine release Airway obstruction Decreased surfactant production and surfactant inactivation Chemical pneumonitis Underlying physiologic stressors also may contribute. If complete bronchial obstruction occurs, atelectasis results; partial blockage leads to air trapping on expiration, resulting in hyperexpansion of the lungs and possibly pulmonary air leak Pulmonary Air-Leak Syndromes Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. Pneumomediastinum Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. Pneumothorax Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. . The risk of air leak is further increased because of the decreased lung compliance caused by decreased surfactant production and inactivated surfactant. PPH can be associated with meconium aspiration as a comorbid condition or because of continuing hypoxia. Neonates also may aspirate vernix caseosa, amniotic fluid, or blood of maternal or fetal origin during delivery, all of which can cause respiratory distress and signs of aspiration pneumonia on chest x-ray. Symptoms and Signs of meconium aspiration syndrome include tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, cyanosis or desaturation, rales, rhonchi, and greenish yellow staining of the umbilical cord, nail beds, or skin. Meconium staining may be visible in the oropharynx and (on intubation) in the larynx and trachea. Neonates with air trapping may have a barrel-shaped chest and also symptoms and signs of pneumothorax Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. Diagnosis Meconium passage Respiratory distress Characteristic x-ray findings Diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome is suspected when a neonate shows respiratory distress in the setting of meconium-containing amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is confirmed by chest x-ray showing hyperinflation with variable areas of atelectasis and flattening of the diaphragm. Initial x-ray findings can be confused with the findings of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn Transient tachypnea of the newborn is transient respiratory distress caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid.TTN is the significant hypoxemia present with the concomitant PPH. Fluid may be seen in the lung fissures or pleural spaces, and air may be seen in the soft tissues or mediastinum. Because meconium may enhance bacterial growth and meconium aspiration syndrome is difficult to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia, cultures of blood also should be taken. Prognosis is generally good, although it varies with the underlying physiologic stressors; overall mortality is increased. Infants with meconium aspiration syndrome may be at greater risk of asthma in later life. Treatment Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation as needed Supplemental oxygen as needed to keep PaO2 high to relax pulmonary vasculature in cases with PPH Surfactant IV antibiotics Inhaled nitric oxide in severe cases of PPH Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if unresponsive to above therapies Routine deep suctioning (ie, intubating to suction below the cords) of neonates delivered with meconium-stained fluid has not been shown to improve outcome. However, if the neonate's breathing appears obstructed, suctioning is done with an endotracheal tube attached to a meconium aspirator. Because positive pressure ventilation enhances risk of a pulmonary air-leak syndrome, regular evaluation (including physical examination and chest x-ray) is important to detect this complication, which should be sought immediately in any intubated neonate whose blood pressure, perfusion, or oxygen saturation suddenly worsens. See Pulmonary Air-Leak Syndromes Pulmonary Air-Leak Syndromes Pulmonary air-leak syndromes involve dissection of air out of the normal pulmonary airspaces. Treatment references Intrapartum meconium aspiration can cause inflammatory pneumonitis and mechanical bronchial obstruction, causing a syndrome of respiratory distress.Treatment references Intrapartum meconium aspiration can cause inflammatory pneumonitis and mechanical bronchial obstruction, causing a syndrome of respiratory distress. Antibiotics (usually ampicillin and an aminoglycoside—such as used for standard treatment of serious bacterial illness in an ill neonate) are sometimes given. However, studies have shown that use of antibiotics in infants with meconium aspiration does not significantly reduce mortality, incidence of sepsis, length of hospital stay, or duration of need for respiratory support (2 Treatment references Intrapartum meconium aspiration can cause inflammatory pneumonitis and mechanical bronchial obstruction, causing a syndrome of respiratory distress.ECMO. Key Points About 5% of neonates with meconium passage aspirate the meconium, triggering lung injury and respiratory distress or have prenatal and postnatal physiology that predisposes them to persistent pulmonary hypertension, which can complicate meconium aspiration syndrome. Neonates may have tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, cyanosis or desaturation, rales, rhonchi, and visible meconium staining in the oropharynx. Suspect the diagnosis when respiratory distress occurs in neonates who had meconium-containing amniotic fluid. Do chest x-ray and cultures of blood to exclude pneumonia and bacterial sepsis.

The primary causes of acute aortic regurgitation are Dissection of the ascending aorta Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel)Infective endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.The primary causes of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults are Degeneration of the aortic valve and root (with or without a bicuspid valve) Infective endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.Thoracic aortic aneurysm Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms A thoracic aortic diameter ≥ 50% larger than normal is considered an aneurysm (normal diameter varies by location)Trauma The most common cause of chronic aortic regurgitation in children is Ventricular septal defect Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an opening in the interventricular septum, causing a shunt between ventricles.Reactive Arthritis Reactive arthritis is an acute spondyloarthropathy that often seems precipitated by an infection, usually genitourinary or gastrointestinal.Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy and chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis of the skin or nails.Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women.Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory and ulcerative disease arising in the colonic mucosa, characterized most often by bloody diarrhea.Takayasu arteritis Takayasu Arteritis Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the aorta, its branches, and pulmonary arteries. It occurs predominantly in young women. Etiology is unknown.Valsalva, acromegaly Gigantism and Acromegaly Gigantism and acromegaly are syndromes of excessive secretion of growth hormone (hypersomatotropism) that are nearly always due to a pituitary adenoma.Giant Cell Arteritis Giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteries.Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are hereditary collagen disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, dermal hyperelasticity, and widespread tissue fragility. Diagnosis is clinical. Pathophysiology of Aortic Regurgitation In aortic regurgitation, volume overload of the left ventricle (LV) occurs because the LV receives blood regurgitated from the aorta during diastole in addition to blood from the left atrium. In acute aortic regurgitation, the LV does not have time to dilate to accommodate the increased volume, which then causes a rapid increase in left ventricular pressure and subsequently pulmonary edema Pulmonary Edema Pulmonary edema is acute, severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous hypertension and alveolar flooding. In chronic aortic regurgitation, LV hypertrophy and dilation can gradually occur, so normal left ventricular pressures and cardiac output are maintained.LV impairment, and heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.HF). Symptoms and Signs of Aortic Regurgitation Acute aortic regurgitation causes symptoms of heart failure Symptoms and Signs Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Symptoms and Signs Shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. Chronic aortic regurgitation is typically asymptomatic for years; progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations develop insidiously. Symptoms of heart failure correlate poorly with objective measures of left ventricular function. Chest pain (angina pectoris) affects only about 5% of patients who do not have coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) and, when it occurs, is especially common at night. Patients may present with endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. Signs vary by severity and acuity. Signs in acute aortic regurgitation reflect heart failure and cardiogenic shock and typically include tachycardia, cool extremities, lung crackles, and low blood pressure (BP). The 1st heart sound (S1) is usually absent (because aortic and LV diastolic pressures equalize), and a 3rd heart sound (S3) is common. An AR murmur may be absent even if AR is severe, although an Austin Flint murmur is common. As chronic disease progresses, systolic blood pressure increases while diastolic blood pressure decreases, creating a widened pulse pressure. With time, the LV impulse may become enlarged, increased in amplitude, and displaced downward and laterally, with systolic depression of the entire left parasternal area, giving a rocking motion to the left chest. A systolic apical or carotid thrill may become palpable in later stages of AR; it is caused by large forward stroke volumes and low aortic diastolic pressure. Auscultatory findings include a normal S1 and a nonsplit, loud, sharp or slapping 2nd heart sound (S2) caused by increased elastic aortic recoil. The murmur of AR is often unimpressive. The murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S2 (A2); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. The murmur is heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient is leaning forward, with breath held at end-expiration. It increases in volume in response to maneuvers that increase afterload (eg, squatting, isometric handgrip). If AR is slight, the murmur may occur only in early diastole. If LV diastolic pressure is very high, the murmur is short because aortic and LV diastolic pressures equalize earlier in diastole. Other abnormal sounds include a forward ejection and backward regurgitant flow (to-and-fro) murmur, an ejection click soon after the S1, and an aortic ejection flow murmur. A diastolic murmur heard near the axilla or mid left thorax (Cole-Cecil murmur) is caused by fusion of the aortic murmur with the S3, which is due to simultaneous filling of LV from the left atrium and AR. A mid-to-late diastolic rumble heard at the apex (Austin Flint murmur) may result from rapid regurgitant flow into the LV, causing mitral valve leaflet vibration at the peak of atrial flow; this murmur mimics the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis. Other signs are unusual; sensitivity and specificity are low or unknown. Visible signs include head bobbing (de Musset sign) and pulsation of the fingernail capillaries (Quincke sign, best seen while applying slight pressure) or uvula (Müller sign). Palpable signs include a large-volume pulse with rapid rise and fall (slapping, water-hammer, or collapsing pulse) and pulsation of the carotid arteries (Corrigan sign), retinal arteries (Becker sign), liver (Rosenbach sign), or spleen (Gerhard sign). BP findings may include popliteal systolic pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg higher than brachial pressure (Hill sign) and a fall in diastolic BP of > 15 mm Hg with arm elevation (Mayne sign). Auscultatory signs include a sharp sound heard over the femoral pulse (pistol-shot sound, or Traube sign) and a femoral systolic bruit distal and a diastolic bruit proximal to arterial compression (Duroziez sign). Diagnosis of Aortic Regurgitation Echocardiography Diagnosis of aortic regurgitation is suspected based on history and physical examination findings and confirmed by echocardiography This photo shows a patient having echocardiography. This image shows all 4 cardiac chambers and the tricupsid and mitral valves. Doppler echocardiography is the test of choice to detect and quantify the magnitude of regurgitant blood flow and grade overall severity of the AR. Two-dimensional echocardiography can quantify aortic root size and anatomy and LV function. Severe chronic aortic regurgitation is suggested by any of the following: Color Doppler jet width ≥ 65% of the LV outflow tract diameter Holodiastolic flow reversal in the abdominal aorta (specific for severe AR) Regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL/beat Regurgitation fraction ≥ 50% Vena contracta > 6 mm (the narrowest diameter of the fluid stream downstream of the abnormal valve orifice) echocardiography This photo shows a patient having echocardiography. This image shows all 4 cardiac chambers and the tricupsid and mitral valves.Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation. It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathic.LV failure, detect vegetations or pericardial effusions (eg, in aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel). Coarctation is associated with bicuspid valve Bicuspid Aortic Valve Bicuspid aortic valve is the presence of only two (rather than the normal three) valve cusps. Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality. Transesophageal echocardiography provides additional delineation of aortic dilatation and valve anatomy, which is especially useful when surgical repair is being considered. If the aorta is enlarged, gated CT or MRI is recommended to evaluate the entire thoracic aorta. MRI also can help assess LV function and degree of AR when echocardiographic images are suboptimal. ECG and chest x-ray should be done.QRS voltage criteria of LV hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and T-wave inversion with ST-segment depression in precordial leads. Chest x-ray may show cardiomegaly and a prominent aortic root in patients with chronic progressive AR. If AR is severe, signs of pulmonary edema and HF may also be present. Exercise testing may help assess functional capacity and symptoms in patients with documented AR and equivocal symptoms. Coronary angiography should be done before surgery, even if no angina is present because about 20% of patients with severe AR have significant coronary artery disease, which may need concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery. First-degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid valve should be screened using echocardiography because 20 to 30% will be similarly affected. Prognosis for Aortic Regurgitation With treatment, the 10-year survival for patients with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation is 80 to 95%. With appropriately timed valve replacement (ie, before heart failure and using accepted criteria for intervention Criteria for intervention Aortic regurgitation (AR) is incompetency of the aortic valve causing backflow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole.AR is good. However, the prognosis for those with severe AR and heart failure is considerably poorer. Treatment of Aortic Regurgitation Aortic valve replacement or repair Sometimes vasodilators, diuretics, and nitrates When aortic root dilatation is part of the mechanism of aortic regurgitation, angiotensin-receptor blockers may slow progression of root dilation, making them favored drugs for patients with concomitant hypertension. These drugs do not reduce the severity of aortic regurgitation or alter disease progression. Intervention is either surgical aortic valve replacement or (less commonly) valve repair. Percutaneous options are being developed (1 Treatment reference Aortic regurgitation (AR) is incompetency of the aortic valve causing backflow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. An aortic bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months postoperatively, but a mechanical valve requires lifetime anticoagulation using warfarin. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are ineffective and should not be used . Patients who are not candidates for surgery benefit from treatment of heart failure Treatment Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be used with caution because they block compensatory tachycardia and worsen AR by prolonging diastole. Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion is contraindicated because the diastolic balloon inflation worsens AR. Patients with severe AR who do not meet the criteria for intervention should be reevaluated by physical examination and echocardiography every 6 to 12 months. Antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is no longer recommended for aortic regurgitation except for patients who have had valve replacement . Criteria for intervention is indicated when AR is severe and is causing symptoms AR is severe and is causing LV dysfunction (EF ≤ 55%, LV end-systolic dimension > 50 mm, or indexed to body surface area > 25 mm/m2) AR is severe and at least 3 serial studies show a progressive decline in EF to 55 to 60%, or progressive increase in LV end-diastolic dimension to > 65 mm Patients with an enlarged ascending aorta frequently have AR as well as an increased risk of aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel). A high risk of aortic dissection may be the first indication for cardiac surgery, which should be undertaken when Ascending aortic diameter is> 55 mm Bicuspid valve is present with ascending aortic diameter 50 to 55 mm and aortic growth rate > 5 mm/year, aortic coarctation, or a family history of aortic dissection Marfan syndrome is present with ascending aortic diameter > 50 mm (or less if the aortic growth rate is > 5 mm/year) or a family history of aortic dissection at < 50 mm diameter When cardiac surgery is being done for other reasons, concomitant aortic surgery is indicated if the ascending aortic diameter is ≥ 45 mm Transcatheter aortic valve implantation Choice of intervention (TAVI) is challenging because of the dilated aortic annulus and lack of sufficient leaflet calcification, leading to prosthetic valve migration and/or paravalvular leak. Key Points The primary causes of acute aortic regurgitation (AR) are infective endocarditis and dissection of the ascending aorta; chronic AR in adults is most often caused by degeneration of the aortic valve or root. Acute AR causes symptoms of heart failure and cardiogenic shock, but signs of AR may be absent. Chronic AR is typically asymptomatic for years followed by progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Typical heart sounds with chronic AR include a normal 1st heart sound (S1) followed by a sharp or slapping 2nd heart sound (S2) and a blowing, high-pitched, decrescendo diastolic murmur. Acute AR requires prompt aortic valve replacement or repair. Chronic AR requires aortic valve replacement or repair when symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction develops; patients who meet criteria but are not candidates for surgery benefit from treatment of heart failure. AR is sometimes accompanied by a dilated ascending aorta. Indications for surgery on the ascending aorta may occur before surgery is indicated for AR.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Although the methods people use to hurt themselves, such as cutting their wrists with a razor blade, sometimes overlap with those of suicide attempts Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Suicidal behavior includes completed suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidal ideation. Often, people specifically state that they are not trying to kill themselves. In other cases, doctors presume people are not actually trying to die when they repeatedly do something that clearly cannot cause death—for example, burning themselves with cigarettes. However, the first time people hurt themselves, it may not be clear whether they actually intended to die. For example, people may think that they could kill themselves by taking an overdose of antibiotics or vitamins, take such dose, and then realize that such a dose is harmless. Even when self-injury does not cause death, people who injure themselves are probably more likely over the long term to attempt or commit suicide. Thus, doctors and family members should not lightly dismiss nonsuicidal self-injury. The most common examples of nonsuicidal self-injury include Cutting or stabbing the skin with a sharp object, such as a knife, razor blade, or needle Burning the skin, typically with a cigarette Nonsuicidal self-injury tends to start during early adolescence. Nonsuicidal self-injury is only slightly more common among girls than boys, whereas suicidal behavior Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Most people stop hurting themselves when they get older. People often injure themselves repeatedly in a single session, creating several cuts or burns in the same location. Usually, people choose an area that is at once accessible and easily hidden by clothing, such as the forearms or front of the thighs. Typically, people also hurt themselves repeatedly, resulting in extensive scars from previous episodes. People are often preoccupied with thoughts about the injurious acts. Why people injure themselves is unclear, but self-injury may be A way to reduce tension or negative feelings A way to resolve interpersonal difficulties Self-punishment for perceived faults A plea for help Some people do not think their self-injury is a problem and thus tend not to seek or accept counseling. Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation First, doctors examine the person to determine whether any of the person's injuries require treatment. To diagnose nonsuicidal self-injury, doctors must determine whether the act was intended to cause death (suicidal behavior) or not (nonsuicidal self-injury). To do so, doctors evaluate the person's intent, reasons, and mood. People who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury may state that they harm themselves to obtain relief from negative feelings rather than to kill themselves. Or they may repeatedly use methods unlikely to result in death. However, people who engage in self-injury can and do attempt suicide. So doctors talk to other people who are close to the person about changes in the person's mood and stresses in the person's life so that they can evaluate the person's risk of suicide. If people do not think their self-injury is a problem, they may be reluctant to talk about it. Thus, to evaluate people who have injured themselves, doctors first try to help these people talk about their self-injury. To do so, doctors communicate the following: That they have heard the person and take the person's experiences seriously That they understand how the person feels and how those feelings could result in self-injury Doctors then try to determine the following: How people injure themselves and how many different ways they do it (for example, do they burn and cut themselves?) How often they injure themselves How long they have been injuring themselves What purpose injuring themselves serves How willing they are to participate in treatment Doctors also check for other mental disorders and try to estimate how likely people are to attempt suicide. Treatment Certain types of psychotherapy Treatment of any other disorders present Certain types of psychotherapy may help people who injure themselves. They include Dialectical behavior therapy Emotion regulation group therapy Dialectical behavior therapy provides weekly individual and group sessions for 1 year and a therapist who is available 24 hours a day by telephone. The therapist acts as a behavior coach. The aim is to help people find more appropriate ways of responding to stress—for example, to resist urges to behave self-destructively. Emotion-regulation group therapy involves 14 weeks of group therapy. It helps people become aware of, understand, and accept their emotions. This therapy helps people be willing to accept negative emotions as part of life and thus not to respond to such emotions so intensely and impulsively. No drugs have been approved for the treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury. However, naltrexone and certain atypical antipsychotics have been effective in some people. If people have other mental disorders (such as depression, Depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. If possible, people should be referred to a mental health care practitioner.

Their main significance (other than cosmetic) is their resemblance to melanoma. Pigmented lesions are assessed for characteristics of concern (new or changing appearance, irregular borders, multiple colors within one lesion, bleeding, ulceration, or itching) that could suggest atypical nevi or melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. Almost everyone has a few moles, which usually appear in childhood or adolescence. There are different types of moles . During adolescence, more moles often appear, and existing ones may enlarge or darken. Nevus cells may be eventually replaced with fat or fibrous tissue. Moles typically change consistency, becoming softer and boggy, or firmer, and less pigmented over the decades. An individual mole is unlikely to become malignant (lifetime risk is about 1 in 3,000 to 10,000); however, patients with large numbers of benign moles (> about 50) have an increased risk of developing melanoma. These patients should be taught to self-monitor for warning signs and have skin surveillance as part of their primary care .  Blue nevi are benign moles that appear as bluish gray macules or thin papules. The depth and density of pigment in the skin account for the apparent blue color. Images of Moles Mole Moles are flesh- to brown-colored macules, papules, or nodules composed of nests of melanocytes or nevus cells. Moles develop on nearly everybody, and are significant primarily because they can become dysplastic or malignant and need to be differentiated from melanoma. Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD.

Derm.Pics/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Blue Nevus This photo shows a blue nevus composed of dark pigmented cells (melanocytes). Derm.Pics/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Diagnosis of Moles Clinical evaluation Sometimes biopsy Because moles are extremely common and melanomas are uncommon, prophylactic removal is not justifiable. However, biopsy and histologic evaluation should be considered if moles have certain characteristics of concern (known as the ABCDEs of melanoma): A: Asymmetry—asymmetric appearance B: Borders—irregular borders (ie, not round or oval) C: Color—color variation within the mole, unusual colors, or a color significantly different or darker than the patient's other moles D: Diameter—> 6 mm E: Evolution—a new mole in a patient > 30 years of age or a changing mole If a mole becomes painful or itchy or bleeds or ulcerates, biopsy can also be considered. The biopsy specimen must be deep enough for accurate microscopic diagnosis and should contain the entire lesion if possible, especially if the concern for cancer is strong. However, wide primary excision should not be the initial procedure, even for highly abnormal-appearing lesions. Many such lesions are not melanomas and, even with melanoma, the proper treatment margin and recommendation for lymph node sampling is determined based on histopathologic features. Excisional biopsy does not increase the likelihood of metastasis if the lesion is malignant, and it avoids extensive surgery for a benign lesion. Treatment of Moles Sometimes excision Moles can be removed by shaving or excision for cosmetic purposes, and all moles removed should be examined histologically. If hair growth is a concern for the patient, a hairy mole should be adequately excised rather than removed by shaving. Otherwise, hair will regrow. Key Points Almost everyone has moles, but people with > about 50 are at increased risk of melanoma. Consider biopsy if moles have ABCDE characteristics: Asymmetry; irregular Borders; high-risk Colors (variations within or between moles or unusual colors); Diameter > 6 mm; Evolution (new moles after age 30 or changes in existing moles).

A postpartum infection is usually diagnosed after 24 hours have passed since delivery and the woman has had a temperature of 100.4° F or higher on two occasions at least 6 hours apart.

{"seq_id": "6122a58c-87ee-4b28-97d9-66190c7b1d77", "title": null, "text": "【0】Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. Blood clots may form in veins if the vein is injured, a disorder causes the blood to clot, or something slows the return of blood to the heart. Blood clots may cause the leg or arm to swell. Doppler ultrasonography and blood tests are used to detect deep vein thrombosis. Anticoagulants are given to prevent clot enlargement and prevent pulmonary embolism. There are two main types of veins, superficial and deep. Superficial veins are located in the fatty layer under the skin. Deep veins are located in the muscles and along the bones.  Arteries carry blood with oxygen and nutrients away from the heart to the rest of the body. Blood clots (thrombi) can occur in the deep veins, called deep vein thrombosis, or in the superficial veins called superficial venous thrombosis Superficial Venous Thrombosis Superficial venous thrombosis is inflammation and clotting in a superficial vein, usually in the arms or legs. The skin over the vein becomes red, swollen, and painful. The superficial veins are usually also inflamed but without clotting (thrombosis), the combination of clotting and inflammation is referred to as superficial thrombophlebitis Superficial Venous Thrombosis Superficial venous thrombosis is inflammation and clotting in a superficial vein, usually in the arms or legs. Because almost any clot (thrombus) can break loose and become an embolism, doctors sometimes refer to deep vein thrombosis as \"thromboembolic disease.\" Deep vein thrombosis occurs most often in the legs or pelvis but may also occasionally develop in the arms. Blood Vessels VIDEO Causes of Deep Vein Thrombosis Three main factors can contribute to deep vein thrombosis: Injury to the vein’s lining An increased tendency for blood to clot Slowing of blood flow Injury to the vein Veins may be damaged during surgery or during an injury to an arm or leg, by the injection of irritating substances, by inflammation, or by certain disorders, such as thromboangiitis obliterans Thromboangiitis Obliterans Thromboangiitis obliterans is inflammation and subsequent blockage of small and medium-sized arteries of the legs or arms. Thromboangiitis obliterans commonly develops in smokers. They may also be injured by a clot, making formation of a second clot more likely. Increased blood clotting tendency Some disorders, such as cancer and certain inherited disorders of blood clotting Overview of Blood Clotting Disorders Blood clotting (coagulation) disorders are dysfunctions in the body's ability to control the formation of blood clots. Some drugs, including oral contraceptives, estrogen therapy, or drugs that act like estrogen (such as tamoxifen and raloxifene), can cause blood to clot more readily. Smoking is also a risk factor. Sometimes blood clots more readily after childbirth or surgery. Among older people, dehydration commonly causes the blood to clot more readily and can therefore contribute to deep vein thrombosis. Slowing of blood flow During prolonged bed rest and other occasions when the legs are not moving normally (such as after a leg injury or a stroke), blood flow slows because the person is lying down and the calf muscles are not contracting and squeezing the blood toward the heart. For example, deep vein thrombosis may develop in people who have had a heart attack Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. Deep vein thrombosis can develop after major surgery, particularly pelvic, hip, or knee surgery. Thrombosis can even occur in healthy people who sit for long periods, for example, during long drives or airplane flights, but thrombosis is extremely uncommon in this circumstance and usually occurs in people with other risk factors.  Although uncommon, thrombosis can occur in healthy people who sit for long periods, such as during long drives or flights. A clot that breaks loose is called an embolus. The embolus can travel through the bloodstream, through the heart, and into the lungs, where it lodges in a blood vessel in the lung, blocking blood flow to a portion of the lung. The small blood clots that occur in superficial venous thrombosis usually do not become emboli. Thus, only thrombi in the deep veins are potentially dangerous. Blood clots in the legs or pelvis are more likely to become emboli than blood clots in the arms, perhaps because the squeezing action of the calf muscles can dislodge a blood clot in a deep vein. The consequences of pulmonary embolism depend on the size and number of emboli: A small embolus may block a small artery in the lungs, causing the death of a small piece of lung tissue (called pulmonary infarction). A large pulmonary embolus can block all or nearly all of the blood traveling from the right side of the heart to the lungs, leading to low blood pressure, low oxygen levels, and quickly causing death. Massive emboli are not common, but no one can predict which case of deep vein thrombosis, if untreated, will lead to a massive embolus. Multiple emboli may occur. Multiple emboli typically go to different parts of the lungs. Sometimes, people have an abnormal opening, called a patent foramen ovale Normal Fetal Circulation About one in 100 babies is born with a heart defect. Some are severe, but many are not. If this opening is present, an embolus can pass into the arterial circulation and block an artery in another part of the body, such as the brain where it will cause a stroke Ischemic Stroke An ischemic stroke is death of an area of brain tissue (cerebral infarction) resulting from an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the brain due to blockage of an artery. Chronic venous insufficiency Some blood clots heal by being converted to scar tissue, which may damage the valves in the veins. The damaged valves prevent the veins from functioning normally, a disorder called chronic venous insufficiency Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Postphlebitic Syndrome Chronic venous insufficiency is damage to leg veins that prevents blood from flowing normally. In this disorder, fluid accumulates (a condition called edema) and the ankle and sometimes lower leg swells. The skin can become scaly, itchy, and reddish brown. Ischemia (lack of blood flow) Rarely, a very large blood clot in a leg causes so much swelling that it blocks the blood flow through the leg. The leg becomes pale or blue and extremely painful. Gangrene can develop if the blood flow is not restored. Symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis About half of the people with deep vein thrombosis have no symptoms at all. In these people, chest pain or shortness of breath caused by pulmonary embolism may be the first indication that a blood clot is present. In other people, if a deep leg vein is involved, the calf swells and may be painful, tender to the touch, and warm. The ankle, foot, or thigh may also swell, depending on which veins are involved. Similarly, if an arm vein is involved, the arm may swell. Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Doppler ultrasonography Blood tests to measure D-dimer Deep vein thrombosis may be difficult for doctors to detect, especially when pain and swelling are absent or very slight. When this disorder is suspected, Doppler ultrasonography Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures is often used to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes doctors do a blood test to measure a substance called D-dimer that is released from blood clots. If the level of D-dimer in the blood is not increased, the person probably does not have a deep vein thrombosis. If the person has symptoms of pulmonary embolism, computed tomography (CT) angiography Chest Imaging or rarely, nuclear lung scanning Chest Imaging using a radioactive marker, is done to detect pulmonary embolism, and Doppler ultrasonography is done to check the legs for clots. These procedures are done except when a person collapses due to very low blood pressure or very low oxygen levels. Collapse suggests massive pulmonary embolism and requires immediate treatment. Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis Although the risk of deep vein thrombosis cannot be entirely eliminated, it can be reduced in several ways: Prevention of immobility Anticoagulant drugs Intermittent pneumatic compression devices Preventive measures are selected depending on the person's risk factors and individual characteristics. People at low risk of deep vein thrombosis, such as those who must be temporarily inactive for long periods, as during an airplane flight, and those who are undergoing minor surgery but have no other risk factors for deep vein thrombosis, can take simple measures. Such people should elevate their legs, flex and extend their ankles about 10 times every 30 minutes, and walk and stretch every 2 hours while awake during long flights. People at higher risk of deep vein thrombosis require additional preventive treatment. Such people include People undergoing minor surgery who have specific risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (for example, cancer or excessive blood clotting) People without risk factors undergoing major surgery (especially orthopedic surgery) People who are hospitalized with a serious illness (for example a heart attack or serious injury) Such higher risk people should keep their legs elevated and begin moving around and walking as soon as possible. Additionally, an anticoagulant drug Anticoagulant drugs Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. These drugs help prevent deep vein thrombosis by reducing the blood's ability to clot but have a slight risk of causing excessive bleeding. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) uses a pump to repeatedly inflate and deflate hollow plastic leggings. The leggings squeeze the calves and empty the veins to prevent clots. The leggings may be used in combination with anticoagulant drugs Anticoagulant drugs Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. In people having surgery associated with a high risk of bleeding, the leggings are put on before surgery and kept on during and after surgery, until the person can walk again. Continuously wearing high-compression elastic stockings (support hose) makes the veins narrow slightly and the blood flow more rapidly. As a result, clotting may be less likely. However, elastic stockings are not sufficient protection against developing deep vein thrombosis. Also, they may give a false sense of security and discourage more effective methods of prevention. If not worn correctly, they may bunch up and aggravate the problem by blocking blood flow in the legs. Hospitalization may be necessary at first, but because of the advances in treatment, most people with deep vein thrombosis can be treated at home. Bed rest is unnecessary except to help relieve symptoms. People may be as active as they want. Physical activity does not increase the risk that a blood clot will break loose and cause a pulmonary embolism. Treatment usually consists of Anticoagulant drugs (most common) Clot-dissolving drugs Rarely, a clot-blocking filter (umbrella)  People with deep vein thrombosis may be as active as they want. Physical activity does not increase the risk that a blood clot will break loose and cause pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulant drugs Anticoagulant drugs are blood thinners. They decrease the blood’s ability to clot, so they can prevent new clots from forming and can stop existing clots from getting bigger. They do not break up or dissolve clots that have already formed. All people with deep venous thrombosis are given anticoagulant drugs. Doctors usually use low-molecular-weight heparin (such as enoxaparin, dalteparin, or tinzaparin) or fondaparinux given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously), accompanied by warfarin taken by mouth. The injectable drug works immediately, but warfarin takes several days to be fully effective. Once the warfarin has taken effect, people stop taking the injectable drug. For some people (those with cancer or those with recurrent clotting problems despite treatment with anticoagulants by mouth), doctors only use the injectable drug and do not start warfarin. How long people continue drug treatment (with warfarin or an injectable drug) varies according to the degree of risk. People whose deep vein thrombosis resulted from a specific, temporary cause (such as surgery or a drug they have stopped taking) usually continue drug treatment for 3 to 6 months. When a specific cause is not found, people usually take warfarin for at least 6 months. Warfarin should be continued indefinitely if the cause is not temporary (for example, a blood clotting disorder) or if people have had two or more episodes of deep vein thrombosis. Use of warfarin increases the risk of bleeding, both internally and externally. To minimize the risk, people taking warfarin must have periodic blood tests to see how much their blood is anticoagulated. Doctors then use the blood test result to adjust the dose of warfarin. The blood tests are usually done once or twice a week for 1 or 2 months, and then every 4 to 6 weeks thereafter. Some drugs and foods increase its breakdown, making a warfarin dose less effective and increasing the risk of another blood clot. Other drugs and foods slowwarfarin's breakdown, making a dose more effective but also more likely to cause bleeding. Some people are also more sensitive to warfarin and may need warfarin-sensitivity testing to help doctors adjust their levels. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are an alternative to warfarin. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran are DOACs. These drugs have a faster anticoagulant effect than warfarin and are as effective as warfarin for the treatment of blood clots. The effect of DOACs on people's blood is more predictable than the effect of warfarin. Therefore, unlike people taking warfarin, people taking DOACs do not need to have frequent blood tests to adjust the dose. Also, DOACs tend to cause fewer episodes of serious bleeding than warfarin. However, bleeding caused by DOACs can be harder to stop because antidotes for these drugs are not as widely available as antidotes for warfarin. Excessive bleeding, which may be life-threatening, is the most common complication of anticoagulant drugs. Risk factors for excessive bleeding include being age 65 or older or having A recent heart attack Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. For people who are taking heparin, doctors can give protamine to partially reverse the effects. For people taking some of the DOACs, doctors can give andexanet alfa or prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the effects of the DOACs and stop the bleeding. Clot-blocking filter Very rarely, as an alternative to anticoagulant drugs Anticoagulant drugs Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that returns blood to the heart from the lower part of the body. The filter can trap emboli, preventing them from reaching the lungs. However, unlike anticoagulant drugs Anticoagulant drugs Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. Filters are usually reserved for people in whom anticoagulant therapy is not possible or not effective. Inferior Vena Cava Filters: One Way to Prevent Pulmonary Embolism In people who have deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot may break loose from an affected vein in the leg and travel through the bloodstream. The embolus travels toward the heart and passes through the right atrium and ventricle and into one of the pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to the lungs. The clot may lodge in an artery in a lung and block blood flow, resulting in pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism may be life threatening, depending on how large the embolus is and the size of the blocked artery. To prevent pulmonary embolism, doctors usually use drugs that limit blood clotting. However, for some people, doctors may recommend that a filter (formerly called an umbrella) be temporarily or permanently placed in the inferior vena cava. The filter typically is recommended when drugs that limit clotting (anticoagulants, or blood thinners) cannot be used, for example, when a person is also having bleeding. The filter can trap emboli before they reach the heart but allow blood to flow through freely. Emboli that are trapped sometimes dissolve on their own. However, filters do not completely eliminate the risk of emboli. Sometimes other veins from the legs enlarge, allowing blood and emboli to bypass the filter. Also, filters can break loose or become blocked by a clot. Filters are much less effective at preventing pulmonary embolism than treatment with anticoagulants. Clot-dissolving drugs Doctors only occasionally use intravenous drugs, such as alteplase, to dissolve venous blood clots. These drugs (also called thrombolytic, fibrinolytic, or clot-busting drugs) may be given to a person with extensive blood clots if the blood clot has been present for less than 48 hours and the person does not have risk factors for excessive bleeding. After 48 hours, scar tissue begins to develop in the blood clot, making it less likely to dissolve. Clot-dissolving drugs have a higher risk of bleeding complications. Doctors sometimes use clot-dissolving drugs in combination with mechanical removal methods in people who have large clots in their upper leg. In such cases, doctors may put a small, flexible tube (catheter) into the blocked vein, remove as much clot as possible with an instrument, and administer the clot-dissolving drug through the catheter. If pulmonary embolism is life threatening, clot-dissolving drugs are given or surgery is done to remove the embolus. The veins never completely recover after deep vein thrombosis develops. Elastic compression stockings worn below the knee may be helpful if chronic venous insufficiency Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Postphlebitic Syndrome Chronic venous insufficiency is damage to leg veins that prevents blood from flowing normally. If painful skin ulcers (venous stasis ulcers Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Postphlebitic Syndrome Chronic venous insufficiency is damage to leg veins that prevents blood from flowing normally. When these bandages are applied carefully once or twice a week, the ulcer almost always heals because blood flow in the veins improves. The ulcers can become are infected, and pus and a foul-smelling discharge can appear on the bandage each time it is changed. The pus and discharge can be washed off the skin with soap and water. Skin creams, balms, and skin medications of any kind have little effect. Once blood flow in the veins has improved, the ulcer heals by itself. After it has healed, wearing an elastic stocking daily can prevent a recurrence. The stocking must be replaced as soon as it becomes too loose. If possible, the person should purchase seven stockings or pairs of stockings (if both legs are involved)—one for each day of the week so that stockings remain effective considerably longer. Rarely, ulcers that do not heal require skin grafting. After grafting, an elastic stocking must be worn to prevent ulcers from returning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Bone tumors may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Aneurysmal bone cysts Aneurysmal bone cysts usually develop before people reach age 25, and the cause is not known. These cysts are made up of multiple blood-filled sacs that are packed together. These cysts usually occur near the inside edges of the long bones (upper arm and thigh bones), but almost any bone may be affected. The cysts tend to grow slowly. Pain and swelling are common. The cyst may be present for a few weeks to a year before diagnosis. To diagnose aneurysmal bone cysts, doctors do x-rays X-rays A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination. Doctors also remove a tissue sample for examination under a microscope (biopsy Diagnosis ). Surgical removal of the entire cyst is the most successful treatment, but sometimes the cysts return, particularly if they are not removed completely. An aneurysmal bone cyst can also be injected with doxycycline (an antibiotic), albumin, and air that forms an injectable foam. More than one or two injections may be needed. Other formulations that contain alcohol have also been used. Radiation should be avoided when possible because cancerous tumors occasionally develop later. However, radiation Therapy for Cancer Radiation is a form of intense energy generated by a radioactive substance, such as cobalt, or by specialized equipment, such as an atomic particle (linear) accelerator. Unicameral bone cysts (simple bone cysts) Unicameral bone cysts occur near the growth plates in the arms or legs in children. Growth plates are what enable children to grow. The cysts often cause nearby bones to thin, which can lead to a break (fracture). Cysts that are less than 2 inches (about 5 centimeters) long or wide may heal and may disappear as the fracture heals. Cysts that are more than 2 inches long or wide, particularly in children, may require treatment. However, a better predictor of the risk of fracture is a cyst size greater than 85% of the diameter of the bone or a bony shell less than 0.5 millimeters. To diagnose unicameral bone cysts, doctors do x-rays X-rays A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination. Most of the time, x-rays are enough to make the diagnosis, but sometimes other imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination. These cysts are often treated with injections of corticosteroids (often repeatedly), with processed bone putty, or with synthetic bone substitutes. Sometimes treatment is surgery to remove the contents of the cyst from the bone by scraping it with a scoop-shaped instrument (curettage) and transplantation of bone from one site to another (bone grafting) or use of processed bone from another person (allograft).

An extra chromosome, making three of a kind (instead of the normal two), is called trisomy ( Home.see also page Overview of Chromosome and Gene Disorders Overview of Chromosome and Gene Disorders Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain a person's genes. Children who have trisomy 18 have a third chromosome 18. Trisomy 18 occurs in about 1 out of 6,000 live births. However, many affected fetuses spontaneously miscarry Miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The extra chromosome almost always comes from the mother. Mothers who are over age 35 are at increased risk of having a child with trisomy 18. There are more girls than boys with trisomy 18. Symptoms of Trisomy 18 In the womb, affected fetuses are not typically very active, and there is often excess amniotic fluid and a small placenta. Physical abnormalities At birth, newborns are often very small because their muscles and body fat are underdeveloped. Newborns are typically limp and have a weak cry. The mouth and jaw may be small, which gives the newborn's face a pinched appearance. Other visible deformities are common, including a small head, low-set and malformed ears, a narrow pelvis, and a short breastbone (sternum). Physical abnormalities may be obvious at birth. However, some newborns have abnormalities that are not as severe. Common Types of Clubfoot The hands are clenched in fists, and the index fingers often overlap the middle and ring fingers. The fingernails are underdeveloped. Skinfolds, especially over the back of the neck, are common. The big toes are shortened and frequently bend upward.

Infection leads to progressive immunologic deterioration and opportunistic infections and cancers. The end stage is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Diagnosis is by viral antibodies in children > 18 months and virologic nucleic acid amplification tests (such as polymerase chain reaction testing) in children < 18 months. Treatment is with combinations of antiretroviral drugs The general natural history and pathophysiology of pediatric HIV infection is similar to that in adults; however, the method of infection, clinical presentations, and treatments often differ. HIV-infected children also have unique social integration issues Integration of HIV-Infected Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). Overview of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) VIDEO Epidemiology of HIV Infection in Infants and Children In the US, HIV probably occurred in children almost as early as in adults but was not clinically recognized for several years. Thus far, about 10,000 cases have been reported in children and young adolescents, representing only 1% of total cases. In 2018, < 100 new cases were diagnosed in children < 13 years of age (1 Epidemiology reference Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). More than 95% of HIV-infected US children acquired the infection from their mother, either before or around the time of birth (vertical transmission). Most of the remainder (including children with hemophilia or other coagulation disorders) received contaminated blood or blood products. A few cases were the result of sexual abuse. Vertical transmission has declined significantly in the US from about 25% in 1991 (resulting in > 1600 infected children annually) to ≤ 1% in 2018 (resulting in only about 100 infected children annually). Vertical transmission has been reduced by using comprehensive serologic screening and treating of infected pregnant women during both pregnancy and delivery and by providing short-term antiretroviral prophylaxis to exposed newborns. However, the total number of HIV-infected US adolescents and young adults (13 to 24 years of age) continues to increase despite the marked success in decreasing perinatal HIV infection. This paradoxical increase is a result of both greater survival among perinatally infected children and new cases of HIV infection acquired via sexual transmission among other adolescents and young adults (in particular, among young men who have sex with men). Reducing transmission of HIV among young men who have sex with men continues to be an important focus of domestic HIV control efforts as is continuing the reduction of vertical transmission. Worldwide, about 1.7 million children have HIV infection (4% of the total caseload worldwide). Each year, about 160,000 more children are infected (9% of all new infections), and about 100,000 children die. Although these numbers represent a daunting amount of illness, new programs created to deliver antiretroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant women and children have reduced the annual number of new childhood infections and childhood deaths by 33 to 50% in the past few years (1 Epidemiology reference Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). However, infected children still do not receive ART nearly as often as adults, and interrupting vertical transmission Prevention of perinatal transmission Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2)HIV-infected children remain the two most important goals of global pediatric HIV medicine. Transmission of HIV The infection risk for an infant born to an HIV-positive mother who did not receive ART during pregnancy is estimated at 25% (range 13 to 39%). Risk factors for vertical transmission include Seroconversion during pregnancy or breastfeeding (major risk) High plasma viral RNA concentrations (major risk) Advanced maternal disease Low maternal peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts Prolonged rupture of membranes is no longer thought to be an important risk factor. Cesarean delivery before onset of active labor reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). However, it is clear that MTCT is reduced most significantly by giving combination ART, usually including zidovudine (ZDV), to the mother and neonate . ZDV monotherapy reduces MTCT from 25% to about 8%, and current combination ART reduces it to ≤ 1%. HIV has been detected in both the cellular and cell-free fractions of human breast milk. The incidence of transmission by breastfeeding is about 6/100 breastfed children/year. Estimates of the overall risk of transmission through breastfeeding are 12 to 14%, reflecting varying durations of breastfeeding. Transmission by breastfeeding is greatest in mothers with high plasma viral RNA concentrations (eg, women who become infected during pregnancy or during the period of breastfeeding).

Classification of HIV Infection in Infants and Children HIV infection causes a broad spectrum of disease, of which AIDS is the most severe. Past classification schemes established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined the progression of clinical and immunologic decline. These clinical and immunologic categories are becoming less relevant in the era of combination ART. When ART is taken as prescribed, it almost invariably decreases symptoms and increases CD4+ T-cell counts. The categories are most useful for clinical research and for describing the severity of illness at the time of diagnosis in children < 13 years. For adolescents ≥ 13 years and adults, newer classification systems now simply use CD4+ T-cell count as the major component of staging unless AIDS-defining conditions (eg, opportunistic infections) are present . Clinical categories in children < 13 years  are defined by presence or absence of certain common opportunistic infections or cancers. These categories are N = Not symptomatic A = Mildly symptomatic B = Moderately symptomatic C = Severely symptomatic Immunologic categories (HIV infection stages) in children < 13 years  for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage Immunologic Categories (HIV Infection Stages) for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage ) reflect the degree of immune suppression based on the CD4+ T-cell count (absolute count and as percentage of total lymphocyte count): 1 = No evidence of immune suppression 2 = Moderate suppression 3 = Severe suppression Thus, a child classified in stage B3 would have moderately advanced clinical symptoms and severe immunocompromise. Clinical and immunologic categories form a unidirectional hierarchy; once classified at a certain level, children cannot be reclassified at a less severe level, regardless of clinical or immunologic improvement. Table Symptoms and Signs of HIV Infection in Infants and Children Natural history in untreated children Infants infected perinatally usually are asymptomatic during the first few months of life, even if no combination ART is begun. Although the median age at symptom onset is about 3 years, some children remain asymptomatic for > 5 years and, with appropriate ART, are expected to survive to adulthood. In the pre-ART era, about 10 to 15% of children had rapid disease progression, with symptoms occurring in the first year of life and death occurring by 18 to 36 months; these children were thought to have acquired HIV infection earlier in utero. However, most children probably acquire infection at or near birth and have slower disease progression (surviving beyond 5 years even before ART was used routinely). The most common manifestations of HIV infection in children not receiving ART include generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, central nervous system (CNS) disease (including developmental delay, which can be progressive), lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, recurrent bacteremia, opportunistic infections, recurrent diarrhea, parotitis, cardiomyopathy, hepatitis, nephropathy, and cancers. Complications of HIV in children When complications occur, they typically involve opportunistic infections (and rarely cancer). Combination ART has made such infections uncommon, and they now occur mainly in undiagnosed children who have not yet received ART or in children who are not adherent to ART. Pneumocystis pneumonia can occur as early as age 4 to 6 weeks but occurs mostly in infants aged 3 to 6 months who acquired infection before or at birth. Infants and older children with Pneumocystis pneumonia characteristically develop a subacute, diffuse pneumonitis with dyspnea at rest, tachypnea, oxygen desaturation, nonproductive cough, and fever (in contrast to non–HIV-infected immunocompromised children and adults, in whom onset is often more acute and fulminant). Other opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed children include Candida esophagitis Candida esophagitis Esophageal infection occurs mainly in patients with impaired host defenses. Primary agents include Candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV, human herpesvirus type 5) can cause infections that have a wide range of severity. A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common.Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection is usually transmitted during delivery. A typical sign is vesicular eruption, which may be accompanied by or progress to disseminated disease.Chickenpox is an acute, systemic, usually childhood infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus type 3)Mycobacterium tuberculosis Perinatal Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis can be acquired during the perinatal period. Symptoms and signs are nonspecific. Diagnosis is by culture and sometimes x-ray and biopsy.M. avium complex infections, chronic enteritis caused by Cryptosporidium Cryptosporidiosis is infection with the protozoan Cryptosporidium. The primary symptom is watery diarrhea, often with other signs of gastrointestinal distress.CNS cryptococcal or Toxoplasma gondii infection Toxoplasmosis is infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Cancers in immunocompromised children with HIV infection are relatively uncommon, but leiomyosarcomas and certain lymphomas, including CNS lymphomas and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (Burkitt type), occur much more often than in immunocompetent children. Kaposi sarcoma is very rare in HIV-infected children receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) Combination ART has significantly changed the clinical manifestations of pediatric HIV infection. Although bacterial pneumonia and other bacterial infections (eg, bacteremia, recurrent otitis media) still occur more often in HIV-infected children, opportunistic infections and growth failure are much less frequent than in the pre-ART era. New problems, such as alterations in serum lipids, hyperglycemia, fat maldistribution (lipodystrophy and lipoatrophy), nephropathy, and osteonecrosis, are reported; however, the incidence is lower in children than in HIV-infected adults. Although combination ART clearly improves neurodevelopmental outcome, there seems to be an increased rate of behavioral, developmental, and cognitive problems in treated HIV-infected children. It is unclear whether these problems are caused by HIV infection itself, therapeutic drugs, or other biopsychosocial factors among HIV-infected children. It is unknown whether any additional effects of HIV infection or ART during critical periods of growth and development will manifest later in life. However, no such effects have been noted in perinatally infected children who were treated with ART and are now young adults. To detect such adverse effects, providers will need to monitor HIV-infected children over time. Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants and Children Serum antibody tests Virologic nucleic acid tests (NATs; includes HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction or HIV RNA assays) HIV-specific tests In children > 18 months, the diagnosis of HIV infection is made using a serum 4th-generation HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay followed by a 2nd-generation HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation assay and, if required, an HIV-1 qualitative RNA assay. This diagnostic testing algorithm has supplanted the previous sequential testing by serum immunoassay and Western blot confirmation. Only very rarely does an older HIV-infected child lack HIV antibody because of significant hypogammaglobulinemia. Children < 18 months retain maternal antibody, causing false-positive results even with the 4th-generation HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, so diagnosis must be made by HIV virologic assays such as qualitative RNA assays (eg, transcription-mediated amplification of RNA) or DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (known collectively as NATs), which can diagnose about 30 to 50% of cases at birth and nearly 100% of cases by 4 to 6 months of age. HIV viral culture has acceptable sensitivity and specificity but has been replaced by NATs because it is technically more demanding and hazardous. The quantitative HIV RNA assay (ie, the HIV plasma viral load assay used for monitoring efficacy of treatment) is a type of NAT, that is becoming more widely used for diagnostic testing of infants. Quantitative RNA assays are as sensitive as DNA PCR in infants not given ART, are less expensive, and are more widely available than are the other NATs. However, care must be taken when using RNA assays for infant diagnosis because test specificity is uncertain at very low RNA concentrations (< 5000 copies/mL) and sensitivity is unknown in infants of mothers with complete treatment-mediated viral suppression at the time of delivery. Rapid immunoassay tests for HIV antibody may be done as point-of-care tests on oral secretions, whole blood, or serum and provide results in minutes to hours. In the US, these tests are most useful in labor and delivery suites to test women of unknown HIV serostatus, thus allowing counseling, commencement of ART to prevent MTCT, and testing of the infant to be arranged during the birth visit. Similar advantages accrue in other episodic care settings (eg, emergency departments, adolescent medicine clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics) and in the developing world. However, rapid assays typically require confirmatory tests, such as a second antigen/antibody assay, an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation assay, or a NAT. These confirmatory tests are especially important because in areas where the expected HIV prevalence is low, even a specific rapid assay yields mostly false-positive results (low positive predictive value by Bayes theorem Bayes Theorem Test results may help make a diagnosis in symptomatic patients (diagnostic testing) or identify occult disease in asymptomatic patients (screening). The higher the pre-test probability of HIV (ie, seroprevalence), the higher the positive predictive value of the test. As more laboratories are able to do same-day testing using 4th-generation HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassays, there will be less need for the comparatively less sensitive and less specific rapid immunoassays. Before HIV testing of a child is done, the mother or primary caregiver (and the child, if old enough) should be counseled about the possible psychosocial risks and benefits of testing. Oral (or written) consent should be obtained and recorded in the patient’s chart, consistent with state, local, and hospital laws and regulations. Counseling and consent requirements should not deter testing if it is medically indicated; refusal of a patient or guardian to give consent does not relieve physicians of their professional and legal responsibilities, and sometimes authorization for testing must be obtained by other means (eg, court order). Test results should be discussed in person with the family, the primary caregiver, and, if old enough, the child. If the child is HIV-positive, appropriate counseling and subsequent follow-up care must be provided. In all cases, maintaining confidentiality is essential. Children and adolescents meeting the criteria for HIV infection or AIDS must be reported to the appropriate public health department. (For questions regarding neonatal diagnosis, clinicians can call the Perinatal HIV Consultation and Referral Services Hotline: 1-888-HIV-8765 [1-888-448-8765].) HIV testing schedules for perinatal exposure  Available at AIDSinfo.) Testing schedules vary depending on whether an infant perinatally exposed to HIV by a mother living with HIV infection is considered at low or higher risk of transmission; higher-risk infants are tested more frequently. Low risk of perinatal HIV transmission is defined by the following: The mother received antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy. The mother had good virologic control as shown by plasma HIV viral RNA of < 50 copies/mL near delivery. There were no concerns about the mother's adherence to ART. Testing of infants at low risk is recommended at ages: 14 to 21 days 1 to 2 months (at least 2 weeks after cessation of ARV prophylaxis Prevention Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2)Higher risk of perinatal HIV transmission is defined as a mother living with HIV infection who has one or more of the following factors: Did not receive prenatal care Did not receive ART during pregnancy Did not receive antepartum or intrapartum antiretroviral drugs Received only intrapartum drugs Initiated ART late in pregnancy (during the late 2nd or 3rd trimester) Diagnosed with acute HIV infection during pregnancy Had an unknown or a detectable (≥ 50 copies/mL) HIV plasma viral load near delivery (particularly when delivery was vaginal) Has acute or primary HIV infection during pregnancy or breastfeeding (in which case breastfeeding should be stopped) Testing of infants at higher risk is recommended at ages: Birth 14 to 21 days 1 to 2 months 2 to 3 months (2 to 6 weeks after cessation of ARV prophylaxis Prevention Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2)A positive test should be confirmed immediately using the same or another virologic test; two positive tests confirm HIV infection. If the serial HIV virologic tests are negative at ≥ 2 weeks and at ≥ 4 weeks and in the absence of any AIDS-defining illness, the infant is considered presumptively uninfected (ie, with > 95% accuracy). If HIV virologic tests are also negative at ≥ 4 weeks and at ≥ 4 months, and again in the absence of any AIDS-defining illness, the infant is considered definitively uninfected (ie, with about 100% accuracy). Nevertheless, many experts continue to recommend follow-up antibody tests (1 antigen/antibody combination assay at > 18 months or, alternatively, 2 such assays done between 6 months and 18 months) to definitively exclude HIV infection and confirm seroreversion (loss of passively acquired HIV antibodies). If an infant < 18 months with a positive antibody test but negative virologic tests develops an AIDS-defining illness (category C— see Table: Clinical Categories for Children Aged < 13 Years With HIV Infection Clinical Categories for Children Aged < 13 Years With HIV Infection ), HIV infection is diagnosed. Other tests Once infection is diagnosed, other tests are done: CD4+ T-cell count CD8+ T-cell count Plasma viral RNA concentration Infected children require measurement of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts and plasma viral RNA concentration (viral load) to help determine their degree of illness, prognosis, and the effects of therapy. CD4+ counts may be normal (eg, above the age-specific cutoffs of category 1 in table Immunologic Categories (HIV Infection Stages) for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage Immunologic Categories (HIV Infection Stages) for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage ) initially but fall eventually. CD8+ counts usually increase initially and do not fall until late in the infection. These changes in cell populations result in a decrease in the CD4+:CD8+ cell ratio, a characteristic of HIV infection (although sometimes occurring in other infections). Plasma viral RNA concentrations in untreated children < 12 months are typically very high (mean of about 200,000 RNA copies/mL). By 24 months, viral concentrations in untreated children decrease (to a mean of about 40,000 RNA copies/mL). Although the wide range of HIV RNA concentrations in children make the data less predictive of morbidity and mortality than in adults, determining plasma viral concentrations in conjunction with CD4+ counts still yields more accurate prognostic information than does determining either marker alone. Less expensive alternative surrogate markers such as total lymphocyte counts and serum albumin levels may also predict AIDS mortality in children, which may be useful in developing nations. Although not routinely measured, serum immunoglobulin concentrations, particularly IgG and IgA, often are markedly elevated, but occasionally some children develop panhypogammaglobulinemia. Patients may be anergic to skin test antigens. Prognosis for HIV Infection in Infants and Children In the pre-ART era, 10 to 15% of children from industrialized countries and perhaps 50 to 80% of children from developing countries died before age 4 years; however, with appropriate combination ART regimens, most perinatally infected children survive well into adulthood. Increasing numbers of these perinatally infected young adults have given birth to or fathered their own children. Nevertheless, if opportunistic infections occur, particularly Pneumocystis pneumonia, progressive neurologic disease, or severe wasting, the prognosis is poor unless virologic and immunologic control is regained with combination ART. Mortality due to Pneumocystis pneumonia ranges from 5 to 40% if treated and is almost 100% if untreated. Prognosis is also poor for children in whom virus is detected early (ie, by 7 days of life) or who develop symptoms in the first year of life. There has been only one well-documented case of an adult in whom replication-competent HIV was eradicated (ie, the person has been \"cured\" for > 5 years). This HIV-infected adult required a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for leukemia. The donor cells were homozygous for the CCR5-delta 32 mutation, which made the engrafted lymphocytes resistant to infection with CCR5-tropic HIV; subsequently, HIV has remained undetectable. It is likely that ART, bone marrow ablation, and graft-vs-host disease also contributed to this person's cure. Other HIV-infected transplant recipients have not experienced cure; however, -a few well-documented cases of infants with transient eradication of replication-competent HIV have been reported. One such infant was born to an HIV-infected mother who had not received prenatal care or prenatal (or intrapartum) ART. Beginning on the second day of life, the infant was given combination ART at high doses not yet known to be safe and effective for use in the first 2 weeks of life. The ART was given for about 15 months, after which time it was inadvertently interrupted. Nevertheless, at 24 months of age the infant had no detectable replicating virus RNA (a \"functional cure\") but did have detectable proviral DNA. Subsequently, however, HIV replication ensued. Several similar cases of infants with temporary interruption of HIV replication have been reported; none have been \"cured\" of their HIV infection, and it is not yet known if cure is possible. What is known, however, is that HIV infection is a treatable infection that is already compatible with long-term survival if effective ART is given. Future research will undoubtedly uncover ways to improve ART tolerance and efficacy and perhaps help achieve the goal of curative therapy. At present, interruption of ART is not recommended. Treatment of HIV Infection in Infants and Children Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs: Combination ART most commonly includes 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI); sometimes a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is given with 2 NRTIs Supportive care Because of the success of combination ART, much of the current focus is on the management of HIV infection as a chronic disease, addressing both medical and social issues. Important long-term medical issues include the need to manage HIV-related and drug-related metabolic complications and to account for age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Social issues include the need to cope with peer pressure from noninfected adolescents, ensure school success and appropriate career choice, and educate children about transmission risk. Adolescents often have difficulty seeking and following health care advice and need particular help with treatment adherence. Children and adolescents should be managed in collaboration with experts who have experience in the management of pediatric HIV infection Initiation of ART for children is similar to that in adults; essentially, all children with HIV infection should be given ART as soon as possible (rapid initiation, within 1 to 2 weeks of diagnosis). The goal of therapy is similar to that in adults: suppress HIV replication (as measured by HIV plasma viral load) and maintain or achieve age-normal CD4+ counts and percentages with the least amount of drug toxicity. Before making the decision to initiate therapy, the practitioner should fully assess the readiness of the caregiver and child to adhere with ARV drug administration and discuss the potential benefits and risks of therapy. Because expert opinions on therapeutic strategies change rapidly, consultation with experts is strongly advised. Adherence Antiretroviral drug therapy will be successful only if the family and child are able to adhere to a possibly complex medical regimen. Nonadherence not only leads to failure to control HIV but also selects drug-resistant HIV strains, which reduces future therapeutic choices. Barriers to adherence should be addressed before starting treatment. Barriers include availability and palatability of pills or suspensions, adverse effects (including those due to drug interactions with current therapy), pharmacokinetic factors such as the need to take some drugs with food or in a fasted state, and a child’s dependence on others to give drugs (and HIV-infected parents may have problems with remembering to take their own drugs). Newer once- or twice-daily combination regimens and more palatable pediatric formulations may help improve adherence. Adherence may be especially problematic in adolescents regardless of whether they have been infected perinatally or have acquired HIV infection later on through sexual activity or injection drug use. Adolescents have complex biopsychosocial issues, such as low self-esteem, chaotic and unstructured lifestyles, fear of being singled out because of illness, and sometimes a lack of family support, all of which may reduce drug adherence. In addition, adolescents may not be developmentally able to understand why drugs are necessary during periods of asymptomatic infection and they may worry greatly about adverse effects. Despite frequent contact with the medical system, perinatally infected adolescents may fear or deny their HIV infection, distrust information provided by the health care team, and poorly make the transition to the adult health care system . Treatment regimens for adolescents must balance these issues. Although the goal is to have the adolescent adhere to a maximally potent regimen of ARV drugs, a realistic assessment of the adolescent's maturity and support systems may suggest that the treatment plan begin by focusing on avoidance of opportunistic illness and provide information about reproductive health services, housing, and how to succeed in school. Once care team members are confident the adolescent is receiving proper support, they can decide exactly which ARV drugs are best. Monitoring Clinical and laboratory monitoring are important for identifying drug toxicity and therapeutic failure. At entry into care and at initiation of ART (and if changing ART regimen): Physical examination, adherence evaluation, complete blood count, serum chemistry values including electrolytes, liver and kidney tests, HIV plasma viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte counts, and, for adolescent girls, a pregnancy test Every 3 to 4 months: Physical examination, adherence evaluation, complete blood count, serum chemistry values, including electrolytes, liver and kidney tests, HIV plasma viral load, and CD4+ lymphocyte counts Every 6 to 12 months: Lipid profiles and urinalysis HIV genotypic resistance testing should be done at entry into care and upon ART changes due to presumed virologic failure. If abacavir is to be given, HLA-B*5701 status must be tested; abacavir should be given only to patients who are HLA-B*5701–negative. This testing is often done at entry into care so that safety of possible future use of abacavir will be known. If children have a stable treatment status, ie, nondetectable HIV RNA and normal age-adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte counts without clinical signs of toxicity for at least 12 months, and a stable family support system, many clinicians will extend the interval of laboratory evaluations to every 6 months. However, clinical care visits every 3 months are valuable because clinicians have the opportunity to review adherence, monitor growth and clinical symptoms, and update weight-based dosing of ARV drugs as needed. Integration of HIV-Infected Children HIV infection in a child affects the entire family. Serologic testing of siblings and parents is recommended. The physician must provide education and ongoing counseling. The infected child should be taught good hygiene and behavior to reduce risk to others. How much and when the child is told about the illness depends on age and maturity. Older children and adolescents should be made aware of their diagnosis and the possibility of sexual transmission and should be counseled appropriately. Families may be unwilling to share the diagnosis with people outside the immediate family because it can create social isolation. Feelings of guilt are common. Family members, including children, can become clinically depressed and require counseling. Because HIV infection is not acquired through the typical types of contact that occur among children (eg, through saliva or tears), HIV-infected children should be allowed to attend school without restrictions. Similarly, there are no inherent reasons to restrict foster care, adoptive placement, or child care of HIV-infected children. Conditions that may pose an increased risk to others (eg, aggressive biting or the presence of exudative, weeping skin lesions that cannot be covered) may require special precautions. The number of school personnel aware of the child’s condition should be kept to the minimum needed to ensure proper care. The family has the right to inform the school, but people involved in the care and education of an infected child must respect the child’s right to privacy. Disclosures of information should be made only with the informed consent of the parents or legal guardians and age-appropriate assent of the child.HIV infection, with several exceptions. The main exception is that live-virus vaccines and live-bacteria vaccines (eg, bacille Calmette–Guérin [BCG]) should be avoided or used only in certain circumstances . In addition, 1 to 2 months after the last dose of the hepatitis B vaccine Hepatitis B (Hep.B) Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine is 80 to 100% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis B in people who complete the vaccine series.HIV-infected children should be tested to determine whether the level of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) is protective (≥ 10 mIU/mL). HIV-infected children and adolescents < 18 years of age should be immunized with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci)PPSV) Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Certain postexposure treatment recommendations also differ. Recently, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate immunization Meningococcal Vaccine The meningococcal serogroups that most often cause meningococcal disease in the US are serogroups B, C, and Y. Serogroups A and W cause disease outside the USHIV-infected children, adolescents, and adults . The live measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine effectively protects against all 3 infections.Varicella Vaccine Varicella vaccination provides effective protection against varicella (chickenpox). It is not known how long protection against varicella lasts. However, the MMR and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccines (separately; not combined as MMRV vaccine, which has a higher titer of attenuated varicella virus, the safety of which has not been shown in this population) can be given to asymptomatic patients following the routine schedule and to patients who have had HIV symptoms but who are not severely immunocompromised (ie, not in category 3 [ see Table: Immunologic Categories (HIV Infection Stages) for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage Immunologic Categories (HIV Infection Stages) for Children < 13 Years With HIV Infection Based on Age-Specific CD4+ T-Cell Count or Percentage ], including having a CD4+ T-cell percentage of ≥ 15%). If possible, the MMR and VZV vaccines should be given starting at age 12 months in symptomatic patients to enhance the likelihood of an immune response, ie, before the immune system deteriorates. The 2nd dose of each may be given as soon as 4 weeks later in an attempt to induce seroconversion as early as possible, although typically a 3-month interval between varicella vaccine doses is preferred in noninfected children < 13 years. If the risk of exposure to measles is increased, such as during an outbreak, the measles vaccine should be given at an earlier age, such as 6 to 9 months. Safety and efficacy data are limited in symptomatic infants but there very likely is overall benefit to immunization, particularly in areas where rotavirus causes significant mortality. The BCG vaccine is not recommended in the US because it is an area of low tuberculosis (TB) prevalence. However, elsewhere in the world, especially in developing countries where TB prevalence is high, BCG is routinely used; many of these countries also have high HIV prevalence among childbearing women. BCG as a live bacterial vaccine has caused some harm in HIV-infected children but likely protects non–HIV-infected and even some HIV-infected children from acquiring TB. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends that children who are known to be HIV-infected, even if asymptomatic, should no longer be immunized with BCG vaccine. However, BCG may be given to asymptomatic infants of unknown HIV infection status born to HIV-infected women, depending on the relative incidence of TB and HIV in the particular area. BCG also may be given to asymptomatic infants born to women of unknown HIV infection status. In some areas of the world, children are routinely given the yellow fever vaccine Prevention Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne flavivirus infection endemic in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa. Because children with symptomatic HIV infection generally have poor immunologic responses to vaccines, they should be considered susceptible when they are exposed to a vaccine-preventable disease (eg, measles, tetanus, varicella) regardless of their vaccination history. Such children should receive passive immunization with IV immune globulin. IV immune globulin also should be given to any nonimmunized household member who is exposed to measles. Seronegative children living with a person with symptomatic HIV infection should receive inactivated poliovirus vaccine Poliomyelitis Vaccine Extensive vaccination has almost eradicated polio worldwide. But cases still occur in areas with incomplete immunization, such as sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Influenza (inactivated or live), MMR, varicella, and rotavirus vaccines may be given normally because these vaccine viruses are not commonly transmitted by the vaccinee. Adult household contacts should receive annual influenza vaccination (inactivated or live) to reduce the risk of transmitting influenza to the HIV-infected person. Table Transition to Adult Care Transition of HIV-infected youth from the pediatric health care model to the adult health care model takes time and advance planning. This process is active and ongoing and does not simply involve a one-time referral to an adult care clinic or office. The pediatric health care model tends to be family-centered, and the care team includes a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals; perinatally infected youth may have been cared for by such a team for their entire life. In contrast, the typical adult health care model tends to be individual-centered, and the health care practitioners involved may be located in separate offices requiring multiple visits. Health care practitioners at adult care clinics and offices are often managing high patient volumes, and the consequences of lateness or missed appointments (which may be more common among adolescents) are stricter. Finally, changes in insurance coverage in adolescence or young adulthood can complicate transition of medical care as well. Planning transition over several months and having adolescents have discussions or joint visits with the pediatric and adult health care practitioners can lead to a smoother and more successful transition. A resource for transition of HIV-infected youth into adult health care is available from the American Academy of Pediatrics . Prevention of perinatal transmission Appropriate prenatal ART attempts to optimize maternal health, interrupt MTCT, and minimize in utero drug toxicity. Rapid HIV testing of pregnant women who present in labor without documentation of their HIV serostatus may allow immediate institution of such measures. All HIV-infected pregnant women should initiate combination ART to prevent MTCT, as well as for their own health, as soon as the diagnosis of HIV infection is made and they are ready to adhere to ART. Combination ART is continued throughout pregnancy. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to combination ART regimens; specifically, neither dolutegravir nor efavirenz is contraindicated during the 1st trimester. Although a clinical trial in Botswana showed a link between periconceptional exposure to dolutegravir and a small increase in infant neural tube defects, it is unknown whether this increase was truly due to dolutegravir or to another factor, such as folate deficiency. The majority of experts believe that HIV-infected women already receiving combination ART who become pregnant should continue that therapy, even early during the 1st trimester. Elective cesarean delivery before onset of labor is recommended if the maternal HIV plasma viral load is > 1000 copies/mL. If labor has already begun, it is less certain whether cesarean delivery will reduce MTCT. During labor, IV ZDV is given at 2 mg/kg IV for the first hour and then 1 mg/kg/hour IV until delivery to women who have ≥ 1 of the following: Recent HIV plasma viral load > 1000 copies/mL Unknown HIV plasma viral load near delivery Are thought to have had incomplete adherence to ART Many experts now believe that IV ZDV is not required during labor for women receiving combination ART who have achieved HIV plasma viral loads < 50 copies/mL near delivery. However, IV ZDV should be considered for women with a viral load of 50 to 999 copies/mL at or near delivery; it may provide additional protection against perinatal transmission. After delivery, combination ART is continued for all women, even those who had not previously received ART. All HIV-exposed newborns should receive a postpartum ARV regimen to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Treatment should begin as soon as possible, preferably within 6 to 12 hours of delivery. The ARV regimen is determined by maternal and infant risk factors for perinatal HIV transmission . Preventive regimens are categorized as ARV prophylaxis: One or more ARV drugs are given to neonates at low risk (< 0.5 to 1%). Empiric HIV therapy: A two- or three-drug regimen is given to neonates at higher risk (1 to 25%) as prophylaxis, also serving as preliminary treatment for those later confirmed to have HIV. Low-risk infants are candidates for ARV prophylaxis. They include full-term neonates born to women who have had good virologic control with ART (as shown by an HIV plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL) near delivery and in whom there are no concerns related to adherence to ART. Low-risk infants should be given ARV prophylaxis with ZDV 4 mg/kg orally twice daily for the first 4 weeks of life. ZDV is the backbone of infant prophylaxis and is used for all infants born to HIV-infected women regardless of the risk factors. Higher-risk infants are given empiric HIV therapy , either with a two-drug regimen of ZDV for 6 weeks and nevirapine for 3 doses, or with a three-drug regimen. Some experts choose a two-drug prophylaxis regimen if maternal HIV plasma viral load is < 200 to 400 copies/mL. Three-drug regimens include 6 weeks of zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine (treatment dose) or raltegravir (for dosing, see table Antiretroviral Dosing for Neonates with Perinatal HIV Exposure ). Very few ARV drugs (notably ZDV, nevirapine, lamivudine, and raltegravir) are considered to be safe and effective for infants < 14 days postnatal age, and fewer still (only zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine) have dosing data available for premature infants. The optimal ARV regimen for neonates born to women with ARV drug-resistant virus is unknown. Infants who subsequently have a positive HIV virologic test are given ART with three drugs. An expert in pediatric or maternal HIV infection should be immediately consulted . Clinicians also can call the Perinatal HIV Consultation and Referral Services Hotline at 1-888-HIV-8765 (1-888-448-8765) for questions regarding interventions to decrease vertical HIV transmission and neonatal diagnosis. Table Breastfeeding or donating to milk banks is contraindicated for HIV-infected women in the US and other countries where safe and affordable alternative sources of feeding are readily available. However, in countries where infectious diseases and undernutrition are major causes of early childhood mortality and safe, affordable infant formula is not available, the protection breastfeeding offers against the mortality risks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections may counterbalance the risk of HIV transmission. In these developing countries, the WHO recommends that HIV-infected mothers continue to breastfeed for the first 6 months of the infant's life and then rapidly wean the infant to food. Premastication (prechewing) of food, practiced by some mothers of young infants, is also contraindicated for HIV-infected women. Prevention of adolescent transmission Because adolescents are at special risk of HIV infection, they should receive education, have access to HIV testing, and know their serostatus. Education should include information about transmission, implications of infection, and strategies for prevention, including abstaining from high-risk behaviors and engaging in safe sex practices (eg, correct and consistent use of condoms Barrier contraceptives include vaginal spermicides (foams, creams, gels, suppositories), contraceptive gel, condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges. Efforts should especially target adolescents at high risk of HIV infection, in particular, black and Hispanic adolescent men who have sex with other men because this is the fastest-growing US demographic of new HIV infections among youth; however, all adolescents should receive risk-reduction education. In most US states, informed consent is necessary for testing and the release of information regarding HIV serostatus. Decisions regarding disclosure of HIV status to a sex partner without the patient’s consent should be based on the possibility of domestic violence to the patient after disclosure to the partner, likelihood that the partner is at risk, whether the partner has reasonable cause to suspect the risk and to take precautions, and presence of a legal requirement to withhold or disclose such information.TDF/FTC) is being used more frequently for the HIV-negative partner of an HIV-infected adult. Older adolescents may also receive PrEP, although issues of confidentiality and cost (with possible lack of insurance reimbursement) are more complex than with adult PrEP. For further discussion, see PrEP to prevent HIV and promote sexual health from the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) from AIDSinfo.M. avium complex infections. Data are limited on the use of prophylaxis for opportunistic infection by other organisms, such as cytomegalovirus, fungi, and toxoplasma. Guidance on prophylaxis of these and other opportunistic infections is also available at AIDSinfo. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia is indicated for HIV-infected children ≥ 6 years of age with CD4+ count < 200 cells/mc.L or CD4+ percentage < 14% HIV-infected children 1 to < 6 years of age with CD4+ count < 500 cells/mc.L or CD4+ percentage < 22% HIV-infected infants < 12 months of age regardless of CD4+ count or percentage Infants born to HIV-infected women (beginning at 4 to 6 weeks of age), until HIV infection is either presumptively excluded by documentation of 2 negative virologic test results (1 at ≥ 2 weeks of age and 1 at ≥ 4 weeks of age) or definitively excluded by documentation of 2 negative virologic test results (1 at ≥ 1 month of age and 1 at ≥ 4 months of age) (NOTE: For these definitions of HIV exclusion to be valid, the infant must not be breastfeeding.) Once immune reconstitution with combination ART occurs, discontinuation of Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis may be considered for HIV-infected children who have received combination ART for > 6 months and whose CD4+ percentage and CD4+ count have remained higher than the previously described treatment thresholds for > 3 consecutive months. Subsequently, the CD4+ percentage and count should be reevaluated at least every 3 months, and prophylaxis should be reinstituted if the original criteria are reached. The drug of choice for Pneumocystis prophylaxis at any age is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) TMP 75 mg/SMX 375 mg/m2 orally 2 times a day on 3 consecutive days/week (eg, Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday); alternative schedules include the same dose 2 times a day every day, the same dose 2 times a day on alternate days, or twice the dose (TMP 150 mg/SMX 750 mg/m2) once a day for 3 consecutive days/week. Some experts find it easier to use weight-based dosing (TMP 2.5 to 5 mg/SMX 12.5 to 25 mg/kg orally 2 times a day). For patients who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX, dapsone 2 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) orally once a day is an alternative, especially for those < 5 years of age. Oral atovaquone given daily or aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg via specially designed inhaler for children ≥ 5 years) given once a month is an additional alternative. IV pentamidine has also been used but is both less effective and more toxic. Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex infection is indicated in Children ≥ 6 years with CD4+ count < 50 cells/mc.L Children 2 to 6 years with CD4+ count < 75 cells/mc.L Children 1 to 2 years with CD4+ count < 500 cells/mc.L Children < 1 year with CD4+ count < 750 cells/mc.L Weekly azithromycin or daily clarithromycin is the drug of choice, and daily rifabutin is an alternative. Key Points Most HIV cases in infants and children result from mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) before or during birth, or from breastfeeding in countries where safe and affordable infant formula is not available. Maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce incidence of MTCT from about 25% to < 1%. Diagnose children < 18 months using qualitative RNA assays (eg, transcription-mediated amplification of RNA) or DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Diagnose children > 18 months using a 4th-generation HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay followed by a 2nd-generation HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation assay and, if required, an HIV-1 qualitative RNA assay. Urgently treat (using rapid initiation) all HIV-infected infants < 12 months of age; those 1 to < 6 years of age who have stage 3–defining opportunistic infections or CD4 counts < 500 cells/mc.L; and those ≥ 6 years of age who have stage 3–defining opportunistic infections or CD4 counts < 200 cells/mc.L. Treat all other HIV-infected children and adolescents as soon as issues of adherence are more fully assessed and addressed with the children and their caretakers. Combination ART is given, preferably using a fixed-dose combination product if feasible, for increased adherence.

Vasculitis can affect any blood vessel—arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, or capillaries. Clinical manifestations of specific vasculitic disorders are diverse and depend on the size and location of the involved vessels, the extent of the organ involvement, and the degree and pattern of extravascular inflammation. Etiology of Vasculitis may be Primary Secondary Primary vasculitis has no known cause. Secondary vasculitis may be triggered by an infection, a drug, or a toxin or may occur as part of another inflammatory disorder or cancer. Pathophysiology of Vasculitis Histologic description of an affected vessel should include the following: A description of vessel wall damage (eg, type and location of inflammatory infiltrate, extent and type of damage, presence or absence of fibrinoid necrosis) A description of healing responses (eg, intimal hypertrophy, fibrosis) Certain features (eg, predominant inflammatory cell type, location of inflammation) suggest particular vasculitic processes and may aid in the diagnosis. For example, in many acute lesions, the predominant inflammatory cells are polymorphonuclear leukocytes; in chronic lesions, lymphocytes predominate. Inflammation may be segmental or involve the entire vessel. At sites of inflammation, varying degrees of cellular inflammation and necrosis or scarring occur in one or more layers of the vessel wall. Inflammation in the media of a muscular artery tends to destroy the internal elastic lamina. Some forms of vasculitis are characterized by giant cells in the vessel wall.Kawasaki disease Kawasaki Disease Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term used to describe findings in small-vessel vasculitis. It refers to breakdown of inflammatory cells that leaves small nuclear fragments (nuclear debris) in and around the vessels. Inflammation is transmural and nongranulomatous. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes predominate early; later, lymphocytes predominate. Resolution of the inflammation tends to result in fibrosis and intimal hypertrophy. Intimal hypertrophy or secondary clot formation can narrow the vessel lumen and cause tissue ischemia or necrosis. Table Classification of Vasculitis Vasculitic disorders can be classified according to the size of the predominant vessel affected. However, there is often substantial overlap. Table Classification of Vasculitic Disorders Size of Predominant Affected Vessels Disorders Symptoms and Signs Large Behçet disease Behçet Disease Behçet disease is a multisystem, relapsing, chronic vasculitic disorder with mucosal inflammation.Giant cell arteritis Giant Cell Arteritis Giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteries.Takayasu arteritis Takayasu Arteritis Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the aorta, its branches, and pulmonary arteries. It occurs predominantly in young women. Etiology is unknown.Limb claudication Unequal blood pressure measurements or unequal pulse strength/absent pulse in the limbs Central nervous system and retinal ischemic symptoms (eg, strokes) Medium-vessel cutaneous vasculitis Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis refers to vasculitis affecting small- or medium-sized vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue but not the internal organs.Kawasaki disease Kawasaki Disease Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years.Symptoms of tissue infarction in affected organs, such as Muscles: Myalgias Nerves: Numbness, paresthesias, and/or weakness. Multiple mononeuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) or polyneuropathy Gastrointestinal tract: Abdominal pain, weight loss, and/or diarrhea. Mesenteric ischemia Kidneys: New-onset hypertension (with renal artery involvement) Skin: Ulcers, nodules, and livedo reticularis Symptoms and signs in Kawasaki disease Kawasaki Disease Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years.Immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis Immunoglobulin A–Associated Vasculitis (IgAV) Immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is vasculitis that affects primarily small vessels. It occurs most often in children.Henoch-Schönlein purpura) Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) Microscopic polyangiitis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis without immune globulin deposition (pauci-immune) that affects mainly small vessels.Small-vessel cutaneous vasculitis Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis refers to vasculitis affecting small- or medium-sized vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue but not the internal organs.Symptoms of tissue infarction in affected organs similar to those for medium-sized vessels, except skin lesions more likely to be purpuric In kidneys: Glomerulonephritis (usually asymptomatic) Symptoms and Signs of Vasculitis Size of the affected vessels helps determine clinical presentation. Regardless of the size of the vessels involved, patients can present with symptoms and signs of systemic inflammation (eg, fever, night sweats, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, arthralgias, arthritis). Some manifestations are life-threatening or organ-threatening and require immediate treatment: Alveolar hemorrhage Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is persistent or recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. There are numerous causes, but autoimmune disorders are most common.Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is acute nephritic syndrome accompanied by microscopic glomerular crescent formation with progression to renal failure within weeks to months.Mesenteric ischemia Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Acute mesenteric ischemia is interruption of intestinal blood flow by embolism, thrombosis, or a low-flow state. It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction.Vision loss in patients with giant cell arteritis Treatment Giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteries.Small- and medium-sized vasculitides often manifest with skin lesions such as palpable purpura, urticaria, ulcers, livedo reticularis, and nodules. Diagnosis of Vasculitis Clinical evaluation Basic laboratory tests to detect inflammation or organ dysfunction (eg, complete blood count [CBC], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein, serum albumin and total protein, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT], blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine, urinalysis) and to stage disease process Laboratory tests to help determine the type of vasculitis (eg, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA]) if suggested by clinical assessment Laboratory and imaging studies that may help determine the cause of vasculitis (eg, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis B core and hepatitis B surface antibody tests and hepatitis C virus antibody test, , blood cultures) and extent of organ involvement Biopsy Systemic vasculitis is suspected in patients with the following: Symptoms or signs suggestive of vasculitis (eg, temporal headache and jaw claudication suggesting giant cell arteritis) Ischemic manifestations (eg, ischemic stroke, limb claudication, mesenteric ischemia) out of proportion to a patient's risk factors for atherosclerosis Unexplained combinations of symptoms in more than one organ system that are compatible with vasculitis (eg, hypertension, myalgias, hemoptysis), particularly when symptoms of a systemic illness are present Primary vasculitic disorders are diagnosed based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, physical findings, compatible laboratory test results, and exclusion of other causes (ie, secondary vasculitis). Histologic examination is done whenever possible and may support the diagnosis of a particular vasculitic disorder . Clinical findings determine the differential diagnosis and thus direct laboratory testing. Most routine laboratory tests yield results that are nonspecific and must be interpreted in the context of the entire clinical presentation. However, results can often help support the diagnosis, determine the location and degree of organ involvement, or suggest alternative diagnoses. Tests usually include CBC, ESR or C-reactive protein, serum albumin and total protein, AST, and ALT. Often, patients present with elevated ESR or C-reactive protein, anemia due to chronic inflammation, elevated platelets, and low serum albumin. Freshly voided urine must be tested for red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and protein to identify renal involvement. Serum creatinine levels should be checked and monitored. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not typical of primary vasculitis and suggest an alternate diagnosis.EGPA), or microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) Microscopic polyangiitis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis without immune globulin deposition (pauci-immune) that affects mainly small vessels.ANCA-associated vasculitides). Standardized tests for ANCA include immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils can detect the cytoplasmic pattern of c-ANCA or the perinuclear pattern of p-ANCA. Then ELISA is used to check for antibodies specific for the major autoantigens: proteinase-3 (PR3), which produces the c-ANCA staining pattern, or myeloperoxidase (MPO), which produces the p-ANCA staining pattern seen on ethanol-fixed neutrophils. Because ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare, and the ANCA test is not completely specific, ANCA testing should be done only when the pretest probability for ANCA-associated vasculitis is moderately high. A positive ANCA test can occur in infections that can cause a secondary vasculitis, including endocarditis. Other useful laboratory tests include hepatitis B and C serologic testing, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, antinuclear antibody and anti-extractable nuclear antigens panel, testing for the presence of cryoglobulins, and complement levels. Complement levels may be low in viral vasculitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, lymphoproliferative disorders, or vasculitis secondary to other autoimmune diseases. Further testing is determined by clinical findings. If indicated based on clinical findings, a chest x-ray should be done to check for infiltrates, but high-resolution noncontrast CT of the chest may be needed to check for subtle findings, such as small nodules or cavities. Bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggest possible alveolar hemorrhage, which requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. Other imaging tests may be required. For example, magnetic resonance angiography of large blood vessels and the aorta is useful for diagnosis and monitoring when such vessels appear affected. If symptoms and examination suggest a neuropathy, electromyography may be helpful. Because vasculitic disorders are rare and treatment may have severe adverse effects, tissue biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis whenever possible. Clinical findings suggest the best site for biopsy. Biopsy results are most likely to be positive if taken from affected lung, skin, and kidney tissue. Blind biopsies of organs without clinical manifestations or laboratory suggestion of involvement have a low likelihood of providing positive results. Treatment of Vasculitis Induction of remission for life-threatening or organ-threatening vasculitis with corticosteroids, often with cyclophosphamide or rituximab Induction of remission for less severe vasculitis with corticosteroids plus a less potent immunosuppressant (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) or rituximab Maintenance of remission with methotrexate, azathioprine, or rituximab, plus tapering of corticosteroids Treatment of vasculitis depends on the etiology, the type of vasculitis, and extent and severity of disease. For secondary vasculitic disorders, removing the cause (eg, infection, drug, cancer) usually helps. For primary vasculitic disorders, treatment aims to induce and maintain remission. Remission is induced by using cytotoxic immunosuppressants and high-dose corticosteroids, usually for 3 to 6 months, until remission occurs or disease activity is acceptably reduced. The duration of remission is hard to predict and may depend on the type of vasculitis. For many patients, maintaining remission requires continuation of immunosuppressive therapy with or without a low dose of corticosteroids. During this period, the goal is to eliminate corticosteroids or reduce their dose and use alternative, less toxic immunosuppressants as long as needed. All patients treated with immunosuppressants should be monitored for opportunistic and other infections. Testing for tuberculosis and hepatitis B, which can become reactivated by some immunosuppressive therapies, should be done. Induction of remission For less severe forms of vasculitis, low doses of corticosteroids and less potent immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) may be used. Severe, rapidly progressive and life- or organ-threatening vasculitis (eg, causing alveolar hemorrhage, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, or mesenteric ischemia) is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission and immediate treatment. Treatment typically consists of the following: Corticosteroids: High-dose corticosteroids (also called pulse corticosteroids) are often prescribed. Specific doses and drugs must be individualized. As one example, methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg or 1 g IV once a day for 3 days may be used, followed by 1 mg/kg prednisone or methylprednisolone orally (or, if hospitalized, sometimes IV) once a day for about 4 weeks. The dose is then tapered slowly, as tolerated, until the drug is stopped. Changes in tapering schedule may be necessary if the patient fails to improve or relapses. Cyclophosphamide: A dose of 2 mg/kg orally once a day is usually recommended for at least 3 months or until remission occurs. The white blood cell (WBC) count must be closely monitored, and the dose must be adjusted to avoid leukopenia. (WBC count should be maintained at > 3500/micro.L [> 3.5 x 109/L].) Alternatively, an IV cyclophosphamide regimen of 0.5 to 1 g/m2 at 2- to 4-week intervals is sometimes used. The dose should be reduced in patients with significant renal insufficiency, and WBC counts should be monitored frequently. Mesna:Mesna is mixed with IV cyclophosphamide to bind acrolein, a product of cyclophosphamide degradation that is toxic to the bladder epithelium and can lead to hemorrhagic cystitis and sometimes transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Long-term use of cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer. One milligram of mesna is added for each milligram of cyclophosphamide. Recurrence of hematuria, especially without casts and dysmorphic red cells, should prompt a referral for urologic evaluation. Cystoscopy and renal imaging should be done to exclude cancer. Rituximab:Rituximab, a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be noninferior to cyclophosphamide in inducing remission of severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. Rituximab is given as 375 mg/m2 IV once a week for 4 weeks. A widely used alternative regimen is two 1000-mg infusions given 2 weeks apart. B cell-depleting therapies will markedly blunt the response to vaccines for months after administration. Remission maintenance Corticosteroids are tapered to zero or to the lowest dose that can maintain remission. For some forms of vasculitis (most clearly demonstrated in ANCA-associated disease), weekly methotrexate (with folate) or daily azathioprine is prescribed to replace cyclophosphamide because these drugs have a better adverse effects profile. Periodic IV rituximab may also be used to maintain remission, but the optimal dosage and infusion interval have not been clearly established. The duration of this treatment varies, from one year to several years, depending on the patient, specific diagnosis, and propensity for relapse. Patients with frequent relapses may need to take immunosuppressants indefinitely. Long-term use of corticosteroids can have significant adverse effects. Patients who are taking ≥ 7.5 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids should be given calcium and vitamin D supplements and bisphosphonates to help prevent or minimize osteoporosis Treatment Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.Diagnosis Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure. Additional corticosteroid supplementation may be needed in seriously ill patients or in those undergoing surgery who may have a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, depending on the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy and the duration and intensity of stress. Recent studies have focused on developing treatments that limit corticosteroid exposure. Avacopan, a selective C5a receptor antagonist, is an available adjunctive therapy for severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis (1 Treatment reference Vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels, often with ischemia, necrosis, and organ inflammation.

The subtypes are important to distinguish, however, because they have different clinical features  and respond differently to treatment.  General reference 1. Travis WD, Costabel U, Hansell DM, et al: An Official American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Statement: Update of the International Multidisciplinary Classification of the Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 188 (6):733–748, 2013. Symptoms and Signs of Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias Symptoms and signs of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias are usually nonspecific. Cough and dyspnea on exertion are typical, with variable onset and progression. Common signs include tachypnea, reduced chest expansion, bibasilar end-inspiratory dry crackles, and digital clubbing. Diagnosis of Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias High-resolution CT (HRCT) Pulmonary function tests Sometimes surgical lung biopsy Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia should be suspected in any patient with unexplained interstitial lung disease. Clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists should exchange information to determine the diagnosis in individual patients. Potential causes  are assessed systematically. For maximum diagnostic yield, history should address the following criteria: Symptom duration Family history of lung disease, especially lung fibrosis History of tobacco use (because some diseases occur mostly among current or former smokers) Current and prior drug use Detailed review of home and work environments, including those of family members A chronologic listing of the patient's employment history, including specific duties and known exposures to organic and inorganic agents , is obtained. The degree of exposure, duration of exposure, latency of exposure, and the use of protective devices is elicited. Chest x-ray is done and is typically abnormal, but findings are not specific enough to differentiate between the various types. Pulmonary function tests Overview of Tests of Pulmonary Function Pulmonary function tests provide measures of airflow, lung volumes, gas exchange, response to bronchodilators, and respiratory muscle function. Typical results are restrictive physiology, with reduced lung volumes and diffusion capacity. Hypoxemia is common during exercise and may be present at rest. HRCT, which distinguishes airspace from interstitial disease, is the most useful test and is always done. It provides assessment of the potential etiology, extent, and distribution of disease, and is more likely to detect underlying or coexisting disease (eg, occult mediastinal adenopathy, cancer, emphysema). HRCT should be done with the patient supine and prone and should include dynamic expiratory imaging to accentuate evidence of small airway involvement. Laboratory tests are done for patients who have clinical features suggesting a connective tissue disorder, vasculitis, or environmental exposure. Such tests may include antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and other more specific serologic tests for connective tissue diseases (eg, ribonucleoprotein [RNP], anti-Ro [SSA], anti-La [SSB], scleroderma antibody [Scl70], anti-Jo-1 antibody ). Bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy can help differentiate certain interstitial lung diseases, such as sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder resulting in noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown.IIPs. Bronchoalveolar lavage helps narrow the differential diagnosis in some patients and can provide information about disease progression and response to therapy. The usefulness of this procedure in the initial clinical assessment and follow-up of most patients with these diseases has not been established, however. Cryobiopsy, a technique that quickly freezes the lung tissue immediately prior to removal, is being investigated as an aid to diagnosis of certain interstitial lung diseases. The tissue yield is higher than that of transbronchial biopsy but lower than surgical lung biopsy. Risks of the procedure include bleeding and pneumothorax. Cryobiopsy is currently under investigation and is not recommended by international guidelines; its role in diagnosis remains to be established. Surgical lung biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis when the history and HRCT are nondiagnostic. Biopsy of multiple sites with a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure is preferred. Treatment of Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias Varies by disorder Sometimes corticosteroids Sometimes lung transplantation Treatment varies by disorder . Smoking cessation Smoking Cessation Most smokers want to quit and have tried doing so with limited success. Corticosteroids are typically recommended for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is an idiopathic condition in which granulation tissue obstructs alveolar ducts and alveolar spaces with chronic inflammation occurring in adjacent alveoli.Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonia Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is lymphocytic infiltration of the alveolar interstitium and air spaces.

Cogan syndrome affects young adults, with 80% of patients between 14 and 47 years. The disease appears to result from an autoimmune reaction directed against an unknown common autoantigen in the cornea and inner ear. About 10 to 30% of patients also have severe systemic vasculitis, which may include life-threatening aortitis is inflammation of the aorta, sometimes causing aneurysm or occlusion. Aortitis is rare, but potentially life threatening. Its reported incidence is 1 to 3 per one million/year. Symptoms and Signs of Cogan Syndrome The presenting symptoms involve the ocular system in 38% of patients, the vestibuloauditory system in 46%, and both in 15%. By 5 months, 75% of patients have both ocular and vestibuloauditory symptoms. Nonspecific systemic complaints include fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia. Ocular involvement includes any combination of the following: Bilateral interstitial keratitis Interstitial Keratitis Interstitial keratitis is chronic, nonulcerative inflammation of the mid-stroma (the middle layers of the cornea) that is sometimes associated with uveitis. The cause is usually infectious.Episcleritis is self-limiting, recurring, usually idiopathic inflammation of the episcleral tissue that does not threaten vision.Scleritis is a severe, destructive, vision-threatening inflammation involving the deep episclera and sclera.Uveitis Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well.Papillitis Other orbital inflammation (eg, vitritis, choroiditis) Ocular symptoms include irritation, pain, photophobia, and decreased vision. Ocular examination shows a patchy corneal stromal infiltrate typical of interstitial keratitis Interstitial Keratitis Interstitial keratitis is chronic, nonulcerative inflammation of the mid-stroma (the middle layers of the cornea) that is sometimes associated with uveitis. The cause is usually infectious. Vestibuloauditory symptoms can include sensorineural hearing loss Pathophysiology , tinnitus is a noise in the ears. It is experienced by 10 to 15% of the population. Vascular A diastolic heart murmur may be present when aortitis is significant. Claudication may be present if limb vessels are affected. Diagnosis of Cogan Syndrome Clinical evaluation Urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist and otolaryngologist is indicated when Cogan syndrome is suspected. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and exclusion of other causes of stromal keratitis (eg, syphilis, Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus infection) by appropriate serologic tests. Antibodies to inner ear antigens, anti-Hsp70 (associated with sensorineural hearing loss), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (associated with vasculitis) have been found in patients with Cogan syndrome. CT and MRI should be done and may be normal or demonstrate labyrinthitis, inflammation, or calcification of the semicircular canals, vestibule, or cochlea. Treatment of Cogan Syndrome Initially topical and sometimes systemic corticosteroids for ocular involvement Untreated disease may lead to corneal scarring and vision loss and, in 60 to 80% of patients, permanent hearing loss Hearing Loss Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss ( 1). Keratitis (and symptoms of corneal involvement), Episcleritis is self-limiting, recurring, usually idiopathic inflammation of the episcleral tissue that does not threaten vision.Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well. To treat deeper ocular inflammation and to treat vestibuloauditory symptoms before they become permanent, prednisone 1 mg/kg orally once a day is begun as soon as possible and continued for 2 to 6 months. Some clinicians add cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, infliximab, or rituximab for recalcitrant cases.

It may be serous, serosanguineous, or purulent.Tinnitus is a noise in the ears. It is experienced by 10 to 15% of the population.Hearing Loss Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss ( 1). Etiology of Otorrhea Causes of ear discharge may originate from the ear canal, the middle ear, or the cranial vault. Certain causes tend to manifest acutely because of the severity of their symptoms or associated conditions. Others usually have a more indolent, chronic course but sometimes manifest acutely . Overall, the most common causes are Acute otitis media Otitis Media (Acute) Acute otitis media is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, usually accompanying an upper respiratory infection.Chronic otitis media Otitis Media (Chronic Suppurative) Chronic suppurative otitis media is a persistent, chronically draining (> 6 weeks), suppurative perforation of the tympanic membrane.Otitis externa External Otitis (Acute) External otitis is an acute infection of the ear canal skin typically caused by bacteria (Pseudomonas is most common)The most serious causes are necrotizing external otitis Mastoiditis is a bacterial infection of the mastoid air cells, which typically occurs after acute otitis media. Table Evaluation of Otorrhea History of present illness in patients with ear discharge should cover duration of symptoms and whether symptoms have been recurrent. Important associated symptoms include pain, itching, decreased hearing, vertigo, and tinnitus. Patients are questioned about activities that can affect the canal or tympanic membrane (eg, swimming; insertion of objects, including cotton swabs; use of ear drops). Head trauma sufficient to cause a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is readily apparent. Past medical history should note any previous known ear disorders, ear surgery (particularly tympanostomy tube placement), and diabetes or immunodeficiency. Physical examination begins with a review of vital signs for fever. Ear and surrounding tissues (particularly the area over the mastoid) are inspected for erythema and edema. The pinna is pulled and the tragus is pushed gently to see whether pain is worsened. The ear canal is inspected with an otoscope; the character of discharge and presence of canal lesions, granulation tissue, or foreign body are noted. Edema and discharge may block visualization of all but the distal canal (irrigation should not be used in case there is a tympanic membrane perforation), but when possible, the tympanic membrane is inspected for inflammation, perforation, distortion, and signs of cholesteatoma (eg, canal debris, polypoid mass from tympanic membrane). When the ear canal is severely swollen at the meatus (eg, as with severe otitis externa) or there is copious drainage, careful suctioning can permit an adequate examination and also allow treatment (eg, application of drops, with or without a wick). The cranial nerves are tested. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Recent major head trauma Any cranial nerve dysfunction (including sensorineural hearing loss) Fever Erythema of ear or periauricular tissue Diabetes or immunodeficiency Interpretation of findings Otoscopic examination can usually diagnose perforated tympanic membrane Traumatic Perforation of the Tympanic Membrane Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM) can cause pain, bleeding, hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Diagnosis is based on otoscopy. Treatment often is unnecessary.External Otitis (Acute) External otitis is an acute infection of the ear canal skin typically caused by bacteria (Pseudomonas is most common)External Ear Obstructions The ear canal may be obstructed by cerumen (earwax), a foreign object, or an insect. Itching, pain, and temporary conductive hearing loss may result. Some findings are highly suggestive . Other findings are less specific but indicate a more serious problem that involves more than a localized external ear or middle ear disorder: Vertigo and tinnitus (disorder of the inner ear) Cranial nerve deficits (disorder involving the skull base, such as infection or tumor) Erythema and tenderness of ear, surrounding tissues, or both (significant infection) Testing Many causes of ear discharge are clear after clinical evaluation. If cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is in question, discharge can be tested for glucose or beta-2 transferrin; these substances are present in CSF but not in other types of discharge. Patients without an obvious etiology on examination require audiogram and CT of the temporal bone or gadolinium-enhanced MRI. When auditory canal granulation is present, biopsy should be considered if clinical evaluation and CT are not clearly consistent with cholesteatoma. Treatment of Otorrhea Treatment is directed at the cause of the ear discharge. Most physicians do not treat a suspected CSF leak with antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis because drugs might mask the onset of meningitis. Sometimes a wick is placed to allow antibiotics to get into a very swollen ear canal (eg, with severe otitis externa). Key Points Acute discharge in a patient without chronic ear problems or immunodeficiency is likely the result of otitis externa or perforated otitis media.

{"seq_id": "11a59345-f953-4614-9b5a-ced2699c468a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Child maltreatment includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (eg, clergy, coach, teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Four types of maltreatment are generally recognized: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse (psychologic abuse), and neglect. The causes of child maltreatment are varied. Abuse and neglect are often associated with physical injuries, delayed growth and development, and mental health issues. Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and sometimes laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging. Management includes documentation and treatment of any injuries and physical and mental health conditions, mandatory reporting to appropriate government agencies, and sometimes hospitalization and/or foster care to keep the child safe. In 2020, 3.9 million reports of alleged child maltreatment were made to Child Protective Services (CPS) in the US involving 7.1 million children. About 2. Maltreatment rates were higher among girls (8.9 per 1000 girls) than boys (7.9 per 1000 boys). About two thirds of all reports to Child Protective Services were made by professionals who are mandated to report maltreatment (eg, educators, law enforcement personnel, social services personnel, legal professionals, day care providers, medical or mental health personnel, foster care providers). Of substantiated cases in the US in 2020, 76.1% involved neglect (including medical neglect), 16.5% involved physical abuse, 9.4% involved sexual abuse, and 0. Many children were victims of multiple types of maltreatment. About 1750 children died in the US of maltreatment in 2020, about half of whom were < 1 year old. About 73% of these children were victims of neglect and 43% were victims of physical abuse with or without other forms of maltreatment. Potential perpetrators of child maltreatment are defined slightly differently in different US states, but, in general, to legally be considered abuse, actions must be done by a person responsible for the child's welfare. Thus, parents and other relatives, people living in the child's home who have occasional responsibility, teachers, bus drivers, counselors, and so forth may be perpetrators. People who commit violence against children who they have no connection to or responsibility for (eg, as in school shootings) are guilty of assault, murder, and so forth but legally are not committing child abuse. In addition to immediate harm, neglect and abuse increase the risk of long-lasting problems, including mental health problems and substance use disorders. Child abuse is also associated with problems in adulthood such as obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke. Classification of Child Maltreatment Different forms of maltreatment often coexist, and overlap is considerable. The 4 main forms include Physical abuse Sexual abuse Emotional abuse Neglect In addition, intentionally feigning, falsifying, or exaggerating medical symptoms in a child that results in potentially harmful medical interventions is considered a form of abuse (child abuse in a medical setting). Physical abuse Physical abuse involves a caregiver inflicting physical harm or engaging in actions that create a high risk of harm. Assault by someone who is not a caregiver or in a position of responsibility to the child (eg, a shooter in a school mass shooting) is not specifically child abuse. Specific forms include shaking, dropping, striking, biting, and burning (eg, by scalding or touching with cigarettes). Infants and toddlers are the most vulnerable because the developmental stages that they may go through (eg, colic, inconsistent sleep patterns, temper tantrums, toilet training) may frustrate caregivers. This age group is also at increased risk because they cannot report their abuse. Abuse is the most common cause of serious head injury in infants. In toddlers, abdominal injury is also common. Children in these age groups are also at increased risk of brain and spine injuries because of the relative size of their head to their body and because they have weaker neck muscles. The risk of physical abuse declines in the early school years. The guidelines that differentiate sexual abuse from play vary from state to state, but in general sexual contact between individuals with a > 4-year (chronologically, or in mental or physical development) age difference is considered to be inappropriate. Forms of sexual abuse include Intercourse, which is oral, anal, or vaginal penetration Molestation, which is genital contact without intercourse Forms that do not involve physical contact by the perpetrator, including exposure of the perpetrator's genitals, showing sexually explicit material to a child, sexting with or posting pictures of a child, and forcing a child to participate in a sex act with another person or to participate in the production of sexual material Sexual abuse does not include sexual play, in which children close in age and development view or touch each other’s genital area without force or coercion. Emotional abuse Emotional abuse is inflicting emotional harm through the use of words or actions. Specific forms include Berating a child by yelling or screaming Spurning by belittling the child’s abilities and achievements Intimidating and terrorizing with threats Exploiting or corrupting by encouraging deviant or criminal behavior Emotional abuse can also occur when words or actions are omitted or withheld, in essence becoming emotional neglect (eg, ignoring or rejecting children or isolating them from interaction with other children or adults). Neglect is the failure to provide for or meet a child’s basic physical, emotional, educational, and medical needs. Neglect differs from abuse in that it usually occurs without intent to harm. Different types of neglect can be defined as Physical neglect includes failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, supervision, and protection from potential harm. Emotional neglect is failure to provide affection or love or other kinds of emotional support. Educational neglect is failure to enroll a child in school, ensure attendance at school, or provide home schooling. Medical neglect is failure to ensure that a child receives appropriate care or needed treatment for injuries or physical or mental disorders. However, failure to provide preventive care (eg, vaccinations, routine dental examinations) is not usually considered neglect. Special considerations Child abuse in a medical setting Child abuse in a medical setting (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, now called factitious disorder imposed on another Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self Factitious disorder is falsification of physical or psychologic symptoms without an obvious external incentive; the motivation for this behavior is to assume the sick role.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) occurs when caregivers intentionally produce or falsify physical or psychologic symptoms or signs in a child. Caregivers may injure the child with drugs or other agents or add blood or bacterial contaminants to urine specimens to simulate disease. Victims of this type of child abuse receive unnecessary and harmful or potentially harmful evaluations, tests, and/or treatments, including procedures or surgeries. Cultural factors Severe corporal punishment (eg, whipping, burning, scalding) clearly constitutes physical abuse, but for lesser degrees of physical and emotional chastisement, the boundary between socially accepted behavior and abuse varies among different cultures. Likewise, practices that are accepted by some cultures constitute abuse in the US (eg, female genital mutilation Female Genital Mutilation Female genital mutilation is a traditional practice in some cultures in parts of Africa (usually northern or central Africa). However, certain folk remedies (eg, coining, cupping (a manipulative and body-based practice) is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Members of certain religious groups have sometimes failed to obtain life-saving treatment (eg, for diabetic ketoacidosis or meningitis), resulting in a child's death. Such failure is typically considered neglect regardless of the parents’ or caregivers’ beliefs. Additionally, in the US, some caregivers refuse to have their children vaccinated, citing safety concerns . It is not clear whether this refusal of vaccination is true medical neglect. However, in the face of illness, refusal of medically accepted treatment sometimes requires further investigation and legal intervention. Etiology of Child Maltreatment Abuse Generally, abuse can be attributed to a breakdown of impulse control in the parent or caregiver. Several factors can contribute. Parental characteristics and personality features can play a role. The parent’s own childhood may have lacked affection and warmth, may not have been conducive to the development of adequate self-esteem or emotional maturity, and, in many cases, also included forms of maltreatment. Abusive parents may see their children as a source of unlimited and unconditional affection and look to them for the support that they never received. As a result, they may have unrealistic expectations of what their children can supply for them, they are frustrated easily and have poor impulse control, and they may be unable to give what they never experienced. Substance use may provoke impulsive and uncontrolled behaviors toward children. Untreated parental mental health disorders also increase the risk of maltreatment. This lack of bonding occurs more commonly with premature or sick infants separated from parents early in infancy or with biologically unrelated children (eg, stepchildren), increasing the risk of abuse. Situational stress may precipitate abuse, particularly when emotional support of relatives, friends, neighbors, or peers is unavailable. All types of abuse, including sexual abuse, occur across the spectrum of socioeconomic groups. Socioeconomic stress (eg, financial stress, social isolation, young or single parenthood) is associated with increased risk. Physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect may be associated with poverty and lower socioeconomic status. Neglect usually results from a combination of factors such as difficulties with parenting, poor stress-coping skills, unsupportive family systems, and stressful life circumstances. Neglect often occurs in families experiencing financial and environmental stresses, particularly those in which parents also have untreated mental health disorders (typically depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia), have a substance use disorder, or have limited intellectual capacity. Children in single-parent families may be at risk of neglect due to a lower income and fewer available resources. Symptoms and Signs of Child Maltreatment Symptoms and signs depend on the nature and duration of the abuse or neglect. Physical abuse Skin lesions are the most common findings. More severe findings may include Handprints or oval fingertip marks caused by slapping or grabbing and shaking Long, bandlike ecchymoses caused by belt whipping Narrow arcuate bruises caused by extension cord whipping Multiple small, round burns caused by cigarettes Symmetric scald burns of upper or lower extremities or buttocks caused by intentional immersion Bite marks Thickened skin or scarring at the corners of the mouth caused by being gagged Patchy alopecia, with varying hair lengths, caused by hair pulling Fractures highly indicative of physical abuse include classic metaphyseal lesions (usually caused by shaking an infant or toddler), rib fractures, and spinous processes fractures. Fractures most frequently associated with physical abuse include skull fractures, long bone fractures, and rib fractures. In children < 1 year old, about 75% of fractures are inflicted by others. Confusion and localizing neurologic abnormalities can occur with central nervous system injuries. Lack of visible head lesions does not exclude traumatic brain injury, particularly in infants subjected to violent shaking. These infants may be comatose or stuporous from brain injury yet lack visible signs of injury (with the common exception of retinal hemorrhage) or they may present with nonspecific signs such as fussiness and vomiting. Traumatic injury to organs within the chest or abdominal/pelvic region may also occur without visible signs. Older children who are frequently abused are often fearful and irritable and sleep poorly. They may have symptoms of depression Depressive Disorders in Children and Adolescents Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress.Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders (ASD and PTSD) in Children and Adolescents Acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are reactions to traumatic events.Overview of Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand. Sometimes victims of abuse display symptoms similar to those of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD, ADHD) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.ADHD) and are mistakenly diagnosed with that disorder. Violent or suicidal behavior may occur. Pearls & Pitfalls Lack of visible head lesions does not exclude traumatic brain injury in children who have been abused. Sexual abuse In most cases, children do not spontaneously disclose sexual abuse and do not always exhibit behavioral or physical signs of sexual abuse. If a disclosure is made, it is generally delayed, sometimes days to years. In some cases, abrupt or extreme changes in behavior may occur. Aggressiveness or withdrawal may develop, as may phobias or sleep disturbances. Some sexually abused children act in ways that are sexually inappropriate for their age. Physical signs of sexual abuse that involves penetration may include Difficulty walking or sitting Bruises or tears around the genitals, anus, or mouth Vaginal discharge, bleeding, or pruritus Other manifestations include a sexually transmitted infection or pregnancy. Within a few days of the abuse, examination of the genitals, anus, and mouth will likely be normal, but the examiner may find healed lesions or subtle changes. Emotional abuse In early infancy, emotional abuse may blunt emotional expressiveness and decrease interest in the environment. Emotional abuse commonly results in failure to thrive and is often misdiagnosed as intellectual disability or physical illness. Delayed development of social and language skills may be a sign of inadequate parental stimulation and interaction. Emotionally abused children may be insecure, anxious, distrustful, superficial in interpersonal relationships, passive, and overly concerned with pleasing adults. Children who are spurned may have very low self-esteem. Children who are terrorized or threatened may seem fearful and withdrawn. The emotional effect on children usually becomes apparent at school age, when difficulties develop in forming relationships with teachers and peers. Often, emotional effects are appreciated only after the child has been placed in another environment or after aberrant behaviors abate and are replaced by more acceptable behaviors. Children who are exploited may commit crimes or develop a substance use disorder. Stunted growth and death resulting from starvation or exposure to extremes in temperature or weather may occur. Neglect that involves inadequate supervision may result in preventable illness or injury. Diagnosis of Child Maltreatment High index of suspicion (eg, for history that does not match physical findings or for atypical injury patterns) Supportive, open-ended questioning Sometimes imaging and laboratory tests Evaluation of injuries and nutritional deficiencies Overview of Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition.THE MANUAL. Recognizing maltreatment as the cause can be difficult, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained. Because of social biases, abuse is considered less often in children living in a 2-parent household with an at least median-level income. However, child abuse can occur regardless of family composition or socioeconomic status. Sometimes direct questions provide answers. Children who have been maltreated may describe the events and the perpetrator, but some children, particularly those who have been sexually abused, may be sworn to secrecy, threatened, or so traumatized that they are reluctant to speak about the abuse (and may even deny abuse when specifically questioned). A medical history including a history of the events should be obtained from children (if they are developmentally able to provide it) and their nonoffending caregivers in a relaxed environment. Open-ended questions (eg, “Can you tell me what happened?”) are particularly important in these cases because yes-or-no questions (eg, “Did daddy do this?”, “Did he touch you here?”) can easily sculpt an untrue history in young children. Examination includes observation of interactions between the child and the caregivers whenever possible. Documentation of the history and physical examination should be as comprehensive and accurate as possible, including recording of exact quotes from the history and photographs of injuries. Often it is unclear after the initial evaluation whether abuse occurred. In such cases, the mandatory reporting requirement of suspected abuse allows appropriate authorities and social agencies to investigate; if their evaluation confirms abuse, appropriate legal and social interventions can be done. Physical abuse  Both history and physical examination provide clues suggestive of maltreatment. Features suggestive of abuse in the history are Parental reluctance or inability to give the history of a significant injury History that is inconsistent with the injury (eg, bruises on the backs of the legs attributed to a forward fall) or apparent stage of resolution (eg, old injuries described as recent) History that varies depending on the information source or over time (it must be acknowledged that some discrepancies may be attributed to how the information was documented by the clinician) History of injury that is incompatible with the child’s stage of development (eg, injuries ascribed to rolling off a bed in an infant too young to roll over, or to a fall down stairs in an infant too young to crawl) Inappropriate response by the parents to the severity of the injury—either overly concerned or unconcerned Delay in seeking care for the injury Major indicators of abuse on examination are Atypical injuries incompatible with stated history Childhood injuries resulting from falls are typically solitary and occur on the forehead, chin, or mouth or extensor surfaces of the extremities, particularly elbows, knees, forearms, and shins. Bruises on the buttocks and the back of the legs are extremely rare from falls. Fractures, apart from clavicular fracture, tibial (toddler’s) fractures, and distal radius (Colles) fracture, are less common in typical falls during play or down stairs. No fractures are pathognomonic of abuse, but classic metaphyseal lesions, rib fractures (especially posterior and 1st rib), and depressed or multiple skull fractures (caused by allegedly minor trauma), scapular fractures, sternal fractures, and spinous processes fractures should raise concern for abuse. Physical abuse should be considered when an infant who is not walking or at least cruising (ie, walking with support of objects in the environment) has a serious injury. Young infants with seemingly minor injuries should also be further evaluated. The younger infant may appear to be normal despite significant brain trauma, and inflicted acute head trauma should be part of the differential diagnosis of every lethargic infant. Other hints are multiple injuries at different stages of resolution or development; cutaneous lesions with patterns suggestive of particular sources of injury ; and repeated injury, which is suggestive of abuse or inadequate supervision. A dilated eye examination and neuroimaging are recommended for all children < 1 year old with suspected abuse. Retinal hemorrhages occur in 85 to 90% of cases of abusive head trauma vs < 10% of cases of accidental head trauma. They also may result from childbirth and persist for 4 or more weeks. When retinal hemorrhages result from accidental trauma, the mechanism is usually obvious and life-threatening (eg, major motor vehicle crash), and the hemorrhages are typically few in number and confined to the posterior poles. Children < 36 months old (previous recommendation 24 months) with possible physical abuse should undergo a skeletal survey for evidence of previous bony injuries (fractures in various stages of healing or subperiosteal elevations in long bones). Surveys are rarely done on children > 3 years old.Congenital Syphilis Congenital syphilis is a multisystem infection caused by Treponema pallidum and transmitted to the fetus via the placenta. In inherited copper deficiency Inherited Copper Deficiency (Menkes Syndrome) Copper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body’s copper is bound to copper proteins. Copper deficiency may be acquired or inherited.Menkes syndrome), osteoporosis may lead to bone fractures. Sexual abuse . When a child has been sexually abused, behavioral changes (eg, irritability, fearfulness, insomnia) may be the only clues initially. If sexual abuse is suspected, the perioral and anal areas and the external genitals should be examined for evidence of injury. If the suspected abuse is thought to have occurred recently (≤ 96 hours), forensic evidence should be gathered using an appropriate kit and handled according to required legal standards  Sexual assault, including rape, may cause physical injury or illness or psychologic trauma. An examination involving use of a magnifying light source with a camera, such as with a specially equipped colposcope, may be helpful to the examiner as well as for documentation for legal purposes. Emotional abuse and neglect Evaluation focuses on general appearance and behavior to determine whether the child is failing to develop normally. Teachers and social workers are often the first to recognize neglect. The physician may notice a pattern of missed appointments and vaccinations that are not up-to-date. Medical neglect of life-threatening, chronic diseases, such as asthma or diabetes, can lead to a subsequent increase in office or emergency department visits and poor adherence with recommended treatment regimens. Treatment of Child Maltreatment Treatment of injuries Reporting to the appropriate agency Creation of a safety plan Family counseling and support Sometimes removal from the home Treatment first addresses urgent medical needs (including possible sexually transmitted infections) and the child’s immediate safety. Referral to a pediatrician specializing in child abuse should be considered. In both abuse and neglect situations, families should be approached in a helping rather than a punitive manner. Immediate safety Physicians and other professionals in contact with children (eg, nurses, teachers, day care workers, police) are mandated reporters who are required by law in all US states to report incidents of suspected abuse or neglect . Every state has its own laws. Members of the general public are encouraged, but not mandated, to report suspected abuse. Any person who makes a report of abuse based on reasonable cause and in good faith is immune from criminal and civil liability. A mandated reporter who fails to make a report can be subject to criminal and civil penalties. The reports are made to Child Protective Services or another appropriate child protection agency. In most situations, it is appropriate for professionals to tell caregivers that a report is being made pursuant to the law and that they will be contacted, interviewed, and likely visited at their home if the report is accepted. In some cases, the professional may determine that informing the parent or caregiver before police or other agency assistance is available creates greater risk of injury to the child and/or themselves. Under those circumstances, the professional may choose to delay informing the parent or caregiver. Representatives of child protective agencies and social workers conduct an evaluation of the events and the child's circumstances and can help the physician or other professional determine likelihood of subsequent harm and thus identify the best immediate disposition for the child. Options include Protective hospitalization Placement with relatives or in temporary housing (sometimes a whole family is moved out of an abusive partner’s home) Temporary foster care Going home with prompt social service and medical follow-up A malnourished child suspected to be a victim of neglect should be hospitalized and given nutrition in an age-appropriate fashion before any other supportive nutritional care is initiated (eg, gastrostomy tube). A child who begins to thrive while hospitalized is potent evidence of neglect (or poverty with lack of food). The physician plays an important role in working with community agencies to advocate for the best and safest disposition for the child. Healthcare professionals in the US are often asked to write an impact statement, which is a letter typically addressed to a Child Protective Services worker (who can then bring it to the attention of the judicial system), about a child who is suspected to be the victim of maltreatment. The letter should contain a clear explanation of the history and physical examination findings (in layperson's terms) and an opinion as to the likelihood that the child was maltreated. Follow-up A source of primary medical care is fundamental. However, the families of abused and neglected children frequently relocate, making continuity of care difficult. Broken appointments are common; outreach and home visits by social workers and/or public health nurses may be helpful. A local child advocacy center can help community agencies, health care practitioners, and the legal system work together as a multidisciplinary team in a more coordinated, child-friendly, and effective manner. A close review of the family setting, prior contacts with various community service agencies, and the caregivers’ needs is essential. A social worker can conduct such reviews and help with interviews and family counseling. Social workers also provide tangible assistance to the caregivers by helping them obtain public assistance, child care, and respite services (which can decrease stress for caregivers). They can also help to coordinate mental health services for caregivers. Periodic or ongoing social work contact usually is needed. Parent-aide programs, which employ trained nonprofessionals to support abusive and negligent parents and provide an example of appropriate parenting, are available in some communities. Other parent support groups also have been successful. Sexual abuse may have lasting effects on the child’s development and sexual adaptation, particularly among older children and adolescents. Counseling or psychotherapy for the child and the adults concerned may lessen these effects. Physical abuse, particularly significant head trauma, also can have long-lasting effects on development. If physicians or caregivers are concerned that young children have a disability or delayed development, they may request an evaluation from their state's Early Intervention system , which is a program to evaluate and treat children with suspected disabilities or developmental delays. Removal from the home Although emergency temporary removal from the home until evaluation is complete and safety is ensured is sometimes done, the ultimate goal of Child Protective Services is to keep children with their family in a safe, healthy environment. Often, families are offered services to rehabilitate the caregivers so that children who have been removed may be reunited with their family. If the previously described interventions do not ensure safety, consideration must be made for long-term removal and possibly termination of parental rights. This significant step requires a court petition, presented by the legal counsel of the appropriate welfare department. The specific procedure varies from US state to US state but usually entails family court testimony by a physician. When the court decides in favor of removing the child from the home, a disposition is arranged, typically to a temporary placement, such as foster care. While the child is in temporary placement, the child's own physician or a medical team that specializes in children in foster care should, if possible, maintain contact with the parents and ensure that adequate efforts are being made to help them. Occasionally, children are re-abused while in foster care. The physician should be alert to this possibility. As the dynamics of the family setting improve, the child may be able to return to the original caregivers. However, recurrences of maltreatment are common. Prevention of Child Maltreatment Prevention of maltreatment should be a part of every well-child office visit through education of parents, caregivers, and children and identification of risk factors. At-risk families should be referred to appropriate community services. Parents who were victims of maltreatment are at increased risk of abusing their own children. These parents sometimes verbalize anxiety about their abusive background and are amenable to assistance. First-time parents and teenage parents as well as parents with several children < 5 years of age are also at increased risk of abusing their children. Often, maternal risk factors for abuse are identified prenatally (eg, a mother who smokes, has a substance use disorder, has a history of domestic violence). Medical problems during pregnancy, delivery, or early infancy that may affect the health of the mother and/or the infant can weaken parent-infant bonding . During such times it is important to elicit the parents’ feelings about themselves and the infant’s well-being. How well can they tolerate an infant with many needs or health demands? Do the parents give moral and physical support to each other? Are there relatives or friends to help in times of need? The health care practitioner who is alert to clues and able to provide support can make a major impact on the family and possibly prevent child maltreatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Adherence is typically better with the patch or ring than with OCs. Spotting or breakthrough bleeding is uncommon when transdermal or ring contraception is used. Irregular bleeding becomes more common the longer women use transdermal or ring contraception. Transdermal contraceptives A 20-cm2 transdermal patch delivers 150 mcg of the progestin norelgestromin (the active metabolite of norgestimate) and 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily into the systemic circulation for 7 days. After 1 week, the patch is removed, and a new patch is applied to a different area of the skin. After 3 patches are used, no patch is used for the 4th week to allow for withdrawal bleeding. Hormone blood levels of estrogen and progestin are much more constant with the patch than with oral contraceptives (OCs). Overall, contraceptive efficacy, incidence of bleeding, and adverse effects with the patch are similar to those with OCs, but patient adherence may be better with the patch because it is applied weekly rather than taken daily.

Doctors can usually see or feel the cyst during a pelvic examination. Doctors may create a permanent opening so that the cyst can drain fluid to the outside, or they may surgically remove the cyst. Bartholin glands are very small, round glands that are located in the vulva (which consists of the labia and other tissues around the opening to the vagina). They may develop on either side of the vulva. Because they are located deep under the skin, they cannot normally be felt. These glands may help provide fluids for lubrication during sexual activity. If the duct to a Bartholin gland is blocked, the gland becomes filled with mucus and enlarges. The result is a cyst. These cysts develop in about 2% of women, usually those in their 20s. Cysts may become infected, forming an abscess (a closed-off area filled with pus). As women age, they are less likely to have cysts and abscesses. Typically, the cause of the blockage is unknown. Very rarely, cancer Vulvar Cancer Vulvar cancer usually develops in the labia, the tissue that surrounds the opening of the vagina. The cancer may appear to be a lump, an itchy area, or a sore that does not heal. What Is Bartholin Gland Cyst? The small glands on either side of the vaginal opening, called Bartholin glands, may become blocked. Fluids then accumulate, and the gland swells, forming a cyst. Cysts range from the size of a pea to that of a golf ball or larger. Most often, they occur only on one side. They may become infected, forming an abscess. Symptoms of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Most Bartholin cysts do not cause any symptoms. Women may notice a painless lump near the opening of the vagina, making the vulva look lopsided. If cysts become large, they can cause irritation and pressure and/or pain. They may interfere with sitting, walking, or sexual activity. If the cyst becomes infected (forming an abscess), it causes severe pain and sometimes fever. Abscesses are tender to the touch. The skin over them appears red. and The skin and the tissues under the skin over the abscess may become infected—an infection called cellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin and the tissues immediately beneath the skin. This infection is most often caused by streptococci or staphylococci. If cellulitis develops, the affected area appears red and is tender, Women may have a vaginal discharge. Diagnosis of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Examination of the vulva Sometimes a biopsy A woman should see a doctor in the following circumstances: The cyst continues to enlarge or persists after several days of immersing the area in hot water (in a tub or sitz bath). The cyst is painful (often indicating an abscess). A fever develops. The cyst interferes with walking or sitting. The woman is over 40. A doctor examines the vulva to diagnose a Bartholin gland cyst. Doctors can usually tell whether it is infected by its appearance. If a discharge is present, doctors may send a sample to be tested for other infections, including sexually transmitted infections. If an abscess has developed, doctors also culture fluid from the abscess. Although cancer very rarely develops in Bartholin glands, a doctor may remove a sample of the cyst to examine under a microscope (biopsy), especially if the woman is over 40. Treatment of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Soaking the area in warm water For abscesses, a procedure to drain them If a Bartholin gland cyst causes severe symptoms or occurs in women over 40, surgery Regardless of treatment, cysts sometimes recur. If they do, the entire Bartholin gland may be removed. Treatment of cysts in women under 40 If a Bartholin gland cyst causes little or no pain, women under 40 may be able to treat it themselves. They can use a sitz bath or soak in a few inches of warm water in a tub. Soaks should last 10 to 15 minutes and be done 2 times a day. Sometimes cysts disappear after a few days of such treatment. If the treatment is ineffective, women should see a doctor. In women under 40, cysts require treatment only if they cause symptoms. Draining a cyst is usually ineffective because cysts commonly recur. Thus, surgery may be done to make a permanent opening from the gland’s duct to the surface of the vulva. Then, if the cyst develops again, it can drain out. After a local anesthetic is injected to numb the site, one of the following procedures can be done: Placement of a catheter: A small incision is made in the cyst so that a small balloon-tipped tube (catheter) can be inserted into the cyst. Once in place, the balloon is inflated, and the catheter is left there for 4 to 6 weeks, so that a permanent opening can form. The catheter is inserted and removed in the doctor’s office. A woman can do her normal activities while the catheter is in place, although sexual activity may be uncomfortable. Marsupialization: Doctors make a small cut in the cyst and stitch the inside edges of the cyst to the surface of the vulva. Marsupialization creates a permanent opening in the cyst so that the cyst can drain as needed. This procedure is done in an operating room. Sometimes general anesthesia is needed. After these procedures, women may have a discharge for a few weeks. Usually, wearing panty liners is all that is needed. Taking sitz baths several times a day may help relieve any discomfort and help speed healing. If a cyst recurs, it may be surgically removed. Treatment of cysts in women aged 40 or older In women aged 40 or older, all Bartholin gland cysts must be treated, except for those that have been present for years and have not changed in appearance. Treatment involves Surgically removing the entire cyst Removing part of the cyst to test for cancer, then marsupializing the cyst Treatment of abscesses For an abscess, initial treatment involves making a small incision into the abscess and placing a catheter in it to drain it. If the abscess refills after being drained, marsupialization, which creates a permanent opening, may be done to prevent the abscess from refilling. Sometimes abscesses are also treated with antibiotics. If cellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin and the tissues immediately beneath the skin. A woman may need to be hospitalized, depending on how ill she is.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging (primarily CT). Initial treatment consists of ensuring a reliable airway and maintaining adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Surgery is often needed in patients with more severe injury to place monitors to track and treat intracranial pressure elevation, decompress the brain if intracranial pressure is increased, or remove intracranial hematomas. In the first few days after the injury, maintaining adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation and preventing complications of altered sensorium are important. Subsequently, many patients require rehabilitation. In the United States, as in much of the world, TBI is a common cause of death and disability. Causes of TBI include Falls in Older People A fall is defined as a person coming to rest on the ground or another lower level; sometimes a body part strikes against an object that breaks the fall.Motor vehicle crashes and other transportation-related causes (eg, bicycle crashes, collisions with pedestrians) Assaults Sports activities (eg, sports-related concussions Sports-Related Concussion Sports activities are a common cause of concussion, a form of mild traumatic brain injury.Pathology of Traumatic Brain Injury Structural changes from head injury may be gross or microscopic, depending on the mechanism and forces involved. Patients with less severe injuries may have no gross structural damage. Clinical manifestations vary markedly in severity and consequences. Injuries are commonly categorized as open or closed. Open head injuries involve penetration of the scalp and skull (and usually the meninges and underlying brain tissue). They typically involve bullets or sharp objects, but a skull fracture with overlying laceration due to severe blunt force is also considered an open injury. Closed head injuries typically occur when the head is struck, strikes an object, or is shaken violently, causing rapid brain acceleration and deceleration. Acceleration or deceleration can injure tissue at the point of impact (coup), at its opposite pole (contrecoup), or diffusely; the frontal and temporal lobes are particularly vulnerable to this type of injury. Axons, blood vessels, or both can be sheared or torn, resulting in diffuse axonal injury Diffuse axonal injury Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Disrupted blood vessels leak, causing contusions, intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and epidural or subdural hematomas . Table Concussion . Gross structural brain lesions and serious neurologic residua are not part of concussion, although temporary disability can result from symptoms (such as nausea, headache, dizziness, memory disturbance, and difficulty concentrating [postconcussion syndrome]), which usually resolve within weeks. However, it is thought that multiple concussions may lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disorder that may occur after repetitive head trauma or blast injuries. Brain contusions (bruises of the brain) can occur with open or closed injuries and can impair a wide range of brain functions, depending on contusion size and location. Larger contusions may cause brain edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Contusions may enlarge in the hours and days following the initial injury and cause neurologic deterioration; surgery may be required. Diffuse axonal injury Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) occurs when rotational deceleration causes shear-type forces that result in generalized, widespread disruption of axonal fibers and myelin sheaths. A few DAI lesions may also result from minor head injury. Gross structural lesions are not part of DAI, but small petechial hemorrhages in the white matter are often observed on CT (although MRI may be more sensitive) and on histopathologic examination. DAI is sometimes defined clinically as a loss of consciousness lasting > 6 hours in the absence of a specific focal lesion. Edema from the injury often increases ICP, leading to various manifestations Pathophysiology Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. DAI is typically the underlying injury in shaken baby syndrome. Hematomas (collections of blood in or around the brain) can occur with open or closed injuries and may be Epidural Intracerebral (intraparenchymal) Subdural Subarachnoid hemorrhage Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Subarachnoid hemorrhage is sudden bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The most common cause of spontaneous bleeding is a ruptured aneurysm.SAH—bleeding into the subarachnoid space) is common in traumatic brain injury (TBI), although the appearance on CT is not usually the same as aneurysmal SAH. Blood from SAH secondary to TBI does not collect in a discrete hematoma. Subdural hematomas are collections of blood between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. Acute subdural hematomas arise from laceration of cortical veins or avulsion of bridging veins between the cortex and dural sinuses. Acute subdural hematomas often occur in patients with Head trauma caused by falls or motor vehicle crashes Underlying cerebral contusions A contralateral epidural hematoma Compression of the brain by the hematoma and swelling of the brain due to edema or hyperemia (increased blood flow due to engorged blood vessels) can increase ICP. When both compression and swelling occur, mortality and morbidity can be high. A chronic subdural hematoma may appear and cause symptoms gradually over several weeks after trauma. Chronic subdural hematomas occur more often in patients with alcohol use disorder and older patients (especially in those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications or in those with brain atrophy). Older patients may consider the head injury relatively trivial or may have even forgotten it. In contrast to acute subdural hematomas, edema and increased ICP are unusual. Epidural hematomas are collections of blood between the skull and dura mater and are less common than subdural hematomas. Epidural hematomas that are large or rapidly expanding are usually caused by arterial bleeding, classically due to damage to the middle meningeal artery by a temporal bone fracture. Without intervention, patients with arterial epidural hematomas may rapidly deteriorate and die. Small, venous epidural hematomas are rarely lethal. Intracerebral hematomas are collections of blood within the brain itself. In the traumatic setting, they result from coalescence of contusions. Exactly when one or more contusions become a hematoma is not well-defined. Increased ICP, herniation Brain Herniation Brain herniation occurs when increased intracranial pressure causes the abnormal protrusion of brain tissue through openings in rigid intracranial barriers (eg, tentorial notch). Skull fractures Penetrating injuries by definition involve fractures. Closed injuries may also cause skull fractures, which may be linear, depressed, or comminuted. The presence of a fracture suggests that significant force was involved in the injury. Most patients with simple linear fractures and no neurologic impairment are not at high risk of brain injuries, but patients with any fracture associated with neurologic impairment are at increased risk of intracranial hematomas. Skull fractures that involve special risks include Depressed fractures: These fractures have the highest risk of tearing the dura, damaging the underlying brain, or both. Frontal bone fractures: These fractures have a risk of frontal sinus violation, which may lead to higher risks of long-term mucocele and meningitis development due to an unrecognized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula. Temporal bone fractures that cross the area of the middle meningeal artery: In these fractures, an epidural hematoma is a risk. Fractures that cross one of the major dural sinuses: These fractures may cause significant hemorrhage and venous epidural or venous subdural hematoma. Injured venous sinuses can later thrombose and cause cerebral infarction. Fractures of the occipital bone and base of the skull (basilar bones): These bones are thick and strong, so fractures in these areas indicate a high-intensity impact and meaningfully increase risk of brain injury (eg, cerebral contusions and hematomas). Basilar skull fractures that extend into the petrous part of the temporal bone often damage middle and inner ear structures and can impair facial, acoustic, and vestibular nerve function. Basilar skull fractures may also lacerate the dura and cause CSF leakage into the ear, nose, or throat. Fractures that involve the carotid canal: These fractures can result in carotid artery dissection. Fractures in infants: The meninges may become trapped in a linear skull fracture of the parietal bone with subsequent development of a leptomeningeal cyst and expansion of the original fracture (growing fracture). Pathophysiology of Traumatic Brain Injury Brain function may be immediately impaired by direct damage (eg, crush, laceration) of brain tissue. Further damage may occur shortly thereafter from the cascade of events triggered by the initial injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any sort can cause cerebral edema and decrease brain blood flow. The cranial vault is fixed in size (constrained by the skull) and filled by noncompressible CSF and minimally compressible brain tissue; consequently, any swelling from edema or an intracranial hematoma has nowhere to expand and thus increases intracranial pressure (ICP). Cerebral blood flow is proportional to the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and mean ICP. Thus, as ICP increases (or MAP decreases), CPP decreases. When CPP falls below 50 mm Hg, the brain may become ischemic. Ischemia and edema may trigger various secondary mechanisms of injury (eg, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, intracellular calcium, free radicals, and cytokines), causing further cell damage, further edema, and further increases in ICP. Systemic complications from trauma (eg, hypotension, hypoxia) can also contribute to cerebral ischemia and are often called secondary brain insults. If excessive ICP is unrelieved, it can push brain tissue across the tentorium or through the foramen magnum, causing herniation Brain Herniation Brain herniation occurs when increased intracranial pressure causes the abnormal protrusion of brain tissue through openings in rigid intracranial barriers (eg, tentorial notch). If ICP increases to equal MAP, CPP becomes zero, resulting in complete brain ischemia and brain death Brain Death Brain death is loss of function of the entire cerebrum and brain stem, resulting in coma, no spontaneous respiration, and loss of all brain stem reflexes. Excessive ICP can also cause short-term and long-term autonomic dysfunction that can result in significant hemodynamic disturbances that are particularly dangerous in patients with polytrauma and other internal organ injuries, fluid depletion, electrolyte imbalance, coagulopathy, hypotension, and anemia from acute blood loss. Injury to the hypothalamus, subfornical organ, and nucleus tractus solitarius, which regulate the overall sympathetic tone, blood flow circulation, and baroreflex response, can lead to profound changes in cardiac and renal function. Hypothalamic dysfunction affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing hemodynamic instability, hypertension, and tachycardia from a sympathetic \"storm\" that upregulates cardiac contractility and induces fluid retention in the kidney.AKI) and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (sometimes termed neurogenic stress myocardium or stunned cardiomyopathy Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy is myocardial dysfunction causing heart failure in which ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction predominate. These systemic changes can significantly increase inpatient mortality during the first few weeks after injury in fragile and susceptible polytrauma patients if unrecognized or undertreated outside an intensive care setting. Hyperemia and increased brain blood flow may result from concussive injury in adolescents or children. Second impact syndrome is a rare and debated entity defined by sudden increased ICP and sometimes death after a second traumatic insult that is sustained before complete recovery from a previous minor head injury. It is attributed to loss of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow that leads to vascular engorgement, increased ICP, and herniation. Symptoms and Signs of Traumatic Brain Injury Initially, most patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) lose consciousness (usually for seconds or minutes), although some patients with minor injuries have only confusion or amnesia (amnesia is usually retrograde, which means memory loss of a period of seconds to a few hours before the injury). Young children may simply become irritable. Some patients have seizures, often within the first hour or day. After these initial symptoms, patients may be fully awake and alert, or consciousness and function may be altered to some degree, from mild confusion to stupor to coma Overview of Coma and Impaired Consciousness Coma is unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused and in which the patient's eyes remain closed. Duration of unconsciousness and severity of obtundation are roughly proportional to injury severity but are not specific. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS—see table ) is a quick, reproducible scoring system to be used during the initial examination to estimate severity of TBI. It is based on eye opening, verbal response, and the best motor response. The lowest total score (3) indicates likely fatal damage, especially if both pupils fail to respond to light and oculovestibular responses are absent. Higher initial scores tend to predict better recovery. By convention, the severity of head injury is initially defined by the GCS: 13 to 15 is mild TBI 9 to 12 is moderate TBI 3 to 8 is severe TBI Table Prediction of the severity of TBI and prognosis can be refined by also considering CT findings and other factors. Some patients with initially moderate TBI and a few patients with initially mild TBI deteriorate. For infants and young children, the Modified Glasgow Coma Scale for Infants and Children is used . Similarly, sedatives and paralytics can decrease GCS values and should be avoided before full neurologic examination is done. Pearls & Pitfalls Delay use of sedative and paralytic medications until after full neurologic examination whenever possible. Table Symptoms of specific types of TBI Symptoms of various types of TBI may overlap considerably. Epidural hematoma symptoms usually develop within minutes to several hours after the injury (the period without symptoms is the so-called lucid interval) and consist of Increasing headache Decreased level of consciousness Focal neurologic deficits (eg, hemiparesis) Pupillary dilation with loss of light reactivity in such patients usually indicates herniation. Some patients who have an epidural hematoma lose consciousness, then have a transient lucid interval, and then gradual neurologic deterioration. Acute subdural hematomas are usually associated with alterations in orientation, level of arousal, and/or cognition. They are commonly associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) even when small due to underlying cerebral contusions and edema. Symptoms include Headache Seizures Hemiparesis Symptoms of increased ICP Symptoms of specific types of TBI Pupillary asymmetry, abnormal brain stem reflexes, and coma from brain stem compression due to uncal herniation Intracerebral hematomas and contusions can cause focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, progressive decrease in consciousness, or both. Progressive decrease in consciousness may result from anything that increases intracranial pressure, or ICP (eg, hematoma, edema, hyperemia). Autonomic dysfunction from injury to the hypothalamus and other vital subcortical structures can cause Sympathetic hyperactivity with hypertension and tachycardia Neurogenic (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy with ischemic changes and decreased cardiac function Acute kidney injury with deterioration of renal function Increased ICP sometimes causes vomiting, but vomiting is nonspecific. Markedly increased ICP classically manifests as a combination of the following (called the Cushing triad): Hypertension (usually with increased pulse pressure) Bradycardia Respiratory depression Respirations are usually slow and irregular. Severe diffuse brain injury or markedly increased ICP may cause decorticate or decerebrate posturing. Both are poor prognostic signs. Transtentorial herniation Transtentorial herniation Brain herniation occurs when increased intracranial pressure causes the abnormal protrusion of brain tissue through openings in rigid intracranial barriers (eg, tentorial notch)Cushing triad. Basilar skull fracture may result in the following: Leakage of CSF from the nose or throat (CSF rhinorrhea) or into the middle ear (CSF otorrhea) Blood behind the tympanic membrane (hemotympanum) or in the external ear canal if the tympanic membrane has ruptured Ecchymosis behind the ear (Battle sign) or in the periorbital area (raccoon eyes) Loss of smell and hearing, which is usually immediate, although these losses will not be noticed until the patient regains consciousness Facial nerve function may be impaired immediately or after a delay. Other fractures of the cranial vault are sometimes palpable, particularly through a scalp laceration, as a depression or step-off deformity. However, blood under the galea aponeurotica may mimic a step-off deformity. Chronic subdural hematoma may manifest with increasing daily headache, fluctuating drowsiness or confusion (which may mimic early dementia), mild-to-moderate hemiparesis or other focal neurologic deficits, and/or seizures. Long-term symptoms Amnesia may persist and be both retrograde and anterograde (ie, for events following the injury). Postconcussion syndrome, which commonly follows a moderate or severe concussion, includes persistent headache, dizziness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, variable amnesia, depression, apathy, and anxiety. Commonly smell (and thus taste), sometimes hearing, or rarely vision is altered or lost. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously over weeks to months. A range of cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits can persist after severe, moderate, and even mild TBI, particularly if structural damage was significant. Common problems include Amnesia Behavioral changes (eg, agitation, impulsivity, disinhibition, lack of motivation) Emotional lability Sleep disturbances Decreased intellectual function Late seizures (> 7 days after the injury) develop in a small percentage of patients, often weeks, months, or even years later. Spastic motor impairment, gait and balance disturbances, ataxia, and sensory losses may occur.TBI that destroys forebrain cognitive functions but spares the brain stem. The capacity for self-awareness and other mental activity is generally absent; however, autonomic and motor reflexes are preserved, and sleep-wake cycles are normal. Few patients recover normal neurologic function when a persistent vegetative state lasts for 3 months after injury, and almost none recover after 6 months. Neurologic function may continue to improve for a few years after TBI, most rapidly during the initial 6 months. Diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury Initial rapid trauma assessment Glasgow coma scale and neurologic examination CT (For an example of how to triage, diagnose, and treat head injuries in a system in which CT and specialty trauma care are used more selectively than in the United States, see the practice guideline of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom, Head injury: triage, assessment, investigation and early management of head injury in children, young people and adults , published in 2014 and last updated in 2019.) Initial measures An initial overall assessment of injuries should be done  In the US, there were 278,345 trauma deaths in 2020, about 70% of which were accidental. Airway adequacy and breathing are assessed. Diagnosis and treatment of TBI occur simultaneously in seriously injured patients. A rapid, focused neurologic evaluation Introduction to the Neurologic Examination The neurologic examination begins with careful observation of the patient entering the examination area and continues during history taking.Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and pupillary light response. Patients are ideally assessed before paralytics and sedatives are given. Patients are reassessed at frequent intervals (eg, every 15 to 30 minutes initially, then every 1 hour after stabilization). Subsequent improvement or deterioration helps estimate injury severity and prognosis. Complete clinical evaluation Complete neurologic examination is done as soon as the patient is sufficiently stable. Infants and children should be examined carefully for retinal hemorrhages, which may indicate shaken baby syndrome. Funduscopic examination in adults may disclose traumatic retinal detachment and/or absence of retinal venous pulsations due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), but examination may be normal despite brain injury. Concussion is diagnosed when loss of consciousness or memory lasts < 6 hours and symptoms are not explained by brain injury seen on neuroimaging. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is suspected when loss of consciousness exceeds 6 hours and microhemorrhages are seen on CT or MRI. Diagnosis of other types of TBI is made by CT or MRI. Neuroimaging Imaging should always be done in patients with more than transiently impaired consciousness, GCS score < 15, focal neurologic findings, persistent vomiting, seizures, a history of loss of consciousness, or clinically suspected fractures. A case can be made for obtaining a CT Computed Tomography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle disease.CT in younger patients. Noncontrast Head CT Scans Subdural Hematoma This CT scan shows a crescent-shaped opacity overlying brain tissue, characteristic of a subdural hematoma. There is also mass effect, with ventricular compression and midline shift. Cavallini James/BSIP/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Subdural Hemorrhage (CT) Classic crescent-shaped hyperdensity extending across suture lines. © 2017 Elliot K. Fishman, MD. Epidural Hemorrhage (Coronal CT) Classic lentiform (lens)-shaped hyperdensity that does not extend across suture lines. Epidural Hemorrhage (Axial CT) Classic lentiform (lens)-shaped hyperdensity that does not extend across suture lines. Epidural Hematoma CT scan shows an epidural hematoma (opacity at bottom right). Cavallini James/BSIP/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Although plain x-rays can detect some skull fractures, they cannot help assess the brain and they delay more definitive brain imaging; thus, plain x-rays are usually not done. CT is the best choice for initial imaging because it can detect hematomas, contusions, skull fractures (thin cuts are obtained to reveal clinically suspected basilar skull fractures, which may otherwise not be visible), and sometimes diffuse axonal injury. CT can show the following: Contusions and acute bleeding appear opaque (dense) compared with brain tissue. Arterial epidural hematomas classically appear as lenticular-shaped opacities over brain tissue, often in the territory of the middle meningeal artery. Subdural hematomas classically appear as crescent-shaped opacities overlying brain tissue. A chronic subdural hematoma appears hypodense compared with brain tissue, whereas a subacute subdural hematoma may have a similar radiopacity as brain tissue (isodense). Isodense subdural hematoma, particularly if bilateral and symmetric, may appear only subtly abnormal. In patients with severe anemia, an acute subdural hematoma may appear isodense with brain tissue. Among individual patients, findings may differ from these classic appearances. Signs of mass effect include sulcal effacement, ventricular and cisternal compression, and midline shift. Absence of these findings does not exclude increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and mass effect may be present with normal ICP. A shift of > 5 mm from the midline is generally considered to be an indication for surgical evacuation of the hematoma. Pearls & Pitfalls Consider chronic subdural hematoma in patients who have unexplained mental status changes and risk factors, including older patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications or who have brain atrophy and people with alcohol use disorder, even if there is no history of trauma and even if brain imaging at first shows no obvious abnormalities. MRI may be useful later in the clinical course to detect more subtle contusions, diffuse axonal injury, and brain stem injury. MRI is usually more sensitive than CT for the diagnosis of very small acute or isodense subacute and isodense chronic subdural hematomas. Preliminary, unconfirmed evidence suggests that certain MRI findings predict prognosis. Angiography is sometimes called conventional angiography to distinguish it from CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)CT angiography CT angiography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle disease.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Neurologic Disorders are all useful for the evaluation of vascular injury. For example, vascular injury is suspected when CT findings are inconsistent with the physical examination findings (eg, hemiparesis with a normal or nondiagnostic CT due to suspected evolving ischemia secondary to vascular thrombosis or embolism due to a carotid artery dissection). Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury For mild injuries, discharge and home observation For moderate and severe injuries, optimization of ventilation, oxygenation, and brain perfusion; treatment of complications (eg, increased intracranial pressure [ICP], seizures, hematomas); and rehabilitation Multiple noncranial injuries, which are likely with motor vehicle crashes and falls, often require simultaneous treatment. Initial resuscitation of trauma patients is discussed elsewhere  In the US, there were 278,345 trauma deaths in 2020, about 70% of which were accidental. At the injury scene, a clear airway is secured and external bleeding is controlled before the patient is moved. Particular care is taken to avoid displacement of the spine or other bones to protect the spinal cord and blood vessels. Proper immobilization should be maintained with a cervical collar and long spine board until stability of the entire spine has been established by appropriate examination and imaging  Occasionally, the spinal nerves are affected. The anatomy of the spinal column is reviewed elsewhere. After the initial rapid neurologic assessment, pain should be relieved with a short-acting opioid (eg, fentanyl). In the hospital, after quick initial evaluation, neurologic findings (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] and pupillary reaction), blood pressure (BP), pulse, and temperature should be recorded frequently for several hours because any deterioration demands prompt attention. Serial GCS and CT results stratify injury severity, which helps guide treatment . Table The cornerstone of management for all patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is Maintenance of adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and brain perfusion to avoid secondary brain insult Aggressive early management of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypotension, and increased ICP helps avoid secondary complications. Bleeding from injuries (external and internal) is rapidly controlled, and intravascular volume is promptly replaced with crystalloid (eg, 0. Hypotonic fluids (especially 5% D/W) are contraindicated because they contain excess free water, which can increase brain edema and ICP. Other complications to check for and to prevent include hyperthermia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and fluid imbalance. Mild injury If patients with mild injury did not lose consciousness or lost it only briefly and have stable vital signs, a normal head CT scan, and normal mental and neurologic function (including resolution of any intoxication), they may be discharged home provided family members or friends can observe them closely for an additional 24 hours. These observers are instructed to return patients to the hospital if any of the following develop: Decreased level of consciousness Focal neurologic deficits Worsening headache Vomiting Deterioration of mental function (eg, seems confused, cannot recognize people, behaves abnormally) Seizures Patients who had lost consciousness or have any abnormalities in mental or neurologic function and cannot be observed closely after discharge are generally observed in the emergency department or overnight in the hospital, and follow-up CT may be done in 8 to 12 hours if symptoms persist. Patients who have no neurologic changes but have minor abnormalities on head CT (eg, small contusions, small subdural hematomas with no mass effect, punctate or small traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage) may need only a follow-up CT within 24 hours. If CT is stable and neurologic examination results are normal, these patients may be discharged home. Moderate and severe injury  Patients with moderate injury often do not require intubation and mechanical ventilation (unless other injuries are present) or ICP monitoring. However, because deterioration is possible, these patients should be admitted and observed even if head CT is normal. Patients with severe injury are admitted to a critical care unit.ICP. Basing management of patients with severe TBI on information from ICP monitoring is recommended to reduce in-hospital and 2-week postinjury mortality (1, 2 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function.Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring has also been recommended as part of management because evidence suggests that it may help decrease 2-week postinjury mortality (4 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Nevertheless, close monitoring using the GCS and pupillary response should continue, and CT is repeated, particularly if there is an unexplained ICP rise. Nasotracheal intubation can cause coughing and gagging and thereby raise the ICP. Medications are used to minimize the ICP increase when the airway is manipulated—eg, lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV 1 to 2 minutes before giving a paralytic. Etomidate is an excellent induction agent because it has minimal effects on BP; IV dose in adults is 0.3 mg/kg (or 20 mg for an average-sized adult) and in children is 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg. An alternative, if hypotension is absent and unlikely, is propofol 0.2 to 1.5 mg/kg IV. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV is typically used as a paralytic. Adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation should be assessed using pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases (if possible, end-tidal CO2). The goal is a normal PaCO2 level (38 to 42 mm Hg). Prophylactic hyperventilation (PaCO2 25 to 35 mm Hg) is no longer recommended. The lower PaCO2 reduces ICP by causing cerebral vasoconstriction, but this vasoconstriction also decreases cerebral perfusion, thus potentiating ischemia. Therefore, hyperventilation (target PaCO2 of 30 to 35 mm Hg) is used only during the first several hours and for ICP that is unresponsive to other measures. ICP monitoring Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.CPP monitoring and control, when used, are recommended for patients with severe TBI who cannot follow simple commands, especially those with an abnormal head CT. The goal is to maintain ICP at < 25 (sometimes a cutoff of 20) mm Hg and CPP as close as possible to 60 mm Hg. Cerebral venous drainage can be enhanced (thus lowering ICP) by elevating the head of the bed to 30° and by keeping the patient’s head in a midline position. If needed, a ventricular catheter can be inserted to drain CSF and thus lower the ICP. A multicenter study found no difference in TBI recovery with ICP treatment directed by an ICP monitor versus care directed by clinical and CT findings (3 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. However, interpretation of these findings is controversial, in part because care was provided in settings that differ from those in the United States, limiting extrapolation of results. Sedation can be used to prevent agitation, excessive muscular activity (eg, due to delirium), and help mitigate response to pain and thus help prevent increases in ICP. For sedation, propofol is often used in adults (contraindicated in children) because it has quick onset and very brief duration of action; dose is 0.3 mg/kg/h continuous IV infusion, titrated gradually upward as needed (up to 3 mg/kg/h). An initial bolus is not used. The most common adverse effect is hypotension. Prolonged use at high doses can cause pancreatitis. Benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam, lorazepam) can also be used for sedation, but they are not as rapidly acting as propofol and individual dose-response can be hard to predict. Antipsychotics can delay recovery and should be avoided if possible. Rarely, paralytics may be needed; if so, adequate sedation must be ensured. Adequate pain control often requires opioids. Maintaining euvolemia and normal serum osmolality (iso-osmolar or slightly hyperosmolar; target serum osmolality 295 to 320 mOsm/kg [295 to 320 mmol/kg]) is important. To control ICP, hypertonic saline solution (3% or 23.4%) is a more effective osmotic agent than mannitol. It is given as a bolus of 2 to 3 mL/kg IV as needed or as a continuous infusion of 1 mL/kg/h. Serum sodium level is monitored and kept ≤ 155 mEq/L (155 mmol/L). Osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol) given IV are an alternative to lower ICP and maintain serum osmolality. However, they should be reserved for patients whose condition is deteriorating or used preoperatively for patients with hematomas. Mannitol 20% solution is given 0.5 to 1 g/kg IV (2.5 to 5 mL/kg) over 15 to 30 minutes and repeated in a dose ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg (1.25 to 2.5 mL/kg) given as often as needed (usually every 6 to 8 hours); it lowers ICP for a few hours. Mannitol must be used cautiously in patients with severe coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal insufficiency, or pulmonary vascular congestion because mannitol rapidly expands intravascular volume. Because osmotic diuretics increase renal excretion of water relative to sodium, prolonged use of mannitol may also result in water depletion and hypernatremia. Furosemide 1 mg/kg IV is also helpful to decrease total body water, particularly when the transient hypervolemia associated with mannitol is to be avoided. Fluid and electrolyte balance should be monitored closely while osmotic diuretics are used. Decompressive craniectomy can be considered when increased ICP is refractory to other interventions and sometimes as a primary measure (eg, at the time of surgery to drain a significant hematoma). For craniectomy, a significant portion of the skull is removed en bloc (to be replaced later), and duraplasty is done to allow outward brain swelling. The amount and location of bone removal depends on the injury, but the opening must be sufficient to keep the swelling from compressing brain tissue against the margins of the defect. In a randomized trial comparing craniectomy and medical management, overall mortality at 6 months was reduced after craniectomy, but rates of severe disability and vegetative state were higher, and rate of good functional recovery was similar (5 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Pentobarbital coma is a more involved and currently less popular option for intractable increased ICP. Coma is induced by giving pentobarbital 10 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes, 5 mg/kg/h for 3 hours, then 1 to 2 mg/kg/h maintenance infusion. The dose may be adjusted to suppress bursts of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, which is continuously monitored. Hypotension is common and managed by giving fluids and, if necessary, vasopressors. Therapeutic systemic hypothermia has not proved helpful. High-dose corticosteroids had previously been advocated to decrease cerebral edema and ICP. However, corticosteroids are not useful to control ICP and are not recommended. In a large randomized, placebo-controlled study, corticosteroids given within 8 hours of TBI increased mortality and severe disability in survivors (6 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. A variety of neuroprotective agents have been and are being studied, but thus far, none has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials. Seizures Seizure Disorders A seizure is an abnormal, unregulated electrical discharge that occurs within the brain’s cortical gray matter and transiently interrupts normal brain function.ICP and therefore should be treated promptly. In patients with significant structural injury (eg, larger contusions or hematomas, brain laceration, depressed skull fracture) or a GCS score < 10, a prophylactic anticonvulsant should be considered. If phenytoin is used, a loading dose of 20 mg/kg IV is given (at a maximum rate of 50 mg/min to prevent cardiovascular adverse effects such as hypotension and bradycardia). The starting maintenance IV dose for adults is 2 to 2.7 mg/kg three times a day; children require higher doses (up to 5 mg/kg twice a day for children < 4 years). Serum levels should be measured to adjust the dose. Duration of treatment depends on the type of injury and EEG results. If no seizures develop within 1 week, anticonvulsants should be stopped because their value in preventing future seizures is not established. Newer anticonvulsants are under study. Fosphenytoin, a form of phenytoin that has better water solubility, is being used in some patients without central venous access because it decreases the risk of thrombophlebitis when given through a peripheral IV. Dosing is the same as for phenytoin. Levetiracetam is used increasingly, particularly in patients with liver disorders. Skull fractures Aligned closed fractures require no specific treatment. Depressed fractures sometimes require surgery to elevate fragments, manage lacerated cortical vessels, repair dura mater, and debride injured brain. Open fractures may require surgical debridement unless there is no CSF leak and the fracture is not depressed by greater than the thickness of the skull. Frontal bone fractures are repaired, especially if there is significant anterior and posterior table displacement (for cosmetic reasons) or CSF leakage into the nose from an underlying dural laceration. Use of antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial because of limited data on its efficacy and the concern that it promotes drug-resistant strains. Surgery Intracranial hematomas may require urgent surgical evacuation to prevent or treat brain shift, compression, and herniation; hence, early neurosurgical consultation is mandatory. However, not all hematomas require surgical removal. Small intracerebral hematomas rarely require surgery. Patients with small subdural hematomas can often be treated without surgery. Factors that suggest a need for emergent surgery include Midline brain shift of > 5 mm Compression of the basal cisterns Worsening neurologic examination findings Chronic subdural hematomas may require surgical drainage but much less urgently than acute subdural hematomas. Large or arterial epidural hematomas are treated surgically, but small epidural hematomas that are thought to be venous in origin can be followed with serial CT. Other critical care issues in TBI Anemia Etiology of Anemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs), which leads to a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin content. TBI. However, blood transfusions may result in significantly more complications and higher mortality; thus, the threshold for transfusion in patients with TBI should be high—the same as that for other intensive-care patients. Hyperglycemia predicts increased risk of increased ICP, impaired cerebral metabolism, urinary tract infection, and bacteremia; thus, careful glycemic control has been attempted in patients with a TBI. However, in a randomized controlled trial comparing intensive regimens (to maintain glucose < 80 to 120 mg/dL [4.4 to 6.7 mmol/L]) with traditional regimens (to maintain glucose < 220 mg/dL [12.2 mmol/L]), GCS scores were the same at 6 months, but incidence of hypoglycemic episodes was higher with the intensive regimen (7 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Various degrees of hypothermia have been advocated to improve neurologic recovery by improving neuroprotection and decreasing ICP in the acute period after TBI. However, multiple randomized controlled trials have shown that early (within 2.5 hours), short-term (48 hours postinjury) prophylactic hypothermia does not improve outcomes in patients with severe TBI compared with standard medical treatment, and it increases the risk of coagulopathy and cardiovascular instability (8, 9 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Calcium channel blockers have been used in an attempt to prevent cerebral vasospasm after TBI, to maintain blood flow to the brain, and thereby to prevent further damage. However, a review of randomized controlled trials of calcium channel blockers in patients with acute TBI and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage concluded that their effectiveness remains uncertain (10 Treatment references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Rehabilitation When neurologic deficits persist, rehabilitation is needed. Rehabilitation after brain injury Brain injury Rehabilitation aims to facilitate recovery from loss of function. . Brain injury support groups may provide assistance to the families of brain-injured patients. For patients whose coma exceeds 24 hours, 50% of whom have severe persistent neurologic sequelae, a prolonged period of rehabilitation, particularly in cognitive and emotional areas, is often required. Rehabilitation services should be planned early. Prognosis for Traumatic Brain Injury In the United States, adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) who are treated have a mortality rate of about 25 to 33%. Mortality is lower when Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) scores are higher. Mortality rates are lower in children ≥ 5 years (≤ 10% in those with a GCS score of 5 to 7). Children overall do better than adults with a comparable injury. The vast majority of patients with mild TBI retain good neurologic function. With moderate or severe TBI, the prognosis is not as good but is much better than is generally believed. The most commonly used scale to assess outcome in TBI patients is the Glasgow Outcome Scale. On this scale, the possible outcomes are Good recovery (return to previous level of function) Moderate disability (capable of self-care) Severe disability (incapable of self-care) Vegetative (no cognitive function) Death Other prognostic grading systems based on CT findings, such as the Marshall classification system and the more recently developed Rotterdam CT score, can also be used to estimate long-term survival (1, 2 Prognosis references Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Over 50% of adults with severe TBI have a good recovery or only moderate disability. Occurrence and duration of coma after a TBI are strong predictors of disability. Of patients whose coma exceeds 24 hours, 50% have severe persistent neurologic sequelae, and up to 6% remain in a persistent vegetative state at 6 months. In adults with severe TBI, recovery occurs most rapidly within the initial 6 months. Smaller improvements continue for perhaps as long as several years. Children have a better immediate recovery from TBI regardless of severity and continue to improve for a longer period of time. Cognitive deficits, with impaired concentration, attention, and memory, and various personality changes are a more common cause of disability in social relations and employment than are focal motor or sensory impairments. Posttraumatic anosmia and acute traumatic blindness seldom resolve after 3 to 4 months. Hemiparesis and aphasia usually resolve at least partially, except in older patients. Key Points TBI can cause a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, sometimes even in the absence of detectable structural brain damage on imaging studies. Follow initial assessment (trauma assessment and stabilization, GCS scoring, rapid and focused neurologic examination) with a more detailed neurologic examination when the patient is stable. Obtain neuroimaging (usually CT) acutely if patients have more than transiently impaired consciousness, GCS score < 15, focal neurologic findings, persistent vomiting, seizures, a history of loss of consciousness, clinically suspected fractures, or possibly other findings. Discharge most patients home if TBI is mild; they can be observed at home if neuroimaging is normal or not indicated and neurologic examination is normal. Admit patients with severe TBI to a critical care unit, and to avoid secondary brain insult, treat them aggressively to maintain adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and brain perfusion. Treat increased ICP usually with rapid sequence intubation, ICP monitoring, sedation, maintenance of euvolemia and normal serum osmolality, and sometimes surgical interventions (eg, CSF drainage, decompressive craniotomy). Treat some lesions surgically (eg, large or arterial epidural hematomas, intracranial hematomas with midline brain shift of > 5 mm, compression of the basal cisterns, worsening neurologic examination findings).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment. Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine (in beverages and foods), and smoking. Other arrhythmias are dangerous or bothersome enough to need treatment. Cardioversion-defibrillation is one type of treatment. Other treatments for arrhythmias include insertion of a pacemaker Artificial Pacemakers There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Cardioversion-defibrillation involves giving an electrical shock to the heart. Sometimes this shock can stop a fast arrhythmia and restore normal rhythm. The shock briefly stops the heart from beating and, after a second or two, it starts beating again on its own. Often, it starts back in a normal rhythm but sometimes the arrhythmia starts again. However, electrical shocks cannot restart a heart that has no electrical activity at all (asystole). Giving the heart such an electrical shock is called cardioversion, or defibrillation, depending on the type of abnormal rhythm for which it is used. Cardioversion is giving an electrical shock timed (synchronized) to a specific part of the heart beat. During ventricular fibrillation, there is no organized electrical activity in the heart to which the shock can be timed. The machine that delivers the shock is called a defibrillator, even though it is used for both defibrillation and cardioversion. Defibrillators can be used by a team of doctors and nurses, by paramedics, or by firefighters.

If so, the person may be at a high risk of having the cancer recur and may need chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to prevent a recurrence.

Relative contraindications None Complications Circulatory compromise (eg, caused by taping too tightly) Stiffness (eg, caused by immobilization of unaffected joints) Equipment Foam-backed malleable aluminum splint Adhesive tape 1.25 cm (½ inch) Sturdy shears to cut splint to length There are a variety of commercially available splints for use with specific injuries (eg, frog shaped, curved finger). Such prefabricated splints usually are available for only the finger; they often have wings that are bent over to hold the splint in place. Finger splints that must also immobilize the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint are usually made from a piece of flat, straight aluminum-foam strip that the operator cuts and bends to the appropriate dimensions and angles. Additional Considerations Dislocations and angulated fractures should be reduced before splinting. Consider digital block prior to splinting if manipulation is required. Often (eg, in mallet finger), to minimize stiffness, only the affected interphalangeal joint is immobilized, leaving the unaffected joint free range of motion (eg, mallet finger Mallet Finger Mallet finger is a flexion deformity of the fingertip caused by avulsion of the extensor tendon, with or without fracture, from the proximal end of the distal phalanx. Some finger injuries (eg, angulated or unstable proximal phalanx fractures) require immobilization of the metacarpals and wrist with gutter splinting. Positioning The patient should be positioned so that the operator has appropriate access to the patient's affected finger. Final joint positioning and choice of joint immobilization technique depend on the type of injury. Below are splinting positions for some specific injuries. Distal phalanx fracture: DIP joint in full extension Mallet finger: DIP joint in full extension Jersey finger (flexor digitorum profundus avulsion); DIP and PIP in slight flexion (eg, 15 to 30°) MCP dislocation: MCP joint in about 50° flexion Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Choose (or fabricate) a splint of the appropriate length. For full finger splints, measure dorsally from the MCP joint to the tip of the finger. For splints that also include the MCP joint, cut a length that extends from just past the fingertip to the base of the metacarpals. Mold the splint to immobilize the finger in the appropriate position. Place the splint on the dorsal surface of the finger. Secure the splint to the finger using tape around each phalanx to immobilize the target joint or joints (eg, for PIP immobilization, apply tape around the proximal and middle phalanges). Aftercare Arrange or recommend appropriate follow-up. Tell the patient to keep the splint dry to prevent skin maceration. Advise patients with mallet finger Mallet Finger Mallet finger is a flexion deformity of the fingertip caused by avulsion of the extensor tendon, with or without fracture, from the proximal end of the distal phalanx. Instruct the patient to seek further care if pain cannot be controlled with oral drugs at home. Warnings and Common Errors For distal phalanx injuries, extend the splint past the end of the finger so the fingertip is protected. Account for the actual length of the patient's phalanges when forming the bends in the splint. Immobilize only the joints necessary for the particular injury. Full finger immobilization is not indicated in all finger injuries and can lead to joint stiffness. Because finger movement is facilitated by a complex system of flexor and extensor tendons, careful and sometimes detailed examination is critical to identifying the appropriate splint type.

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. There are two types of diabetes mellitus: Type 1 Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. People with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes are likely to have complications as a result of the elevated glucose level. However, because type 2 diabetes may be present for some time before it is diagnosed, complications in type 2 diabetes may be more serious or more advanced when they are discovered. People with diabetes mellitus may experience many serious, long-term complications. Some of these complications begin within months of the onset of diabetes, although most tend to develop after a few years. Most of the complications gradually worsen. In people with diabetes, strictly controlling the level of glucose in the blood makes these complications less likely to develop or worsen. Causes of Complications of Diabetes Mellitus Most complications of diabetes are the result of problems with blood vessels. Glucose levels that remain high over a long time cause both the small and large blood vessels to narrow. The narrowing reduces blood flow to many parts of the body, leading to problems. There are several causes of blood vessel narrowing: Complex sugar-based substances build up in the walls of small blood vessels, causing them to thicken and leak. Types of Diabetes Complications Blood vessel complications in diabetes Atherosclerosis leads to heart attacks Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is between 2 and 4 times more common and tends to occur at a younger age in people with diabetes than in people who do not have diabetes. Over time, narrowing of blood vessels can harm the heart, brain, legs, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and skin, resulting in angina is temporary chest pain or a sensation of pressure that occurs while the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen. Infectious problems in diabetes People with diabetes often develop bacterial and fungal infections typically of the skin and mouth. When the levels of glucose in the blood are high, white blood cells cannot effectively fight infections. Any infection that develops tends to be more severe and takes longer to resolve in people with diabetes. Sometimes, an infection is the first sign of diabetes. One such infection is a yeast infection called candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by several species of the yeast Candida, especially Candida albicans. Candida yeast is a normal resident of the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina that usually causes no harm. In people with diabetes, however, Candida can overgrow on mucous membranes and moist areas of the skin causing rashes in those areas. People with diabetes are also particularly likely to have ulcers and infections of the feet and legs because of poor circulation to the skin. Too often, these wounds heal slowly or not at all. When wounds do not heal, they typically become infected and this can result in gangrene Gas Gangrene Gas gangrene is a life-threatening infection of muscle tissue caused mainly by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens and several other species of clostridia. Amputation of the foot or part of the leg may be needed. Eye problems in diabetes Damage to the blood vessels of the eye can cause loss of vision (diabetic retinopathy Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the retina (the transparent, light-sensitive structure at the back of the eye) as a result of diabetes. Laser surgery can seal the leaking blood vessels of the eye and prevent permanent damage to the retina. Sometimes, other forms of surgery or injectable medications may be used. Therefore, people with diabetes should have yearly eye examinations to check for early signs of damage. Diabetic Retinopathy VIDEO Liver damage in diabetes It is common for people with diabetes to also have fatty liver disease Fatty Liver Fatty liver is an abnormal accumulation of certain fats (triglycerides) inside liver cells. Fatty liver disease can sometimes progress to more serious liver disease including cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. Doctors diagnose liver problems if liver blood tests are abnormal and confirm the diagnosis with a liver biopsy of the Liver Doctors can obtain a sample of liver tissue during exploratory surgery, but more often they obtain a sample by inserting a hollow needle through the person's skin and into the liver. Losing weight, maintaining good control of blood sugar levels, and treating high cholesterol Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. Kidney damage in diabetes The kidneys can malfunction, resulting in chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood. Doctors usually check the urine of people with diabetes for abnormally high levels of protein (albumin), which is an early sign of kidney damage. At the earliest sign of kidney complications, people are often given medications that slow the progression of kidney damage, for example, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (medications that increase glucose secretion in the urine), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Diabetic Nephropathy VIDEO Nerve damage in diabetes Damage to nerves can manifest in several ways. If a single nerve malfunctions, an arm or leg may suddenly become weak. If the nerves to the hands, legs, and feet become damaged (diabetic polyneuropathy is the simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body. Damage to the nerves of the skin makes repeated injuries more likely because people cannot sense changes in pressure or temperature. Foot problems in diabetes causes many changes in the body. The following changes in the feet are common and difficult to treat: Damage to the nerves (neuropathy) affects sensation to the feet, so that pain is not felt. Irritation and other forms of injury may go unnoticed. An injury may wear through the skin before any pain is felt. Changes in sensation alter the way people with diabetes carry weight on their feet, concentrating weight in certain areas so that calluses form. Calluses (and dry skin) increase the risk of skin breakdown. Diabetes can cause poor circulation in the feet, making ulcers more likely to form when the skin is damaged and making the ulcers slower to heal. Because diabetes can affect the body’s ability to fight infections, a foot ulcer, once it forms, easily becomes infected. Because of neuropathy, people may not feel discomfort due to the infection until it becomes serious and difficult to treat, leading to gangrene Gas Gangrene Gas gangrene is a life-threatening infection of muscle tissue caused mainly by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens and several other species of clostridia. People with diabetes are more than 30 times more likely to require amputation of a foot or leg than are people without diabetes. Foot care is critical , usually due to atherosclerosis and resulting in decreased blood flow. The feet should be protected from injury, and the skin should be kept moist with a good moisturizer. Shoes should fit properly and not cause areas of irritation. Shoes should have appropriate cushioning to spread out the pressure caused by standing. Going barefoot is ill advised. Regular care from a podiatrist (a doctor specializing in foot care), such as having toenails cut and calluses removed, may also be helpful. Also, sensation and blood flow to the feet should be regularly evaluated by doctors. Table Monitoring and Preventing Diabetes Complications At the time of diagnosis and then at least yearly, people with type 2 diabetes are monitored for the presence of diabetes complications, such as kidney, eye, and nerve damage. In people with type 1 diabetes, doctors begin monitoring for complications 5 years after diagnosis. Typical screening tests include the following: Foot examination to test sensation and look for signs of poor circulation (ulcers, hair loss) Eye examination (done by an eye specialist) Urine and blood tests of kidney function Blood tests for cholesterol levels Sometimes an electrocardiogram Worsening of complications can be prevented or delayed by strict blood glucose control or by early treatment with medication. Risk factors for heart problems, such as increased blood pressure High Blood Pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. It also uses them to synthesize hormones and other substances needed for the body’s activities. Proper care of feet and regular eye examinations can help prevent or delay the onset of complications of diabetes. People with diabetes are vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, hepatitis B, and COVID-19, and doctors usually recommend they receive annual flu vaccination because people with diabetes are at risk of infection. Treatment of high blood pressure High Blood Pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. People with diabetes who are between 40 and 75 years are given a statin Lipid-lowering drugs Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. People younger than 40 or older than 75 years and with an elevated risk of heart disease also should take a statin. Another common problem in people with diabetes is gum disease (gingivitis is a mild form of periodontal disease characterized by inflammation of the gums (gingivae).  People who can strictly control their blood glucose levels may be able to minimize or delay diabetes complications. Prevention of hypoglycemia One of the challenges of trying to strictly control the levels of glucose in the blood is that low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes. Recognizing the presence of low blood glucose is important because treatment of hypoglycemia is an emergency. Symptoms may include hunger pangs, racing heartbeat, shakiness, sweating, and inability to think clearly. If hypoglycemia is very severe, sugar must get into the body quickly to prevent permanent harm and relieve symptoms. Most of the time, people can eat sugar. Almost any form of sugar will do, although glucose works more quickly than table sugar (typical table sugar is sucrose). Many people with diabetes carry glucose tablets or glucose gel packs. Other options are to drink a glass of milk (which contains lactose, a type of sugar), sugar water, or fruit juice or to eat a piece of cake, some fruit, or another sweet food. In more serious situations, it may be necessary for emergency medical practitioners to inject glucose into a vein. Another treatment for hypoglycemia involves the use of glucagon. Glucagon can be injected into a muscle or inhaled as a nasal powder and causes the liver to release large amounts of glucose within minutes. Small transportable kits containing a syringe or autoinjector pen filled with glucagon are available for people who frequently have episodes of low blood glucose to use in emergency situations when sugar cannot be ingested by mouth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "c13577aa-a7d0-48eb-b484-bfecd32e085a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Human African trypanosomiasis is infection with protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly. Symptoms include characteristic skin lesions, intermittent fever, headache, rigors, transient edema, generalized lymphadenopathy, and often fatal meningoencephalitis. Diagnosis is by identification of the organism in blood, lymph node aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid or sometimes by serologic tests. Treatment is with fexinidazole, suramin, pentamidine, melarsoprol, or eflornithine, depending on the infecting subspecies, clinical stage, and drug availability. Human African trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West and Central Africa and by T. brucei rhodesiense in East Africa; both species are endemic in Uganda. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 98% of all cases of African trypanosomiasis, and T. brucei rhodesiense accounts for 2%. African trypanosomiasis has been targeted for eradication by the World Health Organization (WHO) and, as a result of control efforts, there has been a dramatic decrease (> 95%) in the number of reported cases worldwide. In 2021, approximately 800 combined cases were reported to the WHO, with over 90% caused by T. b. gambiense . On average, 1 case is diagnosed in the US each year, always in travelers returning to the US from endemic regions. The organisms are transmitted by tsetse flies and can be transmitted prenatally from mother to fetus. Rarely, the infection is transmitted through blood transfusions; theoretically, it could be transmitted through organ transplantation.American trypanosomiasis). Pathophysiology of African Trypanosomiasis Metacyclic trypomastigotes inoculated by tsetse flies transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, which multiply by binary fission and spread through the lymphatics and bloodstream after inoculation. Bloodstream trypomastigotes multiply until specific antibodies produced by the host sharply reduce parasite levels. However, a subset of parasites escape immune destruction by a change in their variant surface glycoprotein and start a new multiplication cycle. The cycle of multiplication and lysis repeats. Late in the course of African trypanosomiasis, trypanosomes appear in the interstitial fluid of many organs, including the myocardium and eventually the central nervous system. The cycle is continued when a tsetse fly bites an infected human or animal. Humans are the main reservoir of T. gambiense, but this species may also reside in animals. Wild game animals are the main reservoir of T. rhodesiense. Symptoms and Signs of African Trypanosomiasis African trypanosomiasis has 3 stages: Cutaneous Hemolymphatic Central nervous system Cutaneous A papule may develop at the site of the tsetse fly bite within a few days to 2 weeks. It evolves into a red, painful, indurated nodule that may ulcerate (trypanosomal chancre). Hemolymphatic Over several months in T. gambiense infection but a period of weeks with T. rhodesiense, intermittent fever, headaches, rigors, muscle and joint pain, and transient facial swelling develop. An evanescent, circinate erythematous rash may develop. It is most readily visible in light-skinned patients. Generalized lymphadenopathy often occurs. Winterbottom sign (enlarged lymph nodes in the posterior cervical triangle) is characteristic with T. gambiense sleeping sickness. Central nervous system (CNS) In the Gambian form, CNS involvement occurs months to several years after onset of acute disease. In the Rhodesian form, disease is more fulminant, and CNS invasion often occurs within a few weeks. CNS involvement can result in persistent headache, inability to concentrate, personality changes (eg, progressive lassitude and indifference), daytime somnolence, tremor, ataxia, and terminal coma. Without treatment, death occurs within months of disease onset with T. rhodesiense and during the 2nd or 3rd year with T. gambiense. Untreated patients die in coma of undernutrition or secondary infections. Diagnosis of African Trypanosomiasis Light microscopy of blood (thin or thick smears) or other fluid sample Diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis is made by identifying trypanosomes in fluid from a chancre, lymph node aspirate, blood, bone marrow aspirate, or, during the late stage of infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Preferred sources are blood smears for T. rhodesiense and fluid aspirated from an enlarged lymph node for T. Wet preparations should be examined for motile trypanosomes, and smears should be fixed, stained with Giemsa (or Field) stain, and examined. The concentration of trypanosomes in blood is often low, and concentration techniques (eg, centrifugation, miniature anion-exchange centrifugation, quantitative buffy coat technique) enhance sensitivity. Antibody detection assays are not very useful clinically because seroconversion occurs after the onset of symptoms. However, a card agglutination test for T. gambiense is useful in mass screening programs to identify candidates for microscopic examination.African trypanosomiasis. When CSF is involved, opening pressure may be increased, and CSF has elevated levels of lymphocytes (≥ 6 cells/mc.L), total protein, and nonspecific IgM. In addition to trypanosomes, characteristic Mott cells (plasma cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles that contain immunoglobulin [Russell bodies]) may be present. Other, nonspecific laboratory findings include anemia, monocytosis, and markedly elevated serum levels of polyclonal IgM. Treatment of African Trypanosomiasis Treatment of African trypanosomiasis is guided by species and stage of disease. Without CNS involvement, fexinidazole or, alternatively, pentamidine for T. gambiense; suramin for T. rhodesiense With CNS involvement, fexinidazole for nonsevere T. gambiense; eflornithine (if available) alone or in combination with nifurtimox, or melarsoprol (if eflornithine is not available), for severe T. gambiense; melarsoprol for T. rhodesiense Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere T. gambiense, with or without CNS involvement.  Fexinidazole is taken orally once a day for 10 days at the following doses: For patients ≥ 35 kg: 1800 mg/day in the loading phase (4 days), followed by 1200 mg/day in the maintenance phase (6 days) For patients 20 to 34 kg: 1200 mg/day in the loading phase (4 days), followed by 600 mg/day in the maintenance phase (6 days) Criteria for outpatient treatment with fexinidazole include reliable adherence to dosing, absence of psychiatric disorders, and body weight ≥ 35 kg. Criteria for inpatient treatment includes any of the following characteristics: Body weight < 35 kg At risk for poor compliance History of psychiatric disorders (to monitor for neuropsychiatric reactions) Patients with signs and symptoms of severe disease should be evaluated by lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Patients with severe disease (white blood cell count ≥ 100 cells/micro.L in CSF), where lumbar puncture is not feasible, or who cannot be treated with fexinidazole should be treated as outlined below. Without central nervous system (CNS) involvement Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere T. gambiense without CNS involvement. Pentamidine and suramin are effective against bloodstream stages of both T. brucei subspecies but do not cross the blood-brain barrier and are not useful for CNS infection. Pentamidine is used for T. gambiense in patients not treated with fexinidazole. Suramin is the only drug effective for the hemolymphatic stage of T. Suramin is not used to treat T. gambiense, because although potentially effective, it has been associated with adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia, hyperesthesias, peripheral neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, urticaria, and pruritus. Also, serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur in patients co-infected with Onchocerca volvulus, which is endemic in many areas of West Africa where T. gambiense occurs. The dosage of pentamidine is 4 mg/kg IM or IV once a day for 7 to 10 days. An initial test dose of suramin (available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) 100 mg IV (to exclude hypersensitivity) is followed by 20 mg/kg (up to 1 g) IV on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21. With central nervous system (CNS) involvement Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere disease with CNS involvement due to T. When available, eflornithine 100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 14 days is used for severe disease with CNS involvement due to T. gambiense (eflornithine is ineffective for T. rhodesiense). WHO recommends eflornithine 200 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 7 days in combination with nifurtimox 5 mg/kg orally 3 times a day for 10 days (1 Treatment reference Human African trypanosomiasis is infection with protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly. Eflornithine (100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 14 days) monotherapy may be given when nifurtimox is unavailable or contraindicated and when fexinidazole cannot be given. Adverse effects of eflornithine include gastrointestinal symptoms, bone marrow suppression, and seizures. Common adverse effects of nifurtimox are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, polyneuropathy, headache, dizziness, and vertigo. Melarsoprol, an organic arsenical, is often used in African countries because of the limited availability of eflornithine, even though adverse effects can be severe and life threatening. Melarsoprol dosage is as follows: For T. gambiense: 2.2 mg/kg (maximum dose 180 mg) IV once a day for 10 days For T. rhodesiense: 2 to 3.6 mg/kg IV once a day for 3 days; after 7 days, 3.6 mg/kg once a day for 3 days, followed 7 days later by another 3-day course at this dose In the US, eflornithine, nifurtimox, and melarsoprol can be obtained from the CDC. Alternative regimens have been proposed for debilitated patients with severe CNS involvement. Serial follow-up examinations, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, are recommended every 6 months (sooner if symptoms return) for 2 years. Serious adverse effects of melarsoprol include encephalopathic reactions, exfoliative dermatitis, cardiovascular toxicity (hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure), and the gastrointestinal and renal toxicity of arsenicals. Corticosteroids have been used to decrease the risk of encephalopathic reactions. There is no test of cure. After treatment, patients should be monitored for relapse for 24 months. Recurrence of symptoms necessitates re-examination of CSF for parasites. Treatment reference 1. World Health Organization: WHO publishes new guidelines for the treatment of sleeping sickness; August 2019. Prevention of African Trypanosomiasis Prevention of African trypanosomiasis includes avoiding endemic areas and protecting against tsetse flies. Visitors to game parks should wear substantial wrist- and ankle-length clothing (tsetse flies bite through thin clothes) in neutral colors that blend with the background and should use insect repellents, although efficacy of repellents against tsetse flies may be limited. Pentamidine can help prevent T. gambiense infection, but it may damage pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin release and hypoglycemia followed later by diabetes; thus, it is no longer used for prophylaxis. Key Points African trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West and Central Africa and by T. rhodesiense in East Africa; tsetse flies are the main vector. There are 3 stages of disease: cutaneous, hemolymphatic, and CNS (sleeping sickness). Diagnose using light microscopy of blood (thin or thick smears) or another fluid sample. Treatment of African trypanosomiasis varies by species and stage of disease. Without CNS involvement, use fexinidazole or, alternatively, pentamidine for T. gambiense and suramin for T. With CNS involvement, use fexinidazole for nonsevere T. gambiense; eflornithine (if available) alone or in combination with nifurtimox, or melarsoprol (if eflornithine is not available) for severe T. gambiense; and melarsoprol for T. rhodesiense.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms and signs are pain and a tender and firm or fluctuant swelling. Diagnosis is usually obvious by examination. Treatment is incision and drainage.  Risk factors for cutaneous abscesses include the following: Bacterial overgrowth Antecedent trauma (particularly when a foreign body is present) Immunosuppression Impaired circulation Bacteria causing cutaneous abscesses are typically indigenous to the skin of the involved area. For abscesses on the trunk, extremities, axillae, or head and neck, the most common organisms are Staphylococcus aureus (with methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] being the most common in the US) and streptococci. Abscesses in the perineal (ie, inguinal, vaginal, buttock, perirectal) region contain organisms found in the stool, commonly anaerobes or a combination of aerobes and anaerobes . Carbuncles and furuncles and Carbuncles Furuncles (boils) are skin abscesses caused by staphylococcal infection, which involve a hair follicle and surrounding tissue. Symptoms and Signs of Cutaneous Abscess Cutaneous abscesses are painful, tender, indurated, and usually erythematous. They vary in size, typically 1 to 3 cm in length, but are sometimes much larger. Initially the swelling is firm; later, as the abscess points, the overlying skin becomes thin and feels fluctuant. The abscess may then spontaneously drain. Local cellulitis, lymphangitis, regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and leukocytosis are variable accompanying features. Diagnosis of Cutaneous Abscess Examination Culture to identify MRSA Diagnosis of cutaneous abscess is usually obvious by examination. Culture is recommended, primarily to identify MRSA. Conditions resembling simple cutaneous abscesses include hidradenitis suppurativa Hidradenitis Suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, scarring, acnelike inflammatory process that occurs in the axillae, groin, and around the nipples and anus. Diagnosis is by examination. Epidermal cysts Cutaneous Cysts Epidermal inclusion cysts are the most common cutaneous cysts. Milia are small epidermal inclusion cysts. Pilar cysts are usually on the scalp and may be familial. Culture of these ruptured cysts seldom reveals any pathogens. Perineal abscesses may represent cutaneous emergence of a deeper perirectal abscess or drainage resulting from Crohn disease Crohn Disease Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. These other conditions are usually recognizable by history and rectal examination. Treatment of Cutaneous Abscess Incision and drainage Sometimes antibiotics Some small abscesses resolve without treatment, coming to a point and draining. Warm compresses help accelerate the process. Incision and drainage are indicated when significant pain, tenderness, and swelling are present; it is unnecessary to await fluctuance. Under sterile conditions, local anesthesia is given as either a lidocaine injection or a freezing spray. Patients with large, extremely painful abscesses may benefit from IV sedation and analgesia during drainage. A single puncture with the tip of a scalpel is often sufficient to open the abscess. After the pus drains, the cavity should be bluntly probed with a gloved finger or curette to clear loculations. Irrigation with normal saline is optional. Packing the cavity loosely with a gauze wick reduces the dead space and prevents formation of a seroma. The wick is typically removed 24 to 48 hours later. However, recent data have not proved the effectiveness of routine irrigation or packing (1 Treatment references A cutaneous abscess is a localized collection of pus in the skin and may occur on any skin surface.

Often, they do not require treatment. In contrast, breast cancer Breast Cancer Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. Thus, for many women, breast cancer is their worst fear. However, potential problems can often be detected early when women do the following: Are examined regularly by their doctor Have mammograms as recommended Early detection of breast cancer can be essential to successful treatment. Women should be familiar with how their breasts and nipples normally look and feel, and men should also be aware of changes in or around their nipples. If a woman notices a change, she may want to do a breast self-examination. Women should report any changes to a health care practitioner right away. Most medical organizations no longer recommend monthly or weekly breast self-examinations Breast self-awareness Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. Doing these examinations when there is no lump or other change does not help detect breast cancer early in women who get regular screening mammograms. The Breasts VIDEO Symptoms of Breast Disorders Symptoms related to the breast are common. They are the reason for more than 15 million visits to the doctor each year. These symptoms include Breast pain Breast Pain Many women experience breast pain. Breast pain may occur in one or both breasts.  A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor. Each breast has several (15 to 20) milk ducts. A discharge can come from one or more of these ducts. Milk secreted by the glands flows through ducts to the nipple. Around the nipple is an area of pigmented skin called the areola. Breast symptoms do not necessarily mean that a woman has breast cancer or another serious disorder. For example, monthly breast tenderness that is related to hormonal changes before a menstrual period does not indicate a serious disorder. However, women should see their doctor if they observe any change in a breast, particularly any of the following: A lump or thickened area that feels distinctly different from other breast tissue A lump that is stuck to the skin or chest wall A lump that does not go away Swelling that does not go away Pitting, puckering, reddening, thickening, or dimpling in the skin of the breast Scaly skin around the nipple Changes in the shape of the breast Changes in the nipple, such as being pulled inward Discharge from the nipple, especially if it is bloody and/or occurs spontaneously (that is, without the nipple's being squeezed or stimulated by other means) Table Evaluation of Breast Disorders Doctors ask the woman about the symptoms she is having and other information related to possible causes, including What the symptoms are How long the woman has had the symptoms Whether the symptoms occur at certain times of the month (related to the menstrual cycle) Whether she has a discharge from the nipple, and if so, what it looks like Whether she is pregnant What drugs she is taking Whether she or a family member has had breast cancer When she had her last mammogram and what the results were Breast examination A breast examination is done. With the woman sitting or lying down, the doctor inspects the breasts for irregularities in shape, a nipple that turns inward (inverted nipple), and lumps. The doctor also checks for dimpling, thickening, redness, or tightening of the skin over the breast. The doctor applies pressure around the nipples to check for a discharge. The discharge is examined to determine whether it contains blood. The armpits are checked for enlarged lymph nodes. The doctor may examine the breast and armpits with the woman in different positions. For example, while sitting, she may be asked to press her palms together in front of the forehead. This position makes the chest muscles contract and makes subtle changes in the breast more noticeable. Testing Imaging tests are used to Check for breast abnormalities before they are noticed (called breast cancer screening Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. A low dose of radiation is used. Only about 10 to 15% of abnormalities detected by mammography result from cancer. Experts agree that all women should be screened for breast cancer. However, experts disagree about When it should start How often it should be done When (or if) it should be stopped Screening may include Mammography A breast examination by a health care practitioner Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for high-risk patients Screening mammography Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. Mammography is then done every 1 or 2 years. Experts have different recommendations about when to start routine mammography. Some experts recommend starting at age 50 because screening mammography is more accurate in women over age 50. Routine mammography may be stopped at age 75, depending on the woman's life expectancy and her wish for continued screening. The types of tissue in the breast affect how well a mammogram can detect an abnormality. The breast contains fibroglandular tissue (composed of fibrous tissue and glands) and fatty tissue. As women age, the amount of fatty tissue in the breasts increases and the amount of fibroglandular tissue decreases. Abnormalities next to fatty tissue are easier to detect with a mammogram. That is why a mammogram becomes more accurate after age 50. Some women have dense breasts. Having dense breasts means that women have more fibroglandular tissue and less fatty tissue. Abnormalities in dense breasts are harder to detect on a mammogram . Also, women with dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer. Thus, these women may require additional tests, such as breast ultrasonography, 3-dimensional mammography (tomosynthesis Breast examination by a health care practitioner Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. Mammography can be used to do the following: Provide images of any abnormalities (such as a tumor or an abscess) and the tissues around the abnormality Provide images of lymph nodes to check for abnormalities Help doctors place a biopsy needle into abnormal tissue After surgery, help doctors determine whether all the cancer was removed Mammography may also be done if a woman or doctor finds a lump while examining the breasts or if a woman has breast pain or a discharge from the nipple. Ultrasonography can be used to do the following: Provide the first image of abnormalities that were detected during a breast examination in women under 30 Provide more information about abnormalities detected by magnetic resonance imaging or mammography—for example, ultrasonography can show whether lumps are solid or filled with fluid (fluid-filled lumps—called cysts—are rarely cancerous) Help doctors place a biopsy needle into abnormal tissue Identify abnormal lymph nodes that may require biopsy Stage breast cancer Staging Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.

Symptoms of acute angle closure are severe ocular pain and redness, decreased vision, colored halos around lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is elevated. Immediate treatment of the acute condition with multiple topical and systemic drugs is required to prevent permanent vision loss, followed by the definitive treatment, iridotomy Angle-closure glaucoma accounts for about 10% of all glaucomas in the US. Etiology of Angle-Closure Glaucoma Angle-closure glaucoma is caused by factors that either pull or push the iris up into the angle (ie, junction of the iris and cornea at the periphery of the anterior chamber), physically blocking drainage of aqueous and raising intraocular pressure (IOP) . Elevated IOP damages the optic nerve. Table Pathophysiology of Angle-Closure Glaucoma Angle closure may be primary (cause is unknown) or secondary to another condition . Primary angle-closure glaucoma Narrow angles are not present in young people. As people age, the lens of the eye continues to grow. In some but not all people, this growth pushes the iris forward, narrowing the angle. Risk factors for developing narrow angles include family history, advanced age, and ethnicity; risk is higher among people of Asian and Inuit ethnicity and lower among people of European and African ethnicities. In people with narrow angles, the distance between the iris at the pupil and the lens is also very narrow. When the iris dilates, forces pull the iris centripetally and posteriorly causing increasing iris–lens contact, which prevents aqueous from passing between the lens and iris, through the pupil, and into the anterior chamber (this mechanism is termed pupillary block). Pressure from the continued secretion of aqueous into the posterior chamber by the ciliary body pushes the peripheral iris anteriorly (causing a forward-bowing iris called iris bombe), closing the angle. This closure blocks aqueous outflow, resulting in rapid (within hours) and severe (> 40 mm Hg) elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Because of the rapid onset, this condition is called primary acute angle-closure glaucoma and is an ophthalmic emergency requiring immediate treatment. Non-pupillary block mechanisms include plateau iris syndrome in which the central anterior chamber is deep, but the peripheral anterior chamber is made shallow by a ciliary body that is displaced forward. Intermittent angle-closure glaucoma occurs if the episode of pupillary block resolves spontaneously after several hours, usually after sleeping supine. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma occurs if the angle narrows slowly, allowing scarring between the peripheral iris and trabecular meshwork; IOP elevation is slow. Pupillary dilation (mydriasis) can push the iris into the angle and precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma in any person with narrow angles. This development is of particular concern when applying topical agents to dilate the eye for examination (eg, cyclopentolate, phenylephrine) or for treatment (eg, homatropine) or when giving systemic drugs that have the potential to dilate the pupils (eg, scopolamine, alpha-adrenergic agonists commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, drugs with anticholinergic effects)PDR), ischemic central vein occlusion Central Retinal Vein Occlusion and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion Central retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the central retinal vein by a thrombus. It causes painless vision loss, ranging from mild to severe, and usually occurs suddenly.Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well. Contraction of a neovascular membrane (eg, in PDR) or inflammatory scarring can pull the iris into the angle. Symptoms and Signs of Angle-Closure Glaucoma Acute angle-closure glaucoma Patients have severe ocular pain and redness, decreased vision, colored halos around lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The systemic complaints may be so severe that patients are misdiagnosed as having a neurologic or gastrointestinal problem. Examination typically reveals conjunctival hyperemia, a hazy cornea, a fixed mid-dilated pupil, and anterior chamber inflammation. Vision is decreased. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement is usually 40 to 80 mm Hg. The optic nerve is difficult to visualize because of corneal edema, and visual field testing is not done because of discomfort. For primary mechanisms of angle-closure (eg, pupillary block and plateau iris), examination of the uninvolved contralateral eye can indicate the diagnosis. Pearls & Pitfalls In patients who have sudden headache, nausea, and vomiting, examine the eyes. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma This type of glaucoma manifests similarly to open-angle glaucoma Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma is a syndrome of optic nerve damage associated with an open anterior chamber angle and an elevated or sometimes average intraocular pressure (IOP). Some patients have ocular redness, discomfort, blurred vision, or headache that lessens with sleep (perhaps because of sleep-induced miosis and posterior displacement of the lens by gravity). On gonioscopy, the angle is narrow, and peripheral anterior synechiae (adhesions between the peripheral iris and angle structure causing blockage of trabecular meshwork and/or ciliary body face), also called peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), may be seen. IOP may be normal but is usually higher in the affected eye. Diagnosis of Angle-Closure Glaucoma Acute: Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) and clinical findings Chronic: Gonioscopy showing peripheral anterior synechiae and characteristic optic nerve and visual field abnormalities Diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma is clinical and by measurement of IOP. Gonioscopy may be difficult to do in the involved eye because of a clouded cornea with friable corneal epithelium. However, examination of the other eye reveals a narrow or occludable angle. If the other eye has a wide angle, a diagnosis other than primary angle-closure glaucoma should be considered. Diagnosis of chronic angle-closure glaucoma is based on the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae on gonioscopy and characteristic optic nerve and visual field changes . Treatment of Angle-Closure Glaucoma Acute: Timolol, pilocarpine, and brimonidine drops, oral acetazolamide, and a systemic osmotic drug, followed by laser peripheral iridotomy Chronic: Similar to primary open-angle glaucoma except that laser peripheral iridotomy should be done if the ophthalmologist feels that the procedure may slow mechanical closing of the angle. Cataract A cataract is a congenital or degenerative opacity of the lens. The main symptom is gradual, painless vision blurring. Diagnosis is by ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination. Acute angle-closure glaucoma Treatment must be initiated immediately because vision can be lost quickly and permanently. The patient should receive several drugs at once. A suggested regimen is timolol 0.5% one drop every 30 minutes for 2 doses, pilocarpine 2 to 4% one drop every 15 minutes for 2 doses, brimonidine (0.15 or 0.2%) one drop every 15 minutes for 2 doses, acetazolamide 500 mg orally initially (IV if patients are nauseated) followed by 250 mg every 6 hours, and an osmotic agent, such as oral glycerol 1 mL/kg diluted with an equal amount of cold water, mannitol 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg IV, or isosorbide 100 g orally (220 mL of a 45% solution). (NOTE: This form of isosorbide is not isosorbide dinitrate.) Response is evaluated by measuring intraocular pressure (IOP). Miotics (eg, pilocarpine) are generally not effective when IOP is > 40 or 50 mm Hg because of an anoxic pupillary sphincter. Definitive treatment is with laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), which opens another pathway for fluid to pass from the posterior to the anterior chamber, breaking the pupillary block. It is done as soon as the cornea is clear and inflammation has subsided. In some cases the cornea clears within hours of lowering the IOP; in other cases, it can take 1 to 2 days. Because the chance of having an acute attack in the other eye is 80%, LPI is done on both eyes. The risk of complications with LPI is extremely low compared with its benefits. Glare, which can be bothersome, may occur. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma Patients with chronic, subacute, or intermittent angle-closure glaucoma should also have LPI. Additionally, patients with a narrow angle, even in the absence of symptoms, should undergo prompt LPI to prevent angle-closure glaucoma. If a cataract is present, cataract removal can dramatically delay the progression of chronic angle-closure glaucoma. The drug and surgical treatments are the same as with open-angle glaucoma. Laser trabeculoplasty is relatively contraindicated if the angle is so narrow that additional peripheral anterior synechiae may form after the laser procedure. Typically, partial-thickness procedures are not indicated. Key Points Angle-closure glaucoma can develop acutely, intermittently, or chronically. Suspect acute angle-closure glaucoma based on clinical findings and confirm it by measuring intraocular pressure. Confirm chronic angle-closure glaucoma by peripheral anterior synechiae and optic nerve and visual field changes. Treat acute angle-closure glaucoma as an emergency. Consult an ophthalmologist to arrange laser peripheral iridotomy for all patients with angle-closure glaucoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a4ac79b5-7cb9-437f-9c6c-8340912b3f38", "title": null, "text": "【0】Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability and hypersensitivity in interpersonal relationships, instability in self-image, extreme mood fluctuations, and impulsivity. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria. Treatment is with psychotherapy and drugs.  Patients with borderline personality disorder have an intolerance of being alone; they make frantic efforts to avoid abandonment and generate crises, such as making suicidal gestures Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Reported prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the US varies. The estimated median prevalence is 1.6% but may be as high as 5.9%. In patients being treated as inpatients for mental health disorders, prevalence is about 20%. About 75% of patients diagnosed with this disorder are female, but in the general US population, the ratio of men to women is 1:1. Comorbidities are complex. Patients often have a number of other disorders, particularly depression Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is recurring, intrusive recollections of an overwhelming traumatic event; recollections last > 1 month and begin within 6 months of the event.Overview of Substance Use Substance-related disorders involve substances that directly activate the brain's reward system. Etiology of BPD Stresses during early childhood may contribute to the development of borderline personality disorder. A childhood history of physical and sexual abuse, neglect, separation from caregivers, and/or loss of a parent is common among patients with borderline personality disorder. Certain people may have a genetic tendency to have pathologic responses to environmental life stresses, and borderline personality disorder clearly appears to have a heritable component. First-degree relatives of patients with borderline personality disorder are 5 times more likely to have the disorder than the general population. Disturbances in regulatory functions of the brain and neuropeptide systems may also contribute but are not present in all patients with borderline personality disorder. Symptoms and Signs of BPD When patients with borderline personality disorder feel that they are being abandoned or neglected, they feel intense fear or anger. For example, they may become panicky or furious when someone important to them is a few minutes late or cancels an engagement. They think that this abandonment means that they are bad. They fear abandonment partly because they do not want to be alone. These patients tend to change their view of others abruptly and dramatically. They may idealize a potential caregiver or lover early in the relationship, demand to spend a lot of time together, and share everything. Suddenly, they may feel that the person does not care enough, and they become disillusioned; then they may belittle or become angry with the person. This shift from idealization to devaluation reflects black-and-white thinking (splitting, polarization of good and bad). Patients with borderline personality disorder can empathize with and care for a person but only if they feel that another person will be there for them whenever needed. Patients with this disorder have difficulty controlling their anger and often become inappropriate and intensely angry. They may express their anger with biting sarcasm, bitterness, or angry tirades, often directed at their caregiver or lover for neglect or abandonment. After the outburst, they often feel ashamed and guilty, reinforcing their feeling of being bad. Patients with borderline personality disorder may also abruptly and dramatically change their self-image, shown by suddenly changing their goals, values, opinions, careers, or friends. They may be needy one minute and righteously angry about being mistreated the next. Although they usually see themselves as bad, they sometimes feel that they do not exist at all—eg, when they do not have someone who cares for them. They often feel empty inside. The changes in mood (eg, intense dysphoria, irritability, anxiety) usually last only a few hours and rarely last more than a few days; they may reflect the extreme sensitivity to interpersonal stresses in patients with borderline personality disorder. Patients with borderline personality disorder often sabotage themselves when they are about to reach a goal. For example, they may drop out of school just before graduation, or they may ruin a promising relationship. Impulsivity leading to self-harm is common. These patients may gamble, engage in unsafe sex, binge eat, drive recklessly, abuse substances, or overspend. Suicidal behaviors Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) Nonsuicidal self-injury is a self-inflicted act that causes pain or superficial damage but is not intended to cause death. Although many of these self-destructive acts are not intended to end life, risk of suicide in these patients is 40 times that of the general population. About 8 to 10% of these patients die by suicide. These self-destructive acts are usually triggered by rejection by, possible abandonment by, or disappointment in a caregiver or lover. Patients may self-mutilate to compensate for their being bad, to reaffirm their ability to feel during a dissociative episode Overview of Dissociative Disorders Everyone occasionally experiences a failure in the normal automatic integration of memories, perceptions, identity, and consciousness. Dissociative episodes, paranoid thoughts, and sometimes psychotic-like symptoms (eg, hallucinations, ideas of reference) may be triggered by extreme stress, usually fear of abandonment, whether real or imagined. These symptoms are temporary and usually not severe enough to be considered a separate disorder. Symptoms lessen in most patients; relapse rate is low. However, functional status does not usually improve as much as the symptoms. Diagnosis of BPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, patients must have A persistent pattern of unstable relationships, self-image, and emotions (ie, emotional dysregulation) and pronounced impulsivity This persistent pattern is shown by ≥ 5 of the following: Desperate efforts to avoid abandonment (actual or imagined) Unstable, intense relationships that alternate between idealizing and devaluing the other person An unstable self-image or sense of self Impulsivity in ≥ 2 areas that could harm themselves (eg, unsafe sex, binge eating, reckless driving) Repeated suicidal behavior and/or gestures Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) Nonsuicidal self-injury is a self-inflicted act that causes pain or superficial damage but is not intended to cause death.Rapid changes in mood, lasting usually only a few hours and rarely more than a few days Persistent feelings of emptiness Inappropriately intense anger or problems controlling anger Temporary paranoid thoughts or severe dissociative symptoms triggered by stress Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood but can occur during adolescence. Differential diagnosis Borderline personality disorder is most commonly misdiagnosed as Bipolar disorder Bipolar Disorders Bipolar disorders are characterized by episodes of mania and depression, which may alternate, although many patients have a predominance of one or the other.This disorder is also characterized by wide fluctuations in mood and behavior. However, in borderline personality disorder, mood and behavior change rapidly in response to stressors, especially interpersonal ones, whereas in bipolar disorder, moods are more sustained and less reactive and people often have significant changes in energy and activity. Other personality disorders share similar manifestations. Histrionic personality disorder Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for adulation, and lack of empathy. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.Patients with either of these disorders can be attention-seeking and manipulative, but patients with borderline personality disorder also see themselves as bad and feel empty. Some patients meet criteria for more than one personality disorder. Differential diagnosis for borderline personality disorder also includes Depressive disorders Overview of Mood Disorders Mood disorders are emotional disturbances consisting of prolonged periods of excessive sadness, excessive joyousness, or both.Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.These disorders can be distinguished from borderline personality disorder based on the negative self-image, insecure attachments, and sensitivity to rejection that are prominent features of borderline personality disorder and are usually absent in patients with a mood or anxiety disorder. Substance use disorders Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use.Posttraumatic stress disorder Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is recurring, intrusive recollections of an overwhelming traumatic event; recollections last > 1 month and begin within 6 months of the event.Many disorders in the differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder coexist with it. Treatment of BPD Psychotherapy Drugs General treatment Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment. Identifying and treating coexisting disorders is important for effective treatment of borderline personality disorder. Psychotherapy The main treatment for borderline personality disorder is psychotherapy. Many psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in reducing suicidal behaviors, ameliorating depression, and improving function in patients with this disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy focuses on emotional dysregulation and lack of social skills. It includes the following: Dialectical behavioral therapy (a combination of individual and group sessions with therapists acting as behavior coaches and available on call around the clock) Systems training for emotional predictability and problem solving (STEPPS) STEPPS involves weekly group sessions for 20 weeks. Patients are taught skills to manage their emotions, to challenge their negative expectations, and to better care for themselves. They learn to set goals; avoid illegal substances; and improve their eating, sleeping, and exercise habits. Patients are asked to identify a support team of friends, family members, and health care practitioners who are willing to coach them when they are in crisis. Other interventions focus on disturbances in the ways patients emotionally experience themselves and others. These interventions include the following: Mentalization-based treatment Transference-focused psychotherapy Schema-focused therapy Mentalization refers to people's ability to reflect on and understand their own state of mind and the state of mind of others. Mentalization is thought to be learned through a secure attachment to the caregiver. Mentalization-based treatment helps patients do the following: Effectively regulate their emotions (eg, calm down when upset) Understand how they contribute to their problems and difficulties with others Reflect on and understand the minds of others It thus helps them relate to others with empathy and compassion. Transference-focused psychotherapy centers on the interaction between patient and therapist. The therapist asks questions and helps patients think about their reactions so that they can examine their exaggerated, distorted, and unrealistic images of self during the session. The current moment (eg, how patients are relating to their therapist) is emphasized rather than the past. For example, when a timid, quiet patient suddenly becomes hostile and argumentative, the therapist may ask whether the patient noticed a shift in feelings and then ask the patient to think about how the patient was experiencing the therapist and self when things changed. The purpose is To enable patients to develop a more stable and realistic sense of self and others To relate to others in a healthier way through transference to the therapist Schema-focused therapy is an integrative therapy that combines cognitive-behavioral therapy, attachment theory, psychodynamic concepts, and emotion-focused therapies. It focuses on lifelong maladaptive patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving and coping (called schemas), affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with limited re-parenting. Limited re-parenting involves establishing a secure attachment between patient and therapist (within professional limits), enabling the therapist to help the patient experience what the patient missed during childhood that led to maladaptive behavior. The purpose of schema-focused therapy is to help patients change their schemas. Therapy has 3 stages: Assessment: Identifying the schemas Awareness: Recognizing the schemas when they are operating in daily life Behavioral change: Replacing negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with healthier ones Some of these interventions are specialized and require specialized training and supervision. However, some interventions do not; one such intervention, which is designed for the general practitioner, is General (or good) psychiatric management Good psychiatric management includes individual therapy once a week, psychoeducation about borderline personality disorder and treatment goals and expectations, and sometimes drugs. It focuses on the patient’s reactions to interpersonal stressors in everyday life. Supportive psychotherapy is also useful. The goal is to establish an emotional, encouraging, supportive relationship with the patient and thus help the patient develop healthy defense mechanisms, especially in interpersonal relationships. Drugs work best when used sparingly and systematically for specific symptoms.SSRIs) are usually well-tolerated; chance of a lethal overdose is minimal. However, SSRIs are only marginally effective for depression and anxiety in patients with borderline personality disorder. The following drugs may be effective in ameliorating symptoms of borderline personality disorder: Mood stabilizers Drug Treatment of Bipolar Disorders Choice of drug treatment for bipolar disorders can be difficult because all drugs have significant adverse effects, drug interactions are common, and no drug is universally effective.For depression, anxiety, mood lability, and impulsivity Atypical (2nd-generation) antipsychotics Second-generation antipsychotics Antipsychotic drugs are divided into conventional antipsychotics and 2nd-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) based on their specific neurotransmitter receptor affinity and activity.For anxiety, anger, mood lability, and cognitive symptoms, including transient stress-related cognitive distortions (eg, paranoid thoughts, black-and-white thinking, severe cognitive disorganization) Benzodiazepines Sedatives Sedatives include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related drugs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms are prolonged high fever, intractable headache, and a maculopapular rash.  Epidemic typhus is a rickettsial disease. Humans are the natural reservoir for R. prowazekii, which is prevalent worldwide and transmitted by body lice when louse feces are scratched or rubbed into bite or other wounds (or sometimes the mucous membranes of the eyes or mouth). In the US, humans occasionally contract epidemic typhus after contact with flying squirrels because fleas or lice on flying squirrels may be vectors. Fatalities are rare in children < 10 years, but mortality increases with age and may reach 60% in untreated patients > 50 years. Symptoms and Signs of Epidemic Typhus After an incubation period of 7 to 14 days, fever, headache, and prostration suddenly occur. Temperature reaches 40° C in several days and remains high, with slight morning remission, for about 2 weeks. Headache is generalized and intense. Small, pink macules, which appear on the 4th to 6th day, rapidly cover the body, usually in the axillae and on the upper trunk and not on the palms, soles, and face. Later, the rash becomes dark and maculopapular. In severe cases, the rash becomes petechial and hemorrhagic. Splenomegaly sometimes occurs. Hypotension occurs in most seriously ill patients. Vascular collapse, renal insufficiency, encephalitic signs, ecchymosis with gangrene, and pneumonia are poor prognostic signs. Brill-Zinsser disease, a mild recrudescence of epidemic typhus, can occur years after the initial infection if host defenses falter. Diagnosis of Epidemic Typhus Clinical features Biopsy of rash with fluorescent antibody staining to detect organisms Acute and convalescent serologic testing (serologic testing not useful acutely) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Louse infestation is usually obvious and strongly suggests typhus if history (eg, living in or visiting an endemic area) suggests possible exposure. For details, see Diagnosis of Rickettsial and Related Infections Diagnosis Rickettsial diseases (rickettsioses) and related diseases (anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Q fever, scrub typhus) are caused by a group of gram-negative, obligately intracellular coccobacilli. Treatment of Epidemic Typhus Doxycycline Primary treatment of epidemic typhus is doxycycline 200 mg orally once followed by 100 mg twice a day in adults until the patient improves, has been afebrile for 24 to 48 hours, and has received treatment for at least 7 days. Although some tetracyclines can cause tooth staining in children < 8 years of age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that a course of doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg orally or IV twice a day is warranted (1 Treatment references Epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. Research indicates that short courses of doxycycline (5 to 10 days, as used for rickettsial disease) can be used in children without causing tooth staining or weakening of tooth enamel (2 Treatment references Epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. Chloramphenicol 500 mg orally or IV 4 times a day for 7 days is 2nd-line treatment. Oral chloramphenicol is not available in the US, and its use can cause adverse hematologic effects, which requires monitoring of blood indices. Severely ill patients with epidemic typhus may have a marked increase in capillary permeability in later stages; thus, IV fluids should be given cautiously to maintain blood pressure while avoiding worsening pulmonary and cerebral edema. Epub 2015 Mar 17. PMID: 25794784. Prevention of Epidemic Typhus Immunization and louse control are highly effective for prevention. However, vaccines are no longer available. Lice may be eliminated by dusting infested people with malathion or lindane. Bedding and clothing should be washed at least once a week in hot water (> 54 C) and dried on high heat. Non-washable clothing and items can be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks. Bedding and clothing also can be treated with the insecticide permethrin. Key Points Epidemic typhus is prevalent worldwide; humans are the natural reservoir. Infection is transmitted among humans by body lice when louse feces are scratched or rubbed into louse bites, wounds, or mucous membranes. Small, pink macules rapidly cover the body, later, becoming dark and maculopapular. Mortality increases with age and may reach 60% in untreated patients > 50 years; vascular collapse, renal insufficiency, encephalitic signs, ecchymosis with gangrene, and pneumonia are poor prognostic signs. Suspect epidemic typhus based on clinical manifestations and signs of louse infestation and recent residence in or travel to an endemic region; confirm with fluorescent antibody staining of skin biopsy. Treat with doxycycline or chloramphenicol. Brill-Zinsser Disease Brill-Zinsser disease is a recrudescence of epidemic typhus, occurring years after an initial attack. Patients with Brill-Zinsser disease acquired epidemic typhus earlier or lived in an endemic area. Apparently, when host defenses falter, viable organisms retained in the body are activated, causing recurrent typhus; thus, disease is sporadic, occurring at any season or geographic area, and in the absence of infected lice. Lice that feed on patients may acquire and transmit the agent. Symptoms and signs of Brill-Zinsser disease are almost always mild and resemble those of epidemic typhus, with similar circulatory disturbances and hepatic, renal, and central nervous system changes. The remittent febrile course lasts about 7 to 10 days. The rash is often evanescent or absent. Mortality is nil.

Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy.

Risk Factors for Breast Cancer For women in the US, cumulative lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 12% (1 in 8 [ 1 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Much of the risk is incurred after age 60 . Risk of dying of breast cancer is about 10% by 5 years after diagnosis (2 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Table Factors that may affect breast cancer risk include the following: Age: The strongest risk factor for breast cancer is age. Median age at diagnosis is about 60 years (1 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Family history: Having a 1st-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) with breast cancer doubles or triples risk of developing the cancer, but breast cancer in more distant relatives increases risk only slightly. When ≥ 2 1st-degree relatives have breast cancer, risk may be 5 to 6 times higher. Breast cancer gene mutation: About 5 to 10% of women with breast cancer carry a mutation in one of the two known breast cancer genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2. The risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 is about 72% with a BRCA1 mutation and about 69% with a BRCA2 mutation. Women with BRCA1 mutations also have an approximate 44% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer; risk among women with BRCA2 mutations is about 17% (3 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Women without a family history of breast cancer in at least two 1st-degree relatives are unlikely to carry this mutation and thus do not require screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Men who carry a BRCA mutation have a 1 to 2% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The mutations are more common among Ashkenazi Jews. Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations require closer surveillance or preventive measures, such as screening with both mammography and MRI, taking tamoxifen or raloxifene, or undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy. Personal history: Having had in situ or invasive breast cancer increases risk. Risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast after mastectomy is about 0.5 to 1%/year of follow-up. Gynecologic history: Early menarche, late menopause, or late first pregnancy increases risk. Women who have a first pregnancy after age 30 are at higher risk than those who are nulliparous. Breast changes: History of a lesion that required a biopsy is associated with a slightly increased risk. Women with multiple breast masses but no histologic confirmation of a high-risk histology should not be considered at high risk. Benign lesions associated with a slightly increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer include complex fibroadenoma, moderate or florid hyperplasia (without atypia), sclerosing adenosis, and papilloma. Risk is about 4 or 5 times higher than average in patients with atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and about 10 times higher if they have a family history of invasive breast cancer in a 1st-degree relative. Increased breast density seen on screening mammography is associated with a 1.2- to 2.1-fold increased risk of breast cancer (5 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): Having LCIS increases the risk of developing invasive carcinoma in either breast by about 7 to 12 times (6 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.LCIS annually. Use of oral contraceptives: Study results vary regarding the use of oral contraceptives and risk of breast cancer Breast Cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Some studies have found a small increased risk in current or recent users (7 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Hormone therapy Hormone Therapy Menopause is physiologic or iatrogenic cessation of menses (amenorrhea) due to decreased ovarian function.Menopausal hormone (estrogen plus a progestin) therapy appears to increase risk modestly after only 3 years of use (8 Risk factor references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. After 5 years of use, the increased risk is about 7 or 8 more cases per 10,000 women for each year of use (about a 24% increase in relative risk). Use of estrogen alone does not appear to increase risk of breast cancer (as reported in the Women's Health Initiative). Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene) reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Radiation therapy: Exposure to radiation therapy before age 30 increases risk. Mantle-field radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma about quadruples risk of breast cancer over the next 20 to 30 years. Diet: Diet may contribute to development or growth of breast cancers, but conclusive evidence about the effect of a particular diet (eg, one high in fats) is lacking. Obese postmenopausal women are at increased risk, but there is no evidence that dietary modification reduces risk. For obese women who are menstruating later than normal, risk may be decreased. Lifestyle factors: Smoking and alcohol may contribute to a higher risk of breast cancer. Women are counseled to stop smoking and to reduce alcohol consumption. In epidemiologic studies, alcohol intake is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer; however, causality is difficult to establish. The American Cancer Society recommends no more than one alcoholic drink a day for women. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), or Gail model Mammography , can be used to calculate a women's 5-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Accessed 3/7/22. 6.

Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators: Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial Pathology of Breast Cancer Most breast cancers are epithelial tumors that develop from cells lining ducts or lobules; less common are nonepithelial cancers of the supporting stroma (eg, angiosarcoma, primary stromal sarcomas, phyllodes tumor). Cancers are divided into carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer. Carcinoma in situ is proliferation of cancer cells within ducts or lobules and without invasion of stromal tissue. There are 2 types: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): About 85% of carcinoma in situ are this type. DCIS is usually detected only by mammography. It may involve a small or wide area of the breast; if a wide area is involved, microscopic invasive foci may develop over time. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS is often multifocal and bilateral. There are 2 types: classic and pleomorphic. Classic LCIS is not malignant but increases risk of developing invasive carcinoma in either breast. This nonpalpable lesion is usually detected via biopsy; it is rarely visualized with mammography. Pleomorphic LCIS behaves more like DCIS; it should be excised to negative margins. Invasive carcinoma is primarily adenocarcinoma. About 80% is the infiltrating ductal type; most of the remaining cases are infiltrating lobular. Rare types include medullary, mucinous, metaplastic, and tubular carcinomas. Mucinous carcinoma tends to develop in older women and be slow growing. Women with most of these rare types of breast cancer have a much better prognosis than women with other types of invasive breast cancer. However, the prognosis for women with metaplastic breast cancer is significantly worse than other types of ductal breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is a fast-growing, particularly aggressive, and often fatal cancer. Cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels in breast skin; as a result, the breast appears inflamed, and the skin appears thickened, resembling orange peel (peau d’orange). Usually, inflammatory breast cancer spreads to the lymph nodes in the armpit. The lymph nodes feel like hard lumps. However, often no mass is felt in the breast itself because this cancer is dispersed throughout the breast. Paget disease of the nipple Paget Disease of the Nipple Paget disease is a rare type of carcinoma that appears as a unilateral eczematous to psoriasiform plaque of the nipple and areola.Paget disease) is a form of ductal carcinoma in situ that extends into the skin over the nipple and areola, manifesting with a skin lesion (eg, an eczematous or a psoriaform lesion). Characteristic malignant cells called Paget cells are present in the epidermis. Women with Paget disease of the nipple often have underlying invasive or in situ cancer. Pathophysiology of Breast Cancer Breast cancer invades locally and spreads through the regional lymph nodes, bloodstream, or both. Metastatic breast cancer may affect almost any organ in the body—most commonly, lungs, liver, bone, brain, and skin. Most skin metastases occur near the site of breast surgery; scalp metastases are uncommon. Some breast cancers may recur sooner than others; recurrence can often be predicted based on tumor markers. For example, metastatic breast cancer may occur within 3 years in patients who are negative for tumor markers or occur > 10 years after initial diagnosis and treatment in patients who have an estrogen-receptor positive tumor. Hormone receptors Estrogen and progesterone receptors, present in some breast cancers, are nuclear hormone receptors that promote DNA replication and cell division when the appropriate hormones bind to them. Thus, drugs that block these receptors may be useful in treating tumors with the receptors. About two thirds of postmenopausal patients with cancer have an estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) tumor. Incidence of ER+ tumors is lower among premenopausal patients. Another cellular receptor is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also called HER2/neu or Erb.B2); its presence correlates with a poorer prognosis at any given stage of cancer. In about 20% of patients with breast cancer, HER2 receptors are overexpressed. Drugs that block these receptors are part of standard treatment for these patients. Breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations increase the risk of developing breast cancer to 70% (1 Pathophysiology references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer by 90% and should be offered to women with a BRCA mutation. Other genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing breast cancer include mutations in CHEK2, PALB2, ATM, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1, and TP53, which are usually included in panel genetic testing (2 Pathophysiology references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Epub 2021 Jan 20. Symptoms and Signs of Breast Cancer Many breast cancers are discovered as a mass by the patient or during routine physical examination or mammography. Infrequently, the presenting symptom is breast enlargement or a nondescript thickening of the breast. Breast pain may be present but is almost never the sole presenting symptom of breast cancer. Some types of breast cancer manifest with notable skin changes: Paget disease of the nipple is associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma and manifests as skin changes, including erythema, crusting, scaling, and discharge; these changes usually appear so benign that the patient ignores them, delaying diagnosis for a year or more. About 50% of patients with Paget disease of the nipple have a palpable mass at presentation. Inflammatory breast cancer manifests as erythema and enlargement of the breast, often without a mass, and skin may be discolored or appear thickened, resembling orange peel (peau d’orange). A nipple discharge is common. A few patients with breast cancer present with signs of metastatic disease (eg, pathologic fracture, abdominal pain, jaundice, dyspnea). A common finding during physical examination is asymmetry or a dominant mass—a mass distinctly different from the surrounding breast tissue. Diffuse fibrotic changes in a quadrant of the breast, usually the upper outer quadrant, are more characteristic of benign disorders; a slightly firmer thickening in one breast but not the other may be a sign of cancer. More advanced breast cancers are characterized by one or more of the following: Fixation of the mass to the chest wall or to overlying skin Satellite nodules or ulcers in the skin Matted or fixed axillary lymph nodes suggest tumor spread, as does supraclavicular or infraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Screening for Breast Cancer Women should be screened for breast cancer (1 Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. All professional societies agree on this concept, although they differ on the recommended age at which to start screening and the precise frequency of screening. Screening modalities include Mammography (including digital and 3-dimensional) Clinical breast examination (CBE) by health care practitioners Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for high-risk patients Mammography In mammography, low-dose x-rays of both breasts are taken in 2 views (oblique and craniocaudal). Mammography is more accurate in women over 50, partly because with aging, fibroglandular tissue in breasts tends to be replaced with fatty tissue, which can be more easily distinguished from abnormal tissue. Mammography is less sensitive in women with dense breast tissue, and some states mandate informing patients that they have dense breast tissue when it is detected by screening mammography. Women with dense breast tissue may require additional imaging tests (eg, breast tomosynthesis [3-dimensional mammography], MRI). Screening mammography guidelines for women with average risk of breast cancer vary, but generally, screening starts at age 40, 45, or 50 and is repeated every year or two until age 75 or life expectancy is < 10 years . Clinicians should make sure that patients understand what their individual risk of breast cancer is and ask patients what their preference for testing is. Table The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), or Gail model, can be used to calculate a woman's 5-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. A woman is considered at average risk if her lifetime risk of breast cancer is < 15%. Concerns about when and how often to do screening mammography include Rate of false-positive results Risks and costs Only about 10 to 15% of abnormalities detected on screening mammography result from cancer—an 85 to 90% false-positive rate. False-negative results may exceed 15% (3 Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Many of the false-positives are caused by benign lesions (eg, cysts, fibroadenomas), but there are concerns about detecting lesions that meet histologic definitions of cancer but do not develop into invasive cancer during a patient's lifetime. Breast tomosynthesis (3-dimensional mammography), done with digital mammography, increases the rate of cancer detection slightly and decreases the rate of recall imaging (4 Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. However, the test exposes women to almost twice as much radiation as traditional mammography. When radiologic screening is started at a young age, risk of cancer is increased. Breast examination Clinical breast examination (CBE) is usually part of routine annual care for women > 40 (1 Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. In the US, CBE augments rather than replaces screening mammography. The American Cancer Society and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against screening with clinical breast examination (CBE); the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends counseling patients about its diagnostic limitations (1 Screening references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. However, in some countries where mammography is considered too expensive, CBE is the sole screen; reports on its effectiveness in this role vary. Breast self-examination (BSE) alone as a screening method has not shown a benefit and may result in higher rates of unnecessary breast biopsy. The major professional organizations do not recommend it as part of routine screening. However, women should be counseled about breast self-awareness, and if they notice changes in how their breasts appear or feel (eg, masses, thickening, enlargement), they should be encouraged to have a medical evaluation. MRI is used for screening women with a high (eg, > 20%) risk of breast cancer, such as those with a BRCA gene mutation. For these women, screening should include MRI as well as mammography and CBE. MRI has higher sensitivity but may be less specific. MRI may be recommended for women with dense breast tissue as part of overall assessment that includes evaluation of risk. Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Screening by mammography, breast examination, and imaging (eg, ultrasonography) Biopsy, including analysis for estrogen and progesterone receptors and for HER2 protein Breast symptoms (eg, pain, nipple discharge) or abnormal findings (eg, mass) detected during breast examination are typically evaluated first with breast ultrasonography. If ultrasound results are abnormal or indeterminate, mammography is done. Biopsy is done if imaging findings suggest cancer or if a palpable breast mass or other physical findings suggest cancer, even if imaging results are negative. If advanced cancer is suspected based on physical examination, biopsy should be done first. A prebiopsy bilateral mammogram may help delineate other areas that should be biopsied and provides a baseline for future reference. Pearls & Pitfalls Biopsy should be done if physical findings (eg, palpable mass) suggest breast cancer, even if mammogram results are negative. Biopsy Percutaneous core needle biopsy is preferred to surgical biopsy. Core biopsy can be done guided by imaging or palpation (freehand). Routinely, stereotactic biopsy (needle biopsy guided by mammography done in 2 planes and analyzed by computer to produce a 3-dimensional image) or ultrasound-guided biopsy is being used to improve accuracy. Clips are placed at the biopsy site to identify it. If core biopsy is not possible (eg, the lesion is too posterior), surgical biopsy can be done; a guidewire is inserted, using imaging for guidance, to help identify the biopsy site. Any skin taken with the biopsy specimen should be examined because it may show cancer cells in dermal lymphatic vessels. The excised specimen should be x-rayed, and the x-ray should be compared with the prebiopsy mammogram to determine whether all of the lesion has been removed. If the original lesion contained microcalcifications, mammography is repeated when the breast is no longer tender, usually 6 to 12 weeks after biopsy, to check for residual microcalcifications. If radiation therapy is planned, mammography should be done before radiation therapy begins. Evaluation after cancer diagnosis After cancer is diagnosed, a multidisciplinary evaluation is usually done to plan further testing and treatment. The core multidisciplinary team typically includes a breast surgical oncologist, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist. A positive biopsy specimen should be analyzed for estrogen and progesterone receptors and for HER2 protein. Cells from blood or saliva should be tested for inherited gene mutations that predispose to breast cancer when Breast cancer develops at age < 45. The cancer does not have estrogen or progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2 protein (triple negative breast cancer). Breast and ovarian cancers occur in the same patient. Patients have lobular breast cancer plus a personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer. Family history includes multiple cases of early-onset breast cancer. Family history of multiple cases of ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer. Patients have an Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Patient is male or family history includes any cases of male breast cancer. Some experts have recommended that genetic testing be offered to all patients with breast cancer (1 Diagnosis reference Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. For these tests, the best approach is to refer patients to a genetic counselor, who can document a detailed family history, choose the most appropriate tests, and help interpret the results. Chest x-ray, a complete blood count (CBC), liver tests, and measurement of serum calcium levels should be done to check for metastatic disease. An oncologist should determine whether to measure serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, or CA 27-29 and whether bone scanning should be done. For bone scanning, common indications include the following: Bone pain Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase Stage III or IV cancer Abdominal CT is done if patients have any of the following: Abnormal liver test results Abnormal abdominal or pelvic examination Stage III or IV cancer Chest CT is done if patients have either of the following: Pulmonary symptoms such as shortness of breath Stage III or IV cancer MRI is often used by surgeons for preoperative planning; it can accurately determine tumor size, chest wall involvement, and number of tumors. Grading and staging Grading is based on histologic examination of the tissue taken during biopsy. Tumor grade describes how abnormal tumor cells and tissue look under a microscope. Staging follows the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification . Because clinical examination and imaging have poor sensitivity for nodal involvement, staging is refined during surgery, when regional lymph nodes can be evaluated. However, if patients have palpably abnormal axillary nodes, preoperative ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration or core biopsy may be done: If biopsy results are positive, axillary lymph node dissection is typically done during the definitive surgical procedure. However, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may make sentinel lymph node biopsy possible if chemotherapy changes node status from N1 to N0. (Results of intraoperative frozen section analysis determine whether axillary lymph node dissection will be needed.) If results are negative, a sentinel lymph node biopsy, a less aggressive procedure, may be done instead. Staging classification follows these models: The anatomic staging model, which is based on anatomy of the tumor and which is used in regions of the world where biomarkers cannot be routinely obtained  The prognostic staging model, which is based on anatomy of the tumor as well as status of biomarkers and which is predominantly used in the US Table Fertility preservation Patients with breast cancer should not become pregnant while being treated for breast cancer. However, all patients who wish to preserve fertility should be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist to discuss fertility preservation before systemic therapy is initiated. Options for fertility preservation include Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) with ovarian stimulation and oocyte and embryo cryopreservation Ovarian or testicular tissue cryopreservation Type of breast cancer, anticipated treatment, and patient preferences affect the type of fertility preservation that can be used. Ovarian suppression (eg, with leuprolide) has been used to minimize the destruction of ova by chemotherapy, but its efficacy is unproven. Diagnosis reference 1. The American Society of Breast Surgeons: Official statement: Consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. Prognosis for Breast Cancer Long-term prognosis depends on tumor stage. Nodal status (including number and location of nodes) correlates with disease-free and overall survival better than any other prognostic factor. The 5-year survival rate (from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program) depends on cancer stage: Localized (confined to primary site): 99.0% Regional (confined to regional lymph nodes): 85.8% Distant (metastasized): 29.0% Unknown: 57.8% Poorer prognosis is associated with the following other factors: Young age: Prognosis appears worse for patients diagnosed with breast cancer during their 20s and 30s than for patients diagnosed during middle age. Race: Breast cancer death rates from 2012 to 2016 were higher in the US in non-Hispanic Black females (28.9 per 100,000) than in non-Hispanic White females (20.6 per 100,000 [ 1 Prognosis reference Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Black women are diagnosed at a younger age compared with White women (median 59 versus 63 years) and are more likely to have triple negative disease. Larger primary tumor: Larger tumors are more likely to be node-positive, but they also confer a worse prognosis independent of nodal status. High-grade tumor: Patients with poorly differentiated tumors have a worse prognosis. Absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors: Patients with ER+ tumors have a somewhat better prognosis and are more likely to benefit from endocrine therapy. Patients with progesterone receptors on a tumor may also have a better prognosis. Patients with both estrogen and progesterone receptors on a tumor may have a better prognosis than those who have only one of these receptors, but this benefit is not clear. Presence of HER2 protein: When the HER2 gene (HER2/neu [erb-b2]) is amplified, HER2 is overexpressed, increasing cell growth and reproduction and often resulting in more aggressive tumor cells. Overexpression of HER2 is an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis; it may also be associated with high histologic grade, ER− tumors, greater proliferation, and larger tumor size, which are all poor prognostic factors. Presence of BRCA gene mutations: For any given stage, patients with the BRCA1 gene mutation appear to have a worse prognosis than those with sporadic tumors, perhaps because they have a higher proportion of high-grade, hormone receptor–negative cancers. Patients with the BRCA2 gene mutation probably have the same prognosis as those without the mutation if the tumors have similar characteristics. With either gene mutation, risk of a 2nd cancer in remaining breast tissue is increased (to perhaps as high as 40%). Prognosis reference 1. American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts & Figures or African Americans 2019-2021. Treatment of Breast Cancer Surgery Usually radiation therapy Systemic therapy: Endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or both For more detailed information about treatment, see NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline: Breast Cancer. For most types of breast cancer, treatment involves surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy. Choice of treatment depends on tumor and patient characteristics . Recommendations for surgery are evolving and include early referral to a plastic or reconstruction surgeon for oncoplastic surgery (which combines cancer removal with reconstruction of the breast). Table Surgery involves mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy. Mastectomy is removal of the entire breast and includes the following types: Skin-sparing mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and enough skin to cover the wound, making breast reconstruction much easier, and spares axillary lymph nodes Nipple-sparing mastectomy: Same as skin-sparing mastectomy plus spares the nipple and areola Simple mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and axillary lymph nodes Modified radical mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and removes some axillary lymph nodes Radical mastectomy: Removes axillary lymph nodes and the pectoral muscles Radical mastectomy is rarely done unless the cancer has invaded the pectoral muscles. Breast-conserving surgery involves determining the size of the tumor and the required margins (based on the tumor's size relative to the volume of the breast), then surgically removing the tumor with its margins. Various terms (eg, lumpectomy, wide excision, quadrantectomy) are used to describe how much breast tissue is removed. For patients with invasive cancer, survival and recurrence rates with mastectomy do not differ significantly from those with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy as long as the entire tumor can be removed. Thus, patient preference can guide choice of treatment within limits. The main advantage of breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy is less extensive surgery and opportunity to keep the breasts. The need for total removal of the tumor with a tumor-free margin overrides any cosmetic considerations. Consulting a plastic surgeon about oncoplastic surgery may help if patients have ptotic (sagging) breasts, while also achieving good resection margins. Some physicians use neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before removing it and applying radiation therapy; thus, some patients who might otherwise have required mastectomy can have breast-conserving surgery. Lymph node evaluation During both mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery, axillary lymph nodes are typically evaluated. Methods include Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) ALND is a fairly extensive procedure that involves removal of as many axillary nodes as possible; adverse effects, particularly lymphedema, are common. Risk of lymphedema is increased for patients with a high preoperative body mass index (BMI ≥ 30) and for those with significant weight gain during and after breast cancer treatment (1 Treatment references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most clinicians now first do SLNB unless biopsy of clinically suspect nodes detected cancer; risk of lymphedema is less with SLNB. Routine use of ALND is not justified because the main value of lymph node removal is diagnostic, not therapeutic, and SLNB has ≥ 95% sensitivity for axillary node involvement. For SLNB, blue dye and/or radioactive colloid is injected around the breast, and a gamma probe (and when dye is used, direct inspection) is used to locate the nodes the tracer drains into. Because these nodes are the first to receive the tracers, they are considered the most likely to receive any metastatic cells and are thus called sentinel nodes. If any of the sentinel nodes contain cancer cells, ALND may be necessary, based on numerous factors such as Tumor stage Hormone receptor status Number of involved nodes Extranodal extension Patient characteristics (2 Treatment references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.Some surgeons do frozen section analysis during mastectomy with SLNB and get prior agreement for ALND in case nodes are positive; others await standard pathology results and do ALND as a 2nd procedure if needed. Frozen section analysis is not routinely done with lumpectomy. Impaired lymphatic drainage of the ipsilateral arm often occurs after axillary node removal (ALND or SLNB) or radiation therapy, sometimes resulting in substantial swelling due to lymphedema. Magnitude of the effect is roughly proportional to the number of nodes removed; thus, SLNB causes less lymphedema than ALND. The lifetime risk of lymphedema after ALND is about 25%. However, even with SLNB, there is a 6% lifetime risk of lymphedema. To reduce risk of lymphedema, practitioners usually avoid giving IV infusions on the affected side. Wearing compression garments and preventing infection in the affected limbs (eg, by wearing gloves during yard work) are important. Avoiding ipsilateral blood pressure measurement and venipuncture is sometimes also recommended, even though supporting evidence is minimal (3 Treatment references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. If lymphedema develops, a specially trained therapist must treat it. Special massage techniques used once or twice a day may help drain fluid from congested areas toward functioning lymph basins; low-stretch bandaging is applied immediately after manual drainage, and patients should exercise daily as prescribed. After the lymphedema lessens, typically in 1 to 4 weeks, patients continue daily exercise and overnight bandaging of the affected limb indefinitely. Reconstructive procedures Reconstructive procedures include the following: Prosthetic reconstruction: Placement of a silicone or saline implant, sometimes after a tissue expander is used Autologous reconstruction: Muscle flap transfer (using the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, or the lower rectus abdominis) or muscle-free flap transfer Breast reconstruction can be done during the initial mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery or later as a separate procedure. Timing of surgery depends on patient preference as well as the need for adjuvant therapy such as radiation therapy. However, doing radiation therapy first limits the types of reconstructive surgery that can be done. Thus, consulting a plastic surgeon early during treatment planning is recommended. Advantages of breast reconstruction include improved mental health in patients who have a mastectomy. Disadvantages include surgical complications and possible long-term adverse effects of implants. Early consultation with a plastic surgeon should also be considered when lumpectomy (especially lower breast or upper inner quadrant lumpectomy) is being done. The best candidates for oncoplastic surgery (which combines cancer removal with reconstruction of the breast) are patients with ptotic (sagging) breasts. Contralateral mastopexy may improve symmetry. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is an option for some women with breast cancer (eg, those with a genetic mutation conferring a high risk of breast cancer). In women with lobular carcinoma in situ in one breast, invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast. Thus, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for these women is bilateral mastectomy. Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option. Advantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include Decreased risk of contralateral breast cancer (especially in women in a family history of breast or ovarian cancer) Improvement in survival in breast cancer patients with an inherited genetic mutation (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) and possibly in women diagnosed at age < 50 years Decreased anxiety in some patients Decreased need for cumbersome follow-up imaging Disadvantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include An almost two-fold increase in surgical complication rates Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is not mandatory for patients with the highest risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast. Close surveillance is a reasonable alternative. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces incidence of local recurrence in the breast and in regional lymph nodes and may improve overall survival. However, if patients are > 70 and have early ER+ breast cancer, adding radiation therapy to lumpectomy plus tamoxifen may not be necessary; adding radiation therapy does not significantly decrease the rate of mastectomy for local recurrence or the occurrence of distant metastases nor increase the survival rate (4 Treatment references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Radiation therapy is indicated after mastectomy if any of the following is present: The primary tumor is ≥ 5 cm. Axillary nodes are involved. Margins are positive for cancer in resected tissue. In such cases, radiation therapy after mastectomy significantly reduces incidence of local recurrence on the chest wall and in regional lymph nodes and improves overall survival. Adverse effects of radiation therapy (eg, fatigue, skin changes) are usually transient and mild. Late adverse effects (eg, lymphedema, brachial plexopathy, radiation pneumonitis, rib damage, secondary cancers, cardiac toxicity) are less common. To improve radiation therapy, researchers are studying several new procedures. Many of these procedures aim to target radiation to the cancer more precisely and spare the rest of the breast from the effects of radiation. Adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy  Chemotherapy or endocrine therapy delay or prevent recurrence in almost all patients and prolong survival in some. However, studies have shown that chemotherapy is not necessary for many small (< 0.5 to 1 cm) tumors with no lymph node involvement (particularly in postmenopausal patients) because the prognosis is already excellent. Usual indications for chemotherapy are one or more of the following: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) oncogene-positive ER/PR+ and positive lymph nodes in a premenopausal patient ER/PR+ and HER2- with high Oncotype Dx™ score Relative reduction in risk of recurrence and death with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy is the same regardless of the clinical-pathologic stage of the cancer. Thus, absolute benefit is greater for patients with a greater risk of recurrence or death (ie, a 20% relative risk reduction reduces a 10% recurrence rate to 8% but a 50% rate to 40%). Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces annual odds of death (relative risk) on average by 25 to 35% for premenopausal patients; for postmenopausal patients, the reduction is about half of that (9 to 19%), and the absolute benefit in 10-year survival is much smaller. Postmenopausal patients with ER– tumors benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy . For ER+ breast cancer, predictive genomic testing of the primary breast cancer is being used increasingly to stratify risk in patients and to determine whether combination chemotherapy or endocrine therapy alone is indicated. Common prognostic tests include The 21-gene recurrence score assay (based on Oncotype Dx™) The Amsterdam 70-gene profile (Mamma.Print®) The 50-gene risk of recurrence score (PAM50 assay) In the US, most women with breast cancer have ER+/PR+/HER- breast cancer with negative axillary nodes. In these women, a low or intermediate score on the 21-gene recurrence score assay predicts similar survival rates with chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy and with endocrine therapy alone. Therefore, in this subset of women with breast cancer, chemotherapy may not be necessary. Chemotherapy is usually begun soon after surgery. If systemic chemotherapy is not required, endocrine therapy is usually begun soon after surgery and is continued for 5 to 10 years. If tumors are > 5 cm, systemic therapy may be started before surgery. Table Combination chemotherapy regimens are more effective than a single drug. Dose-dense regimens given for 4 to 6 months are preferred; in dose-dense regimens, the time between doses is shorter than that in standard-dose regimens. There are many regimens; a commonly used one is ACT (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel). Acute adverse effects depend on the regimen but usually include nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, alopecia, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, and thrombocytopenia. Growth factors that stimulate bone marrow (eg, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim) are commonly used to reduce risk of fever and infection due to chemotherapy. Long-term adverse effects are infrequent with most regimens; death due to infection or bleeding is rare (< 0.2%). If tumors overexpress HER2 (HER2+), anti-HER2 drugs (trastuzumab, pertuzumab) may be used. Adding the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to chemotherapy provides substantial benefit. Trastuzumab is usually continued for a year, although the optimal duration of therapy is unknown. If lymph nodes are involved, adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab improves disease-free survival. A serious potential adverse effect of both these anti-HER2 drugs is a decreased cardiac ejection fraction. With endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), benefit depends on estrogen and progesterone receptor expression; benefit is Greatest when tumors have expressed estrogen and progesterone receptors Nearly as great when they have only estrogen receptors Minimal when they have only progesterone receptors Absent when they have neither receptor In patients with ER+ tumors, particularly low-risk tumors, endocrine therapy may be used instead of chemotherapy. Tamoxifen: This drug competitively binds with estrogen receptors. Adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years reduces annual odds of death by about 25% in premenopausal and postmenopausal women regardless of axillary lymph node involvement; treatment for 2 years is not as effective. If tumors have estrogen receptors, treatment for 10 years appears to prolong survival and reduce recurrence risk compared with 5 years of treatment. Tamoxifen can induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms but reduces incidence of contralateral breast cancer and lowers serum cholesterol. Tamoxifen increases bone density in postmenopausal women and may reduce risk of fractures and ischemic heart disease. However, it significantly increases risk of developing endometrial cancer Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Typically, it manifests as postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Staging is surgical. Thus, if such women have spotting or bleeding, they must be evaluated for endometrial cancer. Nonetheless, the improved survival for women with breast cancer far outweighs increased risk of death due to endometrial cancer. Risk of thromboembolism is also increased. Aromatase inhibitors: These drugs (anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) block peripheral production of estrogen in postmenopausal women. More effective than tamoxifen, these drugs are becoming the preferred treatment for early-stage hormone receptor–positive cancer in postmenopausal patients. Letrozole may be used in postmenopausal women who have completed tamoxifen treatment. Optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy is uncertain. A recent trial showed that extending treatment to 10 years resulted in a lower rate of breast cancer recurrence and higher rate of disease-free survival. There was no change in overall survival and a higher rate of fractures and osteoporosis in patients treated for an extended time. Patients with DCIS are often treated with daily oral tamoxifen. For postmenopausal women, an aromatase inhibitor is preferred. Metastatic disease Any indication of metastases should prompt immediate evaluation. Treatment of metastases increases median survival by 6 months or longer. These treatments (eg, chemotherapy), although relatively toxic, may palliate symptoms and improve quality of life. Thus, the decision to be treated may be highly personal. Choice of therapy depends on the following: Hormone-receptor status of the tumor Length of the disease-free interval (from remission to manifestation of metastases) Number of metastatic sites and organs affected Patient’s menopausal status Systemic endocrine therapy or chemotherapy is usually used to treat symptomatic metastatic disease. Initially, patients with multiple metastatic sites outside the central nervous system (CNS) should be given systemic therapy. If metastases are asymptomatic, there is no proof that treatment substantially increases survival, and it may reduce quality of life. Endocrine therapy is preferred over chemotherapy for patients with any of the following: ER+ tumors A disease-free interval of > 2 years Disease that is not immediately life threatening In premenopausal women, tamoxifen is often used first. Reasonable alternatives include ovarian ablation by surgery, radiation therapy, and use of a luteinizing-releasing hormone agonist (eg, buserelin, goserelin, leuprolide). Some experts combine ovarian ablation with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors are being increasingly used as primary endocrine therapy. If the cancer initially responds to endocrine therapy but progresses months or years later, additional forms of endocrine therapy (eg, progestins, the antiestrogen fulvestrant) may be used sequentially until no further response occurs. The most effective chemotherapy drugs are capecitabine, doxorubicin (including its liposomal formulation), gemcitabine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Response rate to a combination of drugs is higher than that to a single drug, but survival is not improved and toxicity is increased. Thus, some oncologists use single drugs sequentially. Anti-HER2 drugs (eg, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) are used to treat tumors that overexpress HER2. These drugs are effective in treating and controlling visceral metastatic sites. Trastuzumab is used alone or with endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or pertuzumab. Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy plus pertuzumab slows the growth of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and increases survival more than trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (5 Treatment references Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, lapatinib, neratinib) are being increasingly used in women with HER2+ tumors. Radiation therapy alone may be used to treat isolated, symptomatic bone lesions or local skin recurrences not amenable to surgical resection. Radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for brain metastases, occasionally providing long-term control. Palliative mastectomy is sometimes an option for patients with stable metastatic breast cancer. IV bisphosphonates (eg, pamidronate, zoledronate) decrease bone pain and bone loss and prevent or delay skeletal complications due to bone metastases. About 10% of patients with bone metastases eventually develop hypercalcemia, which can also be treated with IV bisphosphonates. End-of-life issues For patients with metastatic breast cancer, quality of life may deteriorate, and the chances that further treatment will prolong life may be small. Palliation may eventually become more important than prolongation of life. Cancer pain Physical, psychologic, emotional, and spiritual distress is common among patients living with fatal illness, and patients commonly fear protracted and unrelieved suffering.Opioid Analgesics Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. Other symptoms (eg, constipation, difficulty breathing, nausea) should also be treated. Psychologic and spiritual counseling should be offered. Patients with metastatic breast cancer should be encouraged to prepare advance directives Advance Directives Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated. Prevention of Breast Cancer Chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene may be indicated for women with the following: Age > 35 and previous LCIS or atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia Presence of high-risk mutations (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, Li-Fraumeni syndrome) Age 35 to 59 and a 5-year risk of developing breast cancer > 1.66%, based on the multivariable Gail model, which includes the women’s current age, age at menarche, age at first live childbirth, number of 1st-degree relatives with breast cancer, and results of prior breast biopsies A computer program to calculate breast cancer risk by the Gail model is available from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at 1-800-4CANCER and on the NCI web site. Recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for chemoprevention of breast cancer are available at the USPSTF web site. Patients should be informed of risks before beginning chemoprevention. Risks of tamoxifen include Endometrial cancer Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Staging is surgical.Thromboembolic complications Cataracts Possibly stroke Risks are higher for older women. Raloxifene appears to be about as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and to have a lower risk of endometrial cancer, thromboembolic complications, and cataracts. Raloxifene, like tamoxifen, may also increase bone density. Raloxifene should be considered as an alternative to tamoxifen for chemoprevention in postmenopausal women. Key Points Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women; cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 95 is 12%. Factors that greatly increase risk include breast cancer in close relatives (particularly if a BRCA gene mutation is present), atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and significant exposure to chest radiation therapy before age 30. Screen women by doing clinical breast examination, mammography (beginning at age 50 and often at age 40), and, for women at high risk, MRI. Factors suggesting a poorer prognosis include younger age, absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and presence of HER2 protein or BRCA gene mutations. For most women, treatment requires surgical removal, lymph node sampling, systemic therapy (endocrine therapy or chemotherapy), and radiation therapy. Treat with endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor) if tumors have hormone receptors. Consider treating metastatic disease to relieve symptoms (eg, with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or, for bone metastases, radiation therapy or bisphosphonates), even though survival is unlikely to be prolonged. Consider chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene for women at high risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Vaginal bleeding is also associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes such as the following: Low birth weight Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) Infant Infants whose weight is < the 10th percentile for gestational age are classified as small for gestational age.Preterm birth Preterm Labor (contractions resulting in cervical change) that begins before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm.Stillbirth is fetal death (fetal demise) at ≥ 20 weeks gestation (> 28 weeks in some definitions). Management is delivery and postpartum care.Perinatal death Etiology Obstetric or nonobstetric disorders may cause vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy A ruptured corpus luteum cyst Functional ovarian cysts Benign ovarian masses include functional cysts (eg, corpus luteum cysts) and neoplasms (eg, benign teratomas). Most are asymptomatic; some cause pelvic pain. The most common cause is Spontaneous abortion Spontaneous Abortion Spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation.Table Evaluation A pregnant woman with vaginal bleeding must be evaluated promptly. Ectopic pregnancy or other causes of copious vaginal bleeding (eg, inevitable abortion, ruptured hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst) can lead to hemorrhagic shock. IV access should be established early during evaluation in case such complications occur. History of present illness should include the following: The patient’s gravidity (number of confirmed pregnancies), parity (number of deliveries after 20 weeks), and number of abortions (spontaneous or induced) Description and amount of bleeding, including how many pads were soaked and whether clots or tissue were passed Presence or absence of pain If pain is present, onset, location, duration, and character should be determined. Review of symptoms should note fever, chills, abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, and neurologic symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, or near syncope. Past medical History should include risk factors for ectopic pregnancy History and spontaneous abortion History . Physical examination Physical examination includes review of vital signs for fever and signs of hypovolemia (tachycardia, hypotension). Evaluation focuses on abdominal and pelvic examinations. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity, guarding), and uterine size. Fetal heart sounds should be checked with a Doppler ultrasound probe. Pelvic examination includes inspection of external genitals, speculum examination, and bimanual examination. Blood or products of conception in the vaginal vault, if present, are removed; products of conception are sent to a laboratory for confirmation. The cervix should be inspected for discharge, dilation, lesions, polyps, and tissue in the os. If the pregnancy is < 14 weeks, the cervical os may be gently probed (but no more than fingertip depth) using ringed forceps to determine the integrity of the internal cervical os. If the pregnancy is ≥ 14 weeks, the cervix should not be probed because the vascular placenta may tear, especially if it covers the internal os (placenta previa). Bimanual examination should check for cervical motion tenderness, adnexal masses or tenderness, and uterine size. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, or both) Orthostatic changes in pulse or blood pressure Syncope or near-syncope Peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity, guarding) Fever, chills, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge Interpretation of findings Clinical findings help suggest a cause but are rarely diagnostic . However, a dilated cervix plus passage of fetal tissue and crampy abdominal pain strongly suggests spontaneous abortion, and septic abortion is usually apparent from the circumstances and signs of severe infection (fever, toxic appearance, purulent or bloody discharge). Even if these classic manifestations are not present, threatened or missed abortion is possible, and the most serious cause—ruptured ectopic pregnancy—must be excluded. Although the classic description of ectopic pregnancy includes severe pain, peritoneal signs, and a tender adnexal mass, ectopic pregnancy can manifest in many ways and should always be considered, even when bleeding appears scant and pain appears minimal. Testing A self-diagnosed pregnancy is verified with a urine test.Rho(D) immune globulin is needed to prevent maternal sensitization. If bleeding is substantial, testing should also include complete blood count and either type and screen (for abnormal antibodies) or cross-matching. For major hemorrhage or shock, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) is also determined. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography is done to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy unless products of conception have been obtained intact (indicating completed abortion). If patients are in shock or bleeding is substantial, ultrasonography should be done at the bedside. The quantitative beta-hCG level helps interpret ultrasound results. Beta-hCG levels of ≥ 1000 to 2000 mIU/mL are commonly used as the discriminatory level; if the level is above the discriminatory level, a gestational sac may be visible if the pregnancy is intrauterine. However, intrauterine pregnancy is still possible even if it is not seen on transvaginal ultrasonography. No established beta-hCG level can exclude an intrauterine pregnancy. The discriminatory level at the facility where the test is done should be used to guide clinical management. (1 Diagnosis reference Vaginal bleeding occurs in 20 to 30% of confirmed pregnancies during the first 20 weeks of gestation; about half of these cases end in spontaneous abortion. In stable patients, serial ultrasonography can help guide management when beta-hCG levels are near this discriminatory level. Ultrasonography can also help identify a ruptured corpus luteum cyst and gestational trophoblastic disease. It can show products of conception in the uterus, which are present in patients with incomplete, septic, or missed abortion. If the patient is stable and clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy is low, serial beta-hCG levels may be done on an outpatient basis. Normally, the level doubles every 1.4 to 2.1 days up to 41 days gestation; in ectopic pregnancy (and in abortions), levels may be lower than expected by dates and usually do not double as rapidly. If clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy is moderate or high (eg, because of substantial blood loss, adnexal tenderness, or both), diagnostic uterine evacuation or dilation and curettage (D & C) or diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered. laparoscopy or laparotomy Unruptured ectopic pregnancy: Methotrexate or salpingotomy or salpingectomy via laparoscopy or laparotomy Threatened abortion Treatment Spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation.Expectant management for hemodynamically stable patients Inevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions: D & C or uterine evacuation Septic abortion Treatment Septic abortion is serious uterine infection during or shortly before or after a spontaneous or an induced abortion.IV antibiotics and urgent uterine evacuation if retained products of conception are identified during ultrasonography Complete abortion: Obstetric follow-up Key Points If patients have vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy, always be alert for ectopic pregnancy; symptoms can be mild or severe. Spontaneous abortion is the most common cause of bleeding during early pregnancy. Always do Rh testing for women who present with vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy to determine whether Rho(D) immune globulin is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Bacteria and viruses can infect the middle ear. Children with ear infections may have a fever and trouble sleeping and may cry, become irritable, and pull on their ears. Doctors use a handheld light called an otoscope to check the eardrum for redness or bulging and to look for fluid behind the eardrum. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can relieve fever and pain, and antibiotics are usually used when children do not get better quickly or get worse. A Look Inside the Ear Acute middle ear infection (also called acute otitis media) usually develops and resolves relatively quickly. Middle ear infections that come back frequently or last for a long time are called chronic middle ear infections Chronic Middle Ear Infection in Children Chronic middle ear infection results from recurring infections that may damage the eardrum or lead to formation of a cholesteatoma, which in turn promotes more infection.  Acute otitis media often occurs in people with a cold or allergies. The infected ear is painful. Causes An acute middle ear infection is most often caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold Common Cold The common cold is a viral infection of the lining of the nose, sinuses, and throat. Many different viruses cause colds. Acute infection may also be caused by bacteria that sometimes normally reside in the mouth and nose. Bacteria that affect the ears of newborns include Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteria that affect older infants and children include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. An infection initially caused by a virus sometimes leads to a bacterial infection. Routine childhood vaccinations have decreased the risk of ear infection. A main risk factor for acute middle ear infection is Exposure to cigarette smoke in the household Other risk factors include a strong family history of ear infections, bottle-feeding (instead of breastfeeding), attending a day care center, and living in an area where resources are low or air pollution is high.  Letting an infant sleep with a bottle can result in an acute middle ear infection. Symptoms Infants with acute middle ear infections have a fever and trouble sleeping. They cry or become irritable for no apparent reason. They may also have a runny nose, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. The ear is painful  Some people also have ear discharge or, rarely, hearing loss. Infants and children who cannot communicate verbally may pull at their ears. Older children are usually able to tell parents that their ear hurts or that they cannot hear well. Commonly, fluid accumulates behind the eardrum and remains after the acute infection has resolved. This disorder is called secretory otitis media Secretory Otitis Media in Children Secretory otitis media occurs when fluid accumulates behind the eardrum and remains there after an acute middle ear infection or blockage of the eustachian tube. Complications Rarely, an acute middle ear infection leads to more serious complications. The eardrum may rupture, causing blood or fluid to drain from the ear  is drainage from the ear. The drainage may be watery, bloody, or thick and whitish, like pus (purulent). Also, nearby structures may become infected, cause symptoms, and require emergency treatment: Infection of the bone surrounding the ear (mastoiditis is a bacterial infection in the mastoid process, which is the prominent bone behind the ear. Infection of the inner ear (labyrinthitis Purulent Labyrinthitis Purulent (suppurative) labyrinthitis is a bacterial infection of the inner ear that often causes deafness and loss of balance. The labyrinth is the bony cavity that contains the inner ear. Infection of the tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). If infections come back, abnormal skinlike tissue called a cholesteatoma Complications Chronic middle ear infection results from recurring infections that may damage the eardrum or lead to formation of a cholesteatoma, which in turn promotes more infection. A cholesteatoma can damage the bones of the middle ear and cause hearing loss. Diagnosis A doctor's examination Doctors diagnose acute middle ear infections by using a handheld light called an otoscope to look for bulging and redness of the eardrum and for fluid behind the eardrum. They may need to clean wax from the ear first so they can see more clearly. Doctors may use a rubber bulb and tube attached to the otoscope to squeeze air into the ear to see if the eardrum moves. If the eardrum does not move or moves only slightly, fluid in the middle ear, which is one sign of infection, may be present. Prevention The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). These infections may be serious in children. Two types of influenza virus, type A and type B, regularly cause seasonal epidemics of influenza in the United States. Infants should not sleep with a bottle because drinking from a bottle while going to sleep tends to cause fluid to collect in the eustachian tubes. Fluid in the eustachian tubes traps secretions in the middle ear and prevents air from reaching the middle ear, both of which make infection more likely. Smoking should be eliminated from the household. Recurring acute otitis media may be prevented by inserting tiny tubes into the eardrum (tympanostomy tubes). These tubes balance the pressure on both sides of the eardrum so fluid is less likely to accumulate   Most acute middle ear infections resolve without use of antibiotics. Treatment Drugs to relieve pain Sometimes antibiotics Rarely tympanic membrane perforation Acetaminophen or ibuprofen is effective for fever and pain. Most acute middle ear infections resolve without antibiotics. Thus, many doctors use antibiotics only when children are very young or very ill, do not improve after a brief period of time, when there are signs that the infection is getting worse, or when children have frequent infections. Antibiotics, such as amoxicillin (with or without clavulanate), may be used. For children, antihistamines (such as brompheniramine or chlorpheniramine) and vasoconstrictors (drugs that constrict blood vessels, also sometimes called decongestants) are not helpful and should not be used. If the eardrum is bulging and the child has severe or persistent pain, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, ear specialists may puncture the eardrum (called myringotomy ) to allow the infected fluid to drain. Sometimes ear specialists then also insert tympanostomy tubes. After this procedure, symptoms usually resolve quickly, hearing returns, and the eardrum heals on its own.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

People with histrionic personality disorder continually demand to be the center of attention and often try to do so by dressing and acting in inappropriately seductive and provocative ways and by expressing themselves very dramatically. Doctors diagnose histrionic personality disorder based on specific symptoms, including discomfort due to not being the center of attention, inappropriately seductive or provocative interaction with others, and dramatic behavior and expression of emotion. Psychotherapy that focuses on underlying conflicts may help. People with histrionic personality disorder use their physical appearance and act in inappropriately seductive or provocative ways to gain the attention of others. They often behave in submissive ways to retain the attention of others. Histrionic personality disorder occurs in about almost 2% of the general population in the United States. It is diagnosed more often in women, but some studies suggest it affects men and women equally. Other disorders are also often present. They include one or more of the following: Other personality disorders (antisocial Personality Disorder Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for consequences and for the rights of others. They are often lively, dramatic, enthusiastic, and flirtatious and sometimes charm new acquaintances. People with this disorder often dress and act in inappropriately seductive and provocative ways, not just with potential romantic interests, but in many contexts, including work and school. They want to impress others with their appearance and so are often preoccupied with how they look. Problems with emotions may be turned off and on quickly and thus may seem shallow to others. At the same time, emotions are often expressed in an exaggerated way. People with this disorder speak dramatically, expressing strong opinions, but with few facts or details to support their opinions. Achieving emotional or sexual intimacy may be difficult. People may, often without being aware of it, play a role (such as that of a victim). They may try to control their partner using seductiveness or emotional manipulations while becoming very dependent on the partner. Other symptoms People with histrionic personality disorder are easily influenced by others and by current trends. They are highly suggestible. Also, they tend to be too trusting, especially of authority figures who, they think, may be able to solve all their problems. These people often believe that their relationships are more intimate than they are. People with histrionic personality disorder crave novelty and tend to bore easily. Thus, they may change jobs and friends frequently. They are easily frustrated by having to wait for rewards, so their actions are often motivated by obtaining immediate satisfaction. For doctors to diagnose histrionic personality disorder, people must persistently exaggerate their emotions and seek attention, as shown by at least five of the following: They feel uncomfortable when they are not the center of attention. They interact with others in inappropriately sexually seductive or provocative ways. Their emotions shift rapidly, making them seem shallow. They consistently use their physical appearance to call attention to themselves. Their speech is extremely vague, lacking detail. They express their emotions in a dramatic, theatrical, and extravagant way. They are easily influenced by others or situations. They view relationships as more intimate than the relationships are. Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood. Little is known about how effective cognitive-behavioral therapy and drugs are for histrionic personality disorder. Psychodynamic psychotherapy Psychodynamic psychotherapy Extraordinary advances have been made in the treatment of mental illness. As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated nearly as successfully as physical disorders. This type of psychotherapy focuses on underlying conflicts. The therapist may start by encouraging people to substitute speech for behavior and thus understand themselves better. This approach helps people with this disorder communicate with others in a less dramatic way. Then, the therapist can help them realize how their histrionic behaviors are an ineffective and inappropriate way to attract the attention of others and to make them feel better about themselves.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

People with common variable immunodeficiency may have a chronic cough, cough up blood, or have difficulty breathing (due to frequent sinus and lung infections) and may have diarrhea. To diagnose the disorder, doctors measure immunoglobulin levels and determine how well the body produces immunoglobulins in response to vaccines. Immune globulin is given throughout life to provide the missing immunoglobulins, and antibiotics are given to treat the frequent infections.  Common variable immunodeficiency is a primary immunodeficiency disorder Primary immunodeficiency disorders involve malfunction of the immune system, resulting in infections that develop and recur more frequently, are more severe, and last longer than usual. It is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but may appear earlier or later in life. Up to 25% of people develop autoimmune disorders Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues. What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known. In autoimmune disorders, the immune system attacks the body's own tissue. People may be weak, short of breath, and pale. Nerves may malfunction. Stomach cancer Stomach Cancer A Helicobacter pylori infection is a risk factor for stomach cancer. Vague abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and weakness are some typical symptoms. Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. The genetic mutations that cause common variable immunodeficiency can be inherited, but more often, they occur spontaneously. B Cells VIDEO Symptoms of CVID Recurring sinus and lung infections, particularly pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. People may develop a chronic cough, cough up blood, or have difficulty breathing. People with CVID who have frequent lung infections can develop bronchiectasis is an irreversible widening (dilation) of portions of the breathing tubes or airways (bronchi) resulting from damage to the airway wall. Diarrhea may occur, and food may not be absorbed well from the digestive tract. The spleen may enlarge. Most people have a normal life span, but if another disorder, such as lymphoma or an autoimmune disorder develops and is hard to treat, life span may be shortened. Diagnosis of CVID Blood tests Doctors suspect common variable immunodeficiency when people have typical symptoms. Blood tests are done to measure immunoglobulin levels and to determine how well the body produces immunoglobulins in response to vaccines. If common variable immunodeficiency is diagnosed, doctors do tests yearly to check for disorders that commonly develop in people with this disorder, such as autoimmune disorders, cancers, and lung disorders. Tests may include blood tests, spirometry Lung flow rate measurements (lung tests that measure how much air is inhaled and exhaled and how long each breath takes), and imaging (such as computed tomography). Treatment of CVID Immune globulin Antibiotics to treat infections Immune globulin (antibodies obtained from the blood of people with a normal immune system) is given throughout life to provide the missing immunoglobulins. It may be injected into a vein (intravenously) once a month or under the skin (subcutaneously) once a week or once a month. Antibiotics are promptly given to treat infections. Sometimes antibiotics are taken regularly to prevent infections.

Culture also facilitates testing of antimicrobial susceptibility. Communication with the laboratory is essential. Although most specimens are placed on general purpose media (eg, blood or chocolate agar), some pathogens require inclusion of specific nutrients and inhibitors  or other special conditions for incubation (eg, a specific temperature, oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration, or duration). If one of these more fastidious pathogens is suspected or if the patient has been taking antimicrobials, the laboratory should be advised. The specimen’s source is reported so that the laboratory can differentiate pathogens from site-specific normal flora.  Specimen collection Specimen collection is important. For diagnosis of infectious disease, the rule of thumb is sample where the infection is. For skin lesions, the leading edge, not the center, should be sampled. Use of swabs is discouraged. However, if a swab is used, a flocked swab is preferred because it can recover more specimen. Swabs used for molecular assays Nucleic Acid–Based Identification Methods for Infectious Disease Nucleic acid–based methods detect organism-specific DNA or RNA sequences extracted from the microorganism. Sequences may or may not be amplified in vitro. The wrong type of swab can produce false-negative results. Wooden-shafted swabs are toxic to some viruses. Cotton-tipped swabs are toxic to some bacteria, including chlamydiae. Blood cultures require decontamination and disinfection of the skin (eg, povidone iodine swab, allowed to dry, removed with 70% alcohol). Multiple samples, each from a different site are generally used; they are taken nearly simultaneously with fever spikes if possible. Normal flora of skin that grows in only a single blood sample is usually interpreted as contamination. If a blood specimen is obtained from a central line, a peripheral blood specimen should also be obtained to help differentiate systemic bacteremia from catheter infection. Cultures from infected catheters generally turn positive more quickly and contain more organisms than simultaneously drawn peripheral blood cultures. Some fungi, particularly molds (eg, Aspergillus species), usually cannot be cultured from blood. The specimen must be transported rapidly, in the correct medium, and in conditions that limit growth of any potentially contaminating normal flora. For accurate quantification of the pathogen, additional pathogen growth must be prevented; specimens should be transported to the laboratory immediately or, if transport is delayed, refrigerated (in most cases). Special considerations for culture Certain cultures have special considerations. Specimens must be shielded from air, which can be difficult. For swab specimens, anaerobic transport media are available. However, fluid specimens (eg, abscess contents) are superior to swab specimens for recovery of anaerobic bacteria. Fluid specimens should be collected with a syringe from which all air was expressed (to minimize contact of the specimen with oxygen) and sent to a laboratory in the syringe (capped without the needle) or transferred to an anaerobic transport vial. Mycobacteria Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. Specimens containing normal flora (eg, sputum) must first be decontaminated and concentrated. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some other mycobacteria grow slowly. Growth of M. tuberculosis is typically faster in liquid than in solid media; routine use of automated systems with liquid media can result in growth within 2 weeks vs ≥ 4 weeks on solid media such as Lowenstein-Jensen agar. In addition, few organisms may be present in a specimen. Multiple specimens from the same site may help maximize yield. Specimens should be allowed to grow for 8 weeks before being discarded. M. ulcerans, which causes Buruli ulcer Cutaneous disease , requires up to 12 weeks at 32° C on Lowenstein-Jensen agar. If an atypical mycobacterium is suspected, the laboratory should be notified. Viruses Diagnosis Viruses are the smallest parasites, typically ranging from 0.02 to 0. Specimens are inoculated onto tissue cultures that support the suspected virus and inhibit all other microbes. Viruses that are highly labile (eg, varicella zoster) should be inoculated onto tissue cultures within 1 hour of collection. Standard tissue cultures are most sensitive. The shell vial culture technique, in which the specimen is centrifuged onto a cell monolayer within a vial, provides more rapid results (2 days vs 7 to 14 days)Epstein-Barr virus Diagnosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.B virus Diagnosis Hepatitis B is caused by a DNA virus that is often parenterally transmitted.

Usually, the main symptoms of normal-pressure hydrocephalus are general unsteadiness and loss of balance, and the feet may seem to stick to the floor. Dementia may not develop until late in the disorder. Doctors usually do magnetic resonance imaging to check for excess fluid around the brain and do a spinal tap or place a temporary drain into the spinal cord to remove any excess fluid. Placing a piece of plastic tubing (a shunt) in the brain to drain the excess fluid may significantly lessen some symptoms, but it may benefit mental function less.  dysfunction—the inability to acquire, retain, and use knowledge normally. Normally, the fluid that surrounds the brain and protects it from injury (cerebrospinal fluid) is continuously produced in the spaces within the brain (ventricles), circulates in and around the brain, and is reabsorbed. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is thought to occur when this fluid is not reabsorbed normally, causing it to accumulate. The amount of fluid in the ventricles increases and the brain is then pushed outward. People typically have an abnormally slow, unsteady, wide-legged walk. The feet may seem to stick to the floor (called a magnetic gait). People also have urinary incontinence and a tendency to fall. Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. Often, the first signs of dementia are difficulty planning, organizing, putting ideas or doing actions for a task in the right order (sequencing), thinking abstractly, and paying attention. Memory tends to be lost later. Diagnosis of Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus A doctor's evaluation Brain imaging, usually magnetic resonance imaging Lessening of symptoms after removal of cerebrospinal fluid Doctors may suspect normal-pressure hydrocephalus when people have the three typical symptoms: Difficulty walking Urinary incontinence Dementia However, the diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus cannot be based on symptoms alone, particularly in older people. Other dementias can cause similar symptoms, and in older people, many conditions can make walking difficult or cause urinary incontinence. Diagnosis of dementia Doctors base a diagnosis of dementia on the following: Symptoms, which are identified by asking the person and family members or other caregivers questions Results of a physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. Neuropsychologic testing, which is more detailed is sometimes needed. This testing covers all the main areas of mental function, including mood, and usually takes 1 to 3 hours. This testing helps doctors distinguish dementia from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as age-associated memory impairment Dementia , mild cognitive impairment Dementia , and depression Dementia . Information from the above sources can usually help doctors rule out delirium as the cause of symptoms . Doing so is essential because delirium, unlike dementia, can often be reversed if promptly treated. Differences between the two include the following: Dementia affects mainly memory, and delirium affects mainly attention. Dementia typically begins gradually and has no definite beginning point. Delirium begins suddenly and often has a definite beginning point. Diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus Brain imaging, usually magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done to check for excess cerebrospinal fluid. Finding excess fluid and other characteristic changes in the brain supports the diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus but does not confirm it. To help with the diagnosis, doctors do a spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. If these procedures relieve symptoms, usually by improving gait, normal-pressure hydrocephalus is more likely, and treatment is more likely to be effective. Treatment of Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus A shunt in the ventricles of the brain Treatment of normal-pressure hydrocephalus consists of placing a piece of plastic tubing (a shunt) in the ventricles of the brain and running it under the skin, usually to the abdomen (ventriculoperitoneal shunting). Cerebrospinal fluid is then drained away from the brain. The effects of this treatment may not be evident for several hours. This procedure may significantly improve the ability to walk and function and may lessen incontinence. However, mental function improves less and in fewer people. Thus, early diagnosis is important, so that people can be treated before dementia develops. Safety and supportive measures Creating a safe and supportive environment Creating a Beneficial Environment for People With Dementia can be very helpful. Generally, the environment should be bright, cheerful, safe, stable, and designed to help with orientation. Some stimulation, such as a radio or television, is helpful, but excessive stimulation should be avoided. Structure and routine help people with dementia stay oriented and give them a sense of security and stability. Any change in surroundings, routines, or caregivers should be explained to people clearly and simply. Following a daily routine for tasks such as bathing, eating, and sleeping helps people with dementia remember. Following a regular routine at bedtime may help them sleep better. Activities scheduled on a regular basis can help people feel independent and needed by focusing their attention on pleasurable or useful tasks. Such activities should include physical and mental activities. Activities should be broken down in small parts or simplified as the dementia worsens. Care for caregivers Caring for people with dementia is stressful and demanding, and caregivers may become depressed and exhausted, often neglecting their own mental and physical health. The following measures can help caregivers : Learning about how to effectively meet the needs of people with dementia and what to expect from them: Caregivers can get this information from nurses, social workers, organizations, and published and online materials. Seeking help when it is needed: Caregivers can talk to social workers (including those in the local community hospital) about appropriate sources of help, such as day-care programs, visits by home nurses, part-time or full-time housekeeping assistance, and live-in assistance. Counseling and support groups can also help. Caring for self: Caregivers need to remember to take care of themselves.

The Digestive System The anus is formed partly from the surface layers of the body, including the skin, and partly from the intestine. The rectal lining consists of glistening red tissue containing mucus glands—much like the rest of the intestinal lining. The lining of the rectum is relatively insensitive to pain, but the nerves from the anus and nearby external skin are very sensitive to pain. The veins from the rectum and anus drain mostly into the portal vein, which leads to the liver, and then into the general circulation. Some of these veins drain directly into the pelvic veins and then into the general circulation. The lymph vessels of the rectum drain into lymph nodes in the lower abdomen. The lymph vessels of the anus drain into the lymph nodes in the groin. A muscular ring (anal sphincter) keeps the anus closed. However, part of the sphincter can be relaxed or tightened at will. Disorders of the anus and rectum include Anal cancer Anal Cancer Risk factors for anal cancer include certain sexually transmitted infections. Bleeding with bowel movements, pain, and sometimes itching around the anus are typical symptoms. The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure. The inflammation has many causes ranging from infection to radiation therapy. A rectal prolapse is often triggered while straining, such as during a bowel movement. With a gloved finger, the doctor probes the rectum. Doctors often also examine the abdomen.

Wheezing is caused by a narrowing of the airways. Other symptoms depend on the cause and may include cough, fever, and runny nose. The diagnosis of the cause is based on chest x-rays and sometimes other tests. Treatment can include bronchodilators and corticosteroids.   Wheezing is caused by a narrowing or blockage (obstruction) of the airways. The narrowing can be caused by one or more of the following: Swelling of the tissues in the airways Spasm of the tiny muscles in the walls of the airways (bronchospasm) Accumulation of mucus in the airways Recurring episodes of wheezing are common in the first few years of life. Until recently, doctors diagnosed these episodes as Asthma in Children Asthma is a recurring inflammatory lung disorder in which certain stimuli (triggers) inflame the airways and cause them to temporarily narrow, resulting in difficulty breathing. Now, however, doctors know that only some infants and young children who have such episodes of wheezing have asthma in later childhood or adolescence.  Not all wheezing is caused by asthma.More severe wheezing episodes Family members with asthma A family tendency to have many allergies Wheezing with viral illnesses (particularly those caused by respiratory syncytial virus Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection and Human Metapneumovirus Infection Respiratory syncytial virus infection and human metapneumovirus infection cause upper and sometimes lower respiratory tract infections.Common Cold The common cold is a viral infection of the lining of the nose, sinuses, and throat. Many different viruses cause colds.However, in most children, wheezing episodes stop by 6 to 10 years of age, and doctors do not diagnose these children as having asthma.

In dysphagia, foods and/or liquids do not move normally from the throat (pharynx) to the stomach.Gastroesophageal Reflux in Children Gastroesophageal reflux is the backward movement of food and acid from the stomach into the esophagus and sometimes into the mouth. Whatever the initial cause of the wheezing, symptoms are often worsened by allergies or inhaled irritants (such as tobacco smoke). Symptoms Wheezing is often accompanied by a recurring cough in Children Cough helps clear materials from the airways and prevent them from going to the lungs. The materials may be particles that have been inhaled or substances from the lungs and/or airways. Other symptoms depend on the cause and may include fever in Infants and Children Normal body temperature varies from person to person and throughout the day (it is typically highest in the afternoon). A high-pitched wheezing sound is heard when the child breathes out. If airway narrowing is severe, the wheezing sound can be heard when the child breathes in. Very ill children may also breathe rapidly, use a lot of their chest muscles to breathe, and have flaring of the nostrils and a bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood. Fever may be present in children with a lung infection. Doctors measure oxygen levels in the blood by placing a sensor on a finger (pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry Both arterial blood gas testing and pulse oximetry measure the amount of oxygen in the blood, which helps determine how well the lungs are functioning. For children with recurring episodes of wheezing who have already had testing, flare-ups typically do not require testing unless there are signs of severe breathing problems. Children who have frequent or severe flare-ups or symptoms that are not relieved by bronchodilators or other asthma drugs may need other tests such as swallowing studies X-Ray Studies of the Digestive Tract X-rays often are used to evaluate digestive problems.

Treatment For flare-ups, bronchodilators and sometimes corticosteroids For severe wheezing, daily use of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs used for asthma Infants and young children who have flare-ups of wheezing are given an inhaled bronchodilator (such as albuterol) and, if the wheezing is severe, corticosteroids (such as prednisone) given by mouth or vein. Children who are unlikely to develop persistent asthma, such as children who do not have signs of allergies or a family history of allergies or asthma and whose episodes of wheezing are relatively mild and infrequent, usually require only inhaled bronchodilators used as needed to control their symptoms.

Suicidal behavior encompasses a spectrum of behavior from suicide attempt and preparatory behaviors to completed suicide. Suicidal ideation refers to the process of thinking about, considering, or planning suicide. Advances in science, advocacy, and stigma reduction have led to an evolution in all of the terminology related to suicide, including those concepts already defined above: Suicidal intent: Intention to end one's life through the act of suicidal behavior Suicide attempt: A nonfatal, potentially injurious behavior directed against the self with an intent to die as a result of the behavior Suicide attempt survivors: People with their own personal experience with suicidal thoughts or attempt(s); often important in the advocacy movement of suicide prevention; suicide attempt survivors sometimes join forces with other advocates (eg, Loss Survivors) Suicide loss survivor or suicide bereaved: Family members or friends of a person who died by suicide Three other important changes in suicide terminology have also made it into the professional lexicon: Died by suicide: This recommended language is preferred over the phrase “committed suicide.” Other plain language is acceptable as well (eg, “killed himself,” “ended her life,” “took his life”). Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) Nonsuicidal self-injury is a self-inflicted act that causes pain or superficial damage but is not intended to cause death.SIB): These behaviors are defined as deliberately injuring oneself without suicidal intent; self-cutting is the most common form, but burning, scratching, hitting, and intentionally preventing wounds from healing are other forms. While the behavior itself is without suicidal intent, people who have a pattern of NSSI have been found to have a higher risk of suicide in the long term. Suicidality: This term is frequently used in clinical settings between professionals to refer to the spectrum of possible suicidal experiences; it does not specify ideation, attempt, chronic/recurrent, or singular event. In many instances, communication can be more effective and clear if one articulates the actual issue at hand, such as ideation or attempt, and include any relevant details.  Recommended standard care for people with suicide risk: Making health care suicide safe. Washington, DC: Education Development Center, Inc.2018.) Epidemiology of Suicidal Behavior Statistics on suicidal behavior are based mainly on death certificates and inquest reports and underestimate the true incidence. To provide more reliable information in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a state-based system that collects facts about each violent incident from various sources to provide a clearer understanding of the causes of violent deaths (homicides and suicides), the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS is now in place in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In the United States, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. The age group with the highest suicide rate is now people aged 45 to 64 years, resulting from a recent significant increase. Why this rate has increased is unknown; however, the following factors may have contributed: Years ago, as teenagers, this group had a higher rate of depression Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. This rate includes the increased number of suicides among military personnel and veterans (20% of suicides are in that group). This rate may also stem from intersecting influences, including unmet expectations and beliefs of this particular cohort, rise in the availability of lethal means, the opioid crisis, changes in the economy, and the persistent stigma associated with addressing mental health conditions. The second highest rate of suicide is in people ≥ 75 years. In the 1990s, youth suicide Suicidal Behavior in Children and Adolescents Suicidal behavior includes completed suicide, attempted suicide (with at least some intent to die), and suicide gestures; suicidal ideation is thoughts and plans about suicide. In all age groups, male deaths by suicide outnumber female deaths 3.5 to 1. The reasons are unclear, but possible explanations include Men are less likely to seek help when they are distressed. Men have a higher prevalence of alcohol Use Disorder and Rehabilitation Alcohol use disorder involves a pattern of alcohol use that typically includes craving and manifestations of tolerance and/or withdrawal along with adverse psychosocial consequences.Overview of Substance Use Substance-related disorders involve substances that directly activate the brain's reward system. Men are more aggressive and use more lethal means when attempting suicide. The number of suicides in men includes suicides among military personnel and veterans, where there is a higher proportion of men to women. White men account for 7 in every 10 suicides in the United States even though they account for around one third of the population. In 2019, an estimated 1.4 million American adults made a suicide attempt. About 25 attempts are made for every death that occurs by suicide. Many make repeated attempts. Only 5 to 10% of people who make an attempt eventually die by suicide; however, in older people, 1 in every 4 suicide attempts ends in death. Although more men than women die by suicide, women attempt suicide 2 to 3 times more often than men; among youth and young adults, there may be 100 attempts by girls to every 1 attempt by boys of the same age. A suicide note is left by about 1 in 6 people who complete suicide. The content may indicate clues regarding the factors that led to the suicide (eg, psychiatric illness, hopelessness, cognitive constriction and narrowing of perceived options for coping, sense of being a burden to others, and sense of isolation). The intersection of these and other life stressors or losses may precipitate suicide. Suicide contagion refers to a phenomenon in which one suicide seems to beget others in a community, school, or workplace. Highly publicized suicides may have a very wide effect. Affected people are usually those already vulnerable. Humans are social creatures prone to imitation of one another. Youths are more likely to engage in imitation than adults because of their stage of psychologic development and brain development. It is estimated that contagion is a factor in 1 to 5% of all teen suicides. Contagion can occur by exposure to a peer who attempts or dies by suicide, by widespread media coverage of a celebrity’s suicide, or by graphic and/or sensationalized portrayal of suicide in popular media. Conversely, media coverage with positive messaging about a suicide death can mitigate the risk and/or impact of suicide contagion for vulnerable youth. Positive messaging typically involves portraying mental health struggles as part of life and human health experience with no stigma related to help seeking and treatment. After a suicide has occurred, positive messages in a school or workplace communicate clearly about the tragic loss of a community member and goes on to express support for the grieving community and provides resources for support. In writing or in-person meetings for debriefing the loss, the language the leader uses to talk about suicide is important. For more detailed information on communication and templates for written communication, please see the After A Suicide Toolkits freely available on the American Foundation for Suicide prevention ( afsp.org ) web site. Suicide contagion can also spread in schools and workplaces, which are—in some ways—the ideal settings for implementing and following postvention guidelines to prevent future suicides. Other categories of suicide are extremely rare. These include Group suicides Murder/suicides \"Suicide by cop\" (situations in which people act in a way, for example, brandishing a weapon, that prompts law enforcement officers to act with deadly force) Etiology of Suicidal Behavior The current scientifically informed view of suicide is that, while complex, suicide is a health-related event that involves a set of genetic, environmental, and psychologic/behavioral factors. Psychologic autopsy studies clearly show that in each instance of suicide, decedents were experiencing multiple risk factors for suicide. Research has shown that 85 to 95% of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health condition at the time of their death. One of the most common, potent, and remediable risk factors for suicide is depression Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. The amount of time spent in an episode of depression is the strongest predictor of suicide. For patients with depression, suicide risk can increase during periods when depression is more severe, and when several other risk factors converge. Also, suicide appears to be more common when severe anxiety Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.Bipolar Disorders Bipolar disorders are characterized by episodes of mania and depression, which may alternate, although many patients have a predominance of one or the other. Risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts may increase in younger age groups after antidepressant drugs are started . Effectively treating depression with medications and/or some form of psychotherapy is considered an effective way to reduce suicide risk overall. Other risk factors for suicide include the following: Most other serious mental health conditions Previous suicide attempts Personality disorders (eg, borderline personality disorder) Impulsivity and aggression Traumatic childhood experiences Family history of suicide and/or psychiatric conditions Use of alcohol, drugs of abuse, and prescription analgesics Serious or chronic physical health conditions (eg, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury) Times of loss (eg, death of family or friends) Relationship conflict (eg, divorce) Work disruption (eg, unemployment) Periods of career transition (eg, changing one's military status from active duty to veteran status or retirement) Financial stress (eg, economic downturns, underemployment) Bullying (eg, cyberbullying, social rejection, discrimination, humiliation)  Death by suicide is more common among people with a psychiatric illness than among age- and sex-matched controls. . Drivers of suicide risk among people with schizophrenia include early phase illness, depressive episodes, hallucinations, lack of access to or nonadherence to effective treatment, disability, hopelessness, and akathisia. Other well-known psychosocial risk factors for suicide include relationship disruption, unemployment, and loss. alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant. Large amounts consumed rapidly can cause respiratory depression, coma, and death. Between 30% and 40% of people who die by suicide have consumed alcohol before the attempt, and about half of them were intoxicated at the time. Impulsive young men and women are particularly susceptible to alcohol's effects; in them, moderate levels of intoxication can result in their using more lethal suicide methods (1 Etiology references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. However, people with an alcohol use disorder Alcohol Use Disorder and Rehabilitation Alcohol use disorder involves a pattern of alcohol use that typically includes craving and manifestations of tolerance and/or withdrawal along with adverse psychosocial consequences. Serious physical health conditions, especially those that are chronic and painful, contribute to about 20% of suicides in older patients. Recently diagnosed or new-onset physical health conditions can also increase suicide risk (eg, diabetes, seizure disorder, pain conditions, multiple sclerosis, cancer, infection, HIV/AIDS). These health conditions can directly impact physiologic brain functioning and, thus, increase suicide risk. The psychologic effects of disability, pain, or a new diagnosis of a serious health condition can also increase the risk of suicide. People with personality disorders Overview of Personality Disorders Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment.Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for consequences and for the rights of others. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) Nonsuicidal self-injury is a self-inflicted act that causes pain or superficial damage but is not intended to cause death. The genetics of suicide risk are an important area of research and appear to influence suicide risk. While suicide risk can run in families, genes appear to account for only a portion of that risk (2 Etiology references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. A family history of suicide, suicide attempts, or psychiatric disorders is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Genes and environment both matter when it comes to suicide risk. It has been proposed that epigenetic changes (eg, DNA methylation) affecting gene expression could increase or decrease risk for suicide by affecting neurophysiology, cognition, or stress regulation. This means that negative experiences such as trauma and conversely positive experiences such as the social support of psychotherapy can actually change gene expression and significantly affect an individual’s resilience and risk for suicide. This is an area of research that is attempting to determine the roles of epigenetics. Psychologic traits such as a tendency toward impulsivity, cognitive rigidity, interpersonal rejection sensitivity, or severe neuroticism can also increase risk. Methods Choice of method for suicide is determined by many things, including cultural factors, availability of means to complete suicide, and the seriousness of intent. (A combination of these factors surely influences the popularity of pesticide poisoning as a common means of suicide in most Asian countries.) Some methods (eg, jumping from heights) make survival virtually impossible, whereas others (eg, drug ingestion) may allow rescue. However, using a method that proves not to be fatal does not necessarily imply that the intent was less serious. For suicide attempts, drug ingestion is the most common method used. Violent methods, such as shooting and hanging, are uncommon among attempted suicides. Approximately 50% of completed suicides in the United States are by firearm; men use this method more than women. Women use poisoning more than men. Other methods of suicide include hanging, jumping from a height, drowning, and cutting. Management of Suicidal Behavior In 2018, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance) published guidelines for recommended standards of care for patients at risk for suicide. These include recommendations for screening, suicide risk assessment, and clinical care in primary care, behavioral health, and emergency department settings (1 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. It is important to note that suicide risk is dynamic. Acute risk generally lasts only a short period of time (hours to days). In the majority of suicides, patients had been seen in various health care settings during the period of acute risk, but suicide risk was not detected. Any sound public health strategy to reduce suicide would equip clinicians in all health care settings (even those outside of behavioral health) to actively look for and mitigate any and all suicide-related risks. This can be done by having health care providers Employ a caring response Provide brief interventions (eg, safety planning and lethal means counseling) Communicate with family and close friends of the patient Refer the patient for appropriate care Currently, these steps have the strongest evidence for reducing suicide risk and saving lives. Certain periods of time are known to be associated with an elevated risk of suicide. The period of days to weeks following discharge from the emergency department or psychiatric hospital for patients admitted for suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt is just such a period and, therefore, a prime point of intervention (2 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. A health care practitioner who foresees the imminent likelihood of suicide in a patient is, in most jurisdictions, required to inform an empowered agency to intervene. Failure to do so can result in criminal and civil actions. At-risk patients should not be left alone until they are in a secure environment (often a psychiatric facility). If necessary, those patients should be transported to that secure environment by trained professionals (eg, emergency medical technicians, police officers). Current advocacy efforts in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere aim to reform the crisis response system to move toward reliance on a more robust multi-tiered set of mental health resources such as mobile crisis units and comprehensive crisis care and away from their current reliance on emergency departments and law enforcement. Any suicidal act, regardless of whether it is a gesture or an attempt, must be taken seriously. Every person with a serious self-injury should be evaluated and treated for the physical injury. If an overdose of a potentially lethal drug is confirmed, immediate steps are taken to administer an antidote and provide supportive treatment  Symptoms vary, but certain common syndromes may suggest particular classes of poisons. Initial assessment can be done by any health care practitioner trained in the assessment and management of suicidal behavior. However, all patients should have a thorough suicide risk assessment—which is usually done by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other trained mental health care practitioner—as soon as possible. Decisions must be made about whether patients need to be voluntarily admitted or involuntarily committed for treatment, and whether restraint is necessary . Patients with a psychotic disorder and some with severe depression and an unresolved crisis should be admitted to a psychiatric unit. Patients with manifestations of potentially confounding medical disorders (eg, delirium, seizures, fever) may need to be admitted to a medical unit with appropriate suicide precautions. After a suicide attempt, the patient may deny any problems because the severe depression that led to the suicidal act may be followed by a short-lived mood elevation. Nonetheless, the risk of later, completed suicide is high unless the patient receives ongoing treatment and psychosocial support. Suicide risk assessment identifies the key drivers contributing to the individual's current suicide risk and helps the clinician plan appropriate treatment. It consists of the following: Establishing rapport and listening to the patient's narrative Understanding the suicide attempt, its background, the events preceding it, and the circumstances in which it occurred Inquiring about mental health symptoms and any medications or alternative treatments the patient may be taking for treatment of their mental health condition or relief of symptoms Fully assessing the patient’s mental state, with particular emphasis on identifying depression, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, severe insomnia, other mental disorders, and alcohol or drug use disorders (many of these problems require specific treatment in addition to crisis intervention) Thoroughly understanding personal and family relationships as well as social networks, which are often pertinent to the suicide attempt and follow-up treatment Interviewing close family members and friends Inquiring about the presence of a firearm or other lethal means in the house and providing lethal means counseling (this may involve facilitating the safe storage or disposal of lethal means away from the home) Mental health management Safety planning, the first step after assessment, is an essential intervention that is done to help patients identify triggers to suicidal planning and develop plans to deal with suicidal thoughts when they occur (3, 4 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Other steps clinicians should take include providing the patient with crisis resources, counseling on removal or storage of lethal means (5, 6 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.CAMS], family therapy; 4, 7–10 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Clinicians can also provide the patient with more frequent contact through outpatient visits or various forms of communication, some of which can be provided by other members of the health care team (11 Management references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Prevention of Suicidal Behavior Prevention of suicide requires identifying at-risk people  and initiating appropriate interventions. A public health model can be used to scale suicide-prevention strategies. Implementing key strategies across an entire population (universal) can drive down suicide rates. Suicide-prevention efforts are, therefore, critically important at the regional and national levels. These efforts are supplemented by effective health care in reducing suicide risk. Interventions at the community level have also shown promising results for reducing suicide risk. There are school-based and public health interventions. One example is the Sources of Strength suicide-prevention program, which is delivered by adolescent peer leaders in high schools (1 Prevention references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Studies also show that appropriately training volunteers who staff suicide lifelines helps callers and can thus save lives (2 Prevention references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Another powerful example of the effectiveness of universal and selective suicide-prevention programming is evidenced by the outcomes associated with Garrett Lee Smith (GLS) Memorial Act grants. These grants have funded youth suicide-prevention activities in the United States since 2004, on college campus as well as in community and tribal settings in many states. Over a 15-year period, a large proportion of counties in the United States received financial funding to engage in youth suicide-prevention initiatives, including the following (3 Prevention references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Establishment of outreach, awareness-raising, and screening programs Provision of “gatekeeper” training (ie, educating people in key front-line roles to recognize suicide risk and intervene accordingly) Development of coalitions (which typically include a number of local groups, eg, local government departments of mental health or suicide prevention, nonprofit organizations focused on suicide prevention, educators, parent groups, faith-based groups, law enforcement, etc) Implementation of policies and/or protocols Establishment and funding of hotlines Forty percent of GLS grants are awarded in rural areas of the United States, where suicide rates are higher and where resources for programs and clinical treatment tend to be much less available than they are in other areas. In one study, counties with GLS activities were compared with control counties that had not been exposed to GLS programs. All counties were matched for demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity makeup, median household income, unemployment rates, and suicide rates of youth and adults). Significant reductions were found both for short- and longer-term impact on suicidal behaviors and suicide deaths. The positive effect was greatest in rural areas of the United States (3, 4 Prevention references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Another innovative nationwide initiative in the United States led by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (Project 2025) aims to reduce the US suicide rate by 20% by 2025. In the clinical arena, there is consensus that patients who are admitted to the hospital after a suicide attempt are at greatest risk of death by suicide during the first few days or weeks after discharge, and the risk remains high during the first 6 to 12 months after discharge. After that, the risk waxes and wanes but is always higher than in people who have never been suicidal. Consequently, before patients are discharged, they—along with family members and/or close friends—should be counseled about the immediate risk of dying by suicide, and an appointment for follow-up care in the first week after discharge should be made. A simple telephone call or two after discharge has been shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of repeat attempts. In addition, the patient and family members or friends should be told the names, doses, and dose frequency of the patient's drugs. During the first weeks after discharge, family and friends should make sure that The patient is not left alone. The patient's adherence to the prescribed drug regimen is monitored. The patient is asked daily about general state of mind, mood, sleep pattern, and energy (eg, for getting up, dressing, and interacting with others). The patient's family member or friend should take the patient to follow-up appointments and should inform the health care practitioner of the patient's progress or lack of it. These interventions should be continued for several months after discharge. Table Although some attempted or completed suicides are met with surprise and shock, even by close relatives and associates, clear warnings may have been given to family members, friends, or health care practitioners. Warnings are often explicit, as when patients actually discuss plans or suddenly write or change a will. However, warnings can be more subtle, as when patients make comments about having nothing to live for or being better off dead. On average, primary care physicians encounter ≥ 6 potentially suicidal people in their practice each year. About 77% of people who die by suicide were seen by a physician within 1 year before killing themselves, and about 32% had been under the care of a mental health care practitioner during the preceding year. Because severe and painful physical disorders, substance use disorders Overview of Substance Use Substance-related disorders involve substances that directly activate the brain's reward system.Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. Each depressed patient should be questioned about thoughts of suicide. The fear that such inquiry may implant the idea of self-destruction is baseless. Inquiry helps the physician obtain a clearer picture of the depth of the depression, encourages constructive discussion, and conveys the physician’s awareness of the patient’s deep despair and hopelessness. Even people threatening imminent suicide (eg, those who call and declare that they are going to take a lethal dose of a drug or who threaten to jump from a high height) are thought to have some desire to live. The physician or another person to whom they appeal for help must support the desire to live. 4.

Washington, DC: Education Development Center, Inc. Accessed 5/3/21. Treatment of depression and risk of suicide The combination of antidepressants and some proven short-term psychotherapy is the ideal treatment for depression Treatment Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. People with depression have a significant risk of suicide and should be carefully monitored for suicidal behaviors and ideation. Risk of suicide may be increased early in the treatment of depression, when psychomotor retardation and indecisiveness have been ameliorated but the depressed mood is only partially lifted. When antidepressants are started or when doses are increased, a few patients experience agitation, anxiety, and increasing depression, which may increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and even behavior in rare instances. Recent public health warnings about the possible association between use of antidepressants and suicidal thoughts and attempts in children, adolescents, and young adults have led to a significant reduction (> 30%) in antidepressant prescriptions to these populations. However, youth suicide rates increased by 14% during the same period. Thus, by discouraging pharmacologic treatment of depression, these warnings may have temporarily resulted in more, not fewer, deaths by suicide. Together, these findings suggest that the best approach is to encourage treatment, but with appropriate precautions such as Dispensing antidepressants in sublethal amounts Preferentially using antidepressants that are not lethal if taken in overdose Providing more frequent monitoring and visits early in treatment Giving a clear warning to patients and to family members and significant others to be alert for symptoms such as agitation, insomnia, or suicidal ideation Instructing patients, family members, and significant others to immediately call the prescribing clinician or seek care elsewhere if symptoms worsen or suicidal ideation occurs Several studies have shown that lithium Choice of drug treatment for bipolar disorders can be difficult because all drugs have significant adverse effects, drug interactions are common, and no drug is universally effective. Lithium, even in low doses, is highly effective as an anti-suicidal drug for recurrent depression. In addition, clozapine reduces suicide risk in patients with schizophrenia. There are multiple new treatments under investigation for the depressed suicidal patient, including psychologic interventions and medical interventions with intranasal esketamine and drugs used for treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal. Intranasal esketamine is now approved for adults with treatment-refractory depression and those with major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.ECT) is still effective for the treatment of severe depression and for suicidal depression. ECT and transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been approved for treatment-resistant depression and can be considered for patients with severe treatment-refractory depression, psychotic depression, or bipolar disorder. Both of these forms of treatment may also be helpful in reducing suicide risk (1, 2 Treatment references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Effect of Suicide Any suicidal act has a marked emotional effect on all involved. Losing someone to suicide is a particularly painful and complex type of loss. Suicide-related grief differs from other types of loss because of unanswered questions surrounding why someone died by suicide and because many people have limited knowledge about suicide. In an effort to make sense of the inexplicable and shocking event (suicide), people frequently launch an intense search for information and generate a series of hypotheses about why the suicide occurred. This can lead to guilt, blame, and anger directed at themselves and others for not having prevented the suicide, and also anger at the loved one who died. This natural part of suicide grief is generally extremely intense in the initial few months, and often lessens in intensity in the second year and beyond. A large number of individuals are affected by each suicide death, including family members, friends, colleagues and others. An international meta-analysis of population-based suicide loss studies found 4.3% of community members had experienced another’s suicide in the past year, and 21.8% during their lifetime. In the United States, even higher rates of exposure were found. From a national sample of 1432 adults, 51% had been exposed to suicide and 35% met criteria for suicide bereavement (defined as experiencing moderate to severe emotional distress related to the suicide loss) at some point in their life (1–3 Effect of suicide references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. The physician can provide valuable assistance to patients who are suicide bereaved. For clinicians who lose a patient to suicide, the experience can be far more distressing than other clinically related deaths. It is often similar to the traumatic and profoundly distressing experience of the death of a physician's family member rather than to the loss of a patient. In one study, half of psychiatrists who lost a patient to suicide had scores on the Impact of an Event Scale comparable to those of a clinical population who had experienced the death of a parent (4 Effect of suicide references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. The loss experience for health professionals often has both personal and professional ramifications, which can include anguish, feeling of guilt, self-doubt, complicated grief, and even thoughts of leaving the profession. There are resources available to clinicians for support through several organizations (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Association of Suicidology, Jed Foundation; [ 5 Effect of suicide references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Effect of suicide references Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal. Physician Aid in Dying Physician aid in dying (formerly, assisted suicide) refers to the assistance given by physicians to people who wish to end their life. It is controversial but legal in 9 US states (California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Washington) and the District of Columbia and is under consideration in 17 other states. All states where physician aid in dying is legal have guidelines for participating patients and physicians, such as eligibility and reporting requirements (eg, the patient must be mentally competent and have a terminal illness with a life expectancy of < 6 months). Voluntary euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, and Luxembourg. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. Physician-assisted suicide (or aid in dying) involves making lethal means available to the patient to be used at a time of the patient’s own choosing. In voluntary active euthanasia, the physician takes an active role in carrying out the patient’s request; it usually involves IV administration of a lethal substance. Despite the limited availability of physician aid in dying, patients with painful, debilitating, and untreatable conditions may initiate a discussion about it with a physician. Physician aid in dying may pose difficult ethical issues for physicians.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Silent lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs most often among women, typically three to four months after childbirth, and causes the thyroid to become enlarged without becoming tender. The disorder tends to recur with each subsequent pregnancy. For several weeks to several months, people have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions. The Thyroid VIDEO Symptoms of Silent Lymphocytic Thyroiditis Silent lymphocytic thyroiditis begins in the 3 to 4 months following childbirth. It starts with a hyperthyroid phase when the thyroid gland gets bigger without any pain or tenderness. Then the woman develops hypothyroidism before the condition usually resolves on its own. During the second phase, the woman may experience symptoms of hypothyroidism Symptoms Hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions.  The word \"silent\" in silent lymphocytic thyroiditis indicates that the thyroid inflammation causes no pain or tenderness. Lymphocytic refers to the type of white blood cells seen when thyroid tissue is examined with a microscope.

Treatment of Silent Lymphocytic Thyroiditis Beta-blocker for hyperthyroidism Thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism may require treatment for a few weeks, often with a beta-blocker such as atenolol. Beta-blockers help control many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. For example, these medications can slow a fast heart rate, reduce tremors, and control anxiety. During the period of hypothyroidism, the person may need to take thyroid hormone, usually for no longer than about 12 months. However, hypothyroidism becomes permanent in about 10% of people with silent lymphocytic thyroiditis, and these people must take thyroid hormone for the rest of their life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Etiology of Knee Pain There are many causes of pain in or around the knee in athletes, particularly runners, including Subluxation of the patella when bending the knee Chondromalacia of the undersurface of the patella Chondromalacia Patellae Chondromalacia patellae is softening of the cartilage underneath the patella.Intra-articular pathology, such as meniscal tears and plicae (infolding of the normal synovial lining of the knee) Fat pad inflammation Stress fractures of the tibia Malalignment of the lower extremities Patellar (or infrapatellar) tendinitis Infrapatellar Tendinitis Infrapatellar tendinitis is an overuse injury to the patellar tendon at the attachment to the lower pole of the patella.Knee pain may be referred from the lumbar spine or hip or result from foot problems (eg, excessive pronation or rolling inward of the foot during walking or running). Diagnosis of Knee Pain History and physical examination Sometimes imaging tests Diagnosis requires a thorough review of the injured athlete’s training program, including a history of symptom onset and aggravating factors, and a complete lower-extremity examination (for knee examination, see Approach to the Patient With Joint Symptoms: Physical Examination Physical Examination Some musculoskeletal disorders affect primarily the joints, causing arthritis.Knee Sprains and Meniscal Injuries Knee Sprains and Meniscal Injuries Sprains of the external (medial and lateral collateral) or internal (anterior and posterior cruciate) ligaments or injuries of the menisci may result from knee trauma. Mechanical symptoms, such as locking or catching, suggest an internal derangement of the knee such as a meniscal tear. Instability symptoms, such as giving way and loss of confidence in the extremity when twisting or turning on the knee, suggest ligamentous injury or subluxation of the patella. Chondromalacia is suggested by anterior knee pain after running, especially on hills, as well as pain and stiffness after sitting for any length of time (positive movie sign). On examination, pain is typically reproduced by compression of the patella against the femur. Pain that becomes worse with weight-bearing suggests a stress fracture. Treatment of Knee Pain Quadriceps-strengthening exercises Sometimes stabilizing pads, supports, or braces Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Treatment is tailored to the specific cause of the pain. Treatment of chondromalacia includes quadriceps-strengthening exercises with balanced strengthening exercises for the hamstrings, use of arch supports if excessive pronation is a possible contributor, and use of NSAIDs. For patellar subluxation, use of patella-stabilizing pads or braces may be necessary, especially in sports that require rapid, agile movements in various planes (eg, basketball, tennis). If there is excessive pronation of the foot, and all other possible causes of knee pain have been excluded, use of an orthotic insert is sometimes useful. Stress fractures require rest and cessation of weight-bearing activity. Intra-articular pathology often requires surgery. Exercises to Strengthen the Knee Straight Leg Raise 1.

Inflammation results from a cell-mediated immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The precise etiology of inflammatory bowel disease unknown, but evidence suggests that the normal intestinal flora inappropriately trigger an immune reaction in patients with a multifactorial genetic predisposition (perhaps involving abnormal epithelial barriers and mucosal immune defenses). No specific environmental, dietary, or infectious causes have been identified. The immune reaction involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor. Although Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are similar, they can be distinguished in most cases . About 10% of colitis cases are not initially distinguishable and are termed unclassified; if a surgical pathologic specimen cannot be classified, it is termed indeterminate colitis. The term colitis applies only to inflammatory disease of the colon (eg, ulcerative, granulomatous, ischemic, radiation-induced, infectious). Table Differentiating Crohn Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Crohn Disease Ulcerative Colitis Small bowel is involved in 80% of cases. Disease is confined to the colon. Rectum is often spared; colonic involvement is usually right-sided. Rectum is invariably involved; colonic involvement is usually left-sided. Gross rectal bleeding is rare, except in 75‒85% of cases of Crohn colitis. Gross rectal bleeding is always present. Fistula, mass, and abscess development is common. Fistulas do not occur. Perianal lesions are significant in 25‒35% of cases. Significant perianal lesions never occur. On x-ray, bowel wall is affected asymmetrically and segmentally, with skip areas between diseased segments. Bowel wall is affected symmetrically and uninterruptedly from rectum proximally. Endoscopic appearance is patchy, with discrete ulcerations separated by segments of normal-appearing mucosa. Inflammation is uniform and diffuse. Microscopic inflammation and fissuring extend transmurally; lesions are often highly focal in distribution. Inflammation is confined to mucosa except in severe cases. Epithelioid (sarcoid-like) granulomas are detected in bowel wall or lymph nodes in 25‒50% of cases (pathognomonic). Typical epithelioid granulomas do not occur. Epidemiology Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects people of all ages but usually begins before age 30, with peak incidence from 14 to 24. IBD may have a second smaller peak between ages 50 and 70; however, this later peak may include some cases of ischemic colitis. IBD is most common among people of Northern European and Anglo-Saxon origin and is 2 to 4 times more common among Ashkenazi Jews than non-Jewish White people from the same geographic location. The incidence is lower in central and southern Europe and lower still in South America, Asia, and Africa. However, the incidence is increasing among Black and Latin American people living in North America. Both sexes are equally affected. First-degree relatives of patients with IBD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk; their absolute risk may be as high as 7%. Familial tendency is much higher in Crohn disease than in ulcerative colitis. Several gene mutations conferring a higher risk of Crohn disease (and some possibly related to ulcerative colitis) have been identified. Cigarette smoking seems to contribute to development or exacerbation of Crohn disease but decreases risk of ulcerative colitis. Appendectomy done to treat appendicitis also appears to lower the risk of ulcerative colitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate IBD. Oral contraceptives may increase the risk of Crohn disease. Some data suggest that perinatal illness and the use of antibiotics in childhood may be associated with an increased risk of IBD. For unclear reasons, people who have a higher socioeconomic status may have an increased risk of Crohn disease. Pearls & Pitfalls Cigarette smoking decreases the risk of ulcerative colitis. Extraintestinal Manifestations Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis both affect organs other than the intestines. Most extraintestinal manifestations are more common in ulcerative colitis and Crohn colitis than in Crohn disease limited to the small bowel. Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are categorized in 3 ways: 1. Disorders that usually parallel (ie, wax and wane with) IBD flare-ups: These disorders include peripheral arthritis, episcleritis is self-limiting, recurring, usually idiopathic inflammation of the episcleral tissue that does not threaten vision.Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common condition in which round or ovoid painful ulcers recur on the oral mucosa. Etiology is unclear. Diagnosis is clinical.Erythema Nodosum Erythema nodosum is a specific form of panniculitis characterized by tender, red or violet, palpable, subcutaneous nodules on the shins and occasionally other locations. Arthritis tends to involve large joints and be migratory and transient. One or more of these parallel disorders develops in more than one third of patients hospitalized with IBD. 2Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well.Pyoderma Gangrenosum Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, neutrophilic, progressive skin necrosis of unknown etiology often associated with systemic illness and sometimes skin injury. Diagnosis is clinical.Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is patchy inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of the bile ducts that has no known cause. Ankylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in IBD patients with human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27). Most patients with spinal or sacroiliac involvement have evidence of uveitis and vice versa. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is a risk factor for cancer of the biliary tract, is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn colitis. Cholangitis may appear before or concurrently with the bowel disease or even 20 years after colectomy. Liver disease (eg, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, pericholangitis, cirrhosis) occurs in 3 to 5% of patients, although minor abnormalities in liver tests are more common. Some of these conditions (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis) may precede IBD by many years and, when diagnosed, should prompt an evaluation for IBD. 3. Disorders that are consequences of disrupted bowel physiology: These disorders occur mainly in severe Crohn disease of the small bowel. Malabsorption Overview of Malabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport.B12, or minerals, resulting in anemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, clotting disorders, and bone demineralization. In children, malabsorption retards growth and development. Other disorders include kidney stones resulting from excessive dietary oxalate absorption, hydroureter and hydronephrosis resulting from ureteral compression by the intestinal inflammatory process, gallstones resulting from impaired ileal reabsorption of bile salts, and amyloidosis secondary to long-standing inflammatory and suppurative disease. Thromboembolic disease may occur as a result of multiple factors in all 3 categories.

Details of their selection and use are discussed under each disorder and in Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Drugs for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Several classes of drugs are helpful for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Supportive care Most patients and their families are interested in diet and stress management. Although there are anecdotal reports of clinical improvement on certain diets, including one with rigid carbohydrate restrictions, controlled trials have shown no consistent benefit. Stress management may be helpful.Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Those < 50 years of age who have IBD may receive the vaccine, and clinicians should engage in a shared decision-making discussion with patients to determine whether they should be vaccinated . This vaccine should be given before starting immunosuppressive therapy when possible. Routine vaccinations such as tetanus-diphtheria Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccine A vaccine for tetanus alone is available, but the tetanus vaccine is typically combined with those for diphtheria and/or pertussis.A Hepatitis A (Hep.A) Vaccine Both hepatitis A vaccines provide long-term protection against hepatitis AB Hepatitis B (Hep.B) Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine is 80 to 100% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis B in people who complete the vaccine series.Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease. HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPVAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology recommend patients with IBD, including those on immunosuppressive therapy, receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Screening tests Female patients who are not receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be screened for cervical cancer with a Papanicolaou (Pap) test Diagnosis Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy should have a Pap test yearly. All patients who are taking or plan to take immunomodulating drugs or biologic agents should be evaluated for skin cancer Overview of Skin Cancer Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer and commonly develops in sun-exposed areas of skin.

Infections can occur anywhere and are most common in skinfolds, digital web spaces, genitals, cuticles, and oral mucosa. Symptoms and signs vary by site. Diagnosis is by clinical appearance and/or potassium hydroxide wet mount of skin scrapings. Treatment is with drying agents and antifungals. Most candidal infections are of the skin and mucous membranes, but invasive candidiasis is common among immunosuppressed patients and can be life threatening. Systemic candidiasis is discussed in Fungi Candidiasis (Invasive) Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C. albicans), manifested by mucocutaneous lesions, fungemia, and sometimes focal infection of multiple sites. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is discussed in Candidal Vaginitis Candidal Vaginitis Candidal vaginitis is vaginal infection with Candida species, usually C. albicans.  Most fungal vaginitis is caused by C. Etiology of Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Potentially pathogenic fungi include dermatophytes and yeast. Candida is a group of about 150 yeast species. C. albicans is responsible for about 70 to 80% of all candidal infections. Other significant species include C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, and C. dubliniensis. Candida is a ubiquitous yeast that resides harmlessly on skin and mucous membranes until dampness, heat, and impaired local and systemic defenses provide a fertile environment for it to grow. Risk factors for candidiasis include Hot weather Restrictive clothing Poor hygiene Infrequent diaper or undergarment changes in children and older patients Altered flora resulting from antibiotic therapy Inflammatory diseases (eg, psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.Immunosuppression resulting from corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, pregnancy, diabetes, other endocrinopathies (eg, Cushing disease, hypoadrenalism, hypothyroidism), blood dyscrasias, HIV/AIDS, or T-cell defects Candidiasis occurs most commonly in intertriginous areas such as the axillae, groin, and gluteal folds (eg, diaper rash), in digital web spaces, on the glans penis, and beneath the breasts. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is common among women. Candidal nail infections and paronychia Acute Paronychia is infection of the periungual tissues. Acute paronychia causes redness, warmth, and pain along the nail margin. Diagnosis is by inspection.Onychomycosis is fungal infection of the nail plate, nail bed, or both. The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow. In obese people, candidal infections may occur beneath the pannus (abdominal fold). Oropharyngeal candidiasis is a common sign of local or systemic immunosuppression. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis typically affects the nails, skin, and oropharynx. Patients have cutaneous anergy to Candida, absent proliferative responses to Candida antigen (but normal proliferative responses to mitogens), and an intact antibody response to Candida and other antigens. They also have impaired T-cell–mediated immunity. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis may occur as an autosomal recessive illness associated with hypoparathyroidism and Addison disease (Candida-endocrinopathy syndrome). Symptoms and Signs of Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Intertriginous infections manifest as pruritic, well-demarcated, erythematous patches of varying size and shape; erythema may be difficult to detect in darker-skinned patients. Primary patches may have adjacent satellite papules and pustules. Perianal candidiasis produces white maceration and pruritus ani. Vulvovaginal candidiasis causes pruritus and discharge  albicans. Candidal nail infections can affect the nail plate, edges of the nail, or both. Candidal infection is a frequent cause of chronic paronychia Acute Paronychia is infection of the periungual tissues. Diagnosis is by inspection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis causes white plaques on oral mucous membranes that may bleed when scraped  They are invariably painful. Perlèche is candidiasis at the corners of the mouth, which causes cracks and tiny fissures. It may stem from chronic lip licking, thumb sucking, ill-fitting dentures, or other conditions that make the corners of the mouth moist enough that yeast can grow. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is characterized by red, pustular, crusted, and thickened plaques resembling psoriasis, especially on the nose and forehead, and is invariably associated with chronic oral candidiasis. Diagnosis of Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Clinical appearance Potassium hydroxide wet mounts Diagnosis of mucocutaneous candidiasis is based on clinical appearance and identification of yeast and pseudohyphae in potassium hydroxide wet mounts of scrapings from a lesion. Positive culture alone is usually meaningless because Candida is omnipresent. Treatment of Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Sometimes drying agents Topical or oral antifungals Intertriginous infection is treated with drying agents as needed (eg, Burow solution compresses applied for 15 to 20 minutes for oozing lesions) and topical antifungals . Powdered formulations are also helpful (eg, miconazole powder 2 times a day for 2 to 3 weeks). Fluconazole 150 mg orally once/week for 2 to 4 weeks can be used for extensive intertriginous candidiasis; topical antifungal agents may be used at the same time. Table Candidal diaper rash is treated with more frequent changes of diapers, use of super- or ultra-absorbent disposable diapers, and an imidazole cream 2 times a day. Oral nystatin is an option for infants with coexisting oropharyngeal candidiasis; 1 mL of suspension (100,000 units/mL) is placed in each buccal pouch 4 times a day. Candidal paronychia is treated by protecting the area from wetness and giving topical or oral antifungals. These infections are often resistant to treatment. Thymol 4% in alcohol applied to the affected area 2 times a day is often helpful. Oral candidiasis can be treated by dissolving 1 clotrimazole 10-mg troche in the mouth 4 to 5 times a day for 14 days. Another option is nystatin oral suspension (4 to 6 mL of a 100,000 unit/mL solution) held in the mouth for as long as possible and then swallowed or expectorated 3 to 4 times a day, continuing for 7 to 14 days after symptoms and signs have resolved. A systemic antifungal may also be used (eg, fluconazole 200 mg orally on the first day, then 100 mg orally once a day for 2 to 3 weeks thereafter). Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis requires long-term oral antifungal treatment with oral fluconazole. Key Points Candida are normal skin flora that can become infective under certain conditions (eg, excessive moisture, alteration of normal flora, host immunosuppression). Consider candidiasis with erythematous, scaling, pruritic patches in intertriginous areas and with lesions in the mucous membranes, around the nails, or at the corners of the mouth. If clinical appearance is not diagnostic, try to identify yeast and pseudohyphae in potassium hydroxide wet mounts of scrapings from a lesion. Treat most intertriginous candidiasis with a drying agent and a topical antifungal. Treat most diaper rash with frequent changes of absorbent disposable diapers and an imidazole cream.

IUDs have minimal systemic effects. IUDs need to be changed only every 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, avoiding the need to use a daily, weekly, or monthly contraceptive method. In the US, available IUDs include levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs and a copper-bearing IUD. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs include A 13.5-mg IUD (14 mcg a day) is effective for 3 years and has a 3-year cumulative pregnancy rate of 1.0%. A 19.5-mg IUD (17.5 mcg a day) is effective for 5 years and has a cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate of 0.9 to 1.4%. Two IUDs contain 52 mg (20 mcg a day for 5 years, 10 mcg a day after 5 years) were originally used for 5 years with a cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate of 0.5 to 1.1%; additional studies report them to be effective at 7 years with a cumulative 7-year pregnancy rate of 0.5 to 1.1%. Use for 8 years is being evaluated. The copper-bearing T380A IUD is effective for 10 years; it has a cumulative 12-year pregnancy rate of < 2% .  Insertion of the IUD Clinicians do not need to do a Papanicolaou (Pap) test or human papillomavirus (HPV) test before they insert an IUD, unless the patient is due for cervical cancer screening.STIs)—gonorrhea and chlamydial infection—should be done just before the IUD is inserted. However, clinicians do not need to wait for results of STI testing before they insert an IUD. If results are positive, patients should be treated with appropriate antibiotics; the IUD is left in place. If purulent cervical discharge is observed just before planned IUD insertion, the IUD is not inserted and STI testing is done; the infection, if present, is then treated, and the IUD is inserted after treatment of the infection is complete. The package insert for the IUD should be reviewed before insertion. When IUDs are inserted, sterile technique is used as much as possible. Bimanual examination should be done to determine the position of the uterus and a tenaculum should be placed on the anterior lip of the cervix to stabilize the uterus, straighten the uterine axis, and help ensure correct placement of the IUD. A uterine sound device may be used to measure the length of the uterine cavity before IUD insertion. Before insertion, a paracervical block may be used to decrease pain during insertion (1 Insertion references In the US, 12% of women who use contraception use intrauterine devices (IUDs); IUDs are popular because of their advantages as a contraceptive method: IUDs are highly effective. An IUD may be inserted at any time during the menstrual cycle if a woman has not had unprotected intercourse during the past month. A routine follow-up visit after IUD insertion is not necessary. Patients should be counseled to return for evaluation if they experience symptoms or complications (eg, pain, heavy bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, fever, expulsion) or are dissatisfied with the method (2 Insertion references In the US, 12% of women who use contraception use intrauterine devices (IUDs); IUDs are popular because of their advantages as a contraceptive method: IUDs are highly effective. An IUD may be inserted immediately after an induced or a spontaneous abortion during the 1st or 2nd trimester and immediately after delivery of the placenta in a cesarean or vaginal delivery. Contraindications Most women can use an IUD. Contraindications include the following: Anatomic abnormalities that distort the uterine cavity Current pelvic infection, usually pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur.PID), mucopurulent cervicitis is infectious or noninfectious inflammation of the cervix.

The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Typically, it manifests as postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Staging is surgical.For levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs, breast cancer Breast Cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.For copper-bearing T380 IUDs, Wilson disease Wilson Disease Wilson disease results in accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. Hepatic or neurologic symptoms develop.Conditions that do not contraindicate IUDs include the following: Contraindications to contraceptives that contain estrogen (eg, history of venous thromboembolism, smoking > 15 cigarettes/day in women > 35, migraine with aura, migraine of any type in women > 35) A history of PID, STIs, or ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Adolescence The patient's personal beliefs about abortion because IUDs are not abortifacients (however, a copper or 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUD used for emergency contraception may prevent implantation of the blastocyst, possibly terminating a viable pregnancy) Adverse effects Vaginal bleeding is often irregular in the first several months after insertion of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD. Bleeding then stops completely within 1 year in up to 20% of women; some patients consider this effect a benefit of the IUD. A copper-bearing T380A IUD may cause heavier menstrual bleeding and more severe cramping, which can be relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen). Women should be told about these effects before the IUD is inserted because this information may help them decide which type of IUD to choose. Potential benefits Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. Data about whether they increase the risk of breast cancer are conflicting (1 Potential benefits reference In the US, 12% of women who use contraception use intrauterine devices (IUDs); IUDs are popular because of their advantages as a contraceptive method: IUDs are highly effective. Complications Average IUD expulsion rates are usually < 5% within the first year after insertion; however, expulsion rates are higher if the IUD is inserted immediately (< 10 minutes) after a delivery. After insertion, a clinician confirms correct placement at 6 weeks by looking for the strings attached to the IUD, which are typically trimmed to 3 cm from the external cervical os. The uterus is perforated in about 1/1000 IUD insertions. Perforation typically occurs at the time of IUD insertion. Sometimes only the distal part of the IUD penetrates; then over the next few months, uterine contractions force the IUD into the peritoneal cavity. If the strings are not visible during pelvic examination, clinicians may do one or more of the following: Use a cytobrush to attempt to sweep the strings out of the cervical canal Gently probe the uterine cavity with an IUD hook, sound, or biopsy instrument (unless pregnancy is suspected), being careful not to push the IUD further into the uterine cavity or myometrium Do ultrasonography If the IUD is not seen, an abdominal x-ray is taken to exclude an intraperitoneal location. Intraperitoneal IUDs may cause intestinal adhesions. IUDs that have perforated the uterus are removed via laparoscopy. If expulsion or perforation is suspected, a backup contraceptive method should be used. Rarely, salpingitis (pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]) develops during the first month after insertion because bacteria are displaced into the uterine cavity during insertion; however, this risk is low and routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. If PID develops, antibiotics should be given. The IUD need not be removed unless the infection persists despite antibiotics. IUD strings do not provide access for bacteria. Except during the first month after insertion, IUDs do not increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. If Actinomyces-like organisms on a Pap test in women with no symptoms of infection does not require antibiotics nor IUD removal.IUD users than in women using no contraceptive method because IUDs effectively prevent pregnancy. However, if a women becomes pregnant while an IUD is in place, she should be told that risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased, and she should be evaluated promptly. Key Points IUDs are highly effective contraceptives and have minimal systemic effects, and IUDs need to be changed only every 3, 5, 7 or 10 years depending on the IUD chosen. Types include levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (effective for 3 to 7 years, depending on the type) and a copper-bearing IUD (effective for 10 years, with a 12-year pregnancy rate of < 2%). A Pap or HPV test is not required before IUD insertion unless the patient is due for cervical cancer screening. Inform women that both types of IUDs can affect menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea with levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs and possibly heavier menstrual bleeding and more severe cramping with the copper-bearing T380 IUD). Counsel patients to return for evaluation after IUD placement if they have complications (eg, pain, heavy bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge,fever, expulsion). If the strings are not visible during the pelvic examination, attempt to sweep the strings out with a cytobrush or gently probe the uterine cavity using an IUD hook, uterine sound, or biopsy instrument (unless pregnancy is suspected), and if needed, do ultrasonography or take an abdominal x-ray to check for location.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Headache, nausea, constipation or diarrhea, lower back pain, and urinary frequency are common; vomiting occurs occasionally. Sometimes dysmenorrhea is accompanied by symptoms of premenstrual syndrome or heavy menstrual bleeding and passage of blood clots. In about 5 to 15% of women with primary dysmenorrhea, cramps are severe enough to interfere with daily activities and may result in absence from school or work.

Etiology of Dysmenorrhea can be Primary (more common) Secondary (due to other disorders) Primary dysmenorrhea Primary dysmenorrhea is idiopathic and cannot be explained by other gynecologic disorders (1 Etiology reference Dysmenorrhea is uterine pain around the time of menses. Pain is thought to result from uterine contractions and ischemia, probably mediated by prostaglandins (eg, prostaglandin F2-alpha, a potent myometrial stimulant and vasoconstrictor) and other inflammatory mediators produced in secretory endometrium and possibly associated with prolonged uterine contractions and decreased blood flow to the myometrium. Contributing factors may include the following: Passage of menstrual tissue through the cervix High levels of prostaglandin F2-alpha in menstrual fluid A narrow cervical os A malpositioned uterus Anxiety Primary dysmenorrhea typically begins within a year after menarche and occurs almost invariably in ovulatory cycles. The pain usually begins when menses start (or just before) and persists for the first 1 to 2 days; this pain, described as spasmodic, is superimposed over constant lower abdominal pain, which may radiate to the back or thigh. Patients may also have malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low back pain, or headache. Risk factors for severe symptoms include the following: Early age at menarche Long or heavy menstrual periods Smoking A family history of dysmenorrhea Symptoms tend to lessen with increasing age and after a first pregnancy. Secondary dysmenorrhea Symptoms of secondary dysmenorrhea are due to pelvic abnormalities. Almost any abnormality or process that can affect the pelvic viscera can cause dysmenorrhea. Common causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include Endometriosis Endometriosis In endometriosis, functioning endometrial cells are implanted in the pelvis outside the uterine cavity. Symptoms depend on location of the implants.Uterine adenomyosis Uterine Adenomyosis Uterine adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in the uterine musculature. Symptoms include heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain.Fibroids Uterine Fibroids Uterine fibroids are benign uterine tumors of smooth muscle origin.Less common causes include congenital malformations (eg, bicornuate uterus, subseptate uterus, transverse vaginal septum), ovarian cysts and tumors, pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur.Intrauterine Device (IUDs; IUD) In the US, 12% of women who use contraception use intrauterine devices (IUDs); IUDs are popular because of their advantages as a contraceptive method: IUDs are highly effective.IUDs), particularly copper IUDs. In a few women, pain occurs when the uterus attempts to expel tissue through an extremely tight cervical os (secondary to conization, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], or cryotherapy). Pain occasionally results from a pedunculated submucosal fibroid or an endometrial polyp protruding through the cervix. Risk factors for severe secondary dysmenorrhea are the same as those for primary. Secondary dysmenorrhea usually begins during adulthood unless caused by congenital malformations. Epub 2015 Sep 7. Evaluation of Dysmenorrhea Clinicians can identify dysmenorrhea based on symptoms. They then determine whether dysmenorrhea is primary or secondary. History of present illness should cover complete menstrual history, including age at onset of menses, duration and amount of flow, time between menses, variability of timing, and relation of menses to symptoms. Clinicians should also ask about The age at which symptoms began Their nature and severity Factors that relieve or worsen symptoms (including the effects of contraceptives) Degree of disruption of daily life Effect on sexual activity Presence of pelvic pain unrelated to menses Response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) History of dyspareunia or infertility (associated with endometriosis) Review of systems should include accompanying symptoms such as cyclic nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Past medical history should identify known causes, including endometriosis, uterine adenomyosis, or fibroids. Method of contraception should be ascertained, specifically asking about IUD use. Past surgical history should identify procedures that increase risk of dysmenorrhea, such as cervical conization and endometrial ablation. Physical examination Pelvic examination focuses on detecting causes of secondary dysmenorrhea. The cervix is examined for tenderness, discharge, cervical stenosis, or a prolapsed polyp or fibroid. Bimanual examination is performed to check for uterine masses and uterine consistency (a boggy uterus occurs in adenomyosis), adnexal masses, thickening of the rectovaginal septum, induration of the cul-de-sac, and nodularity of the uterosacral ligament. The abdomen is examined for evidence of abnormal findings, including signs of peritonitis. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern in patients with dysmenorrhea: New or sudden-onset pain Unremitting pain Fever Purulent cervical discharge Evidence of peritonitis Interpretation of findings Red flag findings suggest a cause of pelvic pain other than dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is suspected if Symptoms begin soon after menarche or during adolescence. Secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected if Symptoms begin after adolescence. Patients have known causes, including uterine adenomyosis, fibroids, a tight cervical os, a mass protruding from the cervical os, or, particularly, endometriosis. Endometriosis is considered in patients with adnexal masses, thickening of the rectovaginal septum, induration of the cul-de-sac, nodularity of the uterosacral ligament, or, occasionally, nonspecific vaginal, vulvar, or cervical lesions. Testing aims to exclude structural gynecologic disorders. Most patients should have Pregnancy testing Pelvic ultrasonography Pregnancy testing should be done in all women of reproductive age who present with pelvic pain. If pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur. Pelvic ultrasonography is highly sensitive for pelvic masses (eg, ovarian cysts, fibroids, endometriosis, uterine adenomyosis) and can locate abnormally located IUDs. If these tests are inconclusive and symptoms persist, hysterosalpingography or sonohysterography may be done to identify endometrial polyps, submucous fibroids, or congenital abnormalities. MRI may be required to fully characterize congenital anomalies. If results of all other tests are inconclusive, laparoscopy may be done, particularly if endometriosis is suspected. Treatment of Dysmenorrhea Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Often hormonal contraceptives Treatment of underlying disorders If identified, disorders causing dysmenorrhea are treated (eg, surgery to remove fibroids). General measures to improve the patient's general well-being (eg, adequate rest and sleep, regular exercise) may be helpful. . Some patients find that a heating pad (used safely to avoid burns) applied to the lower abdomen alleviates pain. Other interventions have been suggested as potentially effective. They include a low-fat diet and nutritional supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, flaxseed, magnesium, vitamin B1, vitamin E, and zinc. Few data support the usefulness of these interventions; however, they are low risk. Women with primary dysmenorrhea are reassured about the absence of other gynecologic disorders. Medications If pain is bothersome, NSAIDs (which relieve pain and inhibit prostaglandins) are typically tried. NSAIDs are usually started 24 to 48 hours before and continued until 1 or 2 days after menses begin. If the NSAID is ineffective, suppression of ovulation with an estrogen/progestin contraceptive may be tried. An NSAID or an NSAID plus an estrogen/progestin contraceptive is usually effective (1 Treatment reference Dysmenorrhea is uterine pain around the time of menses. Other hormone therapy, such as danazol, progestins (eg, levonorgestrel, etonogestrel, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, or a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, may decrease symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Other treatments Endometriosis may be treated pharmacologically or with surgical fulguration of lesions. For intractable pain of unknown origin, laparoscopic presacral neurectomy or uterosacral nerve ablation has been efficacious in some patients for as long as 12 months. Hypnosis Hypnotherapy, a type of mind-body medicine, is derived from western psychotherapeutic practice. Other proposed nonpharmacologic therapies, including acupuncture, a therapy within traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the most widely accepted components of integrative therapies in the western world.Electrical stimulation Treatment of pain and inflammation aims to facilitate movement and improve coordination of muscles and joints. Key Points Most dysmenorrhea is primary. Check for underlying gynecologic disorders. Usually, do ultrasonography to check for structural gynecologic disorders. An NSAID or an NSAID plus an estrogen/progestin contraceptive is usually effective.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis is by clinical criteria. Treatment is with cognitive-behavioral therapy.  In schizoid personality disorder, the ability to relate to others meaningfully is limited. About 3.1 to 4.9% of the general US population have schizoid personality disorder. It is slightly more common among men. Schizoid personality disorder may be more common among people with a family history of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder. Comorbidities are common. Up to half of patients have had at least one episode of major depressive disorder Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) Paranoid personality disorders is characterized by a pervasive pattern of unwarranted distrust and suspicion of others that involves interpreting their motives as malicious.Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation. Etiology of ScPD Having caregivers who were emotionally cold, neglectful, and detached during childhood may contribute to the development of schizoid personality disorder by fueling the child's feeling that interpersonal relationships are not satisfying. Symptoms and Signs of ScPD Patients with schizoid personality disorder seem to have no desire for close relationships with other people, including relatives. They have no close friends or confidants, except sometimes a 1st-degree relative. They rarely date and often do not marry. They prefer being by themselves, choosing activities and hobbies that do not require interaction with others (eg, computer games). Sexual activity with others is of little, if any, interest to them. They also seem to experience less enjoyment from sensory and bodily experiences (eg, walking on the beach). These patients do not seem bothered by what others think of them—whether good or bad. Because they do not notice normal clues of social interaction, they may seem socially inept, aloof, or self-absorbed. They rarely react (eg, by smiling or nodding) or show emotion in social situations. They have difficulty expressing anger, even when they are provoked. They do not react appropriately to important life events and may seem passive in response to changes in circumstances. As a result, they may seem to have no direction to their life. Rarely, when these patients feel comfortable revealing themselves, they admit that they feel pain, especially in social interactions. Symptoms of schizoid personality disorder tend to remain stable over time, more so than those of other personality disorders. Diagnosis of ScPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder, patients must have a persistent pattern of Detachment from and general disinterest in social relationships Limited expression of emotions in interpersonal interactions This pattern is shown by the presence of ≥ 4 of the following: No desire for or enjoyment of close relationships, including those with family members Strong preference for solitary activities Little, if any, interest in sexual activity with another person Enjoyment of few, if any, activities Lack of close friends or confidants, except possibly 1st-degree relatives Apparent indifference to the praise or criticism of others Emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affect Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.Patients with schizoid personality disorder, unlike those with schizophrenia, do not have cognitive or perceptual disturbances (eg, paranoia, hallucinations)Social impairment and stereotyped behaviors or interests are less prominent in patients with schizoid personality disorder.This disorder is characterized by distorted perceptions and thinking; these features are absent in schizoid personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation.Social isolation in schizoid personality disorder is due to pervasive detachment from and general disinterest in social relationships, whereas in avoidant personality disorder, it is due to fear of being embarrassed or rejected. Treatment of ScPD Social skills training General treatment Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment. No controlled studies have been published about psychotherapies or drug therapy for schizoid personality disorder. Generally, efforts to share interest in impersonal topics (eg, possessions, collections, hobbies) that appeal to people who prefer solitary pursuits can help establish a relationship with a patient and perhaps facilitate a therapeutic interaction. Cognitive-behavioral approaches that focus on acquiring social skills may also help patients change. Because patients with schizoid personality disorder lack interest in other people, they may not be motivated to change.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "c4c739e4-4a51-4759-82f0-548c11f8bc7b", "title": null, "text": "【0】A parasite is an organism that lives on or inside another organism (the host) and benefits (for example, by getting nutrients) from the host at the host's expense. Although this definition actually applies to many microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, doctors use the term \"parasites\" to refer to Protozoa (such as amebas Amebiasis is an infection of the large intestine and sometimes the liver and other organs that is caused by the single-celled protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, an ameba. The protozoa include a wide range of single-cell organisms such as Giardia Giardiasis Giardiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused by the single-celled protozoan parasite Giardia. The main symptoms are abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Most worms, in contrast, produce eggs or larvae that develop in the environment before they become capable of infecting people. Development in the environment may involve another animal (an intermediate host). There are many species of fluke. Different species tend to infect different parts of the body. Parasitic infections are more common in rural or developing areas than in developed areas. In developed areas, these infections may occur in immigrants, in returning travelers, or in people with a weakened immune system. Parasites usually enter the body through the mouth or skin. Doctors diagnose the infection by taking samples of blood, stool, urine, sputum, or other infected tissue and examining or sending them to a laboratory for analysis. Travelers to areas where food, drink, and water may be contaminated are advised to cook it, boil it, peel it, or forget it. Drugs are available to treat most parasitic infections. Most parasitic infections are more common in tropical and subtropical areas, and intestinal parasites are often linked to areas with inadequate sanitation. A person who visits such an area can unknowingly acquire a parasitic infection, and a doctor may not readily diagnose the infection when the person returns home. In the United States and other industrialized countries, parasitic infections tend to affect mainly immigrants, international travelers, and people with a weakened immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders. Parasitic infections may occur in places with poor sanitation and unhygienic practices (as occurs in some psychiatric hospitals and day care centers). Some parasites are common in the United States and other industrialized countries. Transmission of Parasites usually enter the body through the Mouth Skin Parasites that enter through the mouth are swallowed and can remain in the intestine or burrow through the intestinal wall and invade other organs. Often parasites enter the mouth through fecal-oral transmission Fecal-oral transmission of parasites A parasite is an organism that lives on or inside another organism (the host) and benefits (for example, by getting nutrients) from the host at the host's expense. Some parasites can enter directly through the skin. Others are transmitted by insect bites. Rarely, parasites are spread through blood transfusions, in transplanted organs, through injections with a needle previously used by an infected person, or from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Some other infectious organisms, such as certain viruses and bacteria, also are transmitted by these same methods. Fecal-oral transmission of parasites Fecal-oral transmission is a common way to acquire a parasite. Fecal refers to feces or stool, and oral refers to the mouth, including things taken into the mouth. Infection that is spread through the fecal-oral route is acquired when a person somehow ingests something that is contaminated by feces from an infected person or animal, such as a dog or cat. Many parasites invade or live in people's digestive tract. Thus, parasites or their eggs are often present in people's feces. Infected people often spread their infection when they do not wash their hands adequately after using the toilet. Because their hands are contaminated, anything they touch afterward may be contaminated with parasites (or with bacteria or viruses that cause digestive tract disorders). If people with contaminated hands touch food—in restaurants, grocery stores, or homes—the food may become contaminated. Then, anyone who eats that food may get the infection. Ingestion does not have to involve food. For example, if a person with contaminated hands touches an object, such as a restroom door, the door can become contaminated. Other people who touch the contaminated door and then touch their finger to their mouth can be infected through the fecal-oral route. Other ways infection can be spread through the fecal-oral route include Drinking water contaminated with raw sewage (in areas with poor sanitation) Eating raw shellfish (such as oysters and clams) that have been cultivated in contaminated water Eating raw fruits or vegetables washed in contaminated water Engaging in sexual activity that involves mouth-to-anus contact Swimming in pools that have not been adequately disinfected or in lakes or parts of the ocean that are contaminated with sewage Skin transmission of parasites Some parasites live inside the body and enter through the skin. Others, such as schistosomes Schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis is infection caused by certain flatworms (flukes), called schistosomes. Insects that carry and transmit organisms that cause disease are called vectors. Some insect vectors transmit parasites called protozoa (such as those that cause malaria is infection of red blood cells with one of five species of Plasmodium, a protozoan. It causes itching, a rash, sometimes with scarring, as well as eye symptoms that may lead to blindness. Many of these parasites have very complex life cycles. Insects (for example, lice Infestation Lice infestation is a parasitic skin infestation caused by tiny wingless insects. Lice spread most frequently through close person-to-person contact. Biting mites, sometimes carried as parasites on the bodies of humans and animals, may transmit disease to humans. Scabies usually spreads from person to person through physical contact. They are transmitted by having close contact with an infected person or their belongings. Diagnosis of Parasitic Infections Laboratory analysis of samples of blood, stool, urine, skin, or sputum (phlegm) Doctors suspect a parasitic infection in people who have typical symptoms and who live in or have traveled to an area where sanitation is poor or where such an infection is known to occur. Laboratory analysis of specimens, including special tests to identify proteins released by the parasite (antigen testing) or genetic material (DNA) from the parasite, may be needed. Samples of blood, stool, urine, skin, or sputum may be used, depending on which parasite doctors are looking for. Doctors may test blood samples for antibodies to the parasite. Doctors may also take a sample of tissue that may contain the parasite. For example, a biopsy may be done to obtain a sample of intestinal or other infected tissue. A sample of skin may be snipped. Several samples and repeated examinations may be necessary to find the parasite. Identifying parasites in the intestinal tract If parasites live in the intestinal tract, the parasite or its eggs or cysts (a dormant and hardy form of the parasite) may be found in the person’s stool when a sample is examined under a microscope. Or parasites may be identified by testing the stool for proteins released by the parasite or genetic materials from the parasite. Antibiotics, laxatives, and antacids should not be used until after the stool sample has been collected. These drugs can reduce the number of parasites enough to make seeing the parasites in a stool sample difficult or impossible. Prevention of Parasitic Infections In general, measures that help prevent infection by parasites involve Good personal hygiene Avoiding insect bites Avoiding contact with contaminated water or soil Many preventive measures are sensible everywhere but some are more important in specific areas. Information about precautions needed in specific areas is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travelers' Health page. Preventing parasites acquired by mouth People need to be particularly careful when they travel to areas where sanitation methods are questionable. In addition, people should think about what they are eating and drinking before they consume it and make sure food is adequately cooked and water is not contaminated. For example, people should avoid drinking from lakes and streams and should avoid swallowing water when using swimming pools or water parks. Even water that looks fresh and clean can contain parasites, so people should not use the appearance of water to judge its safety for drinking. In areas of the world where food, drink, and water may be contaminated with parasites, wise advice for travelers is to Avoid drinking tap water \"Cook it, boil it, peel it, or forget it\" Because some parasites survive freezing, ice cubes can sometimes transmit disease unless the cubes are made from purified water. Thorough handwashing using soap and water is very important. People who prepare food for others (for example, restaurant workers) must be particularly careful to wash their hands thoroughly because they can spread infection to many people. Handwashing is important in the following situations: After using the toilet After changing a child's diapers or cleaning a child who has used the toilet Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating food Before and after caring for a person who is sick Before and after treating a cut or wound After touching an animal or animal waste Preventing parasites acquired through the skin To know precautions to take in specific countries, people should check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travelers' Health page. Measures that help protect against insect bites include: Using insecticide (permethrin or pyrethrum) sprays in homes and outbuildings Placing screens on doors and windows Using permethrin- or pyrethrum-saturated mosquito netting over beds Applying insect repellents containing DEET (diethyltoluamide) on exposed areas of the skin Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts, particularly between dusk and dawn, to protect against insect bites If insect exposure is likely to be long or involve many insects, applying permethrin to clothing before it is worn Treatment of Parasitic Infections Antiparasitic drugs For some parasitic infections, no treatment is needed because the infection disappears on its own. Some drugs (antiparasitic drugs) are designed particularly to eliminate parasites or, in the case of some worm infections, reduce the number of worms enough so that symptoms clear up. Also, certain antibiotics and antifungal drugs are effective against some parasitic infections. No single drug is effective against all parasites. For some parasitic infections, no drug is effective.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "34775de6-a16c-4b64-8198-ad8184422488", "title": null, "text": "【0】Chest pain is a very common complaint. Many patients are well aware that it is a warning of potential life-threatening disorders and seek evaluation for minimal symptoms. Other patients, including many with serious disease, minimize or ignore its warnings. Pain perception (both character and severity) varies greatly between individuals as well as between men and women. However described, chest pain should never be dismissed without an explanation of its cause. Pathophysiology of Chest Pain The heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels provide afferent visceral input through the same thoracic autonomic ganglia. A painful stimulus in these organs is typically perceived as originating in the chest, but because afferent nerve fibers overlap in the dorsal ganglia, thoracic pain may be felt (as referred pain) anywhere between the umbilicus and the ear, including the upper extremities. Painful stimuli from thoracic organs can cause discomfort described as pressure, tearing, gas with the urge to eructate, indigestion, burning or aching. Uncommonly, other descriptions of chest pain are given such as stabbing or sharp needle-like pain. When the sensation is visceral in origin, many patients deny they are having pain and insist it is merely “discomfort.” Etiology of Chest Pain Many disorders cause chest pain or discomfort. These disorders may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, or musculoskeletal systems . Some disorders are immediately life threatening: Acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Thoracic aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel)Tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. Esophageal rupture Esophageal Rupture Esophageal rupture may be iatrogenic during endoscopic procedures or other instrumentation or may be spontaneous (Boerhaave syndrome)Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis.PE) Other causes range from serious, potential threats to life to causes that are simply uncomfortable. Often no cause can be confirmed even after full evaluation. Overall, the most common causes are Chest wall disorders (ie, those involving muscle, rib, or cartilage) Pleural disorders Gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, causing burning pain.Cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder. In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones.Acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Angina Pectoris Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction.In some cases, no etiology of the chest pain can be determined. Table Evaluation of Chest Pain History of present illness should note the location, duration, character, and quality of the pain. The patient should be asked about any precipitating events (eg, straining or overuse of chest muscles), as well as any triggering and relieving factors. Specific factors to note include whether pain is present during exertion or at rest, presence of psychologic stress, whether pain occurs during respiration or coughing, difficulty swallowing, relationship to meals, and positions that relieve or exacerbate pain (eg, lying flat, leaning forward). Previous similar episodes and their circumstances should be noted with attention to the similarity or lack thereof and whether the episodes are increasing in frequency and/or duration. Important associated symptoms to seek include dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing. It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause. Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including leg pain, swelling, or both (deep venous thrombosis Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.DVT] and therefore possible pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis. Past medical history should document known causes, particularly cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and any cardiac investigations or procedures (eg, stress testing, catheterization). Risk factors for coronary artery disease Risk Factors Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.CAD—eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, tobacco use) or pulmonary embolism (eg, lower extremity injury, recent surgery, immobilization, known cancer, pregnancy) should also be noted. Drug history should note use of drugs that can trigger coronary artery spasm (eg, cocaine, triptans) or GI disease (particularly alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Family history should note history of myocardial infarction (particularly among 1st-degree relatives at an early age, ie, < 55 in men and < 60 in women) and hyperlipidemia. Physical examination The extent of physical examination is guided by clinical suspicion. Vital signs and weight are measured, and body mass index (BMI) is calculated. Pulses are palpated in both arms and both legs, blood pressure is measured in both arms. General appearance is noted (eg, pallor, diaphoresis, cyanosis, anxiety). The neck is inspected for venous distention and hepatojugular reflux. The neck is palpated for carotid pulses, lymphadenopathy, or thyroid abnormality. The carotid arteries are auscultated for bruit. Lungs are percussed and auscultated for presence and symmetry of breath sounds Auscultation Key components in the evaluation of patients with pulmonary symptoms are the history, physical examination, and, in many cases, a chest x-ray. The cardiac examination notes the intensity and timing of the 1st heart sound (S1) and 2nd heart sound (S2), the respiratory movement of the pulmonic component of S2, pericardial friction rubs, murmurs, and gallops. When murmurs are detected, the timing, duration, pitch, shape, and intensity and the response to changes of position, handgrip, and the Valsalva maneuver should be noted. When gallops are detected, differentiation should be made between the 4th heart sound (S4), which is often present with diastolic dysfunction or myocardial ischemia, and the 3rd heart sound (S3), which is present with systolic dysfunction. The chest is inspected for skin lesions of trauma or herpes zoster infection and palpated for crepitance (suggesting subcutaneous air) and tenderness. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, organomegaly, and masses or tenderness, particularly in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. The legs are examined for arterial pulses, adequacy of perfusion, edema, varicose veins, and signs of DVT (eg, swelling, erythema, tenderness). Pulsus paradoxus Pulsus paradoxus Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart. Red flags Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chest pain: Abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, bradycardia, tachypnea, hypotension) Signs of hypoperfusion (eg, confusion, ashen color, diaphoresis) Shortness of breath Hypoxemia on pulse oximetry Asymmetric breath sounds or pulses New heart murmurs Pulsus paradoxus > 10 mm Hg Interpretation of findings Symptoms and signs of thoracic disorders vary greatly, and those of serious and nonserious conditions often overlap. Although red flag findings indicate a high likelihood of serious disease, and many disorders have “classic” manifestations , many patients who have serious illness do not present with these classic symptoms and signs. For example, patients with myocardial ischemia may complain only of indigestion or have a very tender chest wall on palpation. A high index of suspicion is important when evaluating patients with chest pain. Nonetheless, some distinctions and generalizations are possible. Duration of pain can provide clues to the severity of the disorder. Long-standing pain (ie, for weeks or months) is not a manifestation of a disorder that is immediately life threatening. Such pain is often musculoskeletal in origin, although gastrointestinal origin or a cancer should be considered, particularly in patients who are older. Similarly, brief (< 5 seconds), sharp, intermittent pains rarely result from serious disorders. Serious disorders typically manifest pain lasting minutes to hours, although episodes may be recurrent (eg, unstable angina Unstable Angina Unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction. Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. Patient age is helpful in evaluating chest pain. Chest pain in children and young adults (< 30 years) is less likely to result from myocardial ischemia, although myocardial infarction can occur in people in their 20s. Musculoskeletal and pulmonary disorders are more common causes in these age groups. Exacerbation and relief of symptoms also are helpful in evaluating chest pain. Although angina can be felt anywhere between the ear and the umbilicus, it is typically consistently related to physical or emotional stress, ie, patients do not experience angina from climbing one flight of stairs one day and tolerate 3 flights the next day. Nocturnal angina is characteristic of acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. Pain from many disorders, both serious and minor, can be exacerbated by respiration, movement, or palpation of the chest. These findings are not specific for origin in the chest wall; about 15% of patients with acute myocardial infarction have chest tenderness on palpation. Nitroglycerin may relieve pain of both myocardial ischemia and noncardiac smooth muscle spasm (eg, esophageal or biliary disorders); its efficacy or lack thereof should not be used for diagnosis. Associated findings may also suggest a cause. Fever is nonspecific but, if accompanied by cough, suggests a pulmonary cause.Migraine is an episodic primary headache disorder. Symptoms typically last 4 to 72 hours and may be severe. The presence or absence of risk factors for CAD Risk Factors Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.CAD but does not help diagnose the cause of a given episode of acute chest pain. Patients with those factors may well have another cause of chest pain, and patients without them may have an acute coronary syndrome Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. However, known CAD in a patient with chest pain raises the likelihood of that diagnosis as the cause (particularly if the patient describes the symptoms as “like my angina” or “like my last heart attack”). A history of peripheral vascular disease Peripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia. Testing For adults with acute chest pain, immediate life threats must be ruled out. In patients with hemodynamic instability, a bedside echocardiogram can also be useful in further evaluating potential life-threatening causes. Echocardiography can be particularly useful in identifying left ventricular or right ventricular dysfunction, evidence of RV pressure overload, valvular pathology, pericardial effusions, and signs of pericardial tamponade. If symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Cardiac markers Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. Expeditious evaluation is essential because if myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome is present, the patient should be considered for urgent heart catheterization (when available). Immediate catheterization is indicated in patients with ST-elevation on ECG or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) causing hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, or persistent chest pain despite optimal medical management. Some abnormal findings on these tests confirm a diagnosis (eg, acute myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing partial or complete lung collapse. Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or result from trauma or medical procedures.Overview of Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection. Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings. Other abnormalities suggest a diagnosis or at least the need to pursue further investigation (eg, abnormal aortic contour on chest x-ray suggests need for testing for thoracic aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel). Thus, if these initial test results are normal, thoracic aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are highly unlikely. However, in acute coronary syndromes, ECG may not change for several hours or sometimes not at all, and in pulmonary embolism, oxygenation may be normal. Thus, other studies may need to be obtained based on findings from the history and physical examination . Because a single normal set of cardiac markers does not rule out a cardiac cause, patients whose symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome should have serial measurement of the cardiac marker troponin and ECGs. A diagnostic trial of sublingual nitroglycerin or an oral liquid antacid does not adequately differentiate myocardial ischemia from gastroesophageal reflux disease or gastritis. Either drug may relieve symptoms of either disorder. Troponin will be elevated in acute coronary syndromes except unstable angina, and often in other disorders that damage the myocardium (eg, myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium with necrosis of cardiac myocytes.Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial space.Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel). Creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated due to damage to any muscle tissue, but creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevation is specific to damage to the myocardium. However, troponin is the standard marker of cardiac muscle injury. Advances in high-sensitivity troponin assays allow for more rapid serial evaluation of a possible acute coronary syndrome. With improved negative predictive value, high sensitivity troponin also has the potential to decrease the necessity of further testing in patients with negative biomarkers and has been demonstrated to allow patients to be discharged more quickly (1 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint. Recent guidelines recommend using normal troponin levels and negative coronary CT scanning as a reliable strategy to exclude acute coronary syndrome in patients with chest pain and no red flags (2 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint. ST-segment abnormality on the ECG may be nonspecific or due to antecedent disorders, so comparison with previous ECGs is important. Some clinicians follow initial testing (acutely or within several days) with a stress ECG or a stress imaging test. If a pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered possible, D-dimer testing is done in low- and intermediate-risk patients. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism is affected by a number of clinical factors, which can be used to derive an approach to testing. Many of these factors are included in scoring systems that help determine the probability of PE such as the Wells Scoring System, the Revised Geneva Scoring System, and the Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC— 3–5 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint. In patients with chronic chest pain, immediate threats to life are unlikely. Most clinicians initially obtain a chest x-ray and do other tests based on symptoms and signs. Treatment of Chest Pain Specific identified disorders are treated. If etiology is not clearly benign, patients are usually admitted to the hospital or an observation unit for cardiac monitoring and more extensive evaluation. Pain Overview of Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical care. Pain has sensory and emotional components and is often classified as acute or chronic. Pain relief following opioid treatment should not diminish the urgency of ruling out serious and life-threatening disease. If pulmonary embolism is highly likely, antithrombin drugs should be given while the diagnosis is pursued; another embolus in a patient who is not receiving anticoagulants may be fatal. Geriatrics Essentials: Chest Pain The probability of serious and life-threatening disease increases with age. Many older patients recover more slowly than younger patients but survive for significant time if properly diagnosed and treated. Drug doses are usually lower, and rapidity of dose escalation is slower. Chronic disorders (eg, chronic kidney disease) are often present and may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Key Points Immediate life threats must be ruled out first. Some serious disorders, particularly coronary ischemia and pulmonary embolism, often do not have a classic presentation. Most patients should have pulse oximetry, ECG, cardiac marker measurement, and chest x-ray. Evaluation must be prompt so that patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or other criteria for intervention can be in the heart catheterization laboratory (or have thrombolysis) within the 90-minute standard. If PE is highly likely, antithrombin drugs should be given while the diagnosis is pursued; another embolus in a patient who is not receiving anticoagulants may be fatal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Because the body uses large amounts of phosphate during recovery from certain disorders, acute hypophosphatemia may occur in people recovering from the following conditions: Severe undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients. Burns cause varying degrees of pain, blisters, swelling, and skin loss. Chronic hypophosphatemia In chronic hypophosphatemia, the phosphate Overview of Phosphate's Role in the Body Phosphorus is an element that plays an important role in the body. Chronic hypophosphatemia usually develops because too much phosphate is excreted. Causes include the following: Hyperparathyroidism In hypercalcemia, the level of calcium in blood is too high... Some people who survived concentration camps died because their already low phosphate level suddenly fell when they began eating a normal diet, a phenomenon called refeeding syndrome. Symptoms of Hypophosphatemia Symptoms of hypophosphatemia occur only when the phosphate level in blood becomes very low. Muscle weakness develops, followed by stupor, coma, and death. In mild chronic hypophosphatemia, the bones can weaken, resulting in bone pain and fractures. People may become weak and lose their appetite. Diagnosis of Hypophosphatemia Measurement of phosphate levels in the blood Hypophosphatemia is diagnosed when blood tests show that the level of phosphate in the blood is low. Doctors do other tests to identify the cause if it is not readily apparent. Treatment of Hypophosphatemia Increase phosphate intake Drugs that reduce the phosphate level are stopped. If hypophosphatemia is mild and causes no symptoms, drinking low-fat or skim milk, which provides a large amount of phosphate, may help.

It lasts 6 months or more. Schizophrenia is probably caused by chemical abnormalities in the brain and by problems during the brain’s development. Adolescents withdraw, start having unusual emotions, and usually have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Doctors do tests to rule out other possible causes. Antipsychotic drugs can help control symptoms, and counseling can help adolescents and family members learn how to manage the disorder. Schizophrenia is quite rare in childhood, before adolescence. It typically begins anytime from mid-adolescence to a person's mid-30s, most often during a person's mid-20s Schizophrenia probably occurs because of chemical abnormalities in the brain and problems during the brain’s development, which occur during pregnancy and early childhood. Doctors do not know exactly what causes these abnormalities. However, experts agree that people can inherit a tendency to develop schizophrenia and that it is not caused by poor parenting or difficulties during childhood. Recent research also indicates that there is an increased risk of developing certain psychotic disorders (namely, bipolar disorder Bipolar Disorder In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania. This increased risk is not explained by genetic factors. There is concern that the recent legalization of marijuana may give adolescents (and their parents) a false sense of security about using this drug. Symptoms Like adults with schizophrenia, children and adolescents with schizophrenia are likely to have Hallucinations Delusions (false beliefs usually involving a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences) Paranoia, often fearing that others are planning to harm them or are controlling their thoughts In children, symptoms are likely to start more gradually and to become more severe than in adolescents or adults. Also, thinking is more likely to be impaired. Adolescents may withdraw, start having unusual emotions, and/or have hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Diagnosis Evaluation of symptoms over time Tests to rule out other disorders There is no specific diagnostic test for schizophrenia. Doctors base the diagnosis on a thorough evaluation of symptoms over time. Doctors also do tests to check for other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Such conditions include brain infections, injuries, tumors, autoimmune disorders, and use of certain drugs (such as corticosteroids and many illicit drugs).  Schizophrenia should not be blamed on poor parenting or difficulties during childhood. Children are particularly susceptible to the side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Social skills training, vocational rehabilitation, and psychologic and educational support for the child and counseling for family members are essential to help everyone cope with the disorder and its consequences.

Diagnosis is by clinical criteria. Treatment may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, antipsychotic drugs, and antidepressants.  People with antisocial personality disorder commit unlawful, deceitful, exploitative, reckless acts for personal profit or pleasure and without remorse; they may do the following: Justify or rationalize their behavior (eg, thinking losers deserve to lose, looking out for number one) Blame the victim for being foolish or helpless Be indifferent to the exploitative and harmful effects of their actions on others For antisocial personality disorder, estimated 12-month prevalence rates in the US (based on older Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] criteria) range from about 0.2 to 3.3%. Antisocial personality disorder is more common among men than among women (6:1), and there is a strong heritable component. Prevalence decreases with age, suggesting that patients can learn over time to change their maladaptive behavior. Comorbidities are common. Most patients also have a substance use disorder Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use. Patients with antisocial personality disorder often also have an impulse control disorder Overview of Learning Disorders Learning disorders are conditions that cause a discrepancy between potential and actual levels of academic performance as predicted by the person’s intellectual abilities.Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD, ADHD) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. A possible mechanism is impulsive aggression, related to abnormal serotonin transporter functioning. Disregard for the pain of others during early childhood has been linked to antisocial behavior during late adolescence. Antisocial personality disorder is more common among 1st-degree relatives of patients with the disorder than among the general population. Risk of developing this disorder is increased in both adopted and biologic children of parents with the disorder. If conduct disorder Conduct Disorder Conduct disorder is a recurrent or persistent pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or violates major age-appropriate societal norms or rules. Diagnosis is by history.Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD, ADHD) Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Risk of conduct disorder evolving into antisocial personality disorder may be increased when parents abuse or neglect the child or are inconsistent in discipline or in parenting style (eg, switching from warm and supportive to cold and critical). Symptoms and Signs of ASPD Patients with antisocial personality disorder may express their disregard for others and for the law by destroying property, harassing others, or stealing. They may deceive, exploit, con, or manipulate people to get what they want (eg, money, power, sex). They may use an alias. These patients are impulsive, not planning ahead and not considering the consequences for or the safety of self or others. As a result, they may suddenly change jobs, homes, or relationships. They may speed when driving and drive while intoxicated, sometimes leading to crashes. They may consume excessive amounts of alcohol or take illegal drugs that may have harmful effects. Patients with antisocial personality disorder are socially and financially irresponsible. They may change jobs with no plan for getting another. They may not seek employment when opportunities are available. They may not pay their bills, default on loans, or not pay child support. These patients are often easily provoked and physically aggressive; they may start fights or abuse their spouse or partner. In sexual relationships, they may be irresponsible and exploit their partner and be unable to remain monogamous. Remorse for actions is lacking. Patients with antisocial personality disorder may rationalize their actions by blaming those they hurt (eg, they deserved it) or the way life is (eg, unfair). They are determined not to be pushed around and to do what they think is best for themselves at any cost. These patients lack empathy for others and may be contemptuous of or indifferent to the feelings, rights, and suffering of others. Patients with antisocial personality disorder tend to have a high opinion of themselves and may be very opinionated, self-assured, or arrogant. They may be charming, voluble, and verbally facile in their efforts to get what they want. Diagnosis of ASPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, patients must have A persistent disregard for the rights of others This disregard is shown by the presence of ≥ 3 of the following: Disregarding the law, indicated by repeatedly committing acts that are grounds for arrest Being deceitful, indicated by lying repeatedly, using aliases, or conning others for personal gain or pleasure Acting impulsively or not planning ahead Being easily provoked or aggressive, indicated by constantly getting into physical fights or assaulting others Recklessly disregarding their safety or the safety of others Consistently acting irresponsibly, indicated by quitting a job with no plans for another one or not paying bills Not feeling remorse, indicated by indifference to or rationalization of hurting or mistreating others Also, patients must have evidence that a conduct disorder has been present before age 15 years. Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed only in people ≥ 18 years. Differential diagnosis Antisocial personality disorder should be distinguished from the following: Substance use disorder Overview of Substance Use Substance-related disorders involve substances that directly activate the brain's reward system.Determining whether impulsivity and irresponsibility result from substance use disorder or from antisocial personality disorder can be difficult but is possible based on a review of the patient's history, including early history, to check for periods of sobriety. Sometimes antisocial personality disorder can be diagnosed more easily after a coexisting substance use disorder is treated, but antisocial personality disorders can be diagnosed even when substance use disorder is present. Conduct disorder Conduct Disorder Conduct disorder is a recurrent or persistent pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or violates major age-appropriate societal norms or rules. Diagnosis is by history.Conduct disorder has a similar pervasive pattern of violating social norms and laws, but conduct disorder must be present before age 15. Narcissistic personality disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for adulation, and lack of empathy. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.Patients are similarly exploitative and lacking in empathy, but they tend not to be aggressive and deceitful as occurs in antisocial personality disorder.Patients are similarly manipulative but do so to be nurtured rather than to get what they want (eg, money, power) as occurs in antisocial personality disorder. Treatment of ASPD In some cases, cognitive-behavioral therapy and sometimes certain drugs There is no evidence that any particular treatment leads to long-term improvement. Thus, treatment aims to reach some other short-term goal, such as avoiding legal consequences, rather than changing the patient. Contingency management (ie, giving or withholding what patients want depending on their behavior) is indicated. Aggressive patients with prominent impulsivity and labile affect may benefit from treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy Psychotherapy or drugs (eg, lithium and valproate [see Drug Treatment of Bipolar Disorders Drug Treatment of Bipolar Disorders Choice of drug treatment for bipolar disorders can be difficult because all drugs have significant adverse effects, drug interactions are common, and no drug is universally effective.

Diagnosis is clinical after exclusion of other causes. Treatment of seizures lasting < 5 minutes is supportive. Seizures lasting ≥ 5 minutes are treated with IV lorazepam, rectal diazepam, or intranasal midazolam and, if persistent, IV fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, valproate, or levetiracetam. Maintenance drug therapy is usually not indicated.  Febrile seizures occur in about 2 to 5% of children 6 months to 5 years of age, and most occur between 12 months and 18 months of age. Febrile seizures may be simple or complex: Simple febrile seizures last < 15 minutes, have no focal features, and do not recur within a 24-hour period. Complex febrile seizures last ≥ 15 minutes continuously or with pauses, or have focal features, or recur within 24 hours. Most (> 90%) febrile seizures are simple. Febrile seizures occur during bacterial or viral infections. They sometimes occur after certain vaccinations such as measles, mumps, and rubella. Genetic and familial factors appear to increase susceptibility to febrile seizures. Monozygotic twins have a much higher concordance rate than dizygotic twins. Several genes associated with febrile seizures have been identified. Symptoms and Signs of Febrile Seizures Often, febrile seizures occur during the initial rapid rise in body temperature, and most develop within 24 hours of fever onset. Typically, seizures are generalized; most are clonic, but some manifest as periods of atonic or tonic posturing. A postictal period of a few minutes is common but may last as long as a few hours. If the postictal period is longer than an hour or if children have focal findings (eg, diminished movement on one side) during this period, it is important to immediately evaluate for an underlying acute central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Febrile status epilepticus is continuous or intermittent seizures that last ≥ 30 minutes without neurologic recovery between them. Diagnosis of Febrile Seizures Exclusion of other causes clinically or sometimes by testing  Seizures are diagnosed as febrile after exclusion of other causes. A fever may trigger seizures in children with previous afebrile seizures; such events are not termed febrile seizures because these children have already shown a tendency to have seizures. Routine testing is not required for simple febrile seizures other than to look for the source of the fever, but if children have complex febrile seizures, neurologic deficits, or signs of a serious underlying disorder (eg, meningitis Overview of Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. It may result from infections, other disorders, or reactions to drugs. Severity and acuity vary. Tests to exclude other disorders are determined clinically: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is done to rule out meningitis and encephalitis in younger infants, in those with meningeal signs or signs of CNS depression, or in those who have seizures after several days of febrile illness. CSF analysis must also be considered if children are not fully immunized or are taking antibiotics. Serum glucose, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus and liver and kidney function tests are done to rule out metabolic disorders especially if the history includes recent vomiting, diarrhea, or impaired fluid intake; if there are signs of dehydration or edema; or if a complex febrile seizure occurs. Brain MRI is done if neurologic examination detects focal abnormalities, if focal features occur during the seizure or postictal period, or if the postictal depression of sensorium is prolonged. Electroencephalography (EEG) is done if febrile seizures have focal features or are recurrent. A diagnostic evaluation based on the underlying disorder is done if children have an already identified developmental or neurologic disorder (usually, the term febrile seizure is not used in such cases). EEG typically does not identify specific abnormalities or help predict recurrent seizures, and it is not recommended after an initial simple febrile seizure in children with a normal neurologic examination. Prognosis for Febrile Seizures Recurrence and subsequent epilepsy Overall recurrence rate of febrile seizures is about 35%. Risk of recurrence is higher if children are < 1 year of age when the initial seizure occurs or have 1st-degree relatives who have had febrile seizures. Risk of developing an afebrile seizure disorder Seizure Disorders A seizure is an abnormal, unregulated electrical discharge that occurs within the brain’s cortical gray matter and transiently interrupts normal brain function. Most of the increased risk occurs in children who have additional risk factors (eg, complex febrile seizures, family history of seizures, developmental delay); in these children, risk is increased up to 10%. It is unclear whether having a febrile seizure can itself permanently lower the seizure threshold or whether some underlying factors predispose children to both febrile and nonfebrile seizures. Neurologic sequelae Simple febrile seizures themselves are not thought to cause neurologic abnormalities. However, in some children, a febrile seizure may be the first manifestation of an underlying seizure disorder or unrecognized neurologic disorder. The signs of the disorder may be identified retrospectively or may not appear until later. In either case, the febrile seizure is not thought to be causal. Febrile status epilepticus may be associated with damage to vulnerable parts of the brain such as the hippocampus. Treatment of Febrile Seizures Antipyretic therapy Supportive therapy if seizures last < 5 minutes Antiseizure drugs and sometimes intubation if seizures last ≥ 5 minutes All children require antipyretic therapy Treatment Normal body temperature varies from person to person and throughout the day. Normal body temperature is highest in children who are preschool aged. However, giving an antipyretic at the beginning of a febrile illness has not been shown to prevent a febrile seizure. Treatment of febrile seizures is supportive if seizures last < 5 minutes. Seizures lasting ≥ 5 minutes may require drugs to end them, with careful monitoring of circulatory and respiratory status. Intubation may be necessary if response is not immediate and the seizure persists or if antiseizure therapy leads to apnea. Drug therapy is usually IV, with a short-acting benzodiazepine (eg, lorazepam 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IV over 2 to 5 minutes repeated every 5 to 10 minutes for up to 3 doses). Fosphenytoin 15 to 20 mg PE (phenytoin equivalents)/kg IV may be given over 15 to 30 minutes if the seizure persists. In children up to 5 years of age, diazepam rectal gel 0.5 mg/kg may be given once and repeated in 4 to 12 hours if lorazepam cannot be given IV. Phenobarbital, valproate, or levetiracetam can also be used to treat a persistent seizure. Some clinicians prescribe rectal diazepam to be given by the parents at home for a prolonged febrile seizure.  Prevention Parents of a child who has had a febrile seizure should be advised to carefully monitor their child's temperature during illnesses and to give antipyretics if temperature is elevated (even though controlled studies have not shown that this treatment prevents febrile seizures from recurring). Maintenance antiseizure drug therapy to prevent recurrent febrile seizures or development of afebrile seizures is usually not indicated.Complex febrile seizures and neurologic deficits Strong family history of epilepsy and recurrent simple or complex febrile seizures Febrile status epilepticus Febrile seizures occurring at least once per quarter Prevention reference 1. Piña-Garza J, James K: Paroxysmal Disorders: Febrile seizures. In Fenichel's Clinical Pediatric Neurology: A Signs and Symptoms Approach, ed. 8. Philadelphia, Elsevier, 2019, p. 18. Key Points Febrile seizures are seizures that occur in neurologically normal children 6 months to 5 years of age with fever > 38° C that is not caused by a central nervous system infection and who have no previous afebrile seizures. Simple febrile seizures last < 15 minutes, have no focal features, and do not recur within a 24-hour period. Complex febrile seizures last > 15 minutes continuously or with pauses, or have focal features, or recur within 24 hours. Routine testing is not required, but if children have complex seizures, neurologic deficits, or signs of a serious underlying disorder (eg, meningitis, metabolic disorders), testing should be done. Seizures lasting ≥ 5 minutes require drug treatment (eg, lorazepam 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IV over 2 to 5 minutes repeated every 5 to 10 minutes for up to 3 doses). Risk of developing an afebrile seizure disorder after having a simple febrile seizure is about 2 to 5%. Giving an antipyretic at the beginning of a febrile illness has not been shown to prevent a febrile seizure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

What causes tetanus? The bacteria that cause tetanus live in dirt and animal droppings. They can get into your body when you have: A cut or puncture wound, especially one that is deep or has dirt in it A puncture from a dirty needle (such as a tattoo needle or a needle you use to inject street drugs) A skin injury such as a burn or frostbite In low and middle income countries, dirt can get into the umbilical cord stump and cause tetanus in newborns. What are the symptoms of tetanus? Symptoms start about 5 to 10 days after the injury, and sometimes as long as 50 days later. They include: Muscle spasms that are painful and make your muscles tight and rigid The muscle spasms usually start in your jaw. You can't open your jaw, which is why tetanus is sometimes called \"lockjaw.\" The muscle spasms may affect your throat and breathing, and later your neck, shoulders, face, arms, legs, back, and belly. People with tetanus sometimes have their faces frozen in a smile with eyebrows raised. They may also have an arched back and trouble urinating (peeing) or passing stool (poop). Other symptoms include: Fast heartbeat Fever and sweating How can doctors tell if I have tetanus? Doctors can tell if you have tetanus from your symptoms and by asking about any recent injuries you've had. They may take a sample of injured tissue to test for bacteria.

Everyone sometimes has disturbing or unusual thoughts or intense emotions. And many people behave in ways that other people sometimes think are strange. However, in people with mental illness, these thoughts, feelings, and behaviors come so often or are so intense that people have serious problems in daily life or are very upset. There are many different types of mental illness Mental illness can be short-lived or long-term Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between mental illness and normal worry or sadness, but mental illness is more severe, lasts longer, and significantly affects a person's ability to cope with life Almost half of adults experience symptoms of mental illness at some point— depression is feeling too sad or sluggish to do your daily tasks or take part in activities you usually enjoy.The main treatments are medicines and counseling (talk therapy) Family, friends, and support groups can help people cope with mental illness What are the types of mental illness? Mental illness is really many different disorders. These disorders fall into broad categories including: Anxiety Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Anxiety is being worried or nervous. Anxiety is often normal. For example, many people are anxious when they're having money problems, trouble at work, or family difficulties.Obsessive-compulsive disorders Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Obsessions are things you just can't stop thinking about, even if you want to. They could be worries, ideas, images, or urges to do something.Other mental health disorders include eating disorders, stress disorders such as PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder), and suicidal behavior. What causes mental illness? Mental illness is probably caused by many things in combination, including: Inherited factors—mental illness that runs in families Life stresses The environment and culture you live in Health problems that affect your brain Many stresses, such as losing a job, getting divorced, or taking too many drugs, increase the risk of mental illness. Certain health problems that affect a baby's brain, such as complications during birth or a brain infection by a virus (encephalitis), increase the risk of mental illness later on in life. Mental illness doesn't occur because people are lazy or irresponsible. It's not something people do on purpose. What are the symptoms of mental illness? Symptoms are different depending on what kind of problem you have. Symptoms may include: Major changes in personality or behavior, especially if they happen for no clear reason Confusion and cloudy thinking Odd, disorganized thoughts (such as jumping from topic to topic, or answering simple questions with long, confusing answers) Inappropriate behavior (such as undressing in public) Seeing or hearing things that aren't there (hallucinations) Believing things that aren't true (delusions) despite strong evidence to the contrary Extreme moods How can doctors tell if someone has mental illness? Doctors diagnose mental illness by talking to the person. Sometimes they'll also talk to caregivers or family members. Sometimes it's obvious that symptoms are caused by a mental illness. For example, people insisting that they're the president or that their thoughts are being controlled by a radio implanted in their brain. Other times it's hard to distinguish mental illness from normal reactions. For example, it can be hard to tell normal grief from depression after the death of a spouse or child, because both involve sadness and a depressed mood. Likewise, the line between being neat or orderly and having obsessive-compulsive disorder can be blurry.For most mental health disorders, a combination of medicine and talk therapy is more effective than either one by itself. In the past, people with mental illness were often placed in institutions or hospitals. Today, people are more likely to live productively in the community. But many people with mental illness still don't get the care and support they need.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis of CNS Tumors in Children MRI Biopsy MRI is the imaging test of choice because it provides more detailed images of parenchymal tumors and can detect tumors within the posterior fossa, subarachnoid spaces, and the arachnoid and pia mater. CT may be done but is less sensitive and less specific. Once imaging confirms the presence of a brain tumor, a biopsy is needed in a majority of cases to confirm the diagnosis and to determine tumor type and grade. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created a commonly used classification system (2021) that includes molecular and histologic information to further classify central nervous system tumors. Once a diagnosis is made and tumor histology is determined, staging and risk assessment are then determined. Staging (determination of whether the tumor has spread) includes an MRI of the entire spine, a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid cytology, and a postoperative MRI to assess for any residual tumor. Risk assessment is based on age, degree of residual tumor, molecular findings, and evidence of spread of disease.

In general, after initial surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both may be required. Entry into a clinical trial, if available, should be considered for all children with a CNS tumor. Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary team of pediatric oncologists, pediatric neuro-oncologists, pediatric neurosurgeons, neuropathologists, neuroradiologists, and radiation oncologists who have experience treating CNS tumors in children.

{"seq_id": "fb2e9049-e222-42f2-874f-06367598db47", "title": null, "text": "【0】Hyponatremia is decrease in serum sodium concentration < 136 mEq/L (< 136 mmol/L) caused by an excess of water relative to solute. Common causes include diuretic use, diarrhea, heart failure, liver disease, renal disease, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Clinical manifestations are primarily neurologic (due to an osmotic shift of water into brain cells causing edema), especially in acute hyponatremia, and include headache, confusion, and stupor; seizures and coma may occur. Diagnosis is by measuring serum sodium. Serum and urine electrolytes and osmolality and assessment of volume status help determine the cause. Treatment involves restricting water intake and promoting water loss, replacing any sodium deficit, and correcting the underlying disorder.  Etiology of Hyponatremia reflects an excess of total body water (TBW) relative to total body sodium content. Because total body sodium content is reflected by extracellular fluid (ECF) volume status, hyponatremia must be considered along with status of the ECF volume: hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia . Note that the ECF volume is not the same as effective plasma volume. For example, decreased effective plasma volume may occur with decreased ECF volume (as with diuretic use or hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death.ECF volume (eg, in heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. Sometimes, a low serum sodium measurement is caused by an excess of certain substances (eg, glucose, lipid) in the blood (translocational hyponatremia, pseudohyponatremia) rather than by a water-sodium imbalance. Table Hypovolemic hyponatremia  Deficiencies in both total body water and total body sodium exist, although proportionally more sodium than water has been lost; the sodium deficit causes hypovolemia. In hypovolemic hyponatremia, both serum osmolality and blood volume decrease. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) secretion increases despite a decrease in osmolality to maintain blood volume. The resulting water retention increases plasma dilution and hyponatremia. Extrarenal fluid losses, such as those that occur with the losses of sodium-containing fluids as in protracted vomiting, severe diarrhea, or sequestration of fluids in a 3rd space , can cause hyponatremia typically when losses are replaced by ingesting plain water or liquids low in sodium  or by hypotonic IV fluid. Significant ECF fluid losses also cause release of vasopressin, causing water retention by the kidneys, which can maintain or worsen hyponatremia. In extrarenal causes of hypovolemia, because the normal renal response to volume loss is sodium conservation, urine sodium concentration is typically < 10 mEq/L (< 10 mmol/L). Table Renal fluid losses resulting in hypovolemic hyponatremia may occur with mineralocorticoid deficiency Addison Disease Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. Salt-losing nephropathy encompasses a loosely defined group of intrinsic renal disorders with primarily renal tubular dysfunction. This group includes interstitial nephritis Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal function.Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure. Renal causes of hypovolemic hyponatremia can usually be differentiated from extrarenal causes by the history. Patients with ongoing renal fluid losses can also be distinguished from patients with extrarenal fluid losses because the urine sodium concentration is inappropriately high (> 20 mEq/L [> 20 mmol/L]). Urine sodium concentration may not help in differentiation when metabolic alkalosis Metabolic Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis is primary increase in bicarbonate (HCO3−) with or without compensatory increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be high or nearly normal. In metabolic alkalosis, urine chloride concentration frequently differentiates renal from extrarenal sources of volume depletion. Diuretics may also cause hypovolemic hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics, in particular, decrease the kidneys’ diluting capacity and increase sodium excretion. Once volume depletion occurs, the nonosmotic release of vasopressin causes water retention and worsens hyponatremia. Concomitant hypokalemia shifts sodium intracellularly and enhances vasopressin release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. This effect of thiazides may last for up to 2 weeks after cessation of therapy; however, hyponatremia usually responds to replacement of potassium and volume deficits along with judicious monitoring of water intake until the drug effect dissipates. Older patients may have increased sodium diuresis and are especially susceptible to thiazide-induced hyponatremia, particularly when they have a preexisting defect in renal capacity to excrete free water. Rarely, such patients develop severe, life-threatening hyponatremia within a few weeks after the initiation of a thiazide diuretic. Loop diuretics much less commonly cause hyponatremia. Euvolemic hyponatremia In euvolemic (dilutional) hyponatremia, total body sodium and thus ECF volume are normal or near-normal; however, TBW is increased. Primary polydipsia can cause hyponatremia only when water intake overwhelms the kidneys’ ability to excrete water. Because normal kidneys can excrete up to 25 L urine a day, hyponatremia due solely to polydipsia results only from the ingestion of large amounts of water or from defects in renal capacity to excrete free water. Patients affected include those with psychosis or more modest degrees of polydipsia plus renal insufficiency. Euvolemic hyponatremia may also result from excessive water intake in the presence of Addison disease Addison Disease Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex.Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. Postoperative hyponatremia most commonly occurs because of a combination of nonosmotic vasopressin release and excessive administration of hypotonic fluids after surgery. Certain drugs (eg, cyclophosphamide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpropamide) potentiate the renal effect of endogenous vasopressin, whereas others (eg, oxytocin) have a direct vasopressin-like effect on the kidneys. Intoxication with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is an amphetamine analog with stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. A deficiency in water excretion is common in all these conditions. Diuretics can cause or contribute to euvolemic hyponatremia if another factor causes water retention or excessive water intake.SIADH) is another cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. Hypervolemic hyponatremia Hypervolemic hyponatremia is characterized by an increase in both total body sodium (and thus ECF volume) and total body water with a relatively greater increase in TBW. Various edematous disorders, including heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture. Rarely, hyponatremia occurs in nephrotic syndrome Overview of Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is urinary excretion of > 3 g of protein/day due to a glomerular disorder plus edema and hypoalbuminemia. In each of these disorders, a decrease in effective circulating volume results in the release of vasopressin and angiotensin II. The following factors contribute to hyponatremia: The antidiuretic effect of vasopressin on the kidneys Direct impairment of renal water excretion by angiotensin II Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Stimulation of thirst by angiotensin II Urine sodium excretion is usually < 10 mEq/L (< 10 mmol/L), and urine osmolality is high relative to serum osmolality. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) The syndrome of inappropriate ADH (vasopressin) secretion is attributed to excessive vasopressin release. It is defined as less-than-maximally-dilute urine in the presence of plasma hypo-osmolality (hyponatremia) without volume depletion or overload, emotional stress, pain, diuretics, or other drugs that stimulate vasopressin secretion (eg, chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, vincristine, clofibrate, antipsychotic drugs, aspirin, ibuprofen) in patients with normal cardiac, hepatic, renal, adrenal, and thyroid function.Disorders Associated with SIADH Disorders Associated With Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion ). Among the many potential contributing factors are Administration of drugs that impair renal water excretion Administration of hypotonic fluids Impaired renal function Nonosmotic vasopressin release due to intravascular volume depletion In addition, adrenal insufficiency has become increasingly common among AIDS patients as the result of cytomegalovirus adrenalitis, mycobacterial infection, or interference with adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis by ketoconazole. SIADH may be present because of coexistent pulmonary or central nervous system infections. Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) Hyponatremia frequently occurs in patients with brain pathology, including concussion, intracranial hemorrhage, encephalitis, meningitis, and CNS tumors. It is most commonly due to SIADH or less commonly glucocorticoid deficiency. However, cerebral salt wasting has been recognized by some as a separate entity affecting a small group of these patients, especially those with subarachnoid hemorrhage Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Subarachnoid hemorrhage is sudden bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The most common cause of spontaneous bleeding is a ruptured aneurysm. Cerebral salt wasting is thought to be due to either decreased sympathetic nervous system function or secretion of a circulating factor that decreases renal sodium reabsorption. It is characterized by low serum sodium with low plasma osmolality and high urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/L [mmol/L] and frequently > 300). Urine sodium is usually > 40 mEq/L (> 40 mmol/L) and serum uric acid is low. The response to normal saline differentiates cerebral salt wasting from SIADH; cerebral salt wasting tends to resolve with isotonic saline, while SIADH does not, Symptoms and Signs of Hyponatremia Symptoms mainly involve central nervous system dysfunction. However, when hyponatremia is accompanied by disturbances in total body sodium content, signs of ECF volume depletion Volume Depletion Volume depletion, or extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction, occurs as a result of loss of total body sodium.Volume Overload Volume overload generally refers to expansion of the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. In general, older chronically ill patients with hyponatremia develop more symptoms than younger otherwise healthy patients. Symptoms are also more severe with faster-onset hyponatremia. Symptoms generally occur when the effective plasma osmolality falls to < 240 mOsm/kg (< 240 mmol/kg). Symptoms can be subtle and consist mainly of changes in mental status, including altered personality, lethargy, and confusion. As the serum sodium falls to < 115 mEq/L (< 115 mmol/L), stupor, neuromuscular hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, seizures, coma, and death can result. Severe cerebral edema may occur in premenopausal women with acute hyponatremia, perhaps because estrogen and progesterone inhibit brain Na+,K+-ATPase and decrease solute extrusion from brain cells. Sequelae include hypothalamic and posterior pituitary infarction and occasionally osmotic demyelination syndrome or brain stem herniation. Diagnosis of Hyponatremia Serum and urine electrolytes and osmolality Clinical assessment of volume status Evaluation of renal, adrenal, thyroid, hepatic, and cardiac function Hyponatremia is occasionally suspected in patients who have neurologic abnormalities and are at risk. However, because findings are nonspecific, hyponatremia is often recognized only after serum electrolyte measurement. Exclusion of translocational hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia Serum sodium may be low when severe hyperglycemia (or exogenously administered mannitol or glycerol) increases osmolality and water moves out of cells into the ECF. Serum sodium concentration falls about 1.6 mEq/L (1.6 mmol/L) for every 100-mg/dL (5.55-mmol/L) rise in the serum glucose concentration above normal. This condition is often called translocational hyponatremia because it is caused by translocation of water across cell membranes. Autoanalyzers in many clinical laboratories are affected by this artifact. Methods of measuring serum electrolytes with direct ion-selective electrodes circumvent this problem. Such direct ion-selective electrodes are available in some hospital laboratories by special request, but are also used by most point-of-care bedside analyzers. These analyzers can be used to exclude pseudohyponatremia. Formulas exist to estimate the effect these abnormalities have on sodium measurement. Calculators Used to Exclude Translocational Hyponatremia and Pseudohyponatremia Clinical Calculator Clinical Calculator Clinical Calculator Identification of the cause Identifying the cause of hyponatremia can be complex. The history sometimes suggests a cause (eg, significant fluid loss due to vomiting or diarrhea, renal disease, compulsive fluid ingestion, intake of drugs that stimulate vasopressin release or enhance vasopressin action). The volume status, particularly the presence of obvious volume depletion or volume overload, suggests certain causes . Overtly hypovolemic patients usually have an obvious source of fluid loss and typically have been treated with hypotonic fluid replacement. Overtly hypervolemic patients usually have a readily recognizable condition, such as heart failure or hepatic or renal disease. Euvolemic patients and patients with equivocal volume status require more laboratory testing to identify a cause. Laboratory tests should include serum and urine osmolality and electrolytes. Euvolemic patients should also have thyroid and adrenal function tested. Hypo-osmolality in euvolemic patients should cause excretion of a large volume of dilute urine (eg, osmolality < 100 mOsm/kg [< 100 mmol/kg]) and specific gravity < 1.003). Serum sodium concentration and serum osmolality that are low and urine osmolality that is inappropriately high (120 to 150 mmol/L [120 to 150 mOsm/kg]) with respect to the low serum osmolality suggests volume overload, volume contraction, SIADH, or cerebral salt wasting. Volume overload Volume Overload Volume overload generally refers to expansion of the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume.Volume Depletion Volume depletion, or extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction, occurs as a result of loss of total body sodium. When neither volume overload or volume contraction appears likely, SIADH is considered. Patients with SIADH are usually euvolemic or slightly hypervolemic. BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine values are normal, and serum uric acid is generally low. Urine sodium concentration is usually > 30 mEq/L (30 mmol/L), and fractional excretion of sodium is > 1% (for calculation, see Evaluation of the Renal Patient Other urine tests In patients with renal disorders, symptoms and signs may be nonspecific, absent until the disorder is severe, or both. In patients with hypovolemia and normal renal function, sodium reabsorption results in a urine sodium of < 20 mEq/L (< 20 mmol/L). Urine sodium > 20 mEq/L (> 20 mmol/L) in hypovolemic patients suggests mineralocorticoid deficiency or salt-losing nephropathy. Hyperkalemia suggests adrenal insufficiency. In patients with hyponatremia and a urine sodium of > 40 mEq/L (> 40 mmol/L) who have recent traumatic brain injury or CNS surgery , cerebral salt wasting should be considered. Treatment of Hyponatremia When hypovolemic, 0.9% saline When hypervolemic, fluid restriction, sometimes a diuretic, occasionally a vasopressin antagonist When euvolemic, treatment of cause In severe, rapid onset or highly symptomatic hyponatremia, partial rapid correction with hypertonic (3%) saline Hyponatremia can be life threatening and requires prompt recognition and proper treatment. Too-rapid correction of hyponatremia risks neurologic complications, such as osmotic demyelination syndrome Osmotic demyelination syndrome Hyponatremia is decrease in serum sodium concentration < 136 mEq/L (< 136 mmol/L) caused by an excess of water relative to solute. Even with severe hyponatremia, serum sodium concentration should not be increased by more than 8 mEq/L (8 mmol/L) over the first 24 hours. And, except during the first few hours of treatment of severe hyponatremia, sodium should be corrected no faster than 0.5 mEq/L/hour (0.5 mmol/L/hour). The degree of hyponatremia, the duration and rate of onset , and the patient's symptoms are used to determine which treatment is most appropriate. In patients with hypovolemia and normal adrenal function, administration of 0.9% saline usually corrects both hyponatremia and hypovolemia. When the serum sodium is < 120 mEq/L (< 120 mmol/L), hyponatremia may not completely correct upon restoration of intravascular volume; restriction of free water ingestion to 500 to 1000 mL/24 hours may be needed. In hypervolemic patients, in whom hyponatremia is due to renal sodium retention (eg, heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.Overview of Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is urinary excretion of > 3 g of protein/day due to a glomerular disorder plus edema and hypoalbuminemia. In patients with heart failure, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in conjunction with a loop diuretic, can correct refractory hyponatremia. In other patients in whom simple fluid restriction is ineffective, a loop diuretic in escalating doses can be used, sometimes in conjunction with IV 0.9% normal saline. Potassium and other electrolytes lost in the urine must be replaced. When hyponatremia is more severe and unresponsive to diuretics, intermittent or continuous hemofiltration Continuous Hemofiltration and Hemodialysis Continuous hemofiltration and hemodialysis procedures filter and dialyze blood without interruption. ECF volume while hyponatremia is corrected with IV 0.9% normal saline. Severe or resistant hyponatremia generally occurs only when heart or liver disease is near end-stage. In euvolemia, treatment is directed at the cause (eg, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, diuretic use). When SIADH is present, severe water restriction (eg, 250 to 500 mL/24 hours) is generally required. Additionally, a loop diuretic may be combined with IV 0.9% saline as in hypervolemic hyponatremia. Lasting correction depends on successful treatment of the underlying disorder. When the underlying disorder is not correctable, as in metastatic cancer, and patients find severe water restriction unacceptable, demeclocycline 300 to 600 mg orally every 12 hours may be helpful by inducing a concentrating defect in the kidneys. IV conivaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist, causes effective water diuresis without significant loss of electrolytes in the urine and can be used in hospitalized patients for treatment of resistant hyponatremia. Oral tolvaptan is another vasopressin receptor antagonist with similar action to conivaptan. Tolvaptan use is limited to less than 30 days due to the potential for liver toxicity and should not be used in patients with liver or kidney disease. Mild to moderate hyponatremia Mild to moderate, asymptomatic hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium ≥ 121 and < 135 mEq/L [≥ 121 and < 135 mmol/L]) requires restraint because small adjustments are generally sufficient. In diuretic-induced hyponatremia, elimination of the diuretic may be enough; some patients need some sodium or potassium replacement. Similarly, when mild hyponatremia results from inappropriate hypotonic parenteral fluid administration in patients with impaired water excretion, merely altering fluid therapy may suffice. Severe hyponatremia In asymptomatic patients, severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 121 mEq/L [< 121 mmol/L]; effective osmolality < 240 mOsm/kg [< 240 mmol/kg] ) can be treated safely with stringent restriction of water intake. In patients with neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma), treatment is more controversial. The debate primarily concerns the rate and degree of hyponatremia correction. Many experts recommend that, in general, serum sodium be raised no faster than 1 mEq/L/hour (1 mmol/L/hour). However, replacement rates of up to 2 mEq/L/hour (2 mmol/L/hour) for the first 2 to 3 hours have been suggested for patients with seizures or significantly altered sensorium. Regardless, the rise should be ≤ 8 mEq/L (≤ 8 mmol/L) over the first 24 hours. More vigorous correction risks precipitating osmotic demyelination syndrome Osmotic demyelination syndrome Hyponatremia is decrease in serum sodium concentration < 136 mEq/L (< 136 mmol/L) caused by an excess of water relative to solute. Rapid-onset hyponatremia Acute hyponatremia with known rapid onset (ie, within < 24 hours) is a special case. Such rapid onset can occur with Acute psychogenic polydipsia Use of the recreational drug ecstasy (MDMA) Postoperative patients who received hypotonic fluid during surgery Marathon runners who replace sweat loss with hypotonic fluids Rapid-onset hyponatremia is problematic because the cells of the central nervous system have not had time to remove some of the intracellular osmolar compounds used to balance intracellular and extracellular osmolality. Thus, the intracellular environment becomes relatively hypertonic compared to the serum, causing intracellular fluid shifts that can rapidly cause cerebral edema, potentially progressing to brain stem herniation and death. In these patients, rapid correction with hypertonic saline is indicated even when neurologic symptoms are mild (eg, forgetfulness). If more severe neurologic symptoms, including seizures, are present, rapid correction of sodium by 4 to 6 mEq/L (4 to 6 mmol/L) using hypertonic saline is indicated. The patient should be monitored in an intensive care unit and serum sodium levels monitored every 2 hours. After sodium level has increased by the initial target of 4 to 6 mEq/L, the rate of correction is slowed so that serum sodium level does not rise by > 8 mEq/L (> 8 mmol/L) in the first 24 hours. Hypertonic saline solution Hypertonic (3%) saline (containing 513 mEq sodium/L [513 mmol/L]) use requires frequent (every 2 hours) electrolyte determinations. In some situations, hypertonic saline may be used with a loop diuretic. Equations are available to help predict the sodium response to a given amount of hypertonic saline, but these formulas are only rough guidelines and do not decrease the need to monitor electrolyte levels frequently. For instance, in hypovolemic hyponatremia the sodium level can normalize too quickly as volume is replaced and thus removes the hypovolemic stimulus for vasopressin secretion, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of water. Another recommendation includes administration of desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours concurrently with hypertonic saline. The desmopressin prevents an unpredictable water diuresis that can follow the abrupt normalization of endogenous vasopressin that can occur as the underlying disorder causing hyponatremia is corrected. After the sodium has been corrected at the appropriate rate for 24 hours, desmopressin is stopped. Hypertonic saline can then be stopped, or, if required for continuing correction of hyponatremia, continued.. For patients with rapid-onset hyponatremia and neurologic symptoms, rapid correction is accomplished by giving 100 mL of hypertonic saline IV over 15 minutes. This dose can be repeated once if neurologic symptoms are still present. For patients with seizures or coma but slower onset hyponatremia, ≤ 100 mL/hour of hypertonic saline may be administered over 4 to 6 hours in amounts sufficient to raise the serum sodium 4 to 6 mEq/L (4 to 6 mmol/L). This amount (in mEq OR mmol) may be calculated using the sodium deficit formula as where TBW is 0.6 × body weight in kg in men and 0.5 × body weight in kg in women. For example, the amount of sodium needed to raise the sodium level from 106 to 112 mEq/L in a 70-kg man can be calculated as follows: Because there is 513 mEq (mmol) sodium/L in hypertonic saline, roughly 0.5 L of hypertonic saline is needed to raise the sodium level from 106 to 112 mEq/L (mmol/L). To result in a correction rate of 1 mEq/L/hour, this 0.5 L volume would be infused over about 6 hours. Adjustments may be needed based on serum sodium concentrations, which are monitored closely during the first few hours of treatment.IV every 5 to 10 minutes as needed) for seizures. Patients meeting the criteria for cerebral salt wasting should not be fluid restricted because fluid restriction can cause brain vessel vasospasm. Although isotonic saline should correct the cause of hyponatremia, use of hypertonic saline is recommended to prevent more severe hyponatremia if indeed SIADH is present. Selective vasopressin receptor antagonists The selective vasopressin (V2) receptor antagonists conivaptan (IV) and tolvaptan (oral) are treatment options for severe or resistant hyponatremia. These drugs are potentially dangerous because they may correct serum sodium concentration too rapidly; they are typically reserved for severe (< 121 mEq/L [< 121 mmol/L]) and/or symptomatic hyponatremia that is resistant to correction with fluid restriction. The same pace of correction as for fluid restriction, ≤ 8 mEq/L over 24 hours, is used. These drugs should not be used for hypovolemic hyponatremia or in patients with liver disease or advanced chronic kidney disease. Conivaptan is indicated for treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia. It requires close monitoring of patient status, fluid balance, and serum electrolytes and so its use is restricted to hospitalized patients. A loading dose is given followed by a continuous infusion over a maximum of 4 days. It is not recommended in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/minute) and should not be used if anuria is present. Caution is advised in moderate to severe cirrhosis. Tolvaptan is a once daily tablet indicated for hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia. Close monitoring is recommended especially during initiation and dosage changes. Tolvaptan use is limited to 30 days because of the risk of liver toxicity. Tolvaptan is not recommended for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or liver disease. Its effectiveness can be limited by increased thirst. Tolvaptan use is also limited by high cost. Both of these drugs are strong inhibitors of CYP3A (cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A) and as such have multiple drug interactions. Other strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, retroviral protease inhibitors) should be avoided. Clinicians should review the other drugs the patient is taking for potentially dangerous interactions with V2 receptor antagonists before initiating a treatment trial. Chronic hyponatremia Patients with SIADH need chronic treatment for hyponatremia. Fluid restriction alone is frequently not enough to prevent recurrence of hyponatremia. Oral salt (NaCl) tablets can be used with dosage adjusted to treat mild to moderate chronic hyponatremia in these patients. Oral urea is a very effective treatment for hyponatremia, but it is tolerated poorly by patients due to its taste. A newer oral formulation of urea has been developed to enhance palatability. Osmotic demyelination syndrome Osmotic demyelination syndrome (previously called central pontine myelinolysis) may follow too-rapid correction of hyponatremia. Demyelination classically affects the pons, but other areas of the brain can also be affected. Lesions are more common among patients with alcohol use disorder Alcohol Use Disorder and Rehabilitation Alcohol use disorder involves a pattern of alcohol use that typically includes craving and manifestations of tolerance and/or withdrawal along with adverse psychosocial consequences.Overview of Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition. Flaccid paralysis, dysarthria, and dysphagia can evolve over a few days or weeks after a hyponatremic episode. The classic pontine lesion may extend dorsally to involve sensory tracts and leave patients with a \"locked-in\" syndrome (an awake and sentient state in which patients, because of generalized motor paralysis, cannot communicate, except by vertical eye movements controlled above the pons). Damage often is permanent. When sodium is replaced too rapidly (eg, > 14 mEq/L/8 hour [> 14 mmol/L/8 hours]) and neurologic symptoms start to develop, it is critical to prevent further serum sodium increases by stopping hypertonic fluids. In such cases, inducing hyponatremia with hypotonic fluid may mitigate the development of permanent neurologic damage. Key Points Hyponatremia may occur with normal, increased, or decreased extracellular fluid volume. Common causes include diuretic use, diarrhea, heart failure, liver disease, and renal disease. Hyponatremia is potentially life threatening. The degree, duration, and symptoms of hyponatremia are used to determine how quickly to correct the serum sodium. Treatment varies depending on fluid volume status, but in all cases serum sodium level should be corrected slowly—by ≤ 8 mEq/L (≤ 8 mmol/L) over 24 hours, although fairly rapid correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L using hypertonic saline over the first several hours is frequently needed to reverse severe neurologic symptoms.

Patients with atypical moles have an increased risk of melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. Management is by close clinical monitoring and biopsy of highly atypical or changed lesions. Patients should reduce sun exposure and conduct regular self-examinations for new moles or changes in existing ones. Atypical moles are nevi with a slightly different clinical and histologic appearance (disordered architecture and atypia of melanocytes). Some patients have only one or a few atypical moles; others have many. Although most melanomas arise de novo, some develop from atypical moles. Risk factors for melanoma include increased number of atypical moles and increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation and sun. Manifestations of Atypical Moles Atypical Nevus This image shows an atypical nevus, with the characteristic irregular border and variable coloration. Image courtesy of Marie Schreiner, PA-C. Multiple Atypical Nevi This image shows atypical nevi, with characteristic irregular borders and variable coloration. Atypical Mole This photo shows a rounded mole with irregular borders. DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY The propensity to develop atypical moles may be inherited (autosomal dominant) or sporadic without apparent familial association. Familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome refers to the presence of multiple atypical moles and melanoma in ≥ 2 first-degree relatives. These patients are at markedly increased risk (25 times) of melanoma. Symptoms and Signs of Atypical Moles Atypical moles are often larger than other nevi (> 6 mm diameter) and primarily round (unlike many melanomas) but with indistinct borders and mild asymmetry. In contrast, melanomas have greater irregularity of color and may have areas that are red, blue, whitish, or depigmented with a scarred appearance. Diagnosis of Atypical Moles Clinical evaluation Dermatoscopic evaluation Biopsy Regular physical examinations Atypical moles must be differentiated from melanoma. Features that suggest melanoma, known as the ABCDEs of melanoma, are A: Asymmetry—asymmetric appearance B: Borders—irregular borders (ie, not round or oval) C: Color—color variation within the mole, unusual colors, or a color significantly different or darker than the patient's other moles D: Diameter—> 6 mm E: Evolution—a new mole in a patient > 30 years of age or a changing mole Although clinical findings can sometimes establish a diagnosis of atypical moles , visual differentiation between atypical nevi and melanoma can be difficult; biopsy of the worst-appearing lesions should be done to establish the diagnosis and to determine the degree of atypia. Biopsy should aim to include the complete depth and breadth of the lesion; excisional biopsy is often ideal. Table Patients with multiple atypical moles and a personal or family history of melanoma should be examined regularly (eg, yearly for family history of melanoma, more often for personal history of melanoma). Some dermatologists observe pigment patterns of melanocytic lesions using a hand-held instrument known as a dermatoscope. Dermoscopy allows a dermatologist to see structures not visible to the naked eye. Dermoscopy can reveal certain high-risk characteristics suggestive of melanoma (eg, blue-white veil, irregular dots and globules, atypical pigment network, reverse network). Treatment of Atypical Moles Removal by excision or shave excision when desired Complete excision of highly atypical lesions Prophylactic removal of all atypical moles is not effective in preventing melanoma and is not recommended. However, atypical moles may warrant removal for any of the following conditions: A patient has a high-risk history (eg, personal or family history of melanoma). A patient cannot guarantee close follow-up. The mole has high-risk dermatoscopic findings. The mole is in a location that makes monitoring the lesion for changes difficult or impossible for the patient. Prevention of Atypical Moles Sun protection (ie, sun-protective clothing, sunscreen, sun avoidance during peak times, seeking shade) Regular self-examination Full-body photography Sometimes surveillance of family members Patients with atypical moles should avoid excessive sun exposure and use sun protection Prevention The skin may respond to sunlight with chronic (eg, dermatoheliosis [photoaging], actinic keratosis) or acute (eg, photosensitivity, sunburn) changes. Patients who are vigilant about sun protection should be counseled to take sufficient supplemental vitamin D. Also, they should be taught self-examination to detect changes in existing moles and to recognize features of melanomas. Full-body photography may help detect new nevi and monitor existing nevi for changes. Regular follow-up examinations are recommended. If patients have a history of melanoma (whether developing from atypical moles or de novo) or other skin cancers, 1st-degree relatives should be examined. Patients who are from melanoma-prone families (ie, ≥ 2 first-degree relatives with cutaneous melanomas) have a high lifetime risk of developing melanomas. The entire skin (including the scalp and genitals) of members of an at-risk family should be examined at least once to determine risk and needed follow-up. Key Points Risk of melanoma is higher if patients have increased numbers of atypical moles, increased sun exposure, or familial atypical mole–melanoma syndrome. Because clinical differentiation from melanoma can be difficult, biopsy the most suspect atypical moles. Closely follow patients with atypical moles, particularly those at higher risk of melanoma, and do full-body photography. Recommend sun protection (with supplemental vitamin D) and regular self-examination for high-risk patients. Do full-body examinations of all 1st-degree relatives of patients who have melanoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms depend on the site of infection and include dysphagia, skin and mucosal lesions, blindness, vaginal symptoms (itching, burning, discharge), fever, shock, oliguria, renal shutdown, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology and cultures from normally sterile sites. Treatment is with amphotericin B, fluconazole, echinocandins, voriconazole, or posaconazole. Candidiasis (Mucocutaneous) Candidiasis is skin and mucous membrane infection with Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans.Candidal Vaginitis Candidal Vaginitis Candidal vaginitis is vaginal infection with Candida species, usually C. albicans.  Most fungal vaginitis is caused by CChronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is persistent or recurrent candidal infection due to inherited T-cell defects. Autoimmune and endocrine disorders may develop in its recessive form Candida species are commensal organisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and sometimes the skin . Unlike other systemic mycoses, candidiasis results from endogenous organisms. Most infections are caused by C. albicans; however, C. glabrata (formerly Torulopsis glabrata) and other non-albicans species are increasingly involved in fungemia, urinary tract infections, and, occasionally, other focal disease. C. glabrata is frequently less susceptible to fluconazole than other species; C. krusei is inherently resistant to fluconazole; frequency of resistance to voriconazole and amphotericin varies. krusei is most frequently susceptible to echinocandins. auris is an emerging, multidrug-resistant species that has caused recent outbreaks in hospitals and is challenging to identify and treat. Candida species account for about 80% of major systemic fungal infections and are the most common cause of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Candidal infections are one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. Because resistance and transmission of C. auris in health care facilities have become a concern, special infection control precautions have been instituted for patients who are colonized or infected with C. auris. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is frequently present in HIV-infected patients, hematogenous dissemination is unusual unless other specific risk factors are present  albicans), manifested by mucocutaneous lesions, fungemia, and sometimes focal infection of multiple sites.

Candidemia may occur in nonneutropenic patients during prolonged hospitalization. This bloodstream infection is often related to one or more of the following: Central venous catheters Major surgery Broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy IV hyperalimentation IV lines and the GI tract are the usual portals of entry. Candidemia often prolongs hospitalization and increases mortality due to concurrent disorders. Candidemia may occur with other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as endocarditis or meningitis, as well as focal involvement of skin, subcutaneous tissues, bones, joints, liver, spleen, kidneys, eyes, and other tissues. Endocarditis is commonly related to IV drug abuse, valve replacement, or intravascular trauma induced by indwelling IV catheters. All forms of disseminated candidiasis should be considered serious, progressive, and potentially fatal. Symptoms and Signs of Invasive Candidiasis Esophageal candidiasis is most often manifested by dysphagia. Candidemia usually causes fever, but no symptoms are specific. Some patients develop a syndrome resembling bacterial sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection.Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) involves abnormal, excessive generation of thrombin and fibrin in the circulating blood. Candidal endophthalmitis starts as white retinal lesions that are initially asymptomatic but can progress, opacifying the vitreous and causing potentially irreversible scarring and blindness. In neutropenic patients, retinal hemorrhages occasionally also occur, but actual infection of the eye is rare. Papulonodular skin lesions may also develop, especially in neutropenic patients, in whom they indicate widespread hematogenous dissemination to other organs. Symptoms of other focal or invasive infection depend on the organ involved. Diagnosis of Invasive Candidiasis Histopathology and fungal cultures Blood cultures Serum beta-glucan testing T2Candida® Panel Because Candida species are commensal, their culture from sputum, the mouth, the vagina, urine, stool, or skin does not necessarily signify an invasive, progressive infection. A characteristic clinical lesion must also be present, histopathologic evidence of tissue invasion (eg, yeasts, pseudohyphae, or hyphae in tissue specimens) must be documented, and other etiologies must be excluded. Positive cultures of specimens taken from normally sterile sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pericardium, pericardial fluid, or biopsied tissue, provide definitive evidence that systemic therapy is needed. Serum beta-glucan is often positive in patients with invasive candidiasis; conversely, a negative result indicates low likelihood of systemic infection. The T2Candida® Panel is a magnetic resonance assay that directly detects 5 Candida species (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata) in whole blood samples in 3 to 5 hours. It is highly sensitive and has an excellent negative predictive value (1 Diagnosis reference Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C.

Identification is important in determining management (eg, drug treatment, isolation measures)PCR)-based assays. Ophthalmologic examination to check for endophthalmitis is recommended for all patients with candidemia. Standard laboratory techniques often misidentify C. auris as C. haemulonii, C. famata, C. sake, or another species. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a more reliable method for correct identification. A nucleic acid-based test also is now available.

Invasive candidiasis In patients with invasive candidiasis, predisposing conditions (eg, neutropenia, immunosuppression, use of broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics, hyperalimentation, presence of indwelling lines) should be reversed or controlled if possible. In nonneutropenic patients, IV catheters should be removed. When an echinocandin is indicated (if patients are moderately severely ill or critically ill [most neutropenic patients] or if C. krusei is suspected), one of the following drugs can be used: Caspofungin, loading dose 70 mg IV, then 50 mg IV once a day Micafungin 100 mg IV once a day Anidulafungin, loading dose 200 mg IV, then 100 mg IV once a day If fluconazole is indicated (if patients are clinically stable or if C. albicans or C. parapsilosis is suspected), loading dose is 800 mg (12 mg/kg) orally or IV once, followed by 400 mg (6 mg/kg) once a day. If there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal drugs, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B at a dosage of 3 to 5 mg/kg IV once a day can be used (1 Treatment reference Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C. Treatment of invasive candidiasis is continued for 14 days after the last negative blood culture. Esophageal candidiasis Esophageal candidiasis is treated with one of the following: Fluconazole 200 to 400 mg orally or IV once a day Itraconazole 200 mg orally once a day If these drugs are ineffective or if infection is severe, one of the following may be used: Voriconazole 4 mg/kg orally or IV 2 times a day Posaconazole 400 mg orally 2 times a day Isavuconazole 400 mg on day 1, then 100 mg once a day or 200 mg on day 1, then 50 mg once a day or 400 mg once a week An echinocandin Treatment of esophageal candidiasis is continued for 14 to 21 days. Key Points Unlike other fungal infections, invasive candidiasis is usually due to endogenous organisms. Invasive infection typically occurs in immunocompromised and/or hospitalized patients, particularly those who have had surgery or been given broad-spectrum antibiotics. Positive cultures of specimens taken from normally sterile sites (eg, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue biopsy specimens) are needed to distinguish invasive infection from normal colonization; serum beta-glucan is often positive in patients with invasive candidiasis.

Men usually have no symptoms, but a few have a frothy discharge from the penis and mild pain or discomfort during urination. Examination of a sample of the discharge under a microscope usually enables doctors to identify trichomoniasis. Infected people and their sex partners are treated with antibiotics. Using condoms during genital sex can help prevent passing trichomoniasis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from one person to another. Trichomonas vaginalis commonly causes an STI of the vagina in women and an STI of the urinary tract in men and women. Women are much more likely to develop symptoms. About 20% of women develop trichomoniasis of the vagina (trichomonas vaginitis Trichomonas Vaginitis Trichomonas vaginitis is a vaginal infection due to the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomonas vaginitis is usually sexually transmitted. Symptoms of Trichomoniasis In women, the infection usually starts with a greenish yellow, frothy, fishy-smelling discharge from the vagina. In some women, the discharge is slight. The genital area may be irritated and sore, and sexual intercourse may be painful. In severe cases, the genital area and surrounding skin may be inflamed, and the tissues around the vagina's opening (labia) may be swollen. Urination may be painful or frequent, as occurs in a bladder infection. Urinary and vaginal symptoms may occur alone or together. Most men with trichomoniasis of the urethra (the tube carries urine from the bladder out of the body) have no or only mild symptoms, but they can still infect their sex partners. Some men have a frothy discharge from the penis, pain during urination, and an urge to urinate frequently.  Most men with trichomoniasis have no symptoms, but they can still infect their sex partners. Diagnosis of Trichomoniasis Examination and sometimes culture of a sample of the discharge or urine Doctors suspect trichomoniasis in the following people: Women with vaginal infections Overview of Vaginal Infections In the United States, vaginal infections are one of the most common reasons women see their doctor, accounting for millions of visits each year. In women, the diagnosis can usually be made quickly by examining a sample of the vaginal discharge with a microscope and identifying the organism. If results are unclear, the sample is cultured for several days. In men, a sample of the discharge from the end of the penis (obtained in the morning, before urination) may be examined under a microscope and sent to the laboratory for culture. Alternatively, doctors sometimes do tests to identify the organism’s unique genetic material (DNA or RNA) using techniques that increase the amount of the bacteria's genetic material. These tests are called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATS). These techniques make the organisms easier to detect. Occasionally, microscopic examination of the urine detects Trichomonas, but identification is more likely if a urine culture is done. Treatment of Trichomoniasis The antibiotic metronidazole or tinidazole Simultaneous treatment of sex partners Women are usually treated with a seven-day course of antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Men may be treated with a single dose. Their sex partners must be treated simultaneously or women may be reinfected. Sometimes, if a woman's partner is unlikely to return for follow-up, the woman is given medications or a prescription to deliver to her sex partner (called expedited partner therapy Sex partners ). Metronidazole may cause a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, or a decrease in the number of white blood cells. Women who take the medication may be more susceptible to vaginal yeast infections Vaginal Yeast Infection (Candidiasis) The vagina is infected by a yeast called Candida, usually Candida albicans, resulting in a yeast infection called candidiasis. Infected people should abstain from sexual intercourse until the infection is cured, or they can infect their partners.

The effectiveness of cranberries in preventing UTIs has not been confirmed. Natural unprocessed cranberry juice contains anthocyanidins (eg, proanthocyanidin), which prevent Escherichia coli from attaching to the urinary tract wall. Some people take cranberry juice to reduce fever and treat certain cancers; however, there is no scientific proof that it is effective for these uses. Evidence The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that it authorized (allowed) qualified health claims for a reduced risk of recurrent UTIs in healthy women . In 1966, the first clinical trial, uncontrolled, evaluating the positive effects of cranberry juice in preventing UTIs was published (1 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices. Since that time numerous trials have been performed evaluating different populations, severity of medical conditions, dosages, time, and form of supplement in juice or extract capsule/tablet. The majority of evidence suggests that cranberry juice or extract can have a small, yet significant effect on preventing the recurrence of UTIs over 12 months, but that supplementation cannot treat UTIs (2 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices. However, a 2012 Cochrane review of 24 studies (4473 participants) placed some doubt on the effectiveness of the supplement, indicating a small trend toward fewer UTIs with supplementation, but that the finding was not statistically significant (3 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.

Standardization of cranberry products and specifying proanthocyanidin (PAC) content may help to clarify results and resolve the discrepancy. Physiologic differences in the urinary tract and proper hygiene of female individuals studied also could contribute to the variability in response.

A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. Severe focal disease, including retinitis, can develop in HIV-infected patients and in organ transplant recipients and other immunocompromised patients. Severe systemic disease can develop in neonates and immunocompromised patients. Laboratory diagnosis, helpful for severe disease, may involve culture, serologic testing, biopsy, or antigen or nucleic acid detection. Ganciclovir and other antiviral drugs are used to treat severe disease, particularly retinitis. Congenital and Perinatal Cytomegalovirus Infection Congenital and Perinatal Cytomegalovirus Infection (CMV) Cytomegalovirus infection may be acquired prenatally or perinatally and is the most common congenital viral infection CMV (human herpesvirus type 5) is transmitted through blood, body fluids, or transplanted organs. Infection may be acquired transplacentally or during birth. Prevalence increases with age; 60 to 90% of adults have CMV infection (resulting in lifelong latent infection). Lower socioeconomic groups tend to have a higher prevalence. Congenital CMV infection Congenital and Perinatal Cytomegalovirus Infection (CMV) Cytomegalovirus infection may be acquired prenatally or perinatally and is the most common congenital viral infection. Complications include extensive hepatic and central nervous system (CNS) damage. Acquired infections are often asymptomatic. An acute febrile illness, termed CMV mononucleosis, may cause hepatitis with elevated aminotransferases (usually subclinical without jaundice), and atypical lymphocytosis similar to infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Postperfusion/posttransfusion syndrome can develop 2 to 4 weeks after transfusion with blood products containing CMV. It causes fever lasting 2 to 3 weeks and the same manifestations as CMV mononucleosis. In immunocompromised patients, CMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Disease often results from reactivation of latent virus. The lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or CNS may be involved. In the terminal phase of AIDS, CMV infection causes retinitis Herpesviruses: Cytomegalovirus A number of infectious diseases cause uveitis . The most common are toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

CMV infection affecting the liver can be differentiated from other viral hepatitis infections by hepatitis serologic testing Serology Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. Seroconversion can be demonstrated by development of CMV antibodies and indicates new CMV infection. However, much CMV disease results from reactivation of latent disease in the immunocompromised host. Reactivation of CMV can result in virus in the urine, other body fluids, or tissues, but the presence of CMV in body fluids and tissues does not always indicate disease and may merely represent shedding. Therefore, biopsy showing CMV-induced abnormalities is often necessary to demonstrate invasive disease. Quantitative detection of CMV antigen or DNA in the peripheral blood can also be very helpful because an elevated or rising CMV viral load is often highly suggestive of invasive disease. Diagnosis of CMV infection in infants can be made by urine culture. Treatment of Cytomegalovirus For serious disease, antivirals (eg, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir) CMV retinitis, which occurs mostly in AIDS patients, is treated with systemic antivirals. Anti-CMV drugs are used to treat severe disease other than retinitis but are less consistently effective than in retinitis. CMV retinitis Drugs used to treat CMV retinitis in induction and maintenance regimens include Ganciclovir or valganciclovir Foscarnet, with or without ganciclovir Cidofovir Most patients receive induction therapy with one of the following: Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 2 to 3 weeks Valganciclovir 900 mg orally every 12 hours for 21 days If induction fails more than once, another drug should be used. Maintenance (suppressive) therapy with one of the following is given after induction: Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV once a day Valganciclovir 900 mg po once a day Alternatively, foscarnet can be given with or without ganciclovir. Dosage is Induction: Foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 2 to 3 weeks Maintenance: Foscarnet 90 to 120 mg/kg IV once a day Adverse effects of IV foscarnet are significant and include nephrotoxicity, symptomatic hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, and CNS effects. Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet increases efficacy as well as adverse effects. Cidofovir therapy is another alternative; it consists of Induction: Cidofovir 5 mg/kg IV once a week for 2 weeks Maintenance: Cidofovir 5 mg/kg IV once every other week Efficacy of cidofovir is similar to that of ganciclovir or foscarnet. Significant adverse effects, including renal failure, limit its use. Cidofovir may cause iritis or ocular hypotony (intraocular pressure ≤ 5 mm Hg). The potential for nephrotoxicity can be reduced by giving probenecid and prehydration with each dose. However, the adverse effects of probenecid, including rash, headache, and fever, may be significant enough to prevent its use.ART) and have had a CD4 count of ≥ 100 cells/mc.L for 3 months. Intravitreal antiviral therapy should be used in combination with systemic therapy for patients with CMV retinitis that immediately threatens sight (ie, disease involving or close to the optic nerve or macula). Even patients receiving ocular injections need systemic therapy to prevent CMV in the contralateral eye and extraocular tissues. Prevention of Cytomegalovirus Prophylaxis or preemptive treatment (actively monitoring patients by viral load and giving antiviral drugs to those with evidence of infection) is effective for preventing CMV disease in solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplant recipients infected with CMV and at risk of CMV disease. Drugs used include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and foscarnet. Letermovir is a newer agent with a novel mechanism of action that can be used for prophylaxis in bone marrow transplantation. CMV hyperimmune globulin can be considered to prevent CMV infection in transplant recipients but is controversial. Key Points Sixty to 90% of adults have latent CMV infection. Healthy children and adults can have mild, nonspecific symptoms or sometimes a mononucleosis-like syndrome when first infected with CMV. Congenital infection may cause stillbirth or severe, sometimes fatal postnatal complications including extensive hepatic or CNS damage. Severely immunocompromised patients may have severe disease involving the retina, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or CNS.

Pregnant women should avoid certain foods and properly wash their hands and kitchen equipment after handling uncooked foods. Antibiotics can cure the infection.Listeriosis is infection caused by the gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, usually when contaminated food is eaten The Listeria monocytogenes bacteria resides in the intestine of some people and many animals worldwide. Unlike many other organisms, it survives well at refrigerator temperatures. Pregnant women can become infected if they eat contaminated food. These foods include unpasteurized dairy products, soft cheeses, raw vegetables, prepared deli meats and salads, refrigerated meat spreads, or smoked seafood. Fetuses become infected if Listeria monocytogenes crosses the placenta (the organ that provides nourishment to the fetus) during pregnancy. Newborns may become infected during or after delivery. Symptoms of Listeriosis in Newborns Pregnant women with listeriosis may show no symptoms, or they may have symptoms resembling the flu (for example, chills, fever, and muscle aches). In fetuses and newborns, symptoms of listeriosis are like those of sepsis in Newborns Sepsis is a serious bodywide reaction to infection spread through the blood. Symptoms may appear within hours or days of birth (called early onset) or may be delayed up to several weeks (called late onset). Newborns who have symptoms that appear early frequently have a low birth weight, problems at delivery, and symptoms of sepsis soon after birth. Newborns who have symptoms that appear late are usually full-term and initially healthy but then develop meningitis in Children Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection of the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord ( meninges). Other common complications of listeriosis include miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy.Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.Stillbirth is death of a fetus after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The risk of prostate cancer increases as men age. Symptoms, such as difficulty urinating, a need to urinate frequently and urgently, and blood in the urine, usually occur only after the cancer is advanced. The cancer can spread, most commonly to bones and lymph nodes. Doctors may do a digital rectal examination to examine the prostate using a gloved finger in the rectum and a blood test (PSA) to check for prostate cancer in men without symptoms. If cancer is suspected, ultrasonography and a biopsy of prostate tissue are done. Treatment may involve active surveillance, removal of the prostate gland, radiation therapy, or hormonal or newer drugs to slow cancer growth. Among men in the United States, prostate cancer is the most common cancer and one of the most common causes of cancer death. Every year, more than 268,490 new cases are diagnosed and 34,500 people die of prostate cancer (2022 estimates). The chance of developing prostate cancer increases with age and is greater for Men who are Black or Hispanic Men whose close relatives had the disease Men who have relatives with other cancers such as breast or ovarian cancer Prostate cancer usually grows very slowly and may take decades to cause symptoms. Thus, particularly because it occurs more often in older men, far more men have prostate cancer than die from it. Many men with prostate cancer die from other causes without ever knowing that they had prostate cancer. Some prostate cancers, however, grow rapidly or spread outside the prostate. The Prostate VIDEO The cause of prostate cancer is not known. Symptoms of Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. Sometimes, symptoms similar to those of benign prostatic hyperplasia Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland that can make urination difficult. The prostate gland enlarges as men age. However, these symptoms do not develop until after the cancer grows large enough to compress the urethra and partially block the flow of urine. Later, prostate cancer may cause bloody urine or a sudden inability to urinate. In some men, symptoms of prostate cancer develop only after it spreads (metastasizes). The areas most often affected by cancer spread are bones (typically the pelvis, ribs, or vertebrae). Bone metastasis tends to be painful and may weaken a bone enough for it to easily fracture. Spread to the bones of the spine (vertebrae) affects the spinal cord and can cause pain, numbness, weakness, or urinary incontinence Urinary Incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. After the cancer spreads, anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.  Many men with prostate cancer die of other causes without ever knowing that they had the cancer. Some prostate cancers grow so slowly that they may not require treatment. Others are aggressive and grow and spread quickly. Doctors cannot always tell which prostate cancers will be aggressive. Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer Needle biopsy Doctors may suspect prostate cancer based on the symptoms, the results of a digital rectal examination, or the results of screening blood tests. The screening blood test is a measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. PSA is a substance produced only by prostate gland tissue. In some men, doctors recommend an MRI that focuses on the prostate to obtain detailed images that could indicate more aggressive cancer. The radiologist reading the MRI identifies abnormal areas that may help doctors choose which areas to biopsy (but the MRI does not make biopsy unnecessary). If results of these tests suggest cancer, ultrasonography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.  In men with prostate cancer, ultrasonography may or may not reveal the cancer but is used to guide biopsy of the prostate biopsy Site-specific biopsies and cell sampling are also used in the evaluation of people with suspected kidney and urinary tract disorders.  If the results of a digital rectal examination or PSA test suggest prostate cancer, tissue samples from the prostate are taken and analyzed (biopsy Prostate biopsy Site-specific biopsies and cell sampling are also used in the evaluation of people with suspected kidney and urinary tract disorders.  When doing a biopsy, doctors usually first obtain images of the prostate by inserting an ultrasound probe (transducer) into the rectum (transrectal ultrasonography). The biopsy sample may be obtained through the rectal probe or through the skin between the rectum and the scrotum (transperineally). Usually, 10 to 12 samples are taken from the prostate. Taking many samples increases the likelihood of finding a small cancer. This procedure takes about 20 minutes, and men are usually given local anesthesia. Needle Biopsy of the Prostate VIDEO Grading and staging help doctors determine the likely course and the best treatment of the cancer. Grading The Gleason Grade Group system is the most common way to grade prostate cancer (previously the Gleason Scoring system was used). Based on the microscopic examination of tissues obtained from the biopsy, a number is assigned based on how distorted the cells appear. The current version of this scoring system gives each cancer a grade between 1 and 5, while the older Gleason Scoring system assigned a score between 6 and 10. The higher the number (high grade), the more aggressive the cancer is and the more likely it is that the cancer will spread. Gleason Grade group 1 = Gleason Score 6 (3+3) Gleason Grade group 2 = Gleason Score 7 (3+4) Gleason Grade group 3 = Gleason Score 7 (4+3) Gleason Grade group 4 = Gleason Score 8 Gleason Grade group 5 = Gleason Score 9 and 10 Gleason Grade, PSA level, and clinical stage (based on rectal examination) together predict the prognosis better than any of them alone. Staging Prostate cancers are staged according to three criteria: How far the cancer has spread within the prostate Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in areas near the prostate Whether the cancer has spread to bones or other organs far from the prostate (metastatic cancer) Testing to stage the cancer is often done when cancer is diagnosed. However, such testing may not be necessary when the likelihood of spread beyond the prostate is extremely low. Likelihood of spread is low when cancers have a Grade Group of 2 or less, the PSA level is less than 10 ng/mL (10 mcg/L), and the cancer has not penetrated the surface of the gland. Results of the digital rectal examination, ultrasonography, and biopsy reveal how far the cancer has spread within the prostate. If likelihood of spread is not low, doctors usually do computed tomography Computed tomography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.   Sometimes an MRI of the prostate is done using a special coil inserted in the rectum. A nuclear medicine (NM) bone scan may be done in people who have pain in their bones or who have a very high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or high Gleason Grade Group. If spread to the brain or spinal cord is suspected, CT or MRI of those organs is done. Screening Because prostate cancer is common and sometimes fatal, and because symptoms may not develop until the cancer has become advanced, many doctors offer screening tests to men with no symptoms. Screening has the advantage of finding aggressive cancers early—when they might be cured. However, experts disagree about whether and when screening is helpful for a variety of reasons: Screening tests may be positive in many men who do not have cancer. Rarely, some more aggressive cancers may not be detected by standard PSA testing. Screening is considered in all men older than 50 and in some who are younger who have risk factors, such as being Black or having a family history of prostate cancer. Benefits of screening may decrease with age. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 2018 recommendations indicate that men aged 55 to 69 (but not those 70 or older) should discuss with their doctor the benefits versus harms of screening. To screen for prostate cancer, doctors do a digital rectal examination and a blood test to measure PSA levels. If the prostate gland is hard, irregularly enlarged, or has a lump or if the PSA level is elevated, prostate cancer is more likely. However, PSA levels can be misleading. The PSA level can be normal when prostate cancer is present and can be elevated for reasons other than prostate cancer. PSA levels normally increase with age and with disorders such as benign prostatic hyperplasia Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland that can make urination difficult. The cause is sometimes a bacterial infection. The way doctors tell whether an elevated PSA level or prostate lump represents cancer is to do a prostate biopsy. Because many men who have elevated PSA levels on screening tests do not have prostate cancer, many biopsies have negative results (but still expose men to discomfort and risk of complications such as infection). Also, even when the biopsy shows prostate cancer, doctors cannot always tell which cancers require treatment. For example, if the biopsy shows a high Gleason Grade Group or that cancer has spread far within the prostate, then cancer is likely to cause problems and should be treated. Indeed, such treatment can be curative or life-saving. However, if the biopsy shows a low Gleason Grade Group and that cancer involves only a small part of the prostate, then the cancer may not cause problems and may not require treatment. Thus, screening may find cancers that would probably not hurt or kill a man even if they were never detected. In such cancers, the side effects of treatment (for example, erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.  Because it is not always clear early on which prostate cancers will be aggressive (for example, for cancers with low Gleason Grade Group and that involve only a small part of the prostate), doctors had historically recommended treatment to all men whose biopsy showed cancer. Thus, many more men were treated for prostate cancer than were cured by such treatment. As a result, many of the men treated derived no benefit from treatment but still risked side effects. However, more recently, as the understanding of prostate cancer has improved, doctors now offer certain men with a positive biopsy the option of close monitoring (active surveillance) Treatment , delaying treatment until results of periodic checkups and tests indicate the need for treatment (for example, that the cancer is enlarging or becoming more aggressive). Because the best course of action is still not clear and because men may have different values and preferences, the risks and benefits of screening, biopsy, and treatment should be discussed with their doctor. For example, men who would rather risk a substantial likelihood of side effects resulting from treatment than even a very small risk of death caused by a prostate cancer may choose to be screened. Men who would not want to risk the side effects of treatment unless it was absolutely necessary may choose not to be screened. Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Prognosis for most men with prostate cancer is very good. Most older men with prostate cancer tend to live as long as other men their age who have similar general health and do not have prostate cancer. For many men, long-term remission or even cure is possible. The prognosis depends upon the cancer’s grade and stage. High-grade cancers have a poor prognosis unless treated very early. Cancers that have spread to surrounding tissues also have a poorer prognosis. Metastatic prostate cancer has no cure. Most men with metastatic cancer live about 1 to 3 years after diagnosis, but some live for many years. Treatment of Prostate Cancer Surgery Radiation therapy Hormonal therapy Choosing among treatment options can be complicated. Because studies have not directly compared one treatment to another, doctors are uncertain which treatment is most effective. Furthermore, for some men, doctors are not sure whether treatment will prolong life. Such men include those who are not expected to live very long (either because of old age or serious health problems) and those with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels who have low-grade cancers confined to the prostate. Thus, men often make their decision by balancing their degree of discomfort in living with a cancer that might or might not harm them against the possible side effects of treatment. Surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy may cause incontinence Urinary Incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine.  For all of these reasons, men’s preferences are a bigger consideration in choosing treatment for prostate cancer than they are for many other disorders. Treatment for prostate cancer usually involves one of three strategies based on the aggressiveness of the cancer and how far the cancer has spread: Active surveillance Curative treatment Palliative treatment Active surveillance means doctors give no treatment unless the cancer is progressing or changing. The advantage of this strategy is avoiding or postponing the potential side effects of treatment. Active surveillance should be considered for all men whose cancers are unlikely to spread or cause symptoms. For example, most cancers that are confined to a small area within the prostate and have low Gleason Grade Group grow very slowly and usually do not spread. Thus, older men, particularly those who have other serious health problems, are far more likely to die of other causes before such cancers kill them or cause symptoms. In younger men, particularly those who are healthy, even a slow-growing cancer may eventually cause problems. In such men, active surveillance may be less preferred but should still be considered. During active surveillance, doctors periodically ask about symptoms, measure the PSA level, do digital rectal examinations, and repeat biopsies (with or without MRI guidance) to determine whether the cancer is causing symptoms, growing rapidly, or spreading. If testing shows growth or spread, doctors offer curative or palliative treatment. Curative treatment aims to remove or kill all of the cancer and includes Surgery Radiation therapy Less often, cryotherapy (freezing), high-frequency ultrasound Curative (also called definitive) treatment is a common strategy for men with cancers confined to the prostate that are likely to cause troublesome symptoms or death. Such cancers include those that are growing rapidly as well as some small, slowly growing cancers in men who are likely to live for some time (perhaps at least 10 or 15 years). Such men are typically those who are healthy, younger (particularly those under 60), or both. Curative treatment is not pursued if cancer has spread widely, but it can benefit some men with cancers that have spread to the area just outside the prostate. Such cancers are likely to cause symptoms within a relatively short period. However, curative treatment is most likely to be successful with cancers that are still confined to the area near the prostate. Curative treatment can prolong life and reduce or eliminate severe symptoms resulting from some cancers. Side effects, although less common with newer treatments, can still develop and diminish quality of life. These can include, for example, erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.  Palliative treatment aims to treat the symptoms rather than cure the cancer. Palliative therapies include Hormonal therapy Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Palliative treatment is best suited to men with widespread prostate cancer, which is not curable. The growth or spread of such cancers can usually be slowed or temporarily reversed, relieving symptoms. Besides trying to slow the cancer’s growth and spread, doctors may try to relieve symptoms resulting from the effects of cancer in other organs and tissues (such as the bones). However, because these treatments cannot cure the cancer, symptoms eventually worsen. Death due to the disease eventually follows. Surgery Surgically removing the prostate (prostatectomy) is useful for cancer that is confined to the prostate. Prostatectomy is usually not done if staging tests show the cancer has spread. Prostatectomy is very effective in curing low-grade, slowly growing cancers but is less effective in high-grade, fast-growing cancers. Such cancers are more likely to have spread even if spread is not detectable with staging tests at the time of diagnosis. Prostatectomy requires general or spinal anesthesia, an overnight hospital stay, and a surgical incision. Following surgery, men must have a catheter in their penis for a week or two until the connection between the bladder and urethra heals. Doctors do not routinely give chemotherapy or hormone therapy before or after surgery. In men whose prostate cancer is found to be aggressive (high-grade, fast-growing) at the time of surgery and whose PSA increases, consideration is being given to radiation therapy (with hormone therapy) after surgery. Prostatectomy may lead to permanent erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.  Erectile dysfunction may occur because the nerves to the penis that control erection run across the prostate and may be damaged during surgery. Incontinence may occur because part of the sphincter that closes the opening at the bottom of the bladder must be removed during surgery. However, most men recover continence within 6 months following prostatectomy. Erectile function recovery is more variable, depending in part on men's erectile function prior to surgery, the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer, and the surgical technique. Techniques for doing prostatectomy include open radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. In open radical prostatectomy, the entire prostate, the seminal vesicles, and part of the vas deferens are removed through an incision in the lower abdomen or, rarely, in the area between the scrotum and anus. Lymph nodes may also be removed to check for cancer. In the laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures, the same structures are removed, but these procedures are done through smaller incisions and result in less postoperative pain and blood loss and typically a faster recovery. Radical prostatectomy, irrespective of technique, is the surgery done when trying to cure prostate cancer. More than 90% of men with cancer confined to the prostate live at least 10 years after radical prostatectomy. Younger men who can otherwise expect to live at least 10 to 15 more years are most likely to benefit from radical prostatectomy. However, the procedure causes some leakage of urine in up to 10% of men. Temporary incontinence develops in most men and may last for several months. Incontinence is less likely in younger men. Prostate Removal VIDEO A degree of erectile dysfunction develops in most men after radical prostatectomy, particularly in those who experience difficulty with erections before surgery. Usually prostatectomy can be done in such a way that some of the nerves needed to achieve erection are spared—this procedure is called nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. This procedure cannot be used to treat cancer that has invaded the nerves and blood vessels of the prostate. Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy is less likely than non–nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy to cause erectile dysfunction. Most men are diagnosed early and, thus, can be treated with nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Blockage of urine flow caused by narrowing of part of the bladder or scarring of the urethra (urethral stricture) develops in 7 to 20% of men. Blockage can usually be easily treated , including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy Radiation Therapy for Cancer Radiation is a form of intense energy generated by a radioactive substance, such as cobalt, or by specialized equipment, such as an atomic particle (linear) accelerator. Although radiation therapy cannot cure cancer that has spread to distant organs, it can help relieve the pain resulting from the spread of prostate cancer to bone. Radiation therapy is sometimes given after surgery to treat the areas around the prostate or if PSA is found in the blood after surgery, suggesting that surgery has not removed all of the cancer. For many stages of prostate cancer, 10-year survival rates after radiation therapy are nearly as high as those achieved with surgery. More than 90% of men with cancer confined to the prostate live at least 10 years after undergoing radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be delivered as External beam radiation therapy (used to treat cancer within the prostate gland and prostate cancer that has spread to bone) Radioactive implants (used to treat low-risk cancer within the prostate gland but not prostate cancer that has spread to bone) Radium-223, an intravenous drug (used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to bone, but not cancer within the prostate gland) External beam radiation therapy uses a machine to send beams of radiation to the prostate and surrounding tissues. Computed tomography Computed tomography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.  This approach is called three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Treatments are usually given 5 days per week for 7 to 8 weeks. Although some degree of erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.  However, after months or years, erectile dysfunction seems to be as likely after radiation therapy as after prostatectomy. Incontinence is rare when three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is used. IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) and SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy) are modifications of standard radiation therapy. Sometimes, for more aggressive cancers, doctors also give hormonal therapy Hormonal therapy Prostate cancer begins in a small area of the prostate gland, an organ found only in males. Scars that narrow the urethra and impede the flow of urine (urethral strictures Urethral Stricture A urethral stricture is scarring that narrows the urethra. Other troublesome but usually temporary side effects of external beam radiation therapy include burning during urination, having to urinate frequently, blood in the urine, diarrhea that is sometimes bloody, radiation proctitis (usually causing irritation of the rectum and diarrhea), and sudden urges to defecate. Rarely, men develop cancers in the surrounding organs (bladder, rectum) caused by radiation therapy. A different form of external beam radiation therapy is proton beam therapy, which uses a different form of radiation that allows the radiation to be delivered more precisely to cancer cells while avoiding healthy cells. Proton beam therapy has been shown to be beneficial for other cancers, but it is not clear if it has fewer side effects in prostate cancer than standard external beam radiation therapy. Recent advances in prostate cancer radiation therapy include Placing markers around the prostate to improve targeting Using a transrectal needle to place hydrogel spacers in the rectum to reduce radiation's toxic effects (these hydrogel spacers eventually break down and are resorbed into the tissues) Dividing large doses of radiation up over time and administering them over a shorter period of time (fewer days or weeks) than traditional radiation Radioactive implants can be inserted into the prostate (brachytherapy). The implants are small, seedlike pieces of radioactive material. Doctors inject the implants into the prostate gland through the area between the scrotum and anus using ultrasonography or CT to guide placement. Brachytherapy can be done in less than 2 hours, does not require repeated treatment sessions, and can be done using spinal anesthesia. Brachytherapy also can deliver high doses of radiation to the prostate while often sparing healthy surrounding tissues and causing fewer side effects. However, brachytherapy may cause urethral strictures in up to 10% of men. The radioactivity of the seeds decreases with time. Seeds may later be passed in the urine. Men treated with these seeds should avoid close contact with pregnant women and young children for a period of time after the procedure because the radioactivity can be harmful to a fetus or young child. Cure rates 10 to 15 years after brachytherapy are similar to rates obtained with other treatments for some men. Combined treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy is sometimes recommended for more aggressive cancers. Temporary brachytherapy implants (requiring an overnight hospital stay) are available at some centers. Radium-223 is a drug given intravenously that emits a particular type of radiation (alpha radiation). Unlike beam radiation and brachytherapy, it is not directed at a particular target. Radium-223 is used to treat bone metastases from prostate cancer rather than the prostate cancer in the prostate gland. Once in the bloodstream, radium-223 seeks out areas of bone affected by prostate cancer, where it helps destroy cancer cells. Because it targets bone tissue and does not scatter radiation (like radiation beams or seeds), it may spare nearby tissues from radiation damage. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses intense ultrasound energy administered through a probe placed in the rectum to destroy prostate tissue. It has been used for many years in Europe and Canada and has recently become available in the United States. Although the role of this technology in the management of prostate cancer is still evolving, it currently appears to be best suited for prostate cancer that recurs after treatment with radiation. Hormonal therapy Because most prostate cancers require testosterone to grow or spread, treatments that block the effects of this hormone (hormonal therapy) can slow progression of the tumors. Hormonal therapy is commonly used to delay the spread of the cancer that has come back after surgery or radiation therapy or to treat widespread (metastatic) prostate cancer. Hormonal therapy is sometimes combined with other treatments such as radiation therapy. It is not curative on its own. Hormonal therapy can prolong life as well as decrease symptoms. Eventually, however, hormonal therapy is likely to lose effectiveness, and the disease progresses. Hormonal drugs used to treat prostate cancer in the United States include leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, buserelin, histrelin, degarelix, and relugolix, which prevent the pituitary gland from stimulating the testes to make testosterone. Except for relugolix (given by mouth), these drugs are given by injection in a doctor’s office every 1, 3, 4, or 12 months, usually for the rest of the man’s life. For some men, this treatment may only be given for a year or two and possibly resumed at a later time. Drugs that block testosterone’s effects (such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide) may also be used. These drugs are taken daily by mouth. Side effects of hormonal therapy may include hot flashes, osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.  Breast disorders include Breast enlargement Breast cancer Breast enlargement in males is called either gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia. The oldest form of hormonal therapy involves the removal of both testes (bilateral orchiectomy). The effects of bilateral orchiectomy on testosterone level are equivalent to those produced by leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, and related drugs. The physical and psychologic effects of bilateral orchiectomy and other hormonal therapies make these therapies difficult for some men to accept. Getting physical exercise, taking vitamin D and calcium supplements, stopping smoking, and avoiding excess alcohol are recommended for men on hormonal therapy to help minimize symptoms. In men with widespread prostate cancer, hormonal therapy may become ineffective after a few years. When cancer eventually progresses despite hormonal therapy, men may live only a few more years. Other drugs Cancer that does not respond to hormonal therapy that successfully decreases testosterone levels is called castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recently, many other treatments that prolong life have become available and are being used earlier to treat metastatic prostate cancer, either in the initial treatment with hormone therapy or when hormone therapy fails. These treatments include sipuleucel-T (a vaccine that targets prostate cancer cells), abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide (types of oral hormonal therapy), docetaxel, and cabazitaxel (chemotherapy drugs), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in people who have CRPC with DNA repair defects or BRCA1/2 mutations. Radium-223 can prolong life and prevent certain complications due to bone spread (such as spinal cord damage). Novel treatments with small molecule radioligands that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are also under investigation. Drugs used to treat osteoporosis, such as zoledronic acid and denosumab, can be used to strengthen bone that has been weakened by cancer or by hormonal therapy, which tends to weaken bones. These drugs help treat and prevent problems such as pain and the tendency to fracture. Table Follow-up After all forms of treatment, PSA levels are measured at regular intervals (usually every 3 to 4 months for the first year, and then every 6 months for the rest of the man’s life). By 1 month after surgery, PSA should not be detected. Following radiation therapy, PSA decreases more slowly and usually does not become undetectable but should remain stable at a low level. Increases in the PSA level may indicate that the cancer has recurred.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal. Drowning results in hypoxia, which can damage multiple organs, particularly the brain. Treatment is supportive, including reversal of respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest, hypoxia, hypoventilation, and hypothermia. Drowning is among the top 10 causes of mortality for children and young people worldwide. In 2020 in the US, drowning was the leading cause of injury mortality in children aged 1 to 4 years and was second only to motor vehicle collisions for children aged 5 to 9 years; drowning also was among the top 10 causes of unintentional death in all ages under 55 years (1 General references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. Groups at high risk of drowning death include the following: Children from African American, Native American, immigrant, or impoverished families (2 General references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal.Children who have not received formal swimming lessons and are unsupervised around water (3, 4 General references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium.

It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal.People who engage in dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors (DUBBs) Dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors (DUBBs) Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal.Drowning is common in pools, hot tubs, and natural water settings, and, among infants and toddlers, in toilets, bathtubs, and buckets of water or cleaning fluids. Nonfatal drownings are more common than fatal drownings; for every child that dies of drowning, approximately 7 receive emergency department care. About 40% of those treated in emergency departments require admission to the hospital (6 General references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. Pathophysiology of Drowning Hypoxia Oxygen Desaturation Patients without respiratory disorders who are in the intensive care unit (ICU)—and other patients—may develop hypoxia (oxygen saturation < 90%) during a hospital stay.Overview of Respiratory Arrest Respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest are distinct, but inevitably if untreated, one leads to the other. Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow. Brain hypoxia may cause cerebral edema and, occasionally, permanent neurologic sequelae. Immediate hypoxia results from aspiration of fluid or gastric contents, acute reflex laryngospasm (previously called dry drowning), or both. Lung injury due to aspiration or hypoxia itself may cause delayed hypoxia (previously called secondary drowning). Aspiration, especially with particulate matter or chemicals, may cause chemical pneumonitis Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs.Overview of Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection. Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.Atelectasis is collapse of lung tissue with loss of volume. Patients may have dyspnea or respiratory failure if atelectasis is extensive. They may also develop pneumonia. Extensive atelectasis may make the affected areas of the lungs stiff, noncompliant, and poorly ventilated, potentially causing respiratory failure Overview of Respiratory Failure Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening impairment of oxygenation, carbon dioxide elimination, or both. Perfusion of poorly ventilated areas of the lungs (V/Q mismatch) worsens hypoxia. Alveolar hypoxia may cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Hypothermia Exposure to cold water induces systemic hypothermia is a core body temperature < 35° C. Symptoms progress from shivering and lethargy to confusion, coma, and death. However, hypothermia can be protective by stimulating the mammalian diving reflex, slowing the heart rate, and constricting the peripheral arteries, shunting oxygenated blood away from the extremities and the gut to the heart and brain. Also, hypothermia decreases the oxygen needs of tissues, possibly prolonging survival and delaying the onset of hypoxic tissue damage. The diving reflex and overall clinically protective effects of cold water are usually greatest in young children. Fluid aspiration Laryngospasm often limits the volume of fluid aspirated. Distinction between freshwater and seawater drowning was once considered important due to the potential electrolyte shifts, hemolysis, and fluid compartment shifting that possibly could occur. However, studies have shown that in most patients, too little liquid is aspirated to have these effects. Aspiration can lead to pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs.Immersion Pulmonary Edema Immersion pulmonary edema is sudden-onset pulmonary edema that typically occurs early during a dive while at depth. . Dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors (DUBBs) Dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors are practiced mostly by healthy young men (often good swimmers) trying to prolong their capacity to remain submerged. There are 3 described types of DUBB: Intentional hyperventilation—blowing off carbon dioxide before submerged swimming, thereby delaying central hypercarbic ventilatory responses Hypoxic training—extending capacity for underwater distance swimming or breath-holding Static apnea—breath-holding for as long as possible while submerged and motionless, including as a game In DUBBs, while submerged, hypoxia occurs first, followed by loss of consciousness (hypoxic blackout, breath-hold blackout) and then drowning. Associated injuries Skeletal, soft-tissue, head, and internal injuries may occur, particularly among surfers, water skiers, boaters, flood victims, and occupants of submerged vehicles. People who dive into shallow water may sustain cervical and other spine injuries Spinal Trauma to the spine may cause injuries involving the spinal cord, vertebrae, or both. Occasionally, the spinal nerves are affected. The anatomy of the spinal column is reviewed elsewhere. 6. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drowning Prevention: Drowning facts. Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). Accessed August 10, 2022. Symptoms and Signs of Drowning During drowning, panic and air hunger occur. Children who are unable to swim may become submerged in < 1 minute, more rapidly than adults. After rescue, anxiety, vomiting, wheezing, and altered consciousness are common. Patients may have respiratory failure with tachypnea, intercostal retractions, or cyanosis. Respiratory symptoms are sometimes delayed for up to 8 hours after submersion. Patients may have symptoms due to injuries or exacerbations of underlying disorders. Pearls & Pitfalls Sometimes respiratory symptoms and hypoxia are delayed for up to 8 hours after submersion. Diagnosis of Drowning Clinical evaluation For concomitant injuries, imaging studies as indicated Pulse oximetry and, if results are abnormal or if respiratory symptoms and signs are present, arterial blood gases (ABG) and chest x-ray Core temperature measurement to rule out hypothermia Evaluation for causative or contributing disorders (eg, seizure, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, intoxication, injury) Ongoing monitoring as indicated for delayed respiratory complications Most people are found in or near water, making the diagnosis obvious clinically. Resuscitation after drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. Cervical spine injury is considered, and the spine is immobilized in patients whose mechanism of injury potentially involves diving or trauma. Secondary head injury and conditions that may have contributed to drowning (eg, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, intoxication, arrhythmia) are considered.ABG) and chest x-ray. Because respiratory symptoms may be delayed, even asymptomatic patients are transported to the hospital and observed for several hours. In patients with symptoms or a history of prolonged submersion, core body temperature is measured, electrocardiography and serum electrolytes are obtained, and continuous oximetry and cardiac monitoring are done. Patients with possible cervical spine injury undergo cervical spine imaging Diagnosis Trauma to the spine may cause injuries involving the spinal cord, vertebrae, or both. Patients with altered consciousness undergo head CT. Any other suspected predisposing or secondary conditions are evaluated with appropriate testing (eg, fingerstick glucose for hypoglycemia, electrocardiography for myocardial infarction, cardiac monitoring for arrhythmia, evaluation for intoxication)Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia is a specific form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with a long QT interval. In patients with pulmonary infiltrates, bacterial or fungal pneumonia is differentiated from chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary edema using blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture. If indicated (eg, bacterial or fungal pneumonia is suspected but the pathogen cannot be otherwise identified), bronchial washings are obtained for testing, including culture. Treatment of Drowning Resuscitation Correction of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and other physiologic abnormalities Intensive respiratory support Treatment aims to correct cardiac arrest, hypoxia, hypoventilation, hypothermia, and other physiologic insults. Resuscitation after drowning In apneic patients, rescue breathing is started immediately—in the water, if necessary. If spinal immobilization is necessary, it is done in a neutral position, and rescue breathing is done using a jaw thrust without head tilt or chin lift. Emergency medical services are called. Although the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) recommend chest compressions as the first step in resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest, drowning is an exception to this recommendation and rescue breathing is started first (1 Treatment references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. Attempts to remove water from the lungs are avoided because they delay ventilation and increase the risk of vomiting. Hypothermic patients are warmed as soon as possible. Immediate treatment measures Treatment Hypothermia is a core body temperature < 35° C. Prolonged resuscitation efforts should be considered especially in young patients involved in cold water drownings. Pearls & Pitfalls Avoid attempts to remove water from the lungs; this only delays ventilation and increases risk of vomiting. Hospital care for drowning patients All hypoxic or moderately symptomatic patients are hospitalized. In the hospital, supportive treatment continues, aimed primarily at achieving acceptable arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Patients are initially given 100% oxygen; the concentration is titrated lower based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Pulmonary support may be necessary for hours or days. If adequate oxygenation is impossible despite maximizing ventilator settings, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be considered. Nebulized beta-2 agonists may help reduce bronchospasm and wheezing. Surfactant administration may be helpful in critically ill patients with significant lung compliance issues after drowning, although no large clinical trials have addressed this. Core body temperature is monitored, and hypothermia Treatment Hypothermia is a core body temperature < 35° C. Fluids or electrolytes are rarely required to correct significant volume or electrolyte imbalances. Fluid restriction is rarely indicated unless pulmonary or cerebral edema occurs. Concomitant injuries and disorders (eg, head or cervical injury Overview of Spinal Cord Disorders Spinal cord disorders can cause permanent severe neurologic disability. For some patients, such disability can be avoided or minimized if evaluation and treatment are rapid.Seizure Disorders A seizure is an abnormal, unregulated electrical discharge that occurs within the brain’s cortical gray matter and transiently interrupts normal brain function. Patients who have persistent altered mental status despite correction of respiratory compromise should be evaluated for other injuries (eg, occult seizures, intracranial injury). Patients with pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs. Corticosteroids are not used. Discharge of drowning patients with mild symptoms, clear lungs, and normal mentation and oxygenation should be observed in the emergency department for at least 8 hours (2 Treatment references Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal.Key Points Drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. If symptoms resolve and the examination and oxygenation remain normal, patients can be discharged with instructions to return if symptoms recur. Prognosis for Drowning Factors that increase the chance of surviving submersion without permanent injury include the following: Rapid institution of resuscitation (most important) Brief duration of submersion Cold water temperature Young age Absence of underlying medical conditions, secondary trauma, and aspiration of particulate matter or chemicals Survival may be possible in cold water submersion that lasts >1 hour, especially among children; thus, even patients with prolonged submersion are vigorously resuscitated. Prevention of Drowning Drugs, alcohol, and drowning Use of alcohol or drugs is a major risk factor and should be avoided before and during swimming and boating, and when supervising children around water. Swimming safety Swimmers should use common sense and be aware of weather and water conditions. Swimmers should be accompanied by an experienced swimmer or swim only in guarded areas. Swimming should stop if the swimmer looks or feels very cold, because hypothermia is a core body temperature < 35° C. Ocean swimmers should learn to escape rip currents by swimming parallel to the beach rather than directly toward the beach. Swimmers should be discouraged from dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors (DUBBs). If they practice them, they should be supervised and should know their dangers. Swimmers should avoid swimming near a boat exhaust port, which can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Public swimming areas should be supervised by lifeguards trained in water safety and resuscitation as well as rescue techniques. Life preservers, life jackets, and a shepherd's crook should be available close to poolside. Emergency airway equipment, automated external defibrillators (AEDs), and immediate telephone access to emergency medical services should be available. Comprehensive community prevention programs should target high-risk groups, teach children to swim as early as possible, and teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to as many adolescents and adults as possible. Owners of private pools should comply with local laws regarding pool safety, have immediate telephone access to emergency medical services, and know about resuscitation after drowning. Water safety for children should wear flotation devices that have been approved by the US Coast Guard or other equivalent authority when in or around water. Air-filled swimming aids and foam toys (water wings, noodles, etc) are not designed to keep swimmers from drowning and should not be used as a substitute for approved safety equipment. Children must be constantly supervised by an adult when around water, including beaches, pools, and ponds. Infants and toddlers should also be supervised, ideally within arm’s length, when near toilets, bathtubs, or any collection of water. Studies in the US and China have shown that formal swimming lessons reduce the risk of fatal drowning among children ages 1 to 4; however, even children who have been taught how to swim require constant supervision when in or around water. Adults should remove water from containers such as pails and buckets immediately after use. Swimming pools should be surrounded with a locked fence ≥ 1.5 m in height. Boating safety Before embarking, boaters should wear life jackets approved by the US Coast Guard or other equivalent authority and they should check weather and water conditions. Nonswimmers and small children in a boat should wear appropriately approved life jackets at all times. Because consuming any quantity of alcohol increases the risk of drowning, operators and passengers on recreational boats should generally avoid consuming alcohol. Special populations at risk for drowning People who are debilitated or older or have seizure disorders or other medical conditions that can alter consciousness require constant supervision when they are boating or swimming and when in bathtubs. Key Points Take preventive measures (eg, provide or take swimming lessons, closely supervise children around water, use flotation devices or life jackets that have been approved by the US Coast Guard or other equivalent authority, avoid alcohol, and ensure access to trained lifeguards and emergency medical services) to decrease the risk of drowning. Begin resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest from drowning with rescue breathing, not chest compressions. Vigorously resuscitate cold water drowning victims even if submersion was prolonged; survival is possible even after 1 hour of submersion, particularly in young children. Evaluate patients for suspected causes of drowning (eg, cervical spine injury, head injury, seizure, arrhythmias, hypoglycemia) as well as injuries or consequences of drowning (eg, head or cervical spine injury, aspiration).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac catheterization can be used to do various tests, including Angiography Detection and quantification of shunts Endomyocardial biopsy Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) Measurement of cardiac output (CO) Measurements of myocardial metabolism These tests define coronary artery anatomy, cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics to establish diagnoses and help clinicians select treatment. Cardiac catheterization is also the basis for several therapeutic interventions . Procedure Patients must fast for 4 to 6 hours before cardiac catheterization. Most patients do not require overnight hospitalization unless a therapeutic intervention is also done. Left heart catheterization Left heart catheterization is most commonly used to assess Coronary artery anatomy and presence of coronary artery disease Left heart catheterization is also used to assess Aortic blood pressure Aortic valve function Left ventricular pressure and function Mitral valve function Systemic vascular resistance The procedure is done via femoral, subclavian, radial, or brachial artery puncture, with a catheter passed into the coronary artery ostia and/or across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV). Catheterization of the left atrium (LA) and LV is occasionally done using transseptal perforation during right heart catheterization. Right heart catheterization Right heart catheterization is commonly used to measure Right atrial pressure Right ventricular pressure Pulmonary artery pressure Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary artery wedge pressure) Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.PAOP—see figure Diagram of the cardiac cycle Diagram of the cardiac cycle, showing pressure curves of the cardiac chambers, heart sounds, jugular pulse wave, and the ECG ) The most frequent indications for right heart catheterization are to assess hemodynamics, diagnose pulmonary hypertension, guide therapy, and assess need for cardiac transplantation or mechanical cardiac support (eg, a ventricular assist device). PAOP approximates left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In seriously ill patients, PAOP helps assess volume status and, with simultaneous measurements of cardiac output, can help guide therapy. Right heart catheterization is also useful for assessing cardiac filling pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, tricuspid or pulmonic valve function, intracardiac shunts, and right ventricular pressure. Right heart pressure measurements may help in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy Overview of Cardiomyopathies A cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscle.Constrictive pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial space.Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. when noninvasive testing is nondiagnostic, and it is an essential part of the assessment for cardiac transplantation or mechanical cardiac support (eg, use of a ventricular assist device). The procedure Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness. A catheter is passed into the right atrium, through the tricuspid valve, into the right ventricle, and across the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery. Selective catheterization of the coronary sinus can also be done. Hemodynamic assessment via right heart catheterization during exercise is increasingly being done as part of the workup for dyspnea of uncertain etiology. The test can be done at the same time as cardiopulmonary exercise testing, called invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. This is considered the standard for diagnosis of cardiac limitation to exercise but is currently available at relatively few centers. An exercise right heart catheterization should be considered in patients at intermediate pretest probability for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Classification Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. An increase in the PAOP > 25 mm Hg confirms the diagnosis when patients have signs and symptoms of heart failure and a normal ejection fraction. Diagram of the cardiac cycle, showing pressure curves of the cardiac chambers, heart sounds, jugular pulse wave, and the ECG The phases of the cardiac cycle are atrial systole (a), isometric contraction (b), maximal ejection (c), reduced ejection (d), protodiastolic phase (e), isometric relaxation (f), rapid inflow (g), and diastasis, or slow LV filling (h). For illustrative purposes, time intervals between valvular events have been modified, and the z point has been prolonged. AO = aortic valve opening; AC = aortic valve closing; LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; MO = mitral valve opening. Specific Tests During Cardiac Catheterization Angiography Injection of radiopaque contrast agent into coronary or pulmonary arteries, the aorta, and cardiac chambers is useful in certain circumstances. Digital subtraction angiography is used for nonmoving arteries and for chamber cineangiography. Coronary angiography via left heart catheterization is used to evaluate coronary artery anatomy in various clinical situations, as in patients with suspected coronary atherosclerotic or congenital disease, valvular disorders Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders Any heart valve can become stenotic or insufficient (also termed regurgitant or incompetent), causing hemodynamic changes long before symptoms.Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary angiography via right heart catheterization can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism Diagnosis Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis. Intraluminal filling defects or arterial cutoffs are diagnostic. Radiopaque contrast agent is usually selectively injected into one or both pulmonary arteries and their segments. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has largely replaced right heart catheterization for diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary angiography via right heart catheterization remains commonly used to determine a management plan for suspected chronic thromboembolic disease. Aortic angiography via left heart catheterization is used to assess aortic regurgitation Aortic Regurgitation Aortic regurgitation (AR) is incompetency of the aortic valve causing backflow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole.Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a persistence of the fetal connection (ductus arteriosus) between the aorta and pulmonary artery after birth.Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel). Ventriculography is used to visualize ventricular wall motion and ventricular outflow tracts, including subvalvular, valvular, and supravalvular regions. It is also used to estimate severity of mitral valve regurgitation Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation (MR) is incompetency of the mitral valve causing flow from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium during ventricular systole. After left ventricular mass and volume are determined from single planar or biplanar ventricular angiograms, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and ejection fraction can be calculated. Coronary artery flow measurements Coronary angiography shows the presence and degree of stenosis but not the functional significance of the lesion (ie, how much blood flows across the stenosis) or whether a specific lesion is likely to be the cause of symptoms. Extremely thin guidewires with pressure sensors or Doppler flow sensors are available. Data from these sensors can be used to estimate coronary artery blood flow, which is expressed as fractional flow reserve (FFR). FFR is the ratio of maximal flow through the stenotic area to normal maximal flow obtained during hyperemia (most commonly with adenosine); an FFR of < 0.75 to 0.8 is considered abnormal. Newer techniques of measuring coronary blood flow, including instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and diastolic hyperemia-free ratio (DFR), have been developed. These techniques have the advantage of not requiring hyperemia. Both iFR and DFR measure gradients across a stenosis during a period in diastole; an iFR or DFR of ≤ 0.89 is considered abnormal (1, 2 Tests during cardiac catheterization reference Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins. These flow estimates correlate well with the need for intervention and long-term outcome; patients with lesions with FFR > 0.8, iFR > 0.89, or DFR > 0.89 do not seem to benefit from placement of a stent. These flow measurements are most useful with intermediate lesions (40 to 70% stenosis) and with multiple lesions (to identify those that are clinically most significant). Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) Miniature ultrasound transducers on the end of coronary artery catheters can produce images of coronary vessel lumina and walls and delineate blood flow. Intravascular ultrasonography is being increasingly used at the same time as coronary angiography. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) Optical coherence tomography is an optical analog of intracoronary ultrasound imaging that measures the amplitude of backscattered light to determine the temperature of coronary plaques and can help determine whether lesions are at high risk of future rupture (leading to acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. The indications and appropriate use for OCT are currently uncertain. Tests for cardiac shunts Measuring blood oxygen content at successive levels in the heart and great vessels can help determine the presence, direction, and volume of central shunts. The maximal normal difference in oxygen content between structures is as follows: The pulmonary artery and right ventricle: 0.5 mL/dL (0.5 vol%) The right ventricle and right atrium: 0.9 mL/dL (0.9 vol%) The right atrium and superior vena cava: 1.9 mL/dL (1.9 vol%) If the blood oxygen content in a chamber exceeds that of the more proximal chamber by more than these values, a left-to-right shunt at that level is probable. Right-to-left shunts are strongly suspected when LA, LV, or arterial oxygen saturation is low (≤ 92%) and does not improve when pure oxygen (fractional inspirational O2 = 1.0) is given. Left heart or arterial desaturation plus increased oxygen content in blood samples drawn beyond the shunt site on the right side of circulation suggests a bidirectional shunt. Measurement of cardiac output and flow Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood ejected by the heart per minute (normal at rest: 4 to 8 L/minute). Techniques  used to calculate CO include Fick cardiac output technique Indicator-dilution technique Thermodilution technique Table With the Fick technique, CO is proportional to oxygen consumption divided by arteriovenous oxygen difference. Dilution techniques rely on the assumption that after an indicator is injected into the circulation, it appears and disappears proportionately to CO. Usually, CO is expressed in relation to body surface area (BSA) as the cardiac index (CI) in L/minute/m2 (ie, CI = CO/BSA—see table Normal Values for Cardiac Index and Related Measures Normal Values for Cardiac Index and Related Measurements ). BSA is calculated using DuBois height (ht)–weight (wt) equation: Table Endomyocardial biopsy Endomyocardial biopsy helps assess transplant rejection and myocardial disorders due to infection or infiltrative diseases. The biopsy catheter (bioptome) can be passed into either ventricle, usually the right. Three to 5 samples of myocardial tissue are removed from the septal endocardium. The main complication of endomyocardial biopsy, cardiac perforation, occurs in 0.3 to 0.5% of patients; it may cause hemopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. Injury to the tricuspid valve and supporting chordae may also occur and can lead to tricuspid regurgitation Tricuspid Regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficiency of the tricuspid valve causing blood flow from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systole. 2.

Disorders of coagulation can be acquired or hereditary.Fever Radiopaque contrast agent allergies Allergic-type contrast reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.Uncontrolled hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Uncompensated heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Relative contraindications balance the urgency of the procedure (eg, in an acute myocardial infarction vs an elective case) and the severity of the contraindicating disorder. Periprocedural management of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs is individualized based on the type of procedure (ie, arterial vs venous access), the urgency of the procedure, the indication for the drug, and the patient's risk of bleeding. Catheterization laboratories frequently have policies for the periprocedural management of these drugs. Complications of Cardiac Catheterization The incidence of complications after cardiac catheterizations ranges from 0.8 to 8%, depending on patient factors, technical factors, and the experience of the operator. Patient factors that increase risk of complications include Chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke.COPD) Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Increasing age Peripheral arterial disease Peripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia.Valvular heart disease Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders Any heart valve can become stenotic or insufficient (also termed regurgitant or incompetent), causing hemodynamic changes long before symptoms.Most complications are minor and can be easily treated.

Incidence of stroke is higher in patients > 80 years. In general, complications involve The contrast agent Effects of the catheter The access site Contrast agent complications Injection of radiopaque contrast agent produces a transient sense of warmth throughout the body in many patients. Tachycardia, a slight fall in systemic pressure, an increase in cardiac output, nausea, vomiting, and coughing may occur. Rarely, bradycardia occurs when a large amount of a contrast agent is injected; asking the patient to cough often restores normal rhythm. More serious reactions  Most contrast agents are iodine based.Allergic-type contrast reactions Contrast-induced kidney injury Allergic reactions to radiographic contrast may include urticaria and conjunctivitis, which usually respond to diphenhydramine 50 mg IV. Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen.Complications reference Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins.3 to 0.4 mL. Treatment of anaphylaxis Treatment Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to contrast may be premedicated with prednisone (50 mg orally 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before injection of contrast) and diphenhydramine (50 mg orally or IM 1 hour before the injection). If patients require imaging immediately, they can be given diphenhydramine 50 mg orally or IM 1 hour before injection of contrast and hydrocortisone 200 mg IV every 4 hours until imaging is completed. Contrast-induced kidney injury Contrast Nephropathy Contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary.5 mg/dL [44 micromole/L] increase in absolute value) within 48 to 72 hours of IV contrast administration. For patients at risk, use of lowest possible dose of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast, avoidance of multiple contrast studies within a short period of time, and infusion of a total 10 to 15 mL/kg normal saline IV beginning 4 to 6 hours before angiography and 6 to 12 hours afterward reduces this risk substantially. In patients at risk of impaired renal function, assess serum creatinine 48 hours after injection of contrast. Catheter-related complications If the catheter tip contacts the ventricular endocardium, ventricular arrhythmias commonly occur, but ventricular fibrillation is rare.DC cardioversion) is administered immediately.

Emboli from the aorta may cause stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Renal Atheroembolism Renal atheroembolism is occlusion of renal arterioles by atherosclerotic emboli, causing progressive chronic kidney disease. It results from rupture of atheromatous plaques. Emboli from proximal to distal coronary arteries may cause myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. Coronary artery dissection is also possible. Access site complications Access site complications include Bleeding Hematoma Pseudoaneurysm Arteriovenous (AV) fistula Limb ischemia Bleeding from the access site may occur and usually resolves with compression. Mild bruises and small hematomas are common and do not require specific investigation or treatment. A large or enlarging lump should be investigated using ultrasonography to distinguish hematoma from pseudoaneurysm. A bruit at the site (with or without pain) suggests an AV fistula, which can be diagnosed using ultrasonography. Hematomas usually resolve with time and do not require specific therapy. Pseudoaneurysms and AV fistulas usually resolve with compression; those that persist may require surgical repair. Radial artery access is in general more comfortable for the patient and carries a much lower risk of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula formation when compared with femoral artery access.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

If untreated, it can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids (semen, vaginal fluid, blood, breast milk) with an infected person, usually through vaginal or anal sex, sharing needles, or from mother to child (during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding). HIV destroys certain types of white blood cells, weakening the body’s defenses against infections and cancers. When people are first infected, symptoms of fever, rashes, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue may last a few days to several weeks, and then they may have no symptoms for more than a decade. Blood tests to check for HIV antibody and to measure the amount of HIV virus can confirm the diagnosis. HIV screening tests are available for adults and adolescents, particularly pregnant women, regardless of what their risk appears to be. HIV medications (antiretroviral medications) can stop HIV from reproducing, allow the immune system to strengthen, and thus allow people to live without severe infections or HIV-related cancers. Most untreated people eventually become ill and develop AIDS, defined by the presence of serious infections and cancers.  Infection in Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infections may be caused by one of two retroviruses, HIV-1 or HIV-2. HIV-1 causes most HIV infections worldwide, but HIV-2 causes many HIV infections in West Africa. Infection with another type of retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), is less common but can also cause serious disease. Overview of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) VIDEO What Is a Retrovirus? The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus, which, like many other viruses, stores its genetic information as RNA Transcription and translation Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. When HIV enters a human cell, it releases its RNA, and an enzyme called reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of the HIV RNA. The resulting HIV DNA is integrated into the infected cell’s DNA. This process is the reverse of that used by human cells, which make an RNA copy of DNA. Thus, HIV is called a retrovirus, referring to the reversed (backward) process. Other RNA viruses (such as polio, influenza, or measles), unlike retroviruses, do not make DNA copies after they invade cells. They simply make RNA copies of their original RNA. Each time an HIV-infected cell divides, it makes a new copy of the integrated HIV DNA as well as its own genes. The HIV DNA copy is either Inactive (latent): The virus is present but does no damage. Activated: The virus takes over the functions of the infected cell, causing it to produce and release many new copies of HIV, which then invade other cells. HIV progressively destroys certain types of white blood cells called CD4+ lymphocytes. Thus, when HIV destroys CD4+ lymphocytes, people become susceptible to attack by many other infectious organisms. Many of the complications of HIV infection, including death, usually result from these other infections and not from HIV infection directly. HIV-1 originated in Central Africa during the first half of the 20th century when a closely related chimpanzee virus first infected people. The global spread of HIV-1 began in the late 1970s, and AIDS was first recognized in 1981. In 2021, approximately 38 million people, including 1.7 million children under age 15, were living with HIV infection worldwide two thirds of whom (25.6 million) are in the Sub-Saharan African Region. 650,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1.9 million in 2004 and 1.4 million in 2010. 1.5 million people were newly infected with HIV, of whom approximately 860,000 (57%) were in sub-Saharan Africa. 85% of people living with HIV in 2021 knew their HIV status, and 75% were accessing treatment. Through international efforts, as of 2021, an estimated 28.7 million people living with HIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy (up from 7.8 million in 2010), dramatically reducing deaths and transmission in many countries. In the United States at the end of 2019, an estimated 1,189,700 people aged 13 years or older were estimated to have HIV infection, including an estimated 158,500 (13%) people whose infections had not been diagnosed. In 2020, over 30,600 people received an HIV diagnosis in the United States, and 20,758 cases were due to male-to-male sexual contact. Data for 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance activities. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) AIDS is the most severe form of HIV infection. HIV infection is considered to be AIDS when at least one serious complicating illness develops or the number (count) of CD4+ lymphocytes decreases substantially. When people who are infected with HIV develop certain illnesses, AIDS is diagnosed. These illnesses, called AIDS-defining illnesses, include Serious infections that occur mainly in people with a weakened immune system (called opportunistic infections), including fungal infections (such as cryptococcosis is an infection caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. The species Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the one that causes tuberculosis. The other mycobacteria species that cause disease are discussed here. It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved. Most cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It is caused by human herpesvirus type 8 infection. Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. HIV can appear in nearly any body fluid, but transmission occurs mainly through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. Although tears, urine, and saliva may contain low concentrations of HIV, transmission through these fluids is extremely rare, if it occurs at all. HIV is not transmitted by contact that does not involve exchange of body fluids (such as touching, holding, or dry kissing) or by close, nonsexual contact (such as touching a surface or an object). No case of HIV transmission has been traced to the coughing or sneezing of an infected person or to a mosquito bite. Transmission from an infected doctor or dentist to a patient is extremely rare. HIV is usually transmitted in the following ways: Sexual contact with an infected person, when the mucous membrane lining the mouth, vagina, penis, or rectum is exposed to body fluids such as semen or vaginal fluids that contain HIV, as occurs during unprotected sexual intercourse Injection of contaminated blood, as can occur when needles are shared or a health care worker is accidentally pricked with an HIV-contaminated needle Transfer from an infected mother to a child before birth, during birth, or after birth through the mother’s milk Medical procedures, such as transfusion of blood that contains HIV, procedures done with inadequately sterilized instruments, or transplantation Overview of Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body. During vaginal or anal sex, small cuts may occur in the genitals or surrounding skin, even if the person is not aware that a cut is present. Most HIV infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact, but risk factors vary according to region. For instance, transmission among men who have sex with men is usually the most common way infection occurs in high-resource countries, but people who inject drugs are disproportionally affected in Southern Asia. In areas where heterosexual transmission is dominant, HIV infection follows routes of trade, transportation, and economic migration to cities and spreads secondarily to rural areas. Transmission of HIV through its most common routes—sexual contact or sharing of needles—is almost completely preventable Prevention Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.  No instance of HIV transmission through coughing, sneezing, or a mosquito bite has been documented. Through sexual activity Risk of transmitting HIV is highest during vaginal or anal sex when a condom is not used or is used incorrectly. HIV transmission can also occur during oral sex, although transmission is less likely than during vaginal or anal sex. Risk of HIV infection is increased when semen or vaginal fluids contain a large amount of HIV and/or when there are tears or sores, even small ones, in the skin or membranes lining the genitals, mouth, or rectum. Thus, treatment of HIV infection with these medications can significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission. Sexual activities that can damage the membranes lining the genitals, mouth, or rectum include fisting (inserting most or all of the hand into the rectum or vagina) and using sex toys. Studies show that people with HIV infection who are treated with antiretroviral therapy and have an undetectable viral load (virally suppressed) do not sexually transmit the virus to their partners. Table Through needles or other instruments Health care workers who are accidentally pricked with an HIV-contaminated needle have approximately a 1 in 300 chance of contracting HIV unless they are treated as soon as possible after exposure. Such treatment reduces the chance of infection to less than 1 in 1,500. The risk increases if the needle penetrates deeply or if the needle is hollow and contains HIV-contaminated blood (as with a needle used to draw blood or to inject street drugs) rather than simply being coated with blood (as with a needle used to stitch a cut). Infected fluid splashing into the mouth or eyes has less than a 1 in 1,000 chance of causing infection. From mother to child HIV infection in a large number of women of childbearing age has led to an increase in HIV infection among children Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infection can be transmitted from a mother infected with HIV to her child in the following ways: During pregnancy, to the fetus through the placenta During childbirth, to the baby during passage through the birth canal To the baby after birth through breast milk The overall cumulative risk of transmission from mother to child without antiretroviral medications is 35 to 45%. Treating infected women with antiretroviral medications can significantly reduce the risk of transmission. Women who are pregnant and infected with HIV should be treated during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, during delivery, and during breastfeeding. Doing a cesarean delivery and treating the baby for several weeks after birth also reduce the risk. HIV is excreted in breast milk. Mothers infected with HIV should not breastfeed if they live in areas where formula feeding is safe and affordable. However, in areas where infectious diseases and undernutrition are common causes of infant death and where safe, affordable infant formula is not available, the World Health Organization recommends antiretroviral treatment combined with breastfeeding for at least 12 months. In such cases, the protection provided by breastfeeding from potentially fatal infections may counterbalance the risk of HIV transmission. Because many women with HIV infection and their infants are treated or take medications to prevent HIV infection, the number of children getting AIDS Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Through blood transfusions or organ transplants Currently, HIV infection is rarely transmitted through blood transfusions or organ transplants. Since 1985 in most high-resource countries, all blood collected for transfusion is tested for HIV, and when possible, some blood products are treated with heat to eliminate the risk of HIV infection. The current risk of HIV infection from a single blood transfusion (which is carefully screened for HIV and other bloodborne viruses) is estimated to be less than 1 in about 2 million in the United States. However, in many low-resource countries, blood and blood products are not screened for HIV or are not screened as stringently. There, the risk remains substantial. HIV has been transmitted when organs (kidneys, livers, hearts, pancreases, bone, and skin) from infected donors were unknowingly used as transplants. HIV transmission is unlikely to occur when corneas or certain specially treated tissues (such as bone) are transplanted. Artificial insemination HIV transmission is also possible when sperm from an infected donor is used to inseminate a woman. In the United States, measures have been taken to reduce this risk. Fresh semen samples are no longer used. Sperm from donors is frozen for 6 months or more. Then the donors are retested for HIV infection before the sperm is used. If a sperm donor is known to have HIV infection, washing sperm is an effective way to remove HIV from sperm. Mechanism of HIV Infection Once in the body, HIV attaches to several types of white blood cells. Helper T lymphocytes activate and coordinate other cells of the immune system. On their surface, these lymphocytes have a receptor called CD4, which enables HIV to attach to them. Thus, these helper lymphocytes are designated as CD4+. HIV is a retrovirus What Is a Retrovirus? . That is, it stores its genetic information as ribonucleic acid (RNA Transcription and translation Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. Once inside a CD4+ lymphocyte, the virus uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to make a copy of its RNA, but the copy is made as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. HIV mutates easily at this point because reverse transcriptase is prone to making errors during the conversion of HIV RNA to DNA. These mutations make HIV more difficult to control because the many mutations increase the chance of producing HIV that can resist attacks by the person’s immune system and/or antiretroviral medications. The HIV DNA copy is incorporated into the DNA of the infected lymphocyte. The lymphocyte’s own genetic machinery then reproduces (replicates) the HIV. Eventually, the lymphocyte is destroyed. Each infected lymphocyte produces thousands of new viruses, which infect other lymphocytes and destroy them as well. Within a few days or weeks, the blood and genital fluids contain a very large amount of HIV, and the number of CD4+ lymphocytes may be reduced substantially. Because the amount of HIV in blood and genital fluids is so large so soon after HIV infection, newly infected people transmit HIV to other people very easily. Simplified Life Cycle of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Like all viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reproduces (replicates) using the genetic machinery of the cell it infects, usually a CD4+ lymphocyte. HIV first attaches to and penetrates its target cell. HIV releases RNA, the genetic code of the virus, into the cell. For the virus to replicate, its RNA must be converted to DNA. The RNA is converted by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (produced by HIV). HIV mutates easily at this point because reverse transcriptase is prone to errors during the conversion of viral RNA to DNA. The viral DNA enters the cell’s nucleus. With the help of an enzyme called integrase (also produced by HIV), the viral DNA becomes integrated with the cell’s DNA. The DNA of the infected cell now produces viral RNA as well as proteins that are needed to assemble a new HIV. A new virus is assembled from RNA and short pieces of protein. The virus pushes (buds) through the membrane of the cell, wrapping itself in a fragment of the cell membrane and pinching off from the infected cell. To be able to infect other cells, the budded virus must mature. It becomes mature when another HIV enzyme (HIV protease) cuts structural proteins in the virus, causing them to rearrange. Medications used to treat HIV infection were developed based on the life cycle of HIV. These medications inhibit the three enzymes (reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease) that the virus uses to replicate or to attach to and enter cells. When HIV infection destroys CD4+ lymphocytes, it weakens the body’s immune system, which protects against many infections and cancers. This weakening is part of the reason that the body is unable to eliminate HIV infection once it has started. However, the immune system is able to mount some response. Within a month or two after infection, the body produces lymphocytes and antibodies that help lower the amount of HIV in the blood and keep the infection under control. For this reason, untreated HIV infection may cause no symptoms or only a few mild symptoms for an average of about 10 years (ranging from 2 to more than 15 years). HIV also infects other cells, such as cells in the skin, brain, genital tract, heart, and kidneys, causing disease in those organs. CD4 count The number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood (the CD4 count) helps determine the following: How well the immune system can protect the body from infections How severe the damage done by the HIV is Most healthy people have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,000 cells per microliter of blood. Typically, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is reduced during the first few months of infection. After about 3 to 6 months, the CD4 count stabilizes, but without treatment, it usually continues to decline at rates that vary from slow to rapid. If the CD4 count falls below about 200 cells per microliter of blood, the immune system becomes less able to fight certain infections (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. Most of these infections are rare in healthy people. However, they are common among people with a weakened immune system. Such infections are called opportunistic infections because they take advantage of a weakened immune system. A count below about 50 cells per microliter of blood is particularly dangerous because additional opportunistic infections that can rapidly cause severe weight loss, blindness, or death commonly occur. Viral load represents how quickly HIV is replicating. When people are first infected, the viral load increases rapidly. Then, after about 6 months, even without treatment, it drops to a lower level, which remains constant, called the set point. This level varies widely from person to person—from as little as a few hundred to over a million copies per microliter of blood. Viral load also indicates How contagious the infection is How fast the CD4 count is likely to decrease How fast symptoms are likely to appear The higher the set point of the viral load, the more quickly the CD4 count decreases to the low levels (less than 200) that increase risk of opportunistic infections, even in people without symptoms. During successful treatment, the viral load decreases to very low or undetectable levels (less than about 20 to 40 copies per microliter of blood). However, inactive (latent) HIV is still present within cells, and if treatment is stopped, HIV starts replicating and the viral load increases. An increase in the viral load during treatment may indicate the following: The HIV has developed resistance to antiretroviral treatment. The person is not taking the prescribed medications. Both  Some people are infected with HIV for years before they develop symptoms. Symptoms of HIV Infection Initial infection When initially infected, many people have no noticeable symptoms, but within 1 to 4 weeks, fever, rashes, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and a variety of less common symptoms develop in some people. Symptoms of initial (primary) HIV infection usually last from 3 to 14 days. Interval of mild or no symptoms After the first symptoms disappear, most people, even without treatment, have no symptoms or only occasionally have a few mild symptoms. This interval of few or no symptoms may last from 2 to 15 years. The symptoms that most commonly occur during this interval include the following: Swollen lymph nodes, felt as small, painless lumps in the neck, under the arms, or in the groin White patches in the mouth (thrush Symptoms ) due to candidiasis (a yeast infection) Shingles is a painful skin rash caused by a viral infection that results from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. These symptoms may result from HIV infection or from opportunistic infections that develop because HIV has weakened the immune system. More severe symptoms For some people, the first symptoms are those of AIDS. AIDS is defined as the development of very serious opportunistic infections or cancer—the ones that usually develop only in people with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells per microliter of blood. The specific opportunistic infections and cancers that develop cause many of the symptoms. These infections occur more frequently or are more severe in people with HIV infection than in those without the infection. Serious opportunistic infections may cause various symptoms depending on the organ affected: Lungs: Fever, cough, or shortness of breath Brain: Headache, weakness, loss of coordination, or deterioration of mental function Digestive tract: Pain, diarrhea, or bleeding HIV can also cause symptoms when it directly infects and damages organs such as the following: Brain: Brain damage with memory loss, difficulty thinking and concentrating, or both, eventually resulting in dementia if HIV infection is not treated, as well as weakness, tremor, or difficulty walking Kidneys: Kidney failure with swelling in the legs and face, fatigue, and changes in urination, but often not until the infection is severe Heart: Heart failure with shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and fatigue (uncommon) Genital organs: Decreased levels of sex hormones, which may cause fatigue and sexual dysfunction in men HIV is probably directly responsible for a substantial loss of weight (AIDS wasting) in some people. Wasting in people with AIDS may also be caused by a series of infections or by an untreated, persistent digestive tract infection. Table Cancers common in people with HIV infection Kaposi sarcoma Kaposi Sarcoma Kaposi sarcoma is a skin cancer that causes multiple flat pink, red, or purple patches or bumps on the skin. It occurs mainly in men who have sex with men. Cancers of the immune system (lymphomas, typically non-Hodgkin lymphoma Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a diverse group of cancers of types of white blood cell called lymphocytes. When the brain is affected, these cancers can cause weakness of an arm or a leg, headache, confusion, or personality changes. Having AIDS increases the risk of other cancers. They include cancer of the cervix, anus, testes, and lungs as well as melanoma and other skin cancers. Men who have sex with men are prone to developing cancer of the rectum due to the same human papillomaviruses Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) can be sexually transmitted and causes changes in cells, which can lead to genital warts or to precancer or cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, or throat. Cause of death Usually, death is caused by the cumulative effects of opportunistic infections or cancers, wasting, and/or dementia. Diagnosis of HIV Infection Tests to detect antibodies to the HIV virus in a sample of blood or saliva Tests to detect HIV RNA in a sample of blood Early diagnosis of HIV infection is important because it makes early treatment possible. Early treatment enables infected people to live longer, be healthier, and be less likely to transmit HIV to other people. Doctors usually ask about risk factors for HIV infection Transmission of HIV Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. Doctors also do a complete physical examination to check for signs of opportunistic infections, such as swollen lymph nodes and white patches inside the mouth (indicating thrush), and for signs of Kaposi sarcoma of the skin or mouth. Screening and diagnostic tests If doctors suspect exposure to HIV infection, they do a screening test for HIV. Doctors also offer a screening test to all adults and adolescents, particularly pregnant women, regardless of what their risk appears to be. Anyone who is concerned about being infected with HIV can request to be tested. Such testing is confidential and often free of charge. Antigens are foreign substances that can trigger an immune response. The body takes several weeks to produce enough antibodies to be detected by the test, so results of the antibody test are negative during the first few weeks after the virus enters the body (known as the \"window period\" of acute HIV infection). However, results of the p24 antigen test can be positive as early as 2 weeks after the initial infection. The combination tests can be done quickly by a laboratory. Also, a version of these tests can be done in a doctor's office or clinic (called bedside testing). If results are positive, doctors do a test to distinguish HIV-1 from HIV-2 and a test to detect the amount of HIV RNA in the blood (the viral load). The combination screening test is quicker and less complex than older screening tests, which use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect HIV antibodies and then confirm positive results using a separate, more accurate, specific test such as the Western blot test. Other, older rapid bedside tests are also available. These tests can be done using a sample of blood or saliva. If results of these rapid screening tests are positive, they are confirmed by ELISA (with or without Western blot) or by repetition of one or more other rapid tests. If people at low risk have a negative test result, the screening test is not repeated unless their risk status changes. If people at the highest risk have a negative test result (especially if they are sexually active, have several sex partners, or do not practice safer sex), testing should be repeated every 6 to 12 months. HIV RNA tests can confirm positive results of an antibody test or detect evidence of HIV infection when antibody test results are negative. HIV RNA tests often use techniques to produce many copies of an organism's genetic material (called nucleic acid amplification). These tests can detect very small amounts of HIV RNA in blood and are very accurate. Monitoring If HIV infection is diagnosed, blood tests should be done regularly to measure the following: CD4 count Viral load If the CD4 count is low, people are more likely to develop serious infections and other complications of HIV such as certain cancers. Viral load helps predict how fast the CD4 count is likely to decrease over the next few years. These two measurements help doctors determine How soon to start antiretroviral medications What effects treatment is likely to have Whether other medications may be needed to prevent complicating infections With successful treatment, the viral load falls to very low levels within weeks, and the CD4 count begins a slow recovery toward normal levels. Diagnosis of AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 count falls below 200 cells per microliter of blood or when extreme wasting or certain serious opportunistic infections or cancers develop. Diagnosis of HIV-related conditions Various tests may be done to check for conditions that can accompany HIV infection. Treatment with antiretroviral medications is recommended for all people with HIV infection because without treatment, HIV infection can lead to serious complications and because newer, less toxic medications have been developed. For most people, early treatment has the best results. Research has shown that people who are promptly treated with antiretroviral medications are less likely to develop AIDS-related complications and to die of them. Treatment cannot eliminate the virus from the body, although the HIV level often decreases so much that it cannot be detected in blood or other fluids or tissues. The goals of treatment are Reducing HIV level to undetectable Restoring CD4 count to normal If treatment is stopped, the HIV level increases, and the CD4 count begins to fall. Thus, people need to take antiretroviral medications for their lifetime. Before starting a treatment regimen, people are taught about the necessity of the following: Taking medications as directed Not skipping any doses Taking the medications for the rest of their life Taking the medications as directed for a life time is demanding. Some people skip doses or stop taking the medications for a time (called a drug holiday). These practices are dangerous because they enable HIV to develop resistance to the medications. Because taking HIV medications irregularly often leads to drug resistance, health care practitioners try to make sure that people are both willing and able to adhere to the treatment regimen. To simplify the medication schedule and to help people take the medications as directed, doctors often prescribe treatment that combines two or more medications in one tablet that can be taken only once a day. Immunization People with HIV infection should have the following vaccinations (for more information, see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] immunization recommendations): Conjugate pneumococcal vaccine Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). Two types of influenza virus, type A and type B, regularly cause seasonal epidemics of influenza in the United States. Typically, hepatitis A is less serious than hepatitis B. People who have completed a primary series but have not previously received the Tdap, should receive Tdap for their next Td booster. Recombinant herpes zoster vaccine Shingles Vaccine There are two herpes zoster (shingles) vaccines. The newer herpes zoster vaccine is preferred over the older herpes zoster vaccine because it provides better and longer-lasting protection. Moreover, many people who are treated with antiretroviral medications can manage HIV infection as a chronic illness, without developing AIDS. With effective treatment, the HIV RNA level decreases to undetectable levels, CD4 counts increase significantly, and people can continue to lead productive, active lives. The risk of illness and death decreases but remains higher than that of people who are of similar age and who are not infected with HIV. However, if people cannot tolerate or take medications consistently, HIV infection and immune deficiency progresses, causing serious symptoms and complications. Many untreated people with HIV infection remain well for more than a decade. A very few untreated people have remained well for over 20 years. Why some people become ill so much sooner than others is not fully understood, but a number of genetic factors appear to influence both susceptibility to infection and progression to AIDS after infection. If infected people are not treated, AIDS develops in most of them. How quickly the number of CD4 cells decreases and HIV infection progresses toward AIDS varies greatly from person to person. Generally, experts estimate that if untreated, people develop AIDS at the following rates: For the first several years after infection: 1 to 2% each year Each year thereafter: 5 to 6% Within 10 to 11 years: 50% Eventually: More than 95%, possibly all if they live long enough Usually, HIV infection does not directly cause death. Instead, HIV infection leads to a substantial loss of weight (wasting), opportunistic infections, cancers, and other disorders, which then lead to death. Cure has been thought to be impossible, although intensive research on how to eliminate all of the latent HIV from infected people continues. End-of-Life Issues Because death rarely occurs suddenly in people with AIDS, people usually have time to make plans for the kind of their health care they want if their condition worsens. Nonetheless, people should record such plans in a legal document early and should include clear instructions about the kind of care they want (called advance directives Advance Directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions. Near the end of life, many people have pain and other distressing symptoms (such as agitation) and usually lose their appetite. In high-income countries, hospice programs Hospice Care Hospice is a concept and a program of care that is specifically designed to minimize suffering for dying people and their family members. They can provide comprehensive support and care, which focuses on managing symptoms, helping dying people maintain their independence, and supporting their caregivers. Prevention of HIV Infection At present, there is no effective HIV vaccine to prevent HIV infection or slow the progression of AIDS in people who are already infected. However, treating people who have HIV infection reduces the risk of their transmitting the infection to other people. Transmission of HIV through its most common routes—sexual contact or sharing of needles—is almost completely preventable. Many people have difficulty changing their addictive or sexual behaviors, so they continue to put themselves at risk of HIV infection. Also, safer sex practices are not foolproof. For example, condoms can leak or break. Strategies for Preventing the Transmission of HIV Abstain from sexual activity. Use a latex condom for each act of intercourse with an infected partner or a partner whose HIV status is unknown (vaginal spermicides and sponges do not protect against HIV infection). For men engaging in oral sex, withdraw before ejaculation. For men, get circumcised (circumcision reduces a man's risk of being infected with HIV during vaginal sex with an infected woman). For newly monogamous couples, get tested for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) before engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse. Never share needles or syringes. Wear rubber gloves (preferably latex) when touching body fluids of another person. If accidentally exposed to fluids containing HIV (for example, after a needlestick), seek treatment with antiretroviral medications to prevent infection. Condoms made of latex provide good protection against HIV (as well as other common sexually transmitted infections), but they are not foolproof. Oil-based lubricants (such as petroleum jelly) should not be used because they may dissolve latex, reducing the condom's effectiveness. Other measures can help. For men, circumcision, an inexpensive, safe procedure, reduces the risk of becoming infected during vaginal intercourse with an infected woman by about half. Whether circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection in other circumstances is unclear. Because circumcision provides only partial protection against HIV infection, people should also use other measures to prevent HIV infection. For example, if either partner has a sexually transmitted infection or HIV infection, it should be treated, and condoms should be used correctly and consistently. Universal precautions People who are likely to come into contact with blood or other body fluids at their job should wear protective latex gloves, masks, and eye shields. These precautions apply to body fluids from all people, not just those from people with HIV, and are thus called universal precautions. Universal precautions are taken for two reasons: People with HIV may not know that they are infected. Viruses that cause other serious disorders (such as hepatitis B and C) can be transmitted by body fluids. Surfaces contaminated with HIV can easily be cleaned and disinfected because HIV is inactivated by heat and by common disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide and alcohol. Because HIV is not transmitted through the air or by casual contact (such as touching, holding, or dry kissing), hospitals and clinics do not isolate people with HIV infection unless they have another contagious infection. Preventing transmission by blood transfusions and organ transplants In the United States, the following have almost eliminated transmission of HIV infection by organ transplantation or blood transfusion: Screening donors of organs or blood for risk factors for HIV infection Screening donated blood for HIV Risk is reduced further by asking people with risk factors for HIV infection, regardless of their test results for HIV, not to donate blood or organs for transplantation. However, low-resource countries have not consistently used sensitive HIV screening tests and have not restricted donors. Consequently, transmission by these routes is still a problem in these countries. Preventing transmission from mother to newborn Pregnant women infected with HIV can transmit the virus to the newborn. The following can help prevent HIV transmission from mother to newborn Prevention of transmission for infected mothers Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Such preventive treatment is called preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, PrEP is expensive and is effective only if people take the medication every day. Thus, PrEP is recommended only for people who have a very high risk of becoming infected, such as people who have a partner who is infected with HIV, people who have sexual behaviors that place them at substantial risk of HIV infection, and people who inject drugs and have injection practices that place them at substantial risk of HIV infection. PrEP may also be recommended for people who engage in high-risk sexual activities, such as the following: Men who have anal sex with men without using a condom Heterosexual men and women who do not regularly use condoms during sex with partners whose HIV status is unknown and who are at increased risk of HIV infection People who use PrEP still need to use other methods to prevent HIV infection, including consistent use of condoms and not sharing needles to inject drugs. Preventive treatment after exposure People who have been exposed to HIV from a blood splash, needlestick, or sexual contact may reduce the chance of infection by taking antiretroviral medications for 4 weeks. These medications are more effective when they are started as soon as possible after the exposure. Taking two or more medications is currently recommended. Doctors and the person who was exposed typically decide together whether to use these preventive medications. They base the decision on the estimated risk of infection and the possible side effects of the medications. If they do not know whether the source is infected with HIV, they consider how likely the source is to be infected. However, even when the source of the exposure is known to be infected with HIV, the risk of infection after exposure varies, depending on the type of exposure. For example, risk from a blood splash is less than that from a needlestick. Immediately after exposure to HIV infection, what is done depends on the type of exposure: If skin is exposed, it is cleaned with soap and water. Puncture wounds are cleaned with antiseptic. If mucous membranes are exposed, they are flushed with large amounts of water.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "19a03844-3841-4daf-be02-3cb4e1a32d9b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Hypolipidemia is a decrease in plasma lipoprotein caused by primary (genetic) or secondary factors. It is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on routine lipid screening. Treatment of secondary hypolipidemia involves treating underlying disorders. Treatment of primary hypolipidemia is often unnecessary, but patients with some genetic disorders require high-dose vitamin E and dietary supplementation of fats and other fat-soluble vitamins.  Hypolipidemia is defined as a total cholesterol (TC) < 120 mg/dL (< 3.1 mmol/L) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol < 50 mg/dL (< 1.3 mmol/L). Causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary. Secondary causes are far more common than primary causes and include all of the following: Chronic infections (including hepatitis C infection Hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis C is a common cause of chronic hepatitis. It is often asymptomatic until manifestations of chronic liver disease occur.Hematologic and other cancers Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones.Malabsorption Overview of Malabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport.Undernutrition Overview of Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition.The unexpected finding of low cholesterol or low LDL cholesterol in a patient not taking a lipid-lowering drug should prompt a diagnostic evaluation, including measurements of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and thyroid-stimulating hormone; a negative evaluation suggests a possible primary cause. There are 3 primary disorders in which single or multiple genetic mutations result in underproduction or increased clearance of LDL. Abetalipoproteinemia Chylomicron retention disease Hypobetalipoproteinemia Loss of function mutations of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin type 9) are another cause of low LDL levels. There are no adverse consequences and no treatment, Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) This autosomal recessive condition is caused by mutations in the gene for microsomal triglyceride (TG) transfer protein, a protein critical to chylomicron and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) formation. Dietary fat cannot be absorbed, and lipoproteins in both metabolic pathways are virtually absent from serum; total cholesterol is typically < 45 mg/dL (< 1.16 mmol/L), TGs are < 20 mg/dL (< 0.23 mmol/L), and LDL is undetectable. The condition is often first noticed in infants with fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive. Intellectual disability may result. Because vitamin E is distributed to peripheral tissues via VLDL and LDL, most affected people eventually develop severe vitamin E deficiency Vitamin E Deficiency Dietary vitamin E deficiency is common in countries with high rates of food insecurity; deficiency among adults in other countries is uncommon and usually due to fat malabsorption. Symptoms and signs include visual changes due to slow retinal degeneration, sensory neuropathy, posterior column signs of ataxia and paresthesias, and cerebellar signs of dysmetria, ataxia, and spasticity, which can eventually lead to death. Diagnosis is made by the absence of apoprotein B (apo B) in plasma; intestinal biopsies show lack of microsomal transfer protein. Red blood cell acanthocytosis is a distinguishing feature on blood smear. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with high doses (100 to 300 mg/kg once a day) of vitamin E with supplementation of dietary fat and other fat-soluble vitamins. The prognosis is often poor. Chylomicron retention disease (Anderson disease) Chylomicron retention disease is a very rare autosomal recessive condition caused by deficient apo B secretion from enterocytes. Mutations in a gene encoding a protein important in transport of chylomicrons through enterocytes have been linked to this disorder. Affected infants have fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, and failure to thrive and may develop neurologic disorders similar to those in abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) Hypolipidemia is a decrease in plasma lipoprotein caused by primary (genetic) or secondary factors. Diagnosis is by intestinal biopsy of patients with low cholesterol levels and absence of postprandial chylomicrons. Treatment is supplementation of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Early treatment with high dose vitamin E may improve the prognosis. Hypobetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal dominant or codominant condition caused by mutations in the gene coding for apo B. Heterozygous patients have truncated apo B, leading to rapid LDL clearance. Heterozygous patients manifest no symptoms or signs except for TC < 120 mg/dL (< 3.1 mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol < 80 mg/dL (< 2.1 mmol/L). Triglycerides are normal. Some patients may have hepatic steatosis Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol consumption is high in most Western countries. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), 8. Homozygous patients have either shorter truncations, leading to lower lipid levels (TC < 80 mg/dL [< 2.1 mmol/L], LDL cholesterol < 20 mg/dL [< 0.52 mmol/L]), or absent apo B synthesis, leading to symptoms and signs of abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) Hypolipidemia is a decrease in plasma lipoprotein caused by primary (genetic) or secondary factors. Diagnosis is by finding low levels of LDL cholesterol and apo B on a serum lipid profile. Hypobetalipoproteinemia and abetalipoproteinemia are distinguished from one another by family history.

You might notice a breast lump by chance or during a breast exam. The Breasts VIDEO Breast lumps are common Most lumps aren’t cancer Breast lumps may be painful or painless Lumps may feel smooth, round, and movable or lumpy and thick What causes breast lumps? Cancer isn't the most common cause of breast lumps. The most common causes of breast lumps are: Fibroadenomas, which are small, smooth, movable, painless round lumps that usually happen in women who are at an age to have children Fibrocystic changes Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast Fibrocystic changes are a set of breast symptoms that include pain, cysts, and general lumpiness in your breasts. The word fibrocystic comes from the terms fibrous tissue and cyst.Less common causes of breast lumps are: Breast infection A clogged milk gland after you stop breastfeeding Breast cancer Breast Cancer is when cells grow abnormally. Cancer cells don't look or work like normal cells and keep multiplying out of control. Cancer cells can invade and destroy nearby healthy tissue.When should I go to the doctor for a breast lump? Go to a doctor within 1 to 2 days if you have a breast lump and: Redness, swelling, and pain Pus leaking out Go to a doctor within 7 days if you have a breast lump and: The lump won’t move around (it feels stuck to your skin or chest) The lump feels very hard and uneven Swollen lymph nodes in your armpit that won’t move Dimpling of your skin near the lump that looks like the skin of an orange What will happen at my doctor visit? Doctors will ask you questions about your symptoms and health. They’ll do an exam, including a breast exam Breast examination Breast disorders may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Most are noncancerous and not life threatening. Often, they do not require treatment. To tell if your breast lump is cancer, doctors often do more tests, such as: Ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body. Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays)Mammogram Mammography Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.Depending on your symptoms and the results of these tests, your doctor may: Put a needle in the lump and take out fluid or a sample of tissue Make a cut in the skin to take out part of the lump and look at it under a microscope (biopsy) How do doctors treat breast lumps?

{"seq_id": "ec2f70e7-07bd-4508-bc95-065515662a30", "title": null, "text": "【0】Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary; formerly, essential, hypertension) is most common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually due to primary aldosteronism. Sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, obesity, or renal artery stenosis are other causes of secondary hypertension. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-standing. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess organ damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or taking medication for hypertension. Nearly half of adults in the United States have hypertension. Many of these people are not aware that they have hypertension. About 80% of adults with hypertension have been recommended treatment with medication and lifestyle modification, but only about 50% with hypertension receive treatment (1 General references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Only about 1 in 5 adults with hypertension have their blood pressure (BP) under control. Even with medication and lifestyle modification only 26% of patients have their blood pressure under control, and of treated adults whose BP is not under control, almost 60% have a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (1 General references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. High blood pressure is more common in non-Hispanic Black adults (56%) than in non-Hispanic White adults (48%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (46%), or Hispanic adults (39%— 2 General references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Among those recommended to take blood pressure medication, blood pressure control is higher among non-Hispanic White adults (32%) than in non-Hispanic Black adults (25%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (19%), or Hispanic adults (25%— 1 General references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Blood pressure increases with age. About two thirds of people > 65 have hypertension, and people with a normal BP at age 55 have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension. Because hypertension becomes so common with age, the age-related increase in BP may seem innocuous, but higher BP increases morbidity and mortality risk.Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. BP in adults is classified as normal, elevated BP, stage 1 (mild) or stage 2 hypertension General references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Etiology of Hypertension may be Primary (no specific cause—85% of cases) Secondary (an identified cause) Primary hypertension Hemodynamics and physiologic components (eg, plasma volume, activity of the renin-angiotensin system) vary, indicating that primary hypertension is unlikely to have a single cause. Even if one factor is initially responsible, multiple factors are probably involved in sustaining elevated blood pressure (the mosaic theory). In afferent systemic arterioles, malfunction of ion pumps on sarcolemmal membranes of smooth muscle cells may lead to chronically increased vascular tone. Heredity is a predisposing factor, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Environmental factors (eg, dietary sodium, stress) seem to affect only genetically susceptible people at younger ages; however, in patients > 65, high sodium intake is more likely to precipitate hypertension. Secondary hypertension Common causes include Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2Primary aldosteronism Primary Aldosteronism Primary aldosteronism is aldosteronism caused by autonomous production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (due to hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma)Etiology references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Renal parenchymal disease (eg, chronic glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis Chronic Pyelonephritis Chronic pyelonephritis is continuing pyogenic infection of the kidney that occurs almost exclusively in patients with major anatomic abnormalities.Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy)Renovascular disease Renovascular Hypertension Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing.Other, much rarer, causes include pheochromocytoma A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of chromaffin cells typically located in the adrenals. It causes persistent or paroxysmal hypertension.Cushing syndrome Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.Overview of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders, each characterized by inadequate synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both.Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones.Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.Hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive, causing elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone and leading to hypercalcemia.Gigantism and Acromegaly Gigantism and acromegaly are syndromes of excessive secretion of growth hormone (hypersomatotropism) that are nearly always due to a pituitary adenoma. Excessive alcohol intake and use of oral contraceptives are common causes of curable hypertension. Use of sympathomimetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, cocaine, or licorice commonly contributes to worsening of blood pressure control. Although hypertension is common in patients with diabetes, diabetes is not considered a cause. Hypertension is defined as resistant when BP remains above goal despite use of 3 different antihypertensive medications at maximally tolerated doses. Patients with resistant hypertension have higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (2 Etiology references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Pathophysiology of Hypertension Because blood pressure equals cardiac output (CO) × total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), pathogenic mechanisms involve Increased CO Increased TPR Both In most patients, CO is normal or slightly increased, and TPR is increased. This pattern is typical of primary hypertension and hypertension due to primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, renovascular disease, and renal parenchymal disease. In other patients, CO is increased (possibly because of venoconstriction in large veins), and TPR is inappropriately normal for the level of CO. Later in the disorder, TPR increases and CO returns to normal, probably because of autoregulation. Some disorders that increase CO (thyrotoxicosis, arteriovenous fistula, aortic regurgitation), particularly when stroke volume is increased, cause isolated systolic hypertension. Some older patients have isolated systolic hypertension with normal or low CO, probably due to inelasticity of the aorta and its major branches. Patients with high, fixed diastolic pressures often have decreased CO. Plasma volume tends to decrease as BP increases; rarely, plasma volume remains normal or increases. Plasma volume tends to be high in hypertension due to primary aldosteronism or renal parenchymal disease and may be quite low in hypertension due to pheochromocytoma. Renal blood flow gradually decreases as diastolic BP increases and arteriolar sclerosis begins. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remains normal until late in the disorder; as a result, the filtration fraction is increased. Coronary, cerebral, and muscle blood flow is maintained unless severe atherosclerosis coexists in these vascular beds. Abnormal sodium transport In many cases of hypertension, sodium transport across the cell wall is abnormal, because the sodium-potassium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase) is defective or inhibited or because permeability to sodium ions is increased. The result is increased intracellular sodium, which makes the cell more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation. Calcium follows sodium, so accumulation of intracellular calcium may be responsible for the increased sensitivity. Because Na+, K+-ATPase may pump norepinephrine back into sympathetic neurons (thus inactivating this neurotransmitter), inhibition of this mechanism could also enhance the effect of norepinephrine, increasing BP. Defects in sodium transport may occur in normotensive children of hypertensive parents. Sympathetic nervous system Sympathetic stimulation increases blood pressure, usually more in patients with elevated BP and hypertension than in normotensive patients. Whether this hyperresponsiveness resides in the sympathetic nervous system or in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle is unknown. A high resting pulse rate, which may result from increased sympathetic nervous activity, is a well-known predictor of hypertension. In some hypertensive patients, circulating plasma catecholamine levels during rest are higher than normal. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system helps regulate blood volume and therefore blood pressure. Renin, an enzyme formed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, catalyzes conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This inactive product is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), mainly in the lungs but also in the kidneys and brain, to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates autonomic centers in the brain to increase sympathetic discharge and stimulates release of aldosterone and vasopressin. Aldosterone and vasopressin cause sodium and water retention, elevating BP. Aldosterone also enhances potassium excretion; low plasma potassium (< 3.5 mEq/L [< 3.5 mmol/L]) increases vasoconstriction through closure of potassium channels. Angiotensin III, present in the circulation, stimulates aldosterone release as actively as angiotensin II but has much less pressor activity. Because chymase enzymes also convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, medications that inhibit ACE do not fully suppress angiotensin II production. Renin secretion is controlled by at least 4 mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive: A renal vascular receptor responds to changes in tension in the afferent arteriolar wall A macula densa receptor detects changes in the delivery rate or concentration of sodium chloride in the distal tubule Circulating angiotensin has a negative feedback effect on renin secretion Sympathetic nervous system stimulates renin secretion mediated by beta-receptors (via the renal nerve) Angiotensin is generally acknowledged to be responsible for renovascular hypertension Renovascular Hypertension Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing. However, in patients with African ancestry and older patients with hypertension, renin levels tend to be low. Older patients also tend to have low angiotensin II levels. Hypertension due to chronic renal parenchymal disease (renoprival hypertension) results from the combination of a renin-dependent mechanism and a volume-dependent mechanism. In most cases, increased renin activity is not evident in peripheral blood. Hypertension is typically moderate and sensitive to sodium and water balance. Vasodilator deficiency of a vasodilator (eg, bradykinin, nitric oxide) rather than excess of a vasoconstrictor (eg, angiotensin, norepinephrine) may cause hypertension. Reductions in nitric oxide occur with aging, and this reduction contributes to salt sensitivity (ie, lesser amounts of salt ingestion will raise BP higher compared to younger people— 1 Pathophysiology reference Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Reduction in nitric oxide due to stiff arteries is linked to salt-sensitive hypertension, an inordinate increase of > 10 to 20 mm Hg systolic BP after a large sodium load (eg, a salty meal). If the kidneys do not produce adequate amounts of vasodilators (because of renal parenchymal disease or bilateral nephrectomy), blood pressure can increase. Vasodilators and vasoconstrictors (mainly endothelin) are also produced in endothelial cells. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction greatly affects blood pressure. Pathology and complications No pathologic changes occur early in hypertension. Severe or prolonged hypertension damages target organs (primarily the cardiovascular system, brain, and kidneys), increasing risk of Coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.CAD) and myocardial infarction Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.MI) Heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Renal failure Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Death The mechanism involves development of generalized arteriolosclerosis Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries. Arteriolosclerosis is characterized by medial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and hyalinization; it is particularly apparent in small arterioles, notably in the eyes and the kidneys. In the kidneys, the changes narrow the arteriolar lumen, increasing TPR; thus, hypertension leads to more hypertension. Furthermore, once arteries are narrowed, any slight additional shortening of already hypertrophied smooth muscle reduces the lumen to a greater extent than in normal-diameter arteries. These effects may explain why the longer hypertension has existed, the less likely specific treatment (eg, renovascular surgery) for secondary causes is to restore blood pressure to normal. Because of increased afterload, the left ventricle gradually hypertrophies, causing diastolic dysfunction. The ventricle eventually dilates, causing dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure due to systolic dysfunction often worsened by arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease. Thoracic aortic dissection is typically a consequence of hypertension; almost all patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have hypertension. Pathophysiology reference 1.

Circulation 101:856–861, 2000. Symptoms and Signs of Hypertension is usually asymptomatic until complications develop in target organs. Dizziness, facial flushing, headache, fatigue, epistaxis, and nervousness are not caused by uncomplicated hypertension. Severe hypertension (hypertensive emergencies Hypertensive Emergencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys). A 4th heart sound is one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease. Retinal changes may include arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhages, exudates, and, in patients with encephalopathy, papilledema (hypertensive retinopathy Hypertensive Retinopathy Hypertensive retinopathy is retinal vascular damage caused by hypertension. Signs usually develop late in the disease. Changes are classified (according to the Keith, Wagener, and Barker classification) into 4 groups with increasingly worse prognosis: Grade 1: Constriction of arterioles only Grade 2: Constriction and sclerosis of arterioles Grade 3: Hemorrhages and exudates in addition to vascular changes Grade 4: Papilledema Diagnosis of Hypertension Multiple measurements of BP to confirm Testing to diagnose causes and complications Hypertension is diagnosed by sphygmomanometry. History, physical examination, and other tests help identify etiology and determine whether target organs are damaged. Blood pressure measurement The blood pressure used for formal diagnosis should be an average of 2 or 3 measurements taken at 2 or 3 different times with the patient: Seated in a chair (not examination table) for > 5 minutes, feet on floor, back supported With their limb supported at heart level with no clothing covering the area of cuff placement Having had no exercise, caffeine, or smoking for at least 30 minutes At the first visit, measure BP in both arms and subsequent measurements should use the arm that gave the higher reading. A properly sized BP cuff is applied to the upper arm. An appropriately sized cuff covers two thirds of the biceps; the bladder is long enough to encircle > 80% of the arm, and bladder width equals at least 40% of the arm’s circumference. Thus, obese patients require large cuffs. The health care practitioner inflates the cuff above the expected systolic pressure and gradually releases the air while listening over the brachial artery. The pressure at which the first heartbeat is heard as the pressure falls is systolic BP. Total disappearance of the sound marks diastolic BP. The same principles are followed to measure BP in a forearm (radial artery) and thigh (popliteal artery). Mechanical devices should be calibrated periodically; automated readers are often inaccurate (1 Diagnosis references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. BP is measured in both arms because BP that is > 15 mm Hg higher in one arm than the other requires evaluation of the upper vasculature.BP is significantly lower in the legs. If BP is in the stage 1 hypertensive range or is markedly labile, more BP measurements are desirable. BP measurements may be sporadically high before hypertension becomes sustained; this phenomenon probably accounts for “white coat hypertension,” in which BP is elevated when measured in the physician’s office but normal when measured at home or by ambulatory BP monitoring. In addition, ambulatory BP monitoring also may be indicated when \"masked hypertension\" (a condition in which BP measured at home is higher than values obtained in the clinician's office) is suspected, typically in patients who demonstrate sequelae of hypertension without evidence of hypertension according to in-office measurements. Anxiety is by far the most common cause of hypertensive urgency Hypertensive urgencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys). Moreover, referral to a psychologist or use of an anxiety alleviating medication to aid in managing the anxiety has proven helpful in many cases to reduce the frequency of hypertensive urgency (2 Diagnosis references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. History The history includes the known duration of hypertension and previously recorded BP levels; any history or symptoms of coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Peripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia.Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Gout is a disorder caused by hyperuricemia (serum urate > 6.8 mg/dL [> 0. Social history includes exercise levels and use of tobacco, alcohol, and stimulant drugs (prescribed and illicit). A dietary history focuses on intake of salt and stimulants (eg, tea, coffee, caffeine-containing sodas, energy drinks). Physical examination The physical examination includes measurement of height, weight, and waist circumference; funduscopic examination for retinopathy Symptoms and Signs Hypertensive retinopathy is retinal vascular damage caused by hypertension. The abdomen is palpated for kidney enlargement and abdominal masses. Peripheral arterial pulses are evaluated; diminished or delayed femoral pulses suggest aortic coarctation, particularly in patients < 30. A unilateral renal artery bruit may be heard in slim patients with renovascular hypertension Renovascular Hypertension Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. Testing After hypertension is diagnosed based on blood pressure measurements, testing is needed to Detect target-organ damage Identify cardiovascular risk factors The more severe the hypertension and the younger the patient, the more extensive is the evaluation. Tests may include Urinalysis and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio; if abnormal, consider renal ultrasonography Blood tests, including fasting lipids, creatinine, potassium ECG Sometimes measure thyroid-stimulating hormone levels Sometimes measure plasma free metanephrines (to detect pheochromocytoma) Sometimes a sleep study Depending on results of the examination and initial tests, other tests may be needed. Renal ultrasonography to evaluate kidney size may provide useful information if urinalysis detects albuminuria (proteinuria), cylindruria, or microhematuria, or if serum creatinine is elevated (≥ 1.4 mg/dL [≥ 124 micromole/L] in men; ≥ 1.2 mg/dL [≥ 106 micromole/L] in women). Patients with hypokalemia unrelated to diuretic use are evaluated for primary aldosteronism Primary Aldosteronism Primary aldosteronism is aldosteronism caused by autonomous production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (due to hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma). Primary aldosteronism was previously thought to be present in only about 1% of patients with resistant hypertension. Studies have shown that about 10 to 20% of patients with resistant hypertension have primary aldosteronism as the cause (3–5 Diagnosis references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. On ECG, a broad, notched P-wave indicates atrial hypertrophy and, although nonspecific, may be one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease. Elevated QRS voltage with or without evidence of ischemia, may occur later and indicates left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). When LVH is seen on ECG, echocardiography is often done.CT, or MRI helps confirm the diagnosis. Patients with labile, significantly elevated BP and symptoms such as headache, palpitations, tachycardia, excessive perspiration, tremor, and pallor are screened for pheochromocytoma Diagnosis A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of chromaffin cells typically located in the adrenals. It causes persistent or paroxysmal hypertension. A sleep study should also be strongly considered in these patients and in those whose history suggests sleep apnea. Patients with symptoms suggesting Cushing syndrome Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia.Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones.Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.Gigantism and Acromegaly Gigantism and acromegaly are syndromes of excessive secretion of growth hormone (hypersomatotropism) that are nearly always due to a pituitary adenoma.CNS) disorders are evaluated. Prognosis for Hypertension The higher the blood pressure and the more severe the retinal changes and other evidence of target-organ involvement, the worse the prognosis. Systolic BP predicts fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events better than diastolic BP. Without treatment, 1-year survival is < 10% in patients with retinal sclerosis, cotton-wool exudates, arteriolar narrowing, and hemorrhage (grade 3 retinopathy), and < 5% in patients with the same changes plus papilledema (grade 4 retinopathy). Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of death among treated patients. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is a common consequence of inadequately treated hypertension. However, effective control of hypertension prevents most complications and prolongs life. Treatment of Hypertension Weight loss and exercise Smoking cessation Diet: Increased fruits and vegetables, decreased salt, limited alcohol Medications: Depending on BP and presence of cardiovascular disease or risk factors Primary hypertension has no cure, but some causes of secondary hypertension can be corrected. In all cases, control of blood pressure can significantly limit adverse consequences. Despite the theoretical efficacy of treatment, BP is lowered to the desired level in only one fifth of hypertensive people in the US. Treatment targets for the general population, including patients with a kidney disorder or diabetes: BP < 130/80 mm Hg regardless of age up to age 80 Lowering BP below 130/80 mm Hg appears to continue to reduce the risk of vascular complications. However, it also increases the risk of adverse drug effects. Thus, the benefits of lowering BP to levels approaching 120 mm Hg systolic should be weighed against the higher risk of dizziness and light-headedness and possible worsening of kidney function. This is a particular concern among patients with diabetes, in whom BP < 120 mm Hg systolic or a diastolic BP approaching 60 mm Hg increases risk of these adverse events. Even older patients, including frail older patients, can tolerate a diastolic BP as low as 60 to 65 mm Hg well and without an increase in cardiovascular events. Ideally, patients or family members measure BP at home, provided they have been trained to do so, they are closely monitored, and the sphygmomanometer is regularly calibrated. Treatment of hypertension during pregnancy Treatment require careful medication selection because some antihypertensive medications can harm the fetus. Lifestyle modifications Lifestyle modifications are recommended for all patients with elevated BP or any stage hypertension  Nonpharmacological Interventions in 2017 Hypertension Guidelines ). The best proven nonpharmacologic interventions for prevention and treatment of hypertension include the following: Increased physical activity with a structured exercise program Weight loss if overweight or obese Healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced saturated and total fat content Reduced dietary sodium to < 1500 mg/day (< 3.75 g sodium chloride) optimally, but at least a 1000 mg/day reduction Enhanced dietary potassium intake, unless contraindicated due to chronic kidney disease or use of medications that reduce potassium excretion Moderation in alcohol intake in those who drink alcohol to ≤ 2 drinks daily for men and ≤ 1 drink daily for women (one drink is about 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) Smoking cessation Smoking Cessation Most smokers want to quit and have tried doing so with limited success.Dietary modifications can also help control diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Patients with uncomplicated hypertension do not need to restrict their activities as long as blood pressure is controlled The decision to treat with medication is based on the BP level and the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or its risk factors . The presence of diabetes or kidney disease is not factored in separately because these diseases are part of ASCVD risk assessment. An important part of management is continued reassessment. If patients are not at target BP, clinicians should strive to optimize adherence before switching or adding medications. Table Medication selection is based on several factors. When one medication is given initially, for patients who do not have African ancestry, including those with diabetes, initial treatment may be with either an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone or indapamide). For patients with African ancestry, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic is recommended initially unless patients also have stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease. In patients with African ancestry and stage 3 chronic kidney disease, an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker is appropriate. When 2 medications are given initially, a single-pill combination with either an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and either a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Signs of hypertensive emergencies Hypertensive Emergencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys). Some antihypertensives are contraindicated in certain disorders (eg, beta-blockers in asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction.Angina Pectoris Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction.Initial Choice of Antihypertensive Drug Class Initial Choice of Antihypertensive Drug Class and Antihypertensives for Patients With Co-existing Conditions Antihypertensives for Patients With Co-existing Conditions ). If the target BP is not achieved within 1 month, assess adherence and reinforce the importance of following treatment. If patients are adherent, the dose of the initial medication can be increased or a second medication added (selected from among the medications recommended for initial treatment). Note that an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker should not be used together. Therapy is titrated frequently. If target BP cannot be achieved with 2 medications, a third medication from the initial group is added. If such a third medication is not available (eg, for patients with African ancestry) or tolerated, a medication from another class (eg, beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist) can be used. Patients with such difficult to control BP may benefit from consultation with a hypertension specialist. Table If initial systolic BP is > 160 mm Hg, 2 medications should be initiated regardless of lifestyle. An appropriate combination and dose are determined; many combinations are available as single tablets, which make adherence easier and are preferred. For resistant hypertension (BP remains above goal despite use of 3 different antihypertensive medications), 4 or more medications are commonly needed. Achieving adequate blood pressure control often requires several evaluations and changes in drug therapy. Reluctance to titrate or add medications to control BP must be overcome. Lack of patient adherence, particularly because lifelong treatment is required, can interfere with adequate BP control. Education, with empathy and support, is essential for success. Table Devices and physical interventions Percutaneous catheter-based radiofrequency ablation of the sympathetic nerves in the renal artery is used in Europe and Australia for resistant hypertension. Although initial studies appeared promising, studies that incorporated a sham ablation procedure in the control arm failed to show a benefit from radiofrequency ablation (1, 2 Treatment references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Thus, sympathetic ablation should be considered experimental and is done only in centers with extensive experience. A physical intervention involves stimulating the carotid baroreceptor with a device surgically implanted around the carotid body. A battery attached to the device, much like a pacemaker, is used to stimulate the baroreceptor and, in a dose-dependent manner, lower blood pressure. A long-term analysis of a statistically powered study showed that baroreflex activation therapy maintained its efficacy for persistent reduction of office BP in patients with resistant hypertension without major safety issues (3 Treatment references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines concluded that studies have not provided sufficient evidence to recommend the use of these devices in managing resistant hypertension (4 Treatment references Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. 3. de Leeuw PW, Bisognano JD, Bakris GL, Nadim MK, Haller H, Kroon AA, DEBuT-T and Rheos Trial Investigators: Sustained reduction of blood pressure with baroreceptor activation therapy: Results of the 6-year open follow-up.

Most hypertension is primary; only 5 to 15% is secondary to another disorder (eg, primary aldosteronism , renal parenchymal disease). Severe or prolonged hypertension damages the cardiovascular system, brain, and kidneys, increasing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. Hypertension is usually asymptomatic until complications develop in target organs. When hypertension is newly diagnosed, do urinalysis, spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio, blood tests (creatinine, potassium, sodium, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, and often thyroid-stimulating hormone), and ECG. Reduce BP to < 130/80 mm Hg for everyone up to age 80, including those with a kidney disorder or diabetes. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, especially a low-sodium and higher potassium diet, management of secondary causes of hypertension, and medications (including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Speed, efficiency, and proper application of CPR with the fewest possible interruptions determine successful outcome; the rare exception is profound hypothermia caused by cold water immersion, when successful resuscitation may be accomplished even after prolonged arrest (up to 60 minutes). Overview of CPR  Guidelines for health care professionals from the AHA are followed . If a person has collapsed with possible cardiac arrest, a rescuer first establishes unresponsiveness and confirms absence of breathing or the presence of only gasping respirations. Then, the rescuer calls for help. Anyone answering is directed to activate the emergency response system (or appropriate in-hospital resuscitation personnel) and, if possible, obtain a defibrillator. If no one responds, the rescuer first activates the emergency response system and then begins basic life support by giving 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120/minute and a depth of 5 to 6 cm, allowing the chest wall to return to full height between compressions, and then opening the airway (lifting the chin and tilting back the forehead) and giving 2 rescue breaths. The cycle of compressions and breaths is continued  without interruption; preferably each rescuer is relieved every 2 minutes. It is crucial that even untrained bystanders begin and maintain continuous chest compressions until skilled help arrives. Therefore, many emergency response providers now give pre-arrival instructions to callers, including phone instruction in compressions-only CPR. When a defibrillator (manual or automated) becomes available, a person in ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions. It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes.VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute. Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death. If the cardiac arrest is witnessed and a defibrillator is on the scene, a person in VF or VT should be immediately defibrillated, with compressions immediately resumed after shock is delivered; early defibrillation may promptly convert VF or pulseless VT to a perfusing rhythm. If the initial rhythm is pulseless electrical activity or asystole, an initial dose of epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO (intravenous/intraosseous) should be administered as soon as possible after recognition of cardiac arrest. Adult comprehensive emergency cardiac care * If an adequate number of trained personnel are available, patient assessment, CPR, and activation of the emergency response system should occur simultaneously. Based on the 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. The techniques used in basic 1- and 2-rescuer CPR are listed in Table CPR Techniques for Health Care Practitioners CPR Techniques for Health Care Practitioners . Mastery is best acquired by hands-on training such as that provided in the US under the auspices of the American Heart Association (1-800-AHA-USA1) or corresponding organizations in other countries. Table Airway and Breathing Opening the airway is 2nd priority . For witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, it is acceptable to provide passive oxygenation for the first 6 minutes, as part of an emergency medical services bundle of care aimed at minimizing pauses in the initial provision of CPR and defibrillation. For mechanical measures regarding resuscitation in children, see table Guide to Pediatric Resuscitation—Mechanical Measures Guide to Pediatric Resuscitation—Mechanical Measures . For health care professionals, bag-valve-mask ventilation should be started as early as possible, but this should not delay initiation of compressions or defibrillation. Lay rescuers trained in CPR may give rescue breaths delivered mouth-to-mouth (adults, adolescents, and children) or combined mouth-to-mouth-and-nose (infants). If available, an oropharyngeal airway may be inserted to maintain airway patency during bag-mask ventilation. Cricoid pressure is not recommended. How To Do Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation VIDEO If abdominal distention develops, the airway is rechecked for patency, and the amount of air delivered during rescue breathing is reduced. Nasogastric intubation to relieve gastric distention is delayed until suction equipment is available because regurgitation with aspiration of gastric contents may occur during insertion. If marked gastric distention interferes with ventilation prior to availability of suction and cannot be corrected by the above methods, patients are positioned on their side, the epigastrium is compressed, and the airway is cleared. When qualified rescuers are present, an advanced airway (endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway) is placed without interruption of chest compressions after initial CPR and defibrillation attempts, as described under Airway Establishment and Control Airway Establishment and Control Airway management consists of Clearing the upper airway Maintaining an open air passage with a mechanical device Sometimes assisting respirations . A breath is given every 6 seconds (10 breaths/minute) without interrupting chest compression in adults; infants and children are given breaths every 2 to 3 seconds (20 to 30 breaths/minute). However, chest compression and defibrillation take precedence over endotracheal intubation.Initial passive oxygenation Preference for endotracheal intubation over bag-valve-mask ventilation or supraglottic airway placement Early intubation Use of a viral filter on bag-valve devices or ventilators This guidance aims to decrease the risk to the health care workers providing care during cardiac arrest. Circulation Chest compressions How To Do Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) In Adults VIDEO Chest compression should be started immediately on recognition of cardiac arrest and done with minimal interruption until defibrillation is available. In an unresponsive patient whose collapse was unwitnessed, the trained rescuer should immediately begin external (closed chest) cardiac compressions, followed by rescue breathing. Chest compressions must not be interrupted for>10 seconds at any time (eg, for intubation, defibrillation, rhythm analysis, central IV catheter placement, or transport). A compression cycle should consist of 50% compression and 50% release; during the release phase, it is important to allow the chest to recoil fully. Rhythm interpretation and defibrillation (if appropriate) are done as soon as a defibrillator is available. The recommended chest compression depth for adults is about 5 to 6 cm. Ideally, external cardiac compression produces a palpable pulse with each compression, although cardiac output is only 20 to 30% of normal. However, palpation of pulses during chest compression is difficult, even for experienced clinicians, and often unreliable. Quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring may provide a better estimate of cardiac output during chest compressions; patients with inadequate perfusion have little venous return to the lungs and hence a low end-tidal carbon dioxide (as do those with hyperventilation). While there is limited evidence supporting specific numbers in physiologic monitoring, it is generally accepted that an end-tidal carbon dioxide level of 10 to 20 mm Hg is associated with adequate CPR. A sudden significant rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide level, usually to a value greater than 30 mm Hg, or a palpable pulse during pause in compressions, indicates restoration of spontaneous circulation. Mechanical chest compression devices are available; these devices are as effective as properly executed manual compressions and can minimize effects of performance error and fatigue. They may be particularly helpful in some circumstances, such as during patient transport or in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Open-chest cardiac compression may be effective but is used only in patients with penetrating chest injuries, shortly after cardiac surgery (ie, within 48 hours), in cases of cardiac tamponade, and most especially after cardiac arrest in the operating room when the patient’s chest is already open. However, thoracotomy is surgical opening of the chest. It is done to evaluate and treat pulmonary problems when noninvasive procedures are nondiagnostic or unlikely to be definitive. Complications of chest compression A frequent complication is regurgitation followed by aspiration of gastric contents, causing life-threatening aspiration pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs. Costochondral separation and fractured ribs often cannot be avoided because it is important to compress the chest enough to produce sufficient blood flow. Fractures are quite rare in children because of the flexibility of the chest wall. Bone marrow emboli to the lungs have rarely been reported after external cardiac compression, but there is no clear evidence that they contribute to mortality. Lung injury is rare, but pneumothorax (Traumatic) Traumatic pneumothorax is air in the pleural space resulting from trauma and causing partial or complete lung collapse. Tension pneumothorax should be considered in a patient who has achieved return of spontaneous circulation after prolonged CPR, and subsequently becomes difficult to ventilate, or who is hypoxic and suddenly rearrests. Serious myocardial injury caused by compression is highly unlikely, with the possible exception of injury to a preexisting ventricular aneurysm. Concern for these injuries should not deter the rescuer from doing CPR. Laceration of the liver is a rare but potentially serious (sometimes fatal) complication and is usually caused by compressing the abdomen below the sternum. Rupture of the stomach (particularly if the stomach is distended with air) is also a rare complication. Delayed rupture of the spleen is very rare. Defibrillation The most common rhythm in witnessed adult cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions. It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes.VF); rapid conversion to a perfusing rhythm is essential. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute. Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death.VT) is treated the same as VF. How To Do Defibrillation In An Adult VIDEO Prompt defibrillation is the only intervention for cardiac arrest, other than high-quality CPR, that has been shown to improve survival; however, the success of defibrillation is time dependent, with about a 10% decline in success after each minute of VF (or pulseless VT). Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) allow minimally trained rescuers to treat VT or VF. Their use by first responders (police and fire services) and their prominent availability in public locations have increased the likelihood of resuscitation. Defibrillating paddles or pads are placed either between the clavicle and the 2nd intercostal space along the right sternal border and over the 5th or 6th intercostal space at the apex of the heart (in the mid-axillary line). Alternatively, the 2 pads may be placed with one pad over the anterior left hemithorax and the other pad on the posterior left hemithorax. Conventional defibrillator paddles are rarely present on modern defibrillators. When present, paddles are used with conducting paste; pads have conductive gel incorporated into them. One initial shock is advised as soon as a shockable rhythm is detected, after which chest compressions are immediately resumed. Energy level for biphasic defibrillators is between 150 and 200 joules (2 joules/kg in children) for the initial shock; monophasic defibrillators are set at 360 joules for the initial shock. Postshock rhythm is not checked until after 2 minutes of chest compressions. Subsequent shocks are delivered at the same or higher energy level (maximum 360 joules in adults, or 10 joules/kg in children). Monitor and IV Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is established to identify the underlying cardiac rhythm. An IV line may be started; 2 lines minimize the risk of losing IV access during CPR. Large-bore peripheral lines in the antecubital veins are preferred. In adults and children, if a peripheral line cannot be established, a subclavian or femoral central line  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. Intraosseous lines  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. Femoral vein catheters  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter.CPR does not need to be stopped and they have less potential for lethal complications; however, they may have a lower rate of successful placement because no discrete femoral arterial pulsations are available to guide insertion. The type and volume of fluids or drugs given depend on the clinical circumstances. Usually, IV 0.9% saline is given slowly (sufficient only to keep an IV line open); vigorous volume replacement (crystalloid and colloid solutions, blood) is required only when arrest results from hypovolemia . Special Circumstances In accidental electrical shock Electrical Injuries Electrical injury is damage caused by generated electrical current passing through the body. Use of nonmetallic grapples or rods and grounding of the rescuer allows for safe removal of the patient before starting CPR. In drowning is respiratory impairment resulting from submersion in a liquid medium. It can be nonfatal (previously called near drowning) or fatal. If cardiac arrest follows traumatic injury, airway-opening maneuvers and a brief period of external ventilation after clearing the airway have the highest priority because airway obstruction is the most likely treatable cause of arrest. If cervical spine injury is suspected, jaw thrust, but not head tilt and chin lift, is advised. Other survivable causes of traumatic cardiac arrest include cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling.Pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. . However, most patients with traumatic cardiac arrest have severe hypovolemia due to blood loss (for which chest compression may be ineffective) or nonsurvivable brain injuries. Drugs for ACLS Despite widespread and long-standing use, no drug or drug combination has been definitively shown to increase neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge in patients with cardiac arrest. Some drugs do seem to improve the likelihood of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and thus may reasonably be given (for dosing, including pediatric, see table Drugs for Resuscitation Drugs for Resuscitation* ). Drug therapy for shock and cardiac arrest continues to be researched. Table In a patient with a peripheral IV line, drug administration is followed by a fluid bolus (“wide open” IV in adults; 3 to 5 mL in young children) to flush the drug into the central circulation. In a patient without IV or intraosseous (IO) access, naloxone, atropine, and epinephrine, when indicated, may be given via the endotracheal tube at 2 to 2.5 times the IV dose. During administration of a drug via endotracheal tube, compression should be briefly stopped. First-line drugs The main first-line drug used in cardiac arrest is Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO should be given as soon as possible to patients with a nonshockable initial rhythm and may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. It should be given early in nonshockable rhythms, because recent evidence suggests survival is increased when it is given in the first 5 minutes of resuscitation, or for ventricular tachycardia Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute. Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death.VT) or ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions. It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes.VF) refractory to two shocks. It has combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic effects. The alpha-adrenergic effects may augment coronary diastolic pressure, thereby increasing subendocardial perfusion during chest compressions. Epinephrine also increases the likelihood of successful defibrillation. However, beta-adrenergic effects may be detrimental because they increase oxygen requirements (especially of the heart) and cause vasodilation. Intracardiac injection of epinephrine is not recommended because, in addition to interrupting precordial compression, pneumothorax, coronary artery laceration, and cardiac tamponade may occur. Amiodarone 300 mg can be given once if a third attempt at defibrillation is unsuccessful after epinephrine, followed by 1 dose of 150 mg. It is also of potential value if VT or VF recurs after successful defibrillation; a lower dose is given over 10 minutes followed by a continuous infusion. There is no persuasive proof that it increases survival to hospital discharge. Lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic to amiodarone, with an initial dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg, followed by a second dose of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg. A single dose of vasopressin 40 units, which has a duration of activity of 40 minutes, is an alternative to epinephrine (adults only). However, it is no more effective than epinephrine and is therefore no longer recommended as a first-line drug in the American Heart Association's guidelines. However, in the unlikely case of a lack of epinephrine during CPR, vasopressin may be substituted. Other drugs A range of additional drugs may be useful in specific settings. Atropine sulfate is a vagolytic drug that increases heart rate and conduction through the atrioventricular node. It is given for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias and high-degree atrioventricular nodal block. It is no longer recommended for asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Calcium chloride is recommended for patients with Hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L (> 5.5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells.Hypermagnesemia is a serum magnesium concentration > 2.6 mg/dL (> 1.05 mmol/L). The major cause is renal failure.Hypocalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration < 8.8 mg/dL (< 2. In other patients, because intracellular calcium is already higher than normal, additional calcium is likely to be detrimental. Because cardiac arrest in patients on renal dialysis is often a result of or accompanied by hyperkalemia, these patients may benefit from a trial of calcium if bedside potassium determination is unavailable. Caution is necessary because calcium exacerbates digitalis toxicity and can cause cardiac arrest. Lidocaine is now recommended as an alternative to amiodarone for VF or VT that is unresponsive to defibrillation and initial vasopressor therapy with epinephrine. It may also be considered after ROSC due to VF or VT (in adults) to prevent recurrent VF or VT. Magnesium sulfate has not been shown to improve outcome in randomized clinical studies. However, it may be helpful in patients with torsades de pointes Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia is a specific form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with a long QT interval. Procainamide is a 2nd-line drug for treatment of refractory VF or VT. However, procainamide is not recommended for pulseless arrest in children and is no longer recommended by American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of post-arrest ventricular arrhythmias. However, the European Resuscitation Council includes it as an alternative to amiodarone in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia with a pulse in both adults and pediatrics per the 2021 guidelines, as some studies have shown an association with fewer major adverse events as compared with amiodarone. Phenytoin may rarely be used to treat VT, but only when VT is due to digitalis toxicity and is refractory to other drugs. A dose of 50 to 100 mg/minute every 5 minutes is given until rhythm improves or the total dose reaches 20 mg/kg. Sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended unless cardiac arrest is caused by hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Sodium bicarbonate may be considered when cardiac arrest is prolonged (> 10 minutes); it is given only if there is good ventilation. When sodium bicarbonate is used, serum bicarbonate concentration or base deficit should be monitored before infusion and after each 50-mEq dose (1 to 2 mEq/kg in children). Arrhythmia Treatment VF or pulseless VT is treated with one direct-current shock, preferably with biphasic waveform, as soon as possible after those rhythms are identified. Despite some laboratory evidence to the contrary, it is not recommended to delay defibrillation to administer a period of chest compressions. Chest compression should be interrupted as little as possible and for no more than 10 seconds at a time for defibrillation. Recommended energy levels for defibrillation vary: 120 to 200 joules for biphasic waveform and 360 joules for monophasic. If this treatment is unsuccessful after 2 attempts, epinephrine 1 mg IV is administered and repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Defibrillation at the same energy level or higher is attempted 1 to 2 minutes after each drug administration. If VF persists, amiodarone 300 mg IV is given. Then, if VF/VT recurs, 150 mg is given followed by infusion of 1 mg/minute for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/minute. Current versions of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) provide a pediatric cable that effectively reduces the energy delivered to children. (For pediatric energy levels, see Defibrillation Despite the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are about 90% for infants and children.Drugs for Resuscitation Drugs for Resuscitation* .) Asystole can be mimicked by a loose or disconnected monitor lead; thus, monitor connections should be checked and the rhythm viewed in an alternative lead. If asystole is confirmed, the patient is given epinephrine 1 mg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Defibrillation of apparent asystole (because it “might be fine VF”) is discouraged because electrical shocks may injure the nonperfused heart. Pulseless electrical activity is circulatory collapse that occurs despite satisfactory electrical complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients with pulseless electrical activity receive epinephrine 1.0 mg IV repeated every 3 to 5 minutes, followed by 500- to 1000-mL (20 mL/kg for children) infusion of 0.9% saline if hypovolemia is suspected. Cardiac tamponade can cause pulseless electrical activity, but this disorder usually occurs in patients after thoracotomy and in patients with known pericardial effusion or major chest trauma. In such settings, immediate pericardiocentesis or thoracotomy is done . Tamponade is rarely an occult cause of cardiac arrest but, if suspected, can be confirmed by ultrasonography or, if ultrasonography is unavailable, pericardiocentesis. Termination of Resuscitation CPR should be continued until the cardiopulmonary system is stabilized, the patient is pronounced dead, or a lone rescuer is physically unable to continue. If cardiac arrest is thought to be due to hypothermia, CPR should be continued until the body is rewarmed to 34° C. The decision to terminate resuscitation is a clinical one, and clinicians take into account duration of arrest, age of the patient, and prognosis of underlying medical conditions. The decision is typically made when spontaneous circulation has not been established after CPR and advanced cardiovascular life support measures have been done. In intubated patients, an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level of < 10 mm Hg is a poor prognostic sign. Postresuscitative Care Restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is only an intermediate goal in resuscitation. The ultimate goal is survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function, which is achieved by only a minority of patients with ROSC. To maximize the likelihood of a good outcome, clinicians must provide good supportive care (eg, manage blood pressure, temperature, and cardiac rhythm) and treat underlying conditions, particularly acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. Postresuscitative care includes mitigation of reperfusion injury occurring after the period of ischemia. Postresuscitative care should begin immediately after spontaneous circulation is determined. Oxygen administration should be titrated down to an SpO2 of 94% to minimize hyperoxic damage to lungs. Ventilation rate and volume should be titrated to an end-tidal carbon dioxide reading of 35 to 40 mm Hg. A fluid bolus should be administered if tolerated, as well as vasopressor infusion. Postresuscitation laboratory studies include arterial blood gases (ABG), complete blood count (CBC), and blood chemistries, including electrolytes, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, and cardiac markers. (Creatine kinase is usually elevated because of skeletal muscle damage caused by CPR; troponins, which are unlikely to be affected by CPR or defibrillation, are preferred.) Arterial PaO2 should be kept near normal values (80 to 100 mm Hg). Hematocrit should be maintained at ≥ 30% (if cardiac etiology is suspected), and glucose at 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.7 to 9.9 mmol/L); electrolytes, especially potassium, should be within the normal range. Coronary angiography When indicated, coronary angiography should be done emergently (rather than later during the hospital course) so that if percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is needed, it is done as soon as possible. The decision to do cardiac catheterization Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins.ECG), the interventional cardiologist's clinical impression, and the patient's prognosis. However, guidelines suggest doing emergency angiography for adult patients in whom a cardiac cause is suspected and who have ST-segment elevation (STEMI), or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG Some researchers advocate liberal use of cardiac catheterization after ROSC, doing the procedure on most patients unless the etiology is clearly unlikely to be cardiac (eg, drowning) or there are contraindications (eg, intracranial bleeding). Neurologic support Only about 10% of all cardiac arrest survivors have good central nervous system function (cerebral performance category [CPC] score 1 or 2—see table Cerebral Performance Category Scale Cerebral Performance Category Scale (Adult)* ) at hospital discharge. A CPC score of 1 is indicative of good cerebral performance (patient is conscious, alert, able to work but may have mild neurologic or psychologic deficit). A CPC score of 2 is indicative of moderate cerebral performance (patient is conscious, able to do activities of daily living [ADLs] and work in a simple environment). Hypoxic brain injury is a result of ischemic damage and cerebral edema . Both damage and recovery may evolve over 48 to 72 hours after resuscitation. Table Maintenance of oxygenation and cerebral perfusion pressure (avoiding hyperventilation, hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypotension) may reduce cerebral complications. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may damage the post-ischemic brain and should be treated. Cooling is begun as soon as spontaneous circulation has returned. Techniques to induce and maintain hypothermia can be either external or invasive. External cooling methods are easy to apply and range from the use of external ice packs to several commercially available external cooling devices that circulate high volumes of chilled water over the skin. For internal cooling, chilled IV fluids (4° C) can be rapidly infused to lower body temperature, but this method may be problematic in patients who cannot tolerate much additional fluid volume. Also available are external heat-exchange devices that circulate chilled saline to an indwelling IV heat-exchange catheter using a closed-loop design in which chilled saline circulates through the catheter and back to the device, rather than into the patient. Another invasive method for cooling uses an extracorporeal device that circulates and cools blood externally then returns it to the central circulation. Regardless of the method chosen, the goal is to cool the patient rapidly and to maintain the core temperature between 32° C and 36° C for 24 hours after restoration of spontaneous circulation. Currently, there is no evidence that any specific temperature within this range is superior, but it is imperative to avoid hyperthermia. Numerous pharmacologic treatments, including free radical scavengers, antioxidants, glutamate inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers, are of theoretic benefit; many have been successful in animal models, but none have proved effective in human trials. Blood pressure support Current recommendations are to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 65 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg. In patients known to be hypertensive, a reasonable target is systolic blood pressure 30 mm Hg below prearrest level. MAP is best measured with an intra-arterial catheter. Use of a flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter for hemodynamic monitoring has been largely discarded. Blood pressure support includes IV crystalloid infusion (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) Inotropic or vasopressor drugs with a goal of maintaining systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg and MAP of at least 65 mm Hg Rarely intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation Patients with low MAP and low central venous pressure should have IV fluid challenge with 0.9% saline infused in 250-mL increments. Although use of inotropic and vasopressor drugs has not proved to enhance long-term survival, older adults with moderately low MAP (70 to 80 mm Hg) and normal or high central venous pressure may receive an infusion of an inotrope (eg, dobutamine started at 2 to 5 mcg/kg/minute). Amrinone or milrinone are alternatives that are rarely used . If this therapy is ineffective, the inotrope and vasoconstrictor dopamine may be considered. Alternatives are epinephrine and the peripheral vasoconstrictors norepinephrine and phenylephrine . However, vasoactive drugs should be used at the minimal dose necessary to achieve low-normal MAP because they may increase vascular resistance and decrease organ perfusion, especially in the mesenteric bed. They also increase the workload of the heart at a time when its capability is decreased because of postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction. If MAP remains < 70 mm Hg in patients who may have sustained a myocardial infarction (MI), intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered. Patients with normal MAP and high central venous pressure may improve with either inotropic therapy or afterload reduction with nitroprusside or nitroglycerin. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation can assist low-output circulatory states due to left ventricular pump failure that is refractory to drugs. A balloon catheter is introduced via the femoral artery, percutaneously or by arteriotomy, retrograde into the thoracic aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. The balloon inflates during each diastole, augmenting coronary artery perfusion, and deflates during systole, decreasing afterload. Its primary value is as a temporizing measure when the cause of shock is potentially correctable by surgery or percutaneous intervention (eg, acute MI with major coronary obstruction, acute mitral insufficiency, ventricular septal defect).

Postresuscitation rapid supraventricular tachycardias occur frequently because of high levels of beta-adrenergic catecholamines (both endogenous and exogenous) during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. These rhythms should be treated if extreme, prolonged, or associated with hypotension or signs of coronary ischemia. An esmolol IV infusion is given, beginning at 50 mcg/kg/min. Patients who had arrest caused by VF or VT not associated with acute MI are candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Current ICDs are implanted similarly to pacemakers and have intracardiac leads and sometimes subcutaneous electrodes.

Arteries carry blood with oxygen and nutrients away from the heart to the rest of the body. Superficial venous thrombosis most often affects the superficial veins Overview of the Venous System Veins return blood to the heart from all the organs of the body. Arteries carry blood with oxygen and nutrients away from the heart to the rest of the body. Superficial venous thrombosis in the arms usually results from having an IV. Superficial venous thrombosis in the legs usually results from varicose veins Varicose Veins Varicose veins are abnormally enlarged superficial veins in the legs. Varicose veins may cause your legs to ache, itch, and feel tired. However, most people with varicose veins do not develop blood clots (thrombosis). Blood Vessels VIDEO Even a slight injury can cause a varicose vein to become inflamed (phlebitis). Unlike deep vein thrombosis Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. Unlike deep veins, superficial veins have no surrounding muscles to squeeze and dislodge a blood clot. For these reasons, superficial venous thrombosis rarely causes a blood clot to break loose (embolism). Migratory phlebitis or migratory thrombophlebitis is superficial venous thrombosis that repeatedly occurs in normal veins. It may indicate a serious underlying disorder, such as cancer of an internal organ. When migratory phlebitis and cancer of an internal organ occur together, the disorder is called Trousseau syndrome. Symptoms of Superficial Venous Thrombosis Pain and swelling develop rapidly in the area of inflammation. The skin over the vein becomes red, and the area feels warm and is very tender. Because blood in the vein is clotted, the vein feels like a hard cord under the skin, not soft like a normal or varicose vein. The vein may feel hard along its entire length. Diagnosis of Superficial Venous Thrombosis Doctor's evaluation Doctors recognize superficial venous thrombosis by its appearance. Tests are not usually needed, although if people have superficial venous thrombosis above the knee that developed suddenly and not in an area of varicose veins, doctors often do ultrasonography to see if there is a blood clot in the deep veins Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs.

Applying warm compresses and taking an analgesic, such as aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain. Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks. Although the inflammation generally subsides in a matter of days, several weeks may pass before the lumps and tenderness subside completely.

The virus is spread through kissing. It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved. Other causes of neck masses include a cyst (a fluid-filled sac) that has been present from birth but is noticed only after it has become inflamed or infected. Neck masses may also result from swelling due to a neck injury, inflammation of the salivary glands, or noncancerous (benign) tumors.

Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Most neck masses cause no symptoms and are of greater concern to parents than to the children who have them. However, infected lymph nodes or cysts are tender and painful and may cause a fever. Diagnosis of Neck Masses in Children Imaging tests, swabs, blood tests, and tuberculosis skin tests Thyroid tests Biopsy Because many neck masses are caused by viral infections and disappear without treatment, tests are usually not needed unless a mass lasts for several weeks. However, doctors may take a swab from the back of the throat to test for a bacterial infection, or they may do blood tests to look for such disorders as infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Epstein-Barr virus causes a number of diseases, including infectious mononucleosis. White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. Doctors may also take x-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees). In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease. Ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissues.

Tinea capitis is a type of dermatophytosis Overview of Dermatophytoses (Ringworm, Tinea) Dermatophytoses are fungal infections of the skin and nails caused by several different fungi and classified by the location on the body. In the United States, tinea capitis is primarily caused by Trichophyton. Tinea capitis is highly contagious and is common among children. Symptoms of Scalp Ringworm Tinea capitis may cause a dry scaly rash that may be somewhat itchy, a patch of hair loss (alopecia (Hair Loss) Hair loss, also called alopecia, can occur on any part of the body. Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness. One type of fungus causes \"black dot\" ringworm, in which hair shafts break at the scalp surface. Another type of fungus causes \"gray patch\" ringworm, in which hair shafts break above the surface, leaving short stubs. Tinea capitis may sometimes cause flaking that resembles dandruff. Kerion A dermatophyte infection occasionally causes a kerion, which is a large, painful, inflamed, swollen patch on the scalp that sometimes oozes pus. A kerion may have blisters and crusting and can look like an abscess (a pocket of pus). A kerion is caused by an immune system reaction to the fungus and may result in scarring hair loss.

Most people with lymphocytic choriomeningitis have no or mild symptoms, but some have a flu-like illness, and a few develop meningitis or a brain infection. To diagnose lymphocytic choriomeningitis, doctors do a spinal tap and blood tests to check for the virus. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, but if people have meningitis or a brain infection, they are hospitalized and may be given an antiviral drug. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is caused by an arenavirus Arenaviruses Arbovirus, arenavirus, and filovirus are viruses that are spread from animals to people and, with some viruses, from people to people. The animal involved depends on the type of virus. Usually, people become infected when they inhale dust or eat food contaminated with the urine, feces, or another body fluid of an infected hamster or gray house mouse. When lymphocytic choriomeningitis is transmitted by mice, it occurs mainly in adults during the autumn and winter. Symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Most people with lymphocytic choriomeningitis have no or mild symptoms. Symptoms, if they occur, develop about 1 to 2 weeks after people are infected. Some people have a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, a general feeling of illness (malaise), weakness, muscle aches (especially in the lower back), and pain behind the eyes. People may be sensitive to light, lose their appetite, and feel nauseated or light-headed. Sore throat occurs less often. After 5 days to 3 weeks, people usually improve for 1 or 2 days. Many of them then worsen. Fever and headache return, and a rash may appear. The joints of the fingers and hands may swell.

Osteopetrosis with delayed manifestations (Albers-Schönberg disease) This type of osteopetrosis is autosomal dominant Autosomal Dominant Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. The defective CLCN7 gene encodes a chloride channel that is apparently important in osteoclast function. Osteopetrosis with delayed manifestations is relatively common and has a wide geographic and ethnic distribution. Affected people may be asymptomatic; general health is usually unimpaired. However, facial palsy and deafness may occur due to cranial nerve entrapment. Bony overgrowths may narrow the marrow cavity and cause cytopenias ranging from anemia to pancytopenia. Extramedullary hematopoiesis may occur, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly; consequent hypersplenism may worsen anemia. The skeleton usually is radiologically normal at birth. However, bone sclerosis becomes increasingly apparent as children age, and diagnosis is typically based on x-rays done for unrelated reasons. Bony involvement is widespread but patchy. The calvaria is dense, and sinuses may be obliterated. Sclerosis of the vertebral end plate causes the characteristic rugby-shirt appearance (horizontal banding). Some patients require transfusion or splenectomy to treat anemia. Osteopetrosis with precocious manifestations This type of osteopetrosis is autosomal recessive Autosomal Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. It is uncommon, frequently lethal, and often due to a mutation in the osteoclast-associated gene TCIRG1. Bony overgrowth progressively obliterates the marrow cavity, causing severe pancytopenia. Initial symptoms of osteopetrosis with precocious manifestations include failure to thrive, spontaneous bruising, abnormal bleeding, and anemia. Palsies of the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th cranial nerves and hepatosplenomegaly occur later. Bone marrow failure (anemia, overwhelming infection, or hemorrhage) usually causes death in the first year of life. Diagnosis of osteopetrosis with precocious manifestations is suspected by the presence of bony overgrowths in the context of anemia, unusual bleeding, and poor growth. Typically, plain x-rays are done, along with complete blood count and coagulation tests. General increased bone density is the predominant feature on x-ray. Penetrated x-rays of long bones show transverse bands in the metaphyseal regions and longitudinal striations in the shafts. As the disorder progresses, the ends of the long bones, particularly the proximal humerus and distal femur, become flask-shaped. Characteristic endobones (bone within a bone) form in the vertebrae, pelvis, and tubular bones. The skull becomes thickened, and the spine has a rugby-shirt appearance. However, prognosis is poor with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–mismatched grafts. Prednisone, calcitriol, and interferon gamma are effective in some cases. Osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis This type of osteopetrosis is autosomal recessive Autosomal Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. The genetic defect involves mutations of the gene encoding carbonic anhydrase II. Osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis causes weakness, stunted stature, and failure to thrive. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cures the osteopetrosis but has no effect on the renal tubular acidosis. Maintenance therapy consists of bicarbonate and electrolyte supplementation to correct renal losses.

Etiology Respiratory distress in neonates and infants has multiple causes . Table Physiology There are several significant differences in the physiology of the respiratory system in neonates and infants compared with that of older children and adults. These differences include A more compliant collapsible chest wall Decreased lung compliance (in infants with surfactant deficiency due to prematurity or genetic mutations) More reliance on diaphragmatic excursions over intercostal muscles Collapsible extrathoracic airways Also, infants’ smaller airway caliber gives increased airway resistance, and absence of collateral ventilation increases tendency toward atelectasis.

Hepatic accumulation of abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin can cause liver disease in both children and adults. Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level < 11 mmol/L (< 80 mg/dL) confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is smoking cessation, bronchodilators, early treatment of infection, and, in selected cases, alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement. Severe liver disease may require transplantation. Prognosis is related mainly to degree of lung impairment. Pathophysiology of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (an antiprotease), the major function of which is to protect the lungs from protease-mediated tissue destruction. Most alpha-1 antitrypsin is synthesized by hepatocytes and monocytes and passively diffuses through the circulation into the lungs; some is secondarily produced by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. The protein conformation (and hence functionality) and quantity of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin are determined by codominant expression of parental alleles; > 90 different alleles have been identified and described by protease inhibitor (PI*) phenotype. Liver Inheritance of some variant alleles causes a change in conformation of the alpha-1 antitrypsin molecule, leading to polymerization and retention within hepatocytes. The hepatic accumulation of aberrant alpha-1 antitrypsin molecules causes neonatal cholestatic jaundice Neonatal Cholestasis is failure of bilirubin secretion, resulting in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. About 20% of cases of neonatal hepatic involvement result in development of cirrhosis in childhood. About 10% of patients without childhood liver disease develop cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture. Liver involvement increases the risk of liver cancer. Lungs In the lungs, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increases neutrophil elastase activity, which facilitates tissue destruction leading to emphysema (especially in smokers, because cigarette smoke also increases protease activity). Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency accounts for 1 to 2% of all cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke.COPD).

Classification of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency The normal PI phenotype is PI*MM. More than 95% of people with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and emphysema are homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ) and have alpha-1 antitrypsin levels of about 30 to 40 mg/dL (5 to 6 micromol/L). Prevalence in the general population is 1/1500 to 1/5000. Most are whites of Northern European descent; the Z allele is rare in people of Asian descent and blacks. Though emphysema is common among PI*ZZ patients, many nonsmoking patients who are homozygous for PI*ZZ do not develop emphysema; patients who do typically have a family history of COPD. PI*ZZ smokers have a lower life expectancy than PI*ZZ nonsmokers, who have a lower life expectancy than PI*MM nonsmokers and smokers. If they smoke, people who are PI*MZ heterozygous are more likely to experience more rapid decreases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over time than do people in the general population. Other rare phenotypes include PI*SZ and two types with nonexpressing alleles, PI*Z-null and PI*null-null . The null phenotype leads to undetectable serum levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Normal serum levels of malfunctioning alpha-1 antitrypsin may occur with rare mutations. Table Symptoms and Signs of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Neonates with hepatic involvement present with cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly during the first week of life; jaundice usually resolves by 2 to 4 months of age. Cirrhosis may develop in childhood or adulthood (symptoms and signs of cirrhosis Symptoms and Signs Cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.Symptoms and Signs Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is common in areas where infection with hepatitis B and C viruses is prevalent.THE MANUAL). Adults with emphysema have symptoms and signs of COPD Symptoms and Signs Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke. Severity of pulmonary disease varies greatly depending on phenotype, smoking status, and other factors. Pulmonary function is well preserved in some PI*ZZ smokers and can be severely impaired in some PI*ZZ nonsmokers. PI*ZZ people identified in population surveys (ie, those without symptoms or pulmonary disease) tend to have better pulmonary function, whether they smoke or not, than do index people (those identified because they have pulmonary disease). Airflow obstruction occurs more frequently in men and in people with asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction. panniculitis describes inflammation of the subcutaneous fat that can result from multiple causes. Treatment depends on the cause. Diagnosis of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level Genotyping Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is suspected in the following: Smokers who develop emphysema before age 45 Nonsmokers without occupational exposures who develop emphysema at any age Patients whose chest x-ray shows predominately lower lung emphysema Patients with a family history of emphysema or unexplained cirrhosis People with a family history of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency Patients with panniculitis Neonates with jaundice or liver enzyme elevations Patients with unexplained bronchiectasis or liver disease Screening is usually done with genotyping. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels < 80 mg/dL (< 15 micromol/L) if measured by the radial immunodiffusion method or levels < 50 mg/dL (< 9 micromol/L) if measured by nephelometry. Prognosis for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency As a group, people with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency who have never smoked have a normal life expectancy and only moderate impairment of pulmonary function. The most common cause of death in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is emphysema, followed by cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is common in areas where infection with hepatitis B and C viruses is prevalent. Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Supportive care For pulmonary disease, often alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement Treatment of pulmonary disease is with purified human alpha-1 antitrypsin (60 mg/kg IV over 45 to 60 minutes given once a week or 250 mg/kg over 4 to 6 hours given once a month [pooled only]), which can maintain the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin level above a target protective level of 80 mg/dL (35% of normal). Because emphysema causes permanent structural change, therapy cannot repair damaged lung structure or improve lung function but is given to halt progression. Treatment is expensive and is therefore reserved for nonsmoking patients who have two abnormal alleles, mild to moderately abnormal pulmonary function, and confirmation of diagnosis by low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels. It is not indicated for patients who have severe disease or for patients in whom one or both alleles are normal. Smoking cessation Smoking Cessation Most smokers want to quit and have tried doing so with limited success. For severely impaired people < 60 years, lung transplantation Lung and Heart-Lung Transplantation Lung or heart-lung transplantation is an option for patients who have respiratory insufficiency or failure and who remain at risk of death despite optimal medical treatment. Lung volume reduction in treating the emphysema of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is controversial; outcomes are inferior to patients without alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Treatment of liver disease is supportive. Enzyme replacement does not help because the disease is caused by abnormal processing rather than by enzyme deficiency. Liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation. . Treatment of panniculitis is not well defined. Corticosteroids, antimalarials, and tetracyclines have been used. Key Points Suspect alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency if patients have unexplained emphysema, liver disease (particularly in neonates), panniculitis, or bronchiectasis. Diagnose using genotyping and confirm using serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels < 80 mg/dL (< 15 micromol/L). Treat selected patients (nonsmoking patients in whom both alleles are abnormal and who have mild to moderately abnormal pulmonary function and low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels) with purified human alpha-1 antitrypsin.

People also may feel dizziness, vague discomfort in the abdomen, and an unwillingness to eat. Vomiting is a forceful contraction of the stomach that propels its contents up the esophagus and out the mouth.  In infants, vomiting must be distinguished from spitting up. Vomiting empties the stomach and often makes people with nausea feel considerably better, at least temporarily. Vomiting is quite uncomfortable and can be violent. Severe vomiting can project stomach contents many feet (projectile vomiting). Vomiting is not the same as regurgitation and Rumination Regurgitation is the spitting up of food from the esophagus or stomach without nausea or forceful contractions of the abdominal muscles. Vomitus—the material that is vomited up—usually reflects what was recently eaten. Sometimes it contains chunks of food. When blood is vomited, the vomitus is usually red (hematemesis Gastrointestinal Bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal [GI]) tract, from the mouth to the anus. When bile is present, the vomitus is bitter and yellow-green. Complications In addition to being uncomfortable, vomiting can cause complications: Inhaled vomitus (aspiration) Torn esophagus (Mallory-Weiss tear Esophageal Laceration (Mallory-Weiss Syndrome) An esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) is a tear that does not penetrate the wall of the esophagus. The tear can be caused by forceful vomiting. Symptoms include blood in vomit. The acid in the vomitus can severely irritate the lungs. Vomiting greatly increases pressure within the esophagus, and severe vomiting can tear the lining of the esophagus  An esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) is a tear that does not penetrate the wall of the esophagus. A small tear causes pain and sometimes bleeding, but a large tear can be fatal. Because people lose water and minerals (electrolytes) in vomitus, severe vomiting can cause dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration. Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments. Newborns and infants are particularly susceptible to these complications. Chronic vomiting can cause undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients. Causes of Nausea and Vomiting Nausea and vomiting result when the vomiting center in the brain is activated. Causes typically involve disorders of the digestive tract or the brain, or ingested substances. Common causes The most common causes of nausea and vomiting are Gastroenteritis (infection of the digestive tract) Drugs Toxins Nausea and vomiting commonly occur with any dysfunction of the digestive tract but are particularly common with gastroenteritis . A less common digestive tract disorder is obstruction of the intestine Intestinal Obstruction An obstruction of the intestine is a blockage that completely stops or seriously impairs the passage of food, fluid, digestive secretions, and gas through the intestines. Many other abdominal disorders that cause vomiting also cause significant abdominal pain Acute Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain is common and often minor. Severe abdominal pain that comes on quickly, however, almost always indicates a significant problem. In such disorders (for example, appendicitis is inflammation and infection of the appendix. Often a blockage inside the appendix causes the appendix to become inflamed and infected. The pancreas is a leaf-shaped organ about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) long. Many drugs, including alcohol, opioid analgesics (such as morphine), cannabis (marijuana), and chemotherapy drugs, can cause nausea and vomiting. Toxins, such as lead or those found in some foods and plants, can cause severe nausea and vomiting. Less common causes Less common causes of nausea and vomiting include Brain or central nervous system disorders Motion sickness Metabolic changes or bodywide (systemic) illness Psychologic disorders Cyclic vomiting syndrome The vomiting center also can be activated by certain brain or central nervous system disorders, including infections (such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). It can affect one or both sides of the head. Disorders that increase intracranial pressure include brain tumors Overview of Brain Tumors A brain tumor can be a noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant) growth in the brain. Intracerebral hemorrhage usually results from chronic high blood pressure. The first symptom is often a severe headache. The balance organs of the inner ear (vestibular apparatus) are connected to the vomiting center. This connection is why some people become nauseated by the movement of a boat, car, or airplane and by certain disorders of the inner ear (such as labyrinthitis Purulent Labyrinthitis Purulent (suppurative) labyrinthitis is a bacterial infection of the inner ear that often causes deafness and loss of balance. The labyrinth is the bony cavity that contains the inner ear. Nausea and vomiting may also occur when there are metabolic changes in the body, such as during early pregnancy, or when people have diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver. Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. Chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome is a functional disorder. That is, the nausea and vomiting are not caused by a physical or specific psychologic disorder but rather may be a problem with the way the brain and gastrointestinal system communicate. In this syndrome, people have bothersome nausea, vomiting, or both that occur at least once a week for at least 6 months including the last 3 months and that have no identifiable cause after testing has been done. Psychologic problems also can cause nausea and vomiting. Such vomiting may be intentional. For instance, people who have bulimia make themselves vomit to lose weight. Or it may be unintentional. For instance, children who are afraid of going to school vomit as a response to their psychologic distress. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is an uncommon disorder in which people have severe attacks of vomiting (or sometimes only nausea) at varying intervals. People feel normal between attacks. Although it usually starts in childhood, it sometimes lasts until adulthood. Cyclic vomiting that begins in adulthood is often due to chronic marijuana use. The vomiting can be relieved by a hot bath and goes away after people stop using marijuana. Evaluation of Nausea and Vomiting Not every episode of nausea and vomiting requires immediate evaluation by a doctor. The following information can help people decide whether a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation. Warning signs Certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern. They include Signs of dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. People who have nausea and vomiting but no warning signs should see a doctor if vomiting continues for more than 24 to 48 hours or if they are unable to tolerate more than a few sips of liquid. People who have a few episodes of vomiting (with or without diarrhea) but are able to tolerate at least some liquids should call their doctor. Depending on their age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions (such as cancer or diabetes), the doctor may suggest that people be seen for an evaluation or stay home and try simple remedies. What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the vomiting and the tests that may need to be done ( Home.see table Some Causes and Features of Nausea and Vomiting Some Causes and Features of Nausea and Vomiting ). During the history, doctors ask whether the person is pregnant or has diabetes, migraines, liver or kidney disease, or cancer (including the timing of any chemotherapy or radiation therapy). All recently ingested drugs and substances are noted because certain substances may not be toxic until several days after ingestion (such as acetaminophen and some mushrooms). During the physical examination, doctors look for the following: Signs of dehydration Symptoms Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Although people with previously known disorders that cause vomiting (such as migraine) may simply be having a recurrence of that disorder, doctors thoroughly look for signs of a new, different problem. Table Testing The need for tests depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination, particularly whether warning signs are present and whether findings suggest a particular disorder ( Home.see table Some Causes and Features of Nausea and Vomiting Some Causes and Features of Nausea and Vomiting ). Possible tests include Pregnancy test Blood and urine tests Girls and women of childbearing age typically should have a pregnancy test. Otherwise healthy adults and older children who have only a few episodes of vomiting (with or without diarrhea) and no other symptoms typically do not require any testing. People whose vomiting is severe or has lasted more than 1 day or who have signs of dehydration need laboratory tests of blood (particularly electrolyte levels and sometimes liver tests) and urine. Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting Specific conditions are treated. If there is no serious underlying disorder and the person is not dehydrated, small amounts of clear liquids may be given 30 minutes or so after the last bout of vomiting. Typically an ounce (30 milliliters) or two are given at first. Plain water is an appropriate liquid, but broth or weak, sweetened tea may be given. Sports drinks have no particular advantage but are not harmful. If these liquids are tolerated, the amounts are increased gradually. When these increases are tolerated, the person may resume eating normal foods. Carbonated beverages and alcohol should be avoided. Even when people are slightly dehydrated, doctors usually recommend oral rehydration solutions Treatment Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. People with significant dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities, people who are actively vomiting, and people who cannot tolerate any liquids by mouth usually require fluids and/or drugs given by vein (intravenously). For some adults and adolescents, doctors give drugs to relieve nausea (antiemetics) depending on the cause and the severity of the vomiting: For vomiting caused by motion sickness: Antihistamines (such as dimenhydrinate), scopolamine patches, or both For mild to moderate symptoms: Prochlorperazine, promethazine, or metoclopramide For severe vomiting (including vomiting caused by chemotherapy): Dolasetron, ondansetron, or granisetron, or sometimes aprepitant Key Points People whose nausea and vomiting have an obvious cause and who have a normal examination only need treatment of their symptoms. People with significant dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities usually require intravenous fluids. Doctors look for signs of severe, sudden changes to the abdomen or disorders within the skull.

At first, these cells interfere with the production of normal blood cells. Later, these cells may become cancerous, turning into a form of leukemia .  White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. Symptoms depend on which type of cells is affected but may include tiredness, weakness, and paleness, or fever and infections, or bleeding and bruising. Blood tests and examination of a bone marrow sample are needed for diagnosis. Treatment with azacytidine and decitabine may help relieve symptoms and lower the likelihood that acute leukemia will develop. Stem cell transplantation can cure the disease. In myelodysplastic syndromes, a line of identical cells (clone) develops and occupies the bone marrow. These abnormal cells do not grow, mature, or function normally. Myelodysplastic syndromes occur most often in people older than 50 years, particularly those older than 65 years. Men are more likely than women to be affected. The cause is usually not known. However, in some people, exposure of bone marrow to radiation therapy or certain types of chemotherapy drugs may play a role. Symptoms of MDS Symptoms may develop very slowly. Fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms of anemia are common. Fever due to infections may develop if the number of white blood cells decreases. Easy bruising and abnormal bleeding can result if the number of platelets drops (thrombocytopenia Overview of Thrombocytopenia is a low number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood, which increases the risk of bleeding. Diagnosis of MDS Blood tests Bone marrow examination Molecular testing A myelodysplastic syndrome may be suspected when people have unexplained persistent anemia, but diagnosis requires bone marrow evaluation Bone Marrow Examination Red blood cells, most white blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow, the soft fatty tissue inside bone cavities. At some centers, people are tested to determine which gene or chromosome abnormalities are causing myelodysplastic syndrome (sometimes called molecular testing). Experimental treatments are now available that target some of these specific abnormalities. Prognosis for MDS Myelodysplastic syndromes are thought to be a type of preleukemia that can progress gradually over a period of several months to years. Treatment of MDS Chemotherapy Sometimes stem cell transplantation The drugs azacitidine and decitabine help relieve symptoms and lower the likelihood that acute leukemia will develop. Azacitidine may also improve survival.

A drug called lenalidomide, which attacks cells functioning with a specific chromosome abnormality, decreases the need for blood transfusions. Platelets are transfused only if people have uncontrolled bleeding or if surgery is needed and the number of platelets is low. People who have very low numbers of neutrophils—the white blood cells that fight infection—may benefit from periodic injections of a special type of protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

Polyhydramnios is excessive amniotic fluid; it is associated with maternal and fetal complications. Diagnosis is by ultrasonographic measurement of amniotic fluid volume. A nasogastric tube should be passed into the neonate’s stomach immediately after cardiovascular stability has been attained after delivery.

Blood pressure is usually low.  Very low blood pressure can cause damage to organs, a process called shock. Shock has several causes: Low blood volume, inadequate pumping action of the heart, or excessive widening (dilation) of blood vessels. When shock is caused by low blood volume or inadequate pumping of the heart, people may feel sluggish, sleepy, or confused, and their skin becomes cold and sweaty and often bluish and pale. When shock results from excessive dilation of blood vessels, the skin may be warm and flushed, and the pulse may be strong and forceful (bounding) rather than weak. People who are in shock should be kept warm and positioned so their legs are elevated. Intravenous fluids, oxygen, and sometimes drugs are given to help restore the blood pressure. Many people who are in shock are brought to emergency departments every day. People go into shock when their blood pressure becomes so low Blood Pressure Low blood pressure is blood pressure low enough to cause symptoms such as dizziness and fainting. Very low blood pressure can cause damage to organs, a process called shock. As a result, cells in numerous organs, including the brain, kidneys, liver, and heart, stop functioning normally. If blood flow (perfusion) to these cells is not quickly restored, they become irreversibly damaged and die. If enough cells are damaged or dead, the organ they are in may fail and the person may die. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the failure of two or more organs. This diagnosis carries a significant chance of death. People in shock require immediate emergency treatment and are usually cared for in the hospital intensive care unit.  Shock has nothing to do with sudden emotional stress. Although low blood pressure is generally the cause of shock, blood pressure may not be low in the early stages of shock. Also, blood pressure can be low in people who do not have shock. The medical disorder of shock has nothing to do with the “shock” that people feel from a sudden emotional stress. Causes of Shock has several causes: Low blood volume (hypovolemic shock Hypovolemic Shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow to the organs is low, decreasing delivery of oxygen and thus causing organ damage and sometimes death... In some people with shock, blood pressure is so low that it cannot be measured with a blood pressure cuff. Hypovolemic shock Low blood volume results in less-than-normal amounts of blood entering the heart with every heartbeat and therefore less-than-normal amounts of blood being pumped out to the body and its cells. Blood volume may be low because of Severe bleeding Excessive loss of body fluids Inadequate fluid intake (less common) Blood may be rapidly lost because of External bleeding, such as that caused by an injury Internal bleeding, such as that caused by an ulcer in the stomach or intestine (gastrointestinal bleeding Gastrointestinal Bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal [GI]) tract, from the mouth to the anus. In an ectopic pregnancy, the fetus cannot survive. Burns cause varying degrees of pain, blisters, swelling, and skin loss. The pancreas is a leaf-shaped organ about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) long.  People also may feel dizziness, vague discomfort in the abdomen, and an unwillingness to eat. Cardiogenic shock Inadequate pumping action of the heart can also result in less-than-normal amounts of blood being pumped out with every heartbeat. The most common causes of inadequate pumping action are Complications of a heart attack Complications of an Acute Coronary Syndrome The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. The coronary arteries, which branch off the aorta just after it leaves the heart, deliver this blood. This can decrease blood flow and oxygen delivery to organs. Blood vessels may be excessively dilated because of A serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions are sudden, widespread, potentially severe and life-threatening allergic reactions. For example, a spinal cord injury interrupts the nerves from the brain to the blood vessels that normally cause blood vessel constriction; poisons or toxins released by bacteria can directly cause the blood vessels to dilate. Symptoms of Shock Symptoms of shock are similar when the cause is low blood volume or inadequate pumping action of the heart. The condition may begin with sluggishness, sleepiness, and confusion. The skin becomes cold and sweaty and often bluish, pale or ashen. If the skin is pressed, color returns much more slowly than normal. Blood vessels may become more visible as a bluish network of lines under the skin. The pulse is weak and rapid, unless a slow heartbeat is causing the shock. Usually, the person cannot sit up without feeling light-headed or passing out. Breathing is rapid, but breathing and the pulse may both slow down if death is imminent. Blood pressure drops so low that it often cannot be measured with a blood pressure cuff. Urination decreases and eventually stops Eventually, the person may go into a coma and die. When shock results from excessive dilation of blood vessels, the symptoms are somewhat different. The skin may be warm and flushed, and the pulse may be strong and forceful (bounding) rather than weak, particularly at first. However, later on, shock due to excessive dilation of blood vessels also produces cold, clammy skin and lethargy. In the earliest stages of shock, especially septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body. In older people, the only symptom may be confusion. Urine flow may be reduced (because blood supply to the kidneys is reduced), and waste products may build up in the blood. The blood pressure may be low. Diagnosis of Shock Doctor's evaluation Blood tests Other tests depending on the probable cause The diagnosis of shock is based mainly on evidence of organ malfunction found on a doctor's evaluation. For example, people May have a reduced level of consciousness May not be producing urine May have bluish fingers or toes People may also show signs of trying to compensate for their low blood volume or their heart's inadequate pumping. For example, they may have a rapid heart rate, be breathing rapidly, or be perspiring profusely. Blood tests can help the diagnosis, but no finding alone is diagnostic, and doctors evaluate each by its trend (ie, worsening or improving) and in light of the person's overall condition. One blood test (the level of lactate) measures the amount of waste products of cellular activity in the blood. An elevated blood lactate level suggests to the doctor that the organs are not receiving enough oxygen and blood and that the person may have shock. Blood tests that show a high or low white blood cell count Complete blood count Doctors select tests to help diagnose blood disorders based on the person's symptoms and the results of the physical examination. Blood tests may also indicate damage to specific organs. For example, a high level of creatinine can indicate that the kidneys are damaged, and a high level of troponin (a cardiac biomarker) can indicate that the heart is damaged. Other tests are done depending on the probable cause of shock. For example, doctors do cultures of blood and other body fluids Culture of Microorganisms Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. They may do electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded. Prognosis for Shock Untreated shock is usually fatal. If shock is treated, the outlook depends on the Cause of the shock Person's age Other disorders the person has Presence and severity of any organ failure Amount of time that passes before treatment begins Type of treatment given Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome carries a significant risk of death. The risk of death increases as the number of affected organs increases. Regardless of treatment, the likelihood of death due to shock after a massive heart attack or due to septic shock, especially in older people, is high. Treatment of Shock Calling for help and stopping any bleeding Intravenous (IV) fluids and/or blood transfusions Sometimes drugs to help increase blood pressure Other measures depending on cause Initial treatment Most important is to call for help and stop any major bleeding. After doing that, the person can be laid down and kept warm, with the legs elevated. When emergency medical personnel arrive, they may provide oxygen through a face mask or insert a breathing tube. Fluids may be given by vein (intravenously) at a fast rate and in large volumes to raise blood pressure. On arrival at an emergency department, the person may be given a blood transfusion Overview of Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or a blood component from one healthy person (a donor) to a sick person (a recipient). Usually, blood is cross-matched before transfusion, but in an emergency when there is no time for crossmatching, type O negative blood can be given to anyone. If shock is caused by severe infection, doctors give intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If shock is caused by a heart attack or other heart problem, other procedures or surgery may be needed. For some types of shock, drugs may be given intravenously to increase blood pressure. However, doctors use such drugs for as brief a time as possible because they can reduce blood flow to other tissues in the body or cause heart rhythm problems. Drugs can increase blood pressure by Constricting blood vessels, which happens, for example, when doctors give epinephrine (used for people with anaphylaxis) or norepinephrine (sometimes used for people with other forms of shock) Increasing the ability of heart to pump blood, which happens, for example, when doctors give dobutamine or milrinone Treatment of cause Fluids given intravenously, blood transfusions, and drugs may not be enough to counteract shock if bleeding or fluid loss continues or if shock is caused by a heart attack, infection, or another problem unrelated to blood volume. Treating the cause of shock is vital. When shock is caused by an inadequate pumping action of the heart, efforts are made to improve the heart’s performance. In addition to fluids and drugs, other treatments include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. Surgery may also be needed if the cause is a damaged heart valve Overview of Heart Valve Disorders Heart valves regulate the flow of blood through the heart's four chambers—two small, round upper chambers (atria) and two larger, cone-shaped lower chambers (ventricles). Excess fluid that compresses the heart, a condition called cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is pressure on the heart by blood or fluid that accumulates in the two-layered sac around the heart (pericardium). When shock is caused by an infection (such as sepsis Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body. When shock is caused by bleeding, surgery may be necessary to stop the bleeding.

Funduscopic examination shows arteriolar constriction, arteriovenous nicking, vascular wall changes, flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, yellow hard exudates, and optic disk edema. Treatment is directed at controlling blood pressure and, when vision loss occurs, treating the retina. Pathophysiology of Hypertensive Retinopathy Acute blood pressure elevation typically causes reversible vasoconstriction in retinal blood vessels, and hypertensive crisis may cause optic disk edema. More prolonged or severe hypertension leads to exudative vascular changes, a consequence of endothelial damage and necrosis. Other changes (eg, arteriole wall thickening, arteriovenous nicking) typically require years of elevated blood pressure to develop. Smoking compounds the adverse effects of hypertensive retinopathy. Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Central Retinal Artery Occlusion and Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion Central retinal artery occlusion occurs when the central retinal artery becomes blocked, usually due to an embolus. It causes sudden, painless, unilateral, and usually severe vision loss.Central Retinal Vein Occlusion and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion Central retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the central retinal vein by a thrombus. It causes painless vision loss, ranging from mild to severe, and usually occurs suddenly. Also, hypertension combined with diabetes greatly increases risk of vision loss. Patients with hypertensive retinopathy are at high risk of hypertensive damage to other end organs. Symptoms and Signs of Hypertensive Retinopathy Symptoms usually do not develop until late in the disease and include blurred vision or visual field defects. In the early stages, funduscopy identifies arteriolar constriction, with a decrease in the ratio of the width of the retinal arterioles to the retinal venules. Chronic, poorly controlled hypertension causes the following: Permanent arterial narrowing Arteriovenous crossing abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking) Arteriosclerosis with moderate vascular wall changes (copper wiring) to more severe vascular wall hyperplasia and thickening (silver wiring) Sometimes total vascular occlusion occurs. Arteriovenous nicking is a major predisposing factor to the development of a branch retinal vein occlusion. If acute disease is severe, the following can develop: Superficial flame-shaped hemorrhages Small, white, superficial foci of retinal ischemia (cotton-wool spots) Yellow hard exudates Optic disk edema Hypertensive Retinopathy Hypertensive Retinopathy (Moderate) Moderate hypertensive retinopathy is characterized by thinned, straight arteries, intraretinal hemorrhages, and yellow hard exudates.

The image also shows a characteristic star-shaped macular lesion caused by leaking retinal vessels. © Springer Science+Business Media Yellow hard exudates represent intraretinal lipid deposition from leaking retinal vessels. These exudates can develop a star shape within the macula, particularly when hypertension is severe. In severe hypertension, the optic disk becomes congested and edematous (papilledema indicating hypertensive crisis Hypertensive Emergencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys). Diagnosis of Hypertensive Retinopathy Diagnosis is by history (duration and severity of hypertension) and funduscopy. Treatment of Hypertensive Retinopathy Hypertensive retinopathy is managed primarily by controlling hypertension. Other vision-threatening conditions should also be aggressively controlled. If vision loss occurs, treatment of the retinal edema with laser or with intravitreal injection of corticosteroids or antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs (eg, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, bevacizumab) may be useful. Key Points Chronic hypertension progressively damages the retina, causing few or no symptoms until changes are advanced. Chronic hypertensive retinopathy is recognized by permanent arterial narrowing, arteriovenous crossing abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking), arteriosclerosis with moderate vascular wall changes (copper wiring), or more severe vascular wall hyperplasia and thickening (silver wiring). Hypertensive crisis can cause retinopathy with superficial flame-shaped hemorrhages; small, white, superficial foci of retinal ischemia (cotton-wool spots); yellow hard exudates; and optic disk edema.

{"seq_id": "5aa81eca-d398-4e10-95d0-a99c61371d2a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Secretory otitis media is an effusion in the middle ear resulting from incomplete resolution of acute otitis media or obstruction of the eustachian tube without infection. Symptoms include hearing loss and a sense of fullness or pressure in the ear. Diagnosis is based on appearance of the tympanic membrane and sometimes on tympanometry. Most cases resolve in 2 to 3 weeks. If there is no improvement in 1 to 3 months, some form of myringotomy is indicated, usually with insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Antibiotics and decongestants are not effective. Normally, the middle ear is ventilated 3 to 4 times a minute as the eustachian tube opens during swallowing, and oxygen is absorbed by blood in the vessels of the middle ear mucous membrane. If patency of the eustachian tube is impaired, a relative negative pressure develops within the middle ear, which can lead to fluid accumulation. This fluid may cause hearing loss. Secretory otitis media is a common sequela to acute otitis media Otitis Media (Acute) Acute otitis media is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, usually accompanying an upper respiratory infection. In other cases, eustachian tube obstruction may be secondary to inflammatory processes in the nasopharynx, allergies, hypertrophic adenoids or other obstructive lymphoid aggregations on the torus of the eustachian tube and in the Rosenmüller fossa, or benign or malignant tumors. The effusion may be sterile or (more commonly) contain pathogenic bacteria sometimes as a biofilm, although inflammation is not observed. Symptoms and Signs of Secretory Otitis Media Patients may report no symptoms, but some (or their family members) note hearing loss. Patients may experience a feeling of fullness, pressure, or popping in the ear with swallowing. Otalgia is rare. Various possible changes to the tympanic membrane (TM) include an amber or gray color, displacement of the light reflex, mild to severe retraction, and accentuated landmarks. On air insufflation, the TM may be immobile. An air-fluid level or bubbles of air may be visible through the TM. Diagnosis of Secretory Otitis Media Examination with pneumatic otoscopy Tympanometry Nasopharyngeal examination Diagnosis of secretory otitis media is clinical and uses pneumatic otoscopy, in which an insufflator attached to the otoscope head is used to move the tympanic membrane (fluid in the middle ear, a perforation, or tympanosclerosis inhibits this movement). Tympanometry Hearing Loss Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss ( 1). Adults and adolescents must undergo nasopharyngeal examination to exclude malignant or benign tumors. Nasopharyngeal malignancy should particularly be suspected in cases of unilateral secretory otitis media. If malignancy is suspected or demonstrated by biopsy, imaging studies should be done. Treatment of Secretory Otitis Media Observation If unresolved, myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion If recurrent in childhood, sometimes adenoidectomy For most patients, watchful waiting is all that is required. Antibiotics and decongestants are not helpful. For patients in whom allergies are clearly involved, antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids may be helpful. If no improvement occurs in 1 to 3 months, myringotomy may be done for aspiration of fluid and insertion of a tympanostomy tube, which allows ventilation of the middle ear and temporarily ameliorates eustachian tube obstruction, regardless of cause. Tympanostomy tubes may be inserted for persistent conductive hearing loss secondary to middle ear fluid which does not clear. Tympanostomy tubes can help prevent recurrences of acute otitis media Otitis Media (Acute) Acute otitis media is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, usually accompanying an upper respiratory infection. Occasionally, the middle ear is temporarily ventilated with the Valsalva maneuver or politzerization. To do the Valsalva maneuver, patients keep their mouth closed and try to forcibly blow air out through their pinched nostrils (ie, popping the ear). To do politzerization, the physician blows air with a special syringe (middle ear inflator) into one of the patient’s nostrils and blocks the other while the patient swallows. This forces the air into the eustachian tube and middle ear. Neither procedure should be done if the patient has a cold and rhinorrhea. Persistent, recurrent secretory otitis media may require correction of underlying nasopharyngeal conditions. In children, particularly adolescent boys, a nasopharyngeal angiofibroma should be ruled out and, in adults, nasopharyngeal carcinoma must be ruled out. Children may benefit from adenoidectomy, including the removal of the central adenoid mass as well as lymphoid aggregations on the torus of the eustachian tube and in the Rosenmüller fossa. Antibiotics should be given for bacterial rhinitis, sinusitis, and/or nasopharyngitis. Demonstrated allergens should be eliminated from the patient’s environment and immunotherapy should be considered. Susceptible young children with prolonged hearing loss from longstanding serous otitis may require appropriate therapy Treatment of Hearing Loss in Children Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss ( 1). Because environmental pressure changes can cause painful barotrauma, scuba diving and air travel should be avoided or delayed when possible. If air travel cannot be avoided, chewing food or drinking (eg, from a bottle) may help in young children. A Valsalva maneuver or politzerization (eg, during descent) may help older children and adults. Key Points Secretory otitis media is noninflammatory middle ear effusion usually following acute otitis media. Diagnosis is clinical; adults and adolescents must undergo nasopharyngeal examination and sometimes imaging studies to exclude malignant or benign tumors. If unresolved in 1 to 3 months, myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion may be needed.

Patients have abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the shoulder, and tenderness. Diagnosis is made by CT or ultrasonography. Treatment is with observation and sometimes surgical repair; rarely, partial hepatectomy is necessary.  Etiology Significant impact (eg, motor vehicle crash) can damage the liver, as can penetrating trauma (eg, knife wound, gunshot wound). Hepatic injuries range from subcapsular hematomas and small capsular lacerations to deep parenchymal lacerations, major crush injury, and vascular avulsion. Classification Hepatic injuries are classified according to severity into 6 grades. Table Grades of Hepatic Injury Grade Injury 1 Subcapsular hematoma < 10% of surface area Laceration < 1 cm deep 2 Subcapsular hematoma 10‒50% of surface area, intraparenchymal hematoma < 10 cm Laceration 1‒3 cm deep and < 10 cm long 3 Subcapsular hematoma > 50% of surface area, intraparenchymal hematoma > 10 cm or any expanding or ruptured hematoma Laceration > 3 cm deep 4 Parenchymal disruption involving 25‒75% of a hepatic lobe or 1‒3 Couinaud segments within a single lobe 5 Parenchymal disruption involving > 75% of a hepatic lobe or > 3 Couinaud segments Juxtahepatic venous injuries (ie, retrohepatic vena cava or central major hepatic veins) 6 Hepatic avulsion Pathophysiology The main immediate consequence is hemorrhage. The amount of hemorrhage may be small or large, depending on the nature and degree of injury. Many small lacerations, particularly in children, cease bleeding spontaneously. Larger injuries hemorrhage extensively, often causing hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. Mortality is significant in high-grade liver injuries. Complications The overall incidence of complications is < 7% but can be as high as 15 to 20% in high-grade injuries. Deep parenchymal lacerations can lead to a biliary fistula or biloma formation. In biliary fistula, bile leaks freely into the abdominal or thoracic cavity. A biloma is a contained collection of bile similar to an abscess. Bilomas are typically treated with percutaneous drainage. For biliary fistulas, biliary decompression through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Imaging is essential for accurately diagnosing biliary tract disorders and is important for detecting focal liver lesions (eg, abscess, tumor)ERCP) is highly successful. Abscesses develop in about 3 to 5% of injuries, often because of devitalized tissue being exposed to biliary contents. Diagnosis is suspected in patients in whom pain, temperature, and white blood count (WBC) increase in the days after injury; confirmation is by CT. Abscesses are usually treated with percutaneous drainage, but laparotomy may be necessary when percutaneous management fails. Symptoms and Signs The manifestations of severe abdominal hemorrhage, including hemorrhagic shock, and abdominal pain, tenderness, and distention, are usually clinically obvious. Lesser hemorrhage or hematomas cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness. Diagnosis Imaging (CT or ultrasonography) A hepatic injury is confirmed with CT in stable patients and with bedside ultrasonography or exploratory laparotomy in unstable patients. Treatment Observation Sometimes embolization or surgical repair Hemodynamically stable patients who have no other indications for laparotomy (eg, hollow viscus perforation) can be observed with monitoring of vital signs and serial hematocrit (Hct) levels. Patients with significant ongoing hemorrhage (ie, those with hypotension and shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death.Hct) require intervention. Patients whose vital signs are stable but who require ongoing transfusion may be candidates for angiography with selective embolization of bleeding vessels. Unstable patients should undergo laparotomy. Success rates for nonoperative management are about 92% for grade 1 and 2 injuries, 80% for grade 3 injuries, 72% for grade 4 injuries, and 62% for grade 5 injuries. Following nonoperative management, there is no consensus in the literature regarding length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, resumption of diet, duration of bedrest, or limitation of activity once discharged (1 Treatment reference Hepatic injury can result from blunt or penetrating trauma. However, the more severe the injury, the more care should be taken before permitting resumption of activities that may involve heavy lifting, contact sports, or torso trauma. When surgery is done, small lacerations can typically be sutured or treated with hemostatic agents (eg, oxidized cellulose, fibrin glue, mixtures of thrombin and powdered gelatin). Surgical management of deeper and more complex injuries can be complicated. Key Points The main immediate consequence of hepatic injuries is bleeding, which often stops spontaneously, particularly if injuries are grade 1 or 2, but may require embolization or surgical repair; mortality and morbidity can be significant in high-grade injuries. Complications include formation of biliary fistulas, bilomas, and abscesses. Confirm the diagnosis by CT in stable patients. Treat patients using laparotomy (if unstable), observation (if stable), or sometimes selective angiographic embolization (eg, if stable but requiring ongoing transfusion).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "46298984-b03d-4310-afe6-041c9e29ab75", "title": null, "text": "【0】Learning disorders involve an inability to acquire, retain, or broadly use specific skills or information, resulting from deficiencies in attention, memory, or reasoning and affecting academic performance. Affected children may be slow to learn names of colors or letters, to count, or to learn to read or write. Children take a series of academic and intelligence tests given by learning specialists, and doctors may apply established criteria to make the diagnosis. Treatment involves a learning plan tailored to the child’s skills. Learning disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders Definition of Developmental Disorders Developmental disorders are better called neurodevelopmental disorders. Learning disorders affect only certain functions, whereas in children with intellectual disability, difficulties affect cognitive functions broadly. Overview of Learning Disorders VIDEO Three common types of learning disorders are Reading disorders of written expression Mathematics disorders Thus, children with learning disorders may have significant difficulty understanding and learning math, but have no difficulty reading, writing, and doing well in other subjects. Dyslexia is a specific reading disorder involving difficulty separating single words from groups of words and parts of words (phonemes) within each word. Learning disorders do not include learning problems that are due primarily to problems of vision, hearing, coordination, or emotional disturbance, although these problems can also occur in children with learning disorders. Children may be born with a learning disorder or develop one as they grow. Although the causes of learning disorders are not fully understood, they include abnormalities in the basic processes involved in understanding or in using spoken or written language or numerical and spatial reasoning.Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new high blood pressure or worsening of existing high blood pressure that is accompanied by excess protein in the urine and that develops after the 20th week of pregnancy.Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.Jaundice in the Newborn Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream.Postterm Newborns A postterm newborn is a baby delivered after 42 weeks of gestation. After birth, possible factors include exposure to environmental toxins such as lead Poisoning Lead poisoning affects many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, kidneys, liver, and blood.Undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients. Traumatic events that occur during childhood, such as child abuse and maltreatment, also can contribute to the development of learning disorders. Although the total number of children in the United States with learning disorders is unknown, in the 2019–2020 school year, 7.3 million students (or 14% of all public school students) ages 3 to 21 in the United States received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Among students receiving these special education services, 33% (or about 5% of all students) had specific learning disabilities. Boys with learning disorders may outnumber girls five to one, although girls are often not recognized or diagnosed as having learning disorders. Many children, particularly those with behavioral problems, do poorly in school and are tested by educational psychologists for learning disorders. However, some children with certain types of learning disorders hide their deficits well, avoiding diagnosis and therefore treatment, for a long time.  Learning disorders can occur in children with normal and high intellectual function. Symptoms of Learning Disorders Young children may be slow to learn the names of colors or letters, to assign words to familiar objects, to count, and to progress in other early learning skills. Learning to read and write may be delayed. Affected children may have difficulty with activities that require fine motor coordination, such as printing and copying, and may have very messy handwriting or hold a pencil awkwardly. Children who have a learning disorder may have trouble organizing or beginning tasks or retelling a story in sequential order, or confuse math symbols and misread numbers. Children with learning disorders may have difficulty communicating. Some children initially become frustrated and later develop behavioral problems, such as being easily distracted, hyperactive, withdrawn, shy, or aggressive.ADHD) often occur together. Diagnosis of Learning Disorders Educational, medical, and psychologic evaluations Established criteria Children who are not reading or learning at the level expected for their age should be evaluated. Doctors examine children for any physical disorders that could interfere with learning, including doing hearing and vision tests. Hearing and vision disorders should not be mistaken for a learning disorder. Children take a series of intelligence tests, both verbal and nonverbal, and academic tests of reading, writing, and math skills. Often these tests can be done by specialists at the child’s school, at the parents’ request. In the United States and other nations, schools are required by law to provide testing and appropriate accommodations. A psychologic evaluation is done to determine whether the child has emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression, or a developmental disorder, such as ADHD, because these disorders often coexist with a learning disability and can make the disability worse. Psychologists ask about the child's attitude toward school and relationships and assess the child's self-esteem and self-confidence. The following areas are evaluated, and these criteria are used to help determine whether a child has a learning disorder: Reading Understanding the meaning of written material Spelling Writing (for example, using proper grammar and punctuation, expressing ideas clearly) Understanding what numbers mean and their relationship to one another (in older children, doing simple calculations) Mathematical reasoning (for example, using mathematical concepts to solve problems) Children who are significantly below the level expected for their age in at least one of these areas for 6 months or longer despite treatment may have a learning disorder. Treatment of Learning Disorders Educational management Sometimes psychostimulant drugs The most useful treatment for a learning disorder is education that is carefully tailored to the individual child. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to children and adolescents with learning disorders. Education must be provided in the least restrictive, most inclusive setting possible—that is, a setting where the children have every opportunity to interact with nondisabled peers and have equal access to community resources. The Americans with Disability Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act also provide for accommodations in schools and other public settings. Measures such as eliminating food additives, taking large doses of vitamins, and analyzing the child’s system for trace minerals are often tried but unproved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Others (such as gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder.  Hepatitis is common throughout the world. Liver or gallbladder problems may result from hormonal changes during pregnancy. Some changes cause only minor, transient symptoms. During pregnancy, jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. They include Acute viral hepatitis Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, generally meaning inflammation caused by infection with one of the five hepatitis viruses. This slowing is called cholestasis is reduction or stoppage of bile flow. Bile is the digestive fluid produced by the liver. Disorders of the liver, bile duct, or pancreas can cause cholestasis. Cholestasis of pregnancy can increase the risk of the following: Premature birth Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation. Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus. No rash develops. Urine may be dark, and jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. For intense itching, a drug called ursodeoxycholic acid, taken by mouth, may be prescribed. Cholestasis of pregnancy usually resolves after delivery but tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies or with use of oral contraceptives. Cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems. The diagnosis of preterm labor is usually obvious. Cirrhosis can cause varicose veins (widened, convoluted veins) to develop around the esophagus (called esophageal varices). Pregnancy slightly increases the risk that these veins will bleed profusely, especially during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Fatty liver of pregnancy This rare disorder can develop toward the end of pregnancy. The cause is unknown. Symptoms of fatty liver of pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and jaundice. The disorder may rapidly worsen, and liver failure may develop. Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new high blood pressure or worsening of existing high blood pressure that is accompanied by excess protein in the urine and that develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. Diagnosis of fatty liver of pregnancy is based on results of the doctor's evaluation, liver tests, and other blood tests and may be confirmed by a liver biopsy. The doctor may advise women to immediately end the pregnancy. The risk of death for pregnant women and the fetus is high in severe cases. Consequently in such cases, doctors may recommend that the baby be delivered promptly or the pregnancy be terminated. Women who survive recover completely. Usually, fatty liver of pregnancy does not recur in subsequent pregnancies. gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder. Pregnant women who develop gallstones are closely monitored. If a gallstone blocks the gallbladder or causes an infection, surgery may be necessary. This surgery is usually safe for pregnant women and the fetus. Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, generally meaning inflammation caused by infection with one of the five hepatitis viruses. It is also the most common cause of jaundice during pregnancy. Pregnancy does not worsen most types of hepatis (hepatitis A, B, C, and D), but hepatitis E may become more severe during pregnancy. Hepatitis B may be transmitted to the baby immediately after delivery or, less often, during the pregnancy. Most infected babies have no symptoms and have only mild liver dysfunction. But they may become carriers of the infection and transmit it to others. All pregnant women are tested for hepatitis, and if they are infected, measures are taken to prevent the baby from being infected. Women with chronic hepatitis Overview of Chronic Hepatitis Chronic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that lasts at least 6 months. Common causes include hepatitis B and C viruses and certain drugs. If they become pregnant, they are more likely to miscarry or to give birth prematurely. If these women were taking corticosteroids before the pregnancy, they can continue to take these drugs during pregnancy. Sometimes, when the infection is severe, women with chronic hepatitis are given antiviral drugs during the 3rd trimester. These drugs may reduce the risk of transmitting the hepatitis virus to the fetus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Nail trauma is common.Onychomycosis is fungal infection of the nail plate, nail bed, or both. The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow.Acute Paronychia is infection of the periungual tissues. Acute paronychia causes redness, warmth, and pain along the nail margin. Diagnosis is by inspection.Retronychia is a less common form of paronychia, which is infection of the periungual tissues.Ingrown Toenail An ingrown toenail is incurvation or impingement of a nail border into its adjacent nail fold, causing pain. . Nail changes may occur in many systemic conditions and genetic syndromes or result from trauma. Most nail infections are fungal (Onychomycosis is fungal infection of the nail plate, nail bed, or both. The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow.Discoloration [Pseudomonas], herpetic whitlow Herpetic Whitlow Herpetic whitlow is a cutaneous infection of the distal aspect of the finger caused by herpes simplex virus. Even parasitic infestation such as crusted scabies is an infestation of the skin with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Paronychia is not actually an infection of the nail but rather of periungual tissues. Common warts are common, benign, epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection. They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies. Diagnosis is by examination. Onychophagia (nail-biting) can help spread this infection. Warts involving these areas are especially difficult to treat. Toenails require special attention in older people and in people with diabetes or peripheral vascular disease; a podiatrist can help avoid local breakdown and secondary infections by assisting in routine nail trimming.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
