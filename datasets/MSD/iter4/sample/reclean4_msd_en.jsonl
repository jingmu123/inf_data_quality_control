A flexible catheter is passed retrograde through the urethra into the bladder. Several types of catheters are available. Sometimes the urethra is impassable, requiring suprapubic catheterization of the bladder.\n【1】 Indications Relief of acute or chronic urinary retention, such as due to urethral or prostatic obstruction ,obstructive uropathy Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy).\n【2】 Symptoms can include overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retention.\n【3】 Most major urethral injuries are due to blunt trauma.\n【4】 In such cases, urethral disruption should be ruled out with imaging ,eg, by retrograde urethrography Genitourinary Imaging Tests Imaging tests are often used to evaluate patients with renal and urologic disorders.\n【5】 Paraphimosis is entrapment of the foreskin in the retracted position; it is a medical emergency.\n【6】 †A coudé catheter is curved at the end and may facilitate passage in a male with significant prostatic hypertrophy.\n【7】 Relevant Anatomy The male urethra bends acutely at the pubis. Always hold the penis straight and upright, to smooth out the curve, when passing a catheter through the urethra. Positioning Position the patient supine with hips comfortably abducted. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Place all equipment within easy reach on an uncontaminated sterile field on a bedside tray. You may put the box containing the catheter and the drainage system between the patient’s legs, so that it is easily accessible during the procedure. If not done already, attach the catheter to the collecting system and do not break the seal unless a different type or size of catheter or irrigation of the catheter is required. Test the retention balloon for integrity by inflating it with water, and apply lubricant to the catheter tip. Saturate the applicator swabs, cotton balls, or gauze with povidone iodine. Place the sterile fenestrated drape over the pelvis so that the penis remains exposed. Grasp the shaft of the penis using your nondominant hand, and retract the foreskin if the patient is uncircumcised. This hand is now nonsterile and must not be removed from the penis or touch any of the equipment during the rest of the procedure. Cleanse the glans penis with applicator swabs, gauze, or cotton balls saturated in povidone iodine. Use a circular motion, beginning at the meatus, and work your way outward. Discard or set aside the newly contaminated items. Inject viscous lidocaine into the urethra. Insert the hub of the lidocaine-containing syringe into the penile meatus and inject about 5 mL. Pinch the meatus closed, to retain the lidocaine within the urethra, for at least 1 minute. The lidocaine distends the urethra, as well as provides some anesthesia, thereby easing catheter passage. Hold the catheter in your free hand. If a coudé catheter is being used, the tip should point upward, so as to track the superior urethral wall during insertion. Advance the catheter slowly through the urethra and into the urinary bladder. Patient discomfort is common. Ask the patient to relax and take slow deep breaths as you continue to apply steady pressure on the catheter until it is fully advanced to the level of the side port. Urine should flow freely into the collection tubing. Slowly inflate the balloon with 5 to 10 mL of water. Obvious resistance or patient discomfort suggests incorrect placement. If this happens, deflate the balloon, withdraw the catheter slightly, and then reinsert the catheter all the way before trying to reinflate the balloon. Position the balloon at the bladder neck, after successful balloon inflation, by slowly withdrawing the catheter until you feel resistance. To prevent paraphimosis Phimosis is inability to retract the foreskin. Paraphimosis is entrapment of the foreskin in the retracted position; it is a medical emergency.\n【8】 How To Do Urethral Catheterization in Males VIDEO Aftercare Remove the drapes. Secure the catheter to the thigh with an adhesive bandage, tape, or strap. Some advocate taping the catheter to the lower abdominal wall to minimize pressure on the posterior urethra. Place the bag below the level of the patient to ensure that urine can drain via gravity.\n【9】 Be sure to reduce the foreskin after the procedure. Be careful not to use excessive force during insertion, which could potentially cause urethral injury. Tips and Tricks Do not continue attempts at catheter placement if significant resistance is met or if the catheter feels to be buckling inside the urethra and not advancing. Urine will appear in the catheter before the balloon has advanced beyond the prostate. Continue advancing the catheter completely to the end of the catheter before inflating the balloon, to avoid inflating the balloon in the prostate or urethral lumen, which will cause significant bleeding. If the catheter appears to be in the correct position, but urine does not return, lubricant may be obstructing drainage of urine. Flush the catheter with normal saline to dislodge the lubricant and see if urine returns. If the balloon is difficult to inflate or the balloon port distends during inflation, the proximal end of the catheter is not in the correct position. Deflate the balloon and advance the catheter further into the bladder. If correct positioning is questioned, flush the catheter with 30 to 60 mL of normal saline. If the fluid can be flushed and aspirated easily, then the catheter is in the correct position. A catheter that will not irrigate is not in proper position. Consult a urologist for any questions regarding catheter size and style or difficulty placing a catheter.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#8#8# VIDEO ", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:38", "update_time": "2024-04-02 01:15:44"}

Diagnosis is by MRI or CT. Treatment may involve nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a soft cervical collar or cervical laminectomy.\n【1】 Cervical spondylosis due to osteoarthritis is common. Occasionally, particularly when the spinal canal is congenitally narrow (< 10 mm), osteoarthritis leads to stenosis of the canal and bony impingement on the cord, causing compression and myelopathy (functional disturbance of the spinal cord). Hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum can aggravate this effect. Osteophytes in the neural foramina, most commonly between C5 and C6 or C6 and C7, can cause radiculopathy ,a nerve root disorder Nerve Root Disorders Nerve root disorders result in segmental radicular deficits (eg, pain or paresthesias in a dermatomal distribution, weakness of muscles innervated by the root).\n【2】 Sometimes the cord and nerve roots are affected, causing radiculomyelopathy. Manifestations vary according to the neural structures involved but commonly include pain. Symptoms and Signs Cord compression commonly causes gradual spastic paresis and/or paresthesias in the hands and feet and may cause hyperreflexia. Neurologic deficits may be asymmetric, nonsegmental, and aggravated by cough or Valsalva maneuvers. After trauma, people with cervical spondylosis may develop a central cord syndrome . Eventually, muscle atrophy and flaccid paresis may develop in the upper extremities at the level of the lesion, with spasticity below the level of the lesion. Nerve root compression commonly causes early radicular pain; later, there may be weakness, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. Diagnosis MRI or CT Cervical spondylosis is suspected when characteristic neurologic deficits occur in patients who are older, have osteoarthritis, or have radicular pain at the C5 or C6 levels. Diagnosis of cervical spondylosis is by MRI, CT, or CT myelography. Treatment For cord involvement or refractory radiculopathy, cervical laminectomy For radiculopathy only, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a soft cervical collar If the cord is severely compressed, cervical laminectomy is usually needed; a posterior approach can relieve the compression but leaves anterior compressive osteophytes and may result in spinal instability and kyphosis. Thus, an anterior approach with spinal fusion is generally preferred. Patients with only radiculopathy may try nonsurgical treatment with NSAIDs and a soft cervical collar; if this approach is ineffective, surgical decompression may be required. Indications for surgical decompression include Intractable pain Spinal cord compromise (eg, progressive weakness, bowel and bladder dysfunction) If muscle spasms occur, muscle relaxants (such as baclofen) may help relieve spasticity.

Cord compression commonly causes gradual spastic paresis and/or paresthesias in the hands and feet and may cause hyperreflexia, eventually resulting in muscle atrophy, with flaccid paresis in the upper extremities at the level of the compression, and spasticity below that level. Nerve root compression commonly causes early radicular pain, sometimes followed by weakness, hyporeflexia, and muscle atrophy. Diagnose using MRI or CT.

The coronary arteries Blood Supply of the Heart The heart and blood vessels constitute the cardiovascular (circulatory) system. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs so it can pick up oxygen and then pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n【1】 Coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【2】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【3】 In an acute coronary syndrome, sudden blockage in a coronary artery greatly reduces or cuts off the blood supply to an area of the heart muscle (myocardium). The lack of blood supply to any tissue is termed ischemia. If the supply is greatly reduced or cut off for more than a few minutes, heart tissue dies. A heart attack, also termed myocardial infarction (MI), is death of heart tissue due to ischemia. There are many different reasons doctors give drugs to people with coronary artery disease: \n【4】 To relieve chest pain by reducing the heart's workload and widening arteries (nitrates) To prevent angina and acute coronary symptoms from occurring (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and sometimes ranolazine) To prevent and reverse coronary artery narrowing from atherosclerosis (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs], statins, and antiplatelet drugs) To open a blocked artery (clot-dissolving drugs, anticoagulants) Nitrates Most people are given nitroglycerin, which relieves pain by lowering blood pressure, which reduces the workload of the heart, and possibly by dilating arteries. Usually, it is first given under the tongue, then intravenously. Morphine Most people who have had a heart attack are experiencing severe discomfort and anxiety. Morphine has a calming effect and reduces the workload of the heart. It is given when nitroglycerin cannot be used or is not effective; however, recent data suggest it may interact with antiplatelet drugs Antiplatelet drugs The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. The coronary arteries, which branch off the aorta just after it leaves the heart, deliver this blood.\n【5】 Beta-blockers Because decreasing the heart’s workload also helps limit tissue damage, a beta-blocker is usually given to slow the heart rate. Slowing the rate enables the heart to work less hard and reduces the area of damaged tissue. Calcium channel blockers Calcium channel blockers prevent blood vessels from narrowing (constricting) and can counter coronary artery spasm. All calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure. Some of these drugs, such as verapamil and diltiazem, may also reduce the heart rate. This effect can be useful to many people, especially those who cannot take beta-blockers or who do not get enough relief from nitrates. Ranolazine is a drug used to treat angina in people who continue to have symptoms despite taking all other antianginal therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers Angiotensin-converting enzyme Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors High blood pressure is very common. It often does not cause symptoms; however, high blood pressure can increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure.\n【6】 It often does not cause symptoms; however, high blood pressure can increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure.\n【7】 Therefore, these drugs are usually given in the first few days after a heart attack and prescribed indefinitely. Statins Treatment Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【8】 Doctors give a statin to people who are not already taking one. Antiplatelet drugs People who think they may be having a heart attack should chew an aspirin tablet immediately after calling an ambulance. If aspirin is not taken at home or given by emergency personnel, it is immediately given at the hospital. This therapy improves the chances of survival by reducing the size of the clot (if present) in the coronary artery. People may also be given other types of antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or ticagrelor taken by mouth, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors given by vein (intravenously). Clot-dissolving drugs Clot-dissolving drugs (thrombolytic drugs) are given intravenously to open the arteries if percutaneous coronary interventions Opening the arteries Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery.\n【9】 Anticoagulants Most people are also given an anticoagulant drug, such as heparin, to help prevent the formation of additional blood clots. Often, oxygen is given through nasal prongs or a face mask.

Couples should be given time alone to formulate questions. Couples can be told about information that is available on the Internet ,www.acog.\n【2】 Many couples (eg, those with known or suspected risk factors) benefit from referral to genetic specialists for presentation of information and testing options. Parents with risk factors for genetic abnormalities are advised about possible outcomes and options for genetic evaluation Prenatal Genetic Testing of Parents Genetic testing is part of routine prenatal care and is ideally done before conception.\n【3】 If testing identifies a disorder, reproductive options are discussed. Preconception reproductive options for patients with genetic disorders include Donor sperm if the man is a carrier Donor oocytes if the woman is a carrier In vitro fertilization In vitro fertilization (IVF) Assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) involve manipulation of sperm and ova or embryos in vitro with the goal of producing a pregnancy.\n【4】 Postconception reproductive options include Pregnancy termination Induced Abortion In the US, about half of pregnancies are unintended.

A balanced parental chromosomal rearrangement should be suspected if couples have had recurrent spontaneous abortions, infertility, or a child with a malformation. The chance of a fetal chromosomal disorder increases as maternal age increases because rates of nondisjunction (failure of chromosomes to separate normally) during meiosis increase. The risk of common aneuploidies by maternal age ,1 Risk factors for congenital disorders references Prenatal genetic counseling is provided for all prospective parents, ideally before conception, to assess risk factors for congenital disorders.\n【11】(1/1438) Most chromosomal disorders due to older maternal age involve an extra chromosome (trisomy), particularly trisomy 21 ,Down syndrome Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21) Down syndrome is an anomaly of chromosome 21 that can cause intellectual disability, microcephaly, short stature, and characteristic facies.\n【12】 Paternal age > 50 increases risk of some spontaneous dominant pathogenic gene variants (formerly termed mutations), such as achondroplasia Osteochondrodysplasias (Osteochondrodysplastic Dwarfism) , in offspring. Some chromosomal disorders are submicroscopic and thus not identified by traditional karyotyping. The submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities, sometimes called copy number variants, occur independently of the age-related nondisjunction mechanisms. The precise incidence of these abnormalities is unclear, but incidence is higher in fetuses with structural abnormalities. A multicenter study sponsored by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) demonstrated a 1% incidence of clinically relevant copy number variants in fetuses with normal karyotypes independent of indication for testing and a 6% incidence in fetuses with structural abnormalities ,2 Risk factors for congenital disorders references Prenatal genetic counseling is provided for all prospective parents, ideally before conception, to assess risk factors for congenital disorders.\n【13】 An autosomal dominant Autosomal Dominant Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood.\n【14】 If one parent has an autosomal dominant disorder, risk is 50% that the disorder will be transmitted to an offspring. For an autosomal recessive Autosomal Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood.\n【15】 Parents may be heterozygous (carriers) and, if so, are usually clinically normal. If both parents are carriers, offspring (male or female) are at a 25% risk of being homozygous for the pathogenic gene variant and thus affected, 50% are likely to be heterozygous, and 25% are likely to be genetically normal. If only siblings and no other relatives are affected, an autosomal recessive disorder should be suspected. Likelihood that both parents carry the same autosomal recessive trait is increased if they are consanguineous. Because females have two X chromosomes and males have only one, X-linked recessive disorders X-Linked Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood.\n【16】 Such disorders are usually transmitted through clinically normal, heterozygous (carrier) females. Thus, for each son of a carrier female, risk of having the disorder is 50%, and for each daughter, risk of being a carrier is 50%. Affected males do not transmit the gene to their sons, but they transmit it to all their daughters, who thus are carriers.

Vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone) helps regulate the amount of water in the body by controlling how much water is excreted by the kidneys. Vasopressin decreases water excretion by the kidneys. As a result, more water is retained in the body, which dilutes the level of sodium in the body. A low level of sodium in the blood is called hyponatremia (Low Level of Sodium in the Blood) In hyponatremia, the level of sodium in blood is too low.\n【1】 The pituitary gland appropriately produces and releases vasopressin when the blood volume (amount of fluid in the blood vessels) or blood pressure goes down or when levels of electrolytes (such as sodium) become too high. Secretion of vasopressin is termed inappropriate if it occurs when Blood volume is normal or high Blood pressure is normal or high Electrolyte concentrations are low Hyponatremia (Low Level of Sodium in the Blood) In hyponatremia, the level of sodium in blood is too low.\n【2】 Causes of SIADH Many conditions increase the risk of developing SIADH. SIADH may result when vasopressin is produced outside the pituitary gland, as occurs in some lung and other cancers. SIADH is common among older people and is fairly common among people who are hospitalized. SIADH has a long list of possible causes that typically require additional tests to uncover.  Symptoms of SIADH Symptoms of SIADH tend to be those related to the low sodium level in blood ,hyponatremia (Low Level of Sodium in the Blood) In hyponatremia, the level of sodium in blood is too low.\n【3】 Symptoms include sluggishness and confusion. Diagnosis of SIADH Blood and urine tests Doctors suspect SIADH in people with hyponatremia that cannot be explained by other factors, such as pain, stress, strenuous exercise, a high blood sugar level, and certain disorders of the heart, thyroid gland, kidneys, or adrenal glands that can decrease blood volume and appropriately stimulate the release of vasopressin from the pituitary. Blood and urine tests are done to measure the sodium and potassium levels and to determine how concentrated the blood and urine are (osmolality). Doctors also rule out other possible causes of excess vasopressin (such as pain, stress, drugs, or cancer). Once SIADH is diagnosed, doctors try to identify the cause What Causes SIADH? and address it so the sodium level slowly returns to normal. Treatment of SIADH Restriction of fluid intake Doctors restrict fluid intake and treat the cause if possible. People with SIADH need treatment of hyponatremia Treatment In hyponatremia, the level of sodium in blood is too low.\n【4】 Intravenous fluids, including fluids containing very high concentrations of sodium (hypertonic saline), are sometimes given. Such treatments must be given carefully to avoid rapid increases in the sodium level. If the sodium level in blood continues to decrease or does not increase despite restriction of fluid intake, doctors may prescribe drugs such as demeclocycline or lithium, which decrease the effect of vasopressin on the kidneys, or drugs such as conivaptan and tolvaptan, which block vasopressin receptors and prevent the kidneys from responding tovasopressin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:38", "update_time": "2024-04-01 01:57:29"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 862,000 people in the US (1 General references Hepatitis B is a common cause of chronic hepatitis. Diagnosis is by serologic testing.\n【4】 Without treatment, chronic hepatitis B can resolve (uncommon), progress rapidly, or progress slowly to cirrhosis over decades. Resolution often begins with a transient increase in disease severity and results in seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) to antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), followed by loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Chronic HBV infection even in the absence of cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is common in areas where infection with hepatitis B and C viruses is prevalent.\n【5】 Coinfection with hepatitis D virus Hepatitis D Hepatitis D is caused by a defective RNA virus (delta agent) that can replicate only in the presence of hepatitis B virus.\n【6】Symptoms and Signs of Chronic Hepatitis B Symptoms of chronic hepatitis B vary depending on the degree of underlying liver damage. Many patients, particularly children, are asymptomatic. However, malaise, anorexia, and fatigue are common, sometimes with low-grade fever and nonspecific upper abdominal discomfort.

Often, the first findings are Signs of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis (eg, splenomegaly, spider nevi, palmar erythema) Complications of cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.\n【7】 The most common cause is portal hypertension. Symptoms usually result from abdominal distention.\n【8】 Diagnosis of Chronic Hepatitis B Serologic testing Liver biopsy The diagnosis Chronic hepatitis is hepatitis that lasts > 6 months.\n【9】  If chronic hepatitis B is confirmed, testing for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) is usually done to help determine the prognosis and to guide antiviral therapy. If serologically confirmed HBV infection is severe or if patients belong to a known at-risk population (eg, those with HIV infection, injection drug users, men who have sex with men, or immigrants from areas of high endemicity, and possibly those who are HBsAg-positive with low HBV DNA but high ALT levels), antibody to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) is measured. Quantitative HBV-DNA tests (viral load) are also used before and during treatment to assess response. Noninvasive assessment of fibrosis is done to evaluate degree of fibrosis after chronic hepatitis B is diagnosed. Biopsy is occasionally done to evaluate the extent of liver damage and to exclude other causes of liver disease. Liver biopsy is most useful in cases that do not meet clear-cut guidelines for treatment . Other tests Liver tests are needed if not previously done; they include serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase.

Diagnosis is by serologic testing.\n【11】 Treatment can occasionally cause loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), or, even more rarely, loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However, the majority of patients treated for chronic hepatitis B must be treated indefinitely. These drugs cannot cure the disease. Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to relapse, which may be severe. However, treatment may be stopped if one of the following occurs: HBeAg converts to antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). Tests for HBsAg become negative. Multiple antiviral drugs are active against hepatitis B, but only four are currently recommended: entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, tenofovir alafenamide, and pegylated interferon-alfa (peginterferon alfa): Adefovir, interferon alfa, lamivudine, and telbivudine have been used but are no longer recommended as first-line treatment because of increased risk of adverse effects and development of drug resistance. First-line treatment is usually with one of the following: An oral antiviral drug, such as entecavir (a nucleoside analog) or tenofovir (a nucleotide analog) Pegylated interferon alfa Oral antiviral drugs have few adverse effects and can be given to patients with decompensated liver disease. Lactic acidosis is a potential side effect, and lactic acid levels should be checked if there is clinical concern. Combination therapy has not proved superior to monotherapy. Patients should be tested for HIV before treatment is initiated. If HBsAg becomes undetectable and HBeAg seroconversion occurs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, these patients may be able to stop antiviral drugs. Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection almost always need to take antiviral drugs indefinitely to maintain viral suppression; they have already developed antibodies to HBeAg, and thus the only specific criterion for stopping HBV treatment would be HBsAg that becomes undetectable. Entecavir has a high antiviral potency, and resistance to it is uncommon; it is considered a first-line treatment for HBV infection. Entecavir is effective against adefovir-resistant strains. Dosage is 0.5 mg orally once a day; however, patients who have previously taken a nucleoside analog should take 1 mg orally once a day. Dose reduction is required in patients with renal insufficiency. Serious adverse effects appear to be uncommon, although safety in pregnancy has not been established. Tenofovir has replaced adefovir (an older nucleotide analog) as a first-line treatment. Tenofovir is the most potent oral antiviral for hepatitis B; resistance to it is minimal. It has few adverse effects. There are two forms of tenofovir: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), which is newer Dosage for TDF is 300 mg orally once a day; dosing frequency may need to be reduced if creatinine clearance is reduced. Potential side effects include nephropathy, Fanconi syndrome, and osteomalacia. If patients are at risk of renal impairment, creatinine clearance, serum phosphate, and urine glucose and protein should be checked at least annually. Bone density studies at baseline and during treatment should be considered if patients have a history of fracture or risk factors for osteopenia. Dosage for TAF is 25 mg orally once a day; no dose adjustments are necessary if creatinine clearance is reduced. TDF and TAF are similar in efficacy, but TAF is safer in patients when renal toxicity or bone density is a concern. Serum creatinine and phosphorus, creatinine clearance, and urine glucose and protein should be checked before initiating and during therapy. Pegylated interferon alfa can be used instead of interferon alfa. Dosage for pegylated interferon alfa is usually 180 mcg by injection once a week for 48 weeks. Adverse effects are similar to those of interferon alfa but may be less severe. More than 40% of patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa report fatigue, fever, myalgia, and headache. Other potential side effects include mood disturbances, cytopenia, and autoimmune disorders. Contraindications to pegylated interferon alfa include the following: Decompensated liver disease Autoimmune hepatitis Renal failure Immunosuppression Solid organ transplantation Cytopenia The following tests should be used to monitor patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa: Complete blood count (monthly to every 3 months) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (every 3 months) Clinical monitoring for autoimmune, ischemic, neuropsychiatric, and infectious complications Lactic acid levels if there is clinical concern Test for HIV before initiating treatment Nonpreferred antiviral therapies (adefovir, lamivudine, telbivudine, interferon alfa) may be considered if the above drugs are unavailable. Adefovir is a nucleotide analog. Dosage is 10 mg orally once a day. It is not a preferred first-line treatment because renal failure and lactic acidosis are risks. Lamivudine (a nucleoside analog) is no longer considered first-line treatment for HBV infection because risk of resistance is higher and efficacy is lower than those of newer antiviral drugs. Dosage is 100 mg orally once a day; it has few adverse effects. Telbivudine is a nucleoside analog that has greater efficacy and potency than lamivudine but also has a high rate of resistance; it is not considered first-line treatment. Dosage is 600 mg orally once a day. Interferon alfa can be used but is no longer considered first-line treatment and has generally been replaced by pegylated interferon alfa. Liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation.\n【12】 In patients with HBV infection, the long-term use of first-line oral antivirals and peri-transplantation use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) has improved outcomes after liver transplantation. Survival is equal to or better than that after transplantation for other indications, and recurrences of hepatitis B are minimized.\n【13】 Key Points Acute hepatitis B becomes chronic in about 5 to 10% of patients overall; risk is highest at a young age (90% for infants, 25 to 50% for children aged 1 to 5 years, and about 5% for adults). The WHO estimates that about 257 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis B infection. Symptoms vary depending on the degree of underlying liver damage. Antiviral drugs can improve liver test results and liver histology and delay progression to cirrhosis but may need to be taken indefinitely; drug resistance has become less of a concern with newer drugs. Liver transplantation may be required in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#2#2# It causes typical ...... and jaundice.与前句重复\n", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:38", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:01:13"}

Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle, such as avoiding alcohol, caffeine (in beverages and foods), and smoking. Other arrhythmias are dangerous or bothersome enough to need treatment. Artificial pacemakers are one type of treatment. Other treatments for arrhythmias include insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment.\n【2】 Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment.\n【3】 Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment.\n【4】 Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment.\n【5】 Artificial pacemakers are electronic devices that act in place of the heart’s own pacemaker, the sinoatrial node Regulation of the Heart The heart and blood vessels constitute the cardiovascular (circulatory) system. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs so it can pick up oxygen and then pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.\n【6】 These devices are implanted surgically under the skin, usually below the left or right collarbone. They are connected to the heart by wires (leads) running inside a vein. The tips of the wires are implanted in the wall of a heart chamber. The pacemaker sends an electrical signal that makes the heart muscle contract. Sometimes only one wire is placed, typically in the right ventricle. Other pacemakers use 2 or more wires so that different chambers can be paced. Modern pacemakers typically can sense the person's heart rate and rhythm and send a pacing signal only when it is needed. Most pacemakers are programmable from outside the body so that doctors can change how they respond. The low-energy circuitry and battery designs now in use allow these units to function about 10 to 15 years. Some people may be candidates for leadless pacemakers. With this type of pacemaker, no wires are needed to connect the pacemaker to the heart. Doctors make a small incision in the groin and use a catheter to insert the pacemaker directly into the bottom right heart chamber (the right ventricle). There is almost no risk of interference with pacemakers from cell phones, automobile ignition systems, radar, microwaves, and airport security detectors. However, some equipment may interfere with pacemakers. Examples are electrocautery devices used to stop bleeding during surgery, diathermy (physical therapy treatments that use radiowaves to apply heat to muscles), and sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI may be safe with certain types of pacemaker, depending on how they are constructed. Keeping the Beat: Artificial Pacemakers Artificial pacemakers are electronic devices that act in place of the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus or sinoatrial node). They generate electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat. Pacemakers consist of a battery, an impulse generator, and wires that connect the pacemaker to the heart. An artificial pacemaker is implanted surgically. After a local anesthetic is used to numb the insertion site, the wires that connect the pacemaker are usually inserted into a vein near the collarbone and threaded toward the heart. Through a small incision, the impulse generator, which is about the size of a silver dollar, is inserted just under the skin near the collarbone and connected to the wires. The incision is stitched closed. Usually, the procedure takes about 30 to 60 minutes. The person may be able to go home shortly afterward or may briefly stay in the hospital. The battery for a pacemaker usually lasts 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless, the battery should be checked regularly. Battery replacement is a quick procedure. There are different types of pacemakers. Some take over the control of the heart rate, overriding the electrical impulses generated by the heart. Others, called demand pacemakers, allow the heart to beat naturally unless it skips a beat or begins to beat at an abnormal rate. Still others, called programmable pacemakers, can do either. Some pacemakers can adjust their rate depending on the wearer’s activity, increasing the heart rate during exercise and decreasing it during rest. The most common use of pacemakers is to treat slow arrhythmias. When the heart slows below a set threshold, the artificial pacemaker begins to produce electrical impulses. Less commonly, pacemakers are used to treat fast arrhythmias by delivering a series of impulses to decrease the heart rate by converting the fast arrhythmia back to normal. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is another use for pacemakers. In some people with heart disorders, the four heart chambers do not follow their normal, orderly sequence of contractions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#4#与上一句重复句子", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:38", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:03:45"}

It requires a living cell in which to multiply.\n【1】 Most people have no symptoms, but some feel ill and have a fever, and people with a weakened immune system can have serious symptoms, including blindness. Cytomegalovirus can cause serious illness in infants who are infected before birth. Doctors may detect the infection by culturing a sample of infected body fluid, such as urine. Often, no treatment is required, but if the infection is severe, antiviral drugs may be used. Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is very common. CMV is a type of herpesvirus Overview of Herpesvirus Infections Some common viral infections are caused by herpesviruses.\n【2】 Blood tests show that 60 to 90% of adults have had a CMV infection at some time. CMV may cause symptoms soon after infection. Also, it remains dormant (inactive) in various tissues for life. Various stimuli can reactivate the dormant CMV, resulting in virus growth which can sometimes cause disease. The lungs, gastrointestinal tract, brain, spinal cord, or eyes may be infected. Usually, CMV infection causes no symptoms. Serious infections typically develop only in infants infected before birth Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection in Newborns Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that usually causes few or no problems but can cause serious illness in infants who are infected before birth or around the time of birth.\n【3】 In people with a weakened immune system, disease often results from reactivation of the dormant virus. Transmission of CMV Infected people may shed cytomegalovirus in their urine or saliva intermittently. The virus is also excreted in mucus in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus), semen, stool, and breast milk. Thus, the virus is spread through sexual and nonsexual contact. If a pregnant woman is infected, the fetus may acquire the infection during the pregnancy, or the baby may acquire the infection during delivery. CMV infection may develop in people who receive a transfusion of infected blood or an infected organ transplant. People who have received an organ transplant Overview of Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body.\n【4】 Symptoms of CMV Infection Most people infected with cytomegalovirus have no symptoms. A few infected people feel ill and have a fever. Infection with CMV, like that with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a type 4 herpesvirus), can cause a type of infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Epstein-Barr virus causes a number of diseases, including infectious mononucleosis. The virus is spread through kissing.\n【5】 Both CMV and EBV mononucleosis cause fever and fatigue. But EBV also causes a severe sore throat. CMV does not. An uninfected person who receives a transfusion of blood containing CMV and becomes infected can have a fever, and sometimes liver inflammation develops 2 to 4 weeks later. In people with a weakened immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders.\n【6】 In people with AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.\n【7】 The virus can infect the retina of the eye. This infection (CMV retinitis) can cause blindness. Infection of the brain ,encephalitis is inflammation of the brain that occurs when a virus directly infects the brain or when a virus, vaccine, or something else triggers inflammation.\n【8】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.\n【9】 If a pregnant woman transmits CMV to the fetus, the following may result: Miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n【10】 Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus.\n【11】 Newborns who survive may have hearing loss and intellectual disability. Diagnosis of CMV Infection In newborns, urine culture Blood tests In people with a weakened immune system, often biopsy Cytomegalovirus infection may not be recognized immediately. Diagnosis of CMV infection is often unnecessary in healthy adults and children because treatment is unnecessary. However, doctors consider the possibility of CMV infection in the following people: Otherwise healthy people who have fever and fatigue People who have a weakened immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders.\n【12】 In newborns, the diagnosis is usually made by sending a sample of urine to a laboratory to grow (culture) and identify the virus. Blood tests that detect antibodies to CMV can confirm a new infection.\n【13】 But these tests cannot confirm whether disease is present. For instance, disease can be caused by reactivation of the virus, as in people with a weakened immune system. In these people, a biopsy of affected tissues is often necessary to confirm CMV disease. Blood tests to estimate how many viruses are present may also be done. CMV retinitis can be identified by an ophthalmologist, who examines internal eye structures to check for characteristic abnormalities using an ophthalmoscope Ophthalmoscopy A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor.\n【14】 Treatment of CMV Infection For CMV retinitis, antiviral drugs For people with HIV/AIDS, drugs used to treat HIV infections Mild cytomegalovirus infection is usually not treated.

It requires a living cell in which to multiply.\n【15】 These drugs may be given by mouth or by vein. When CMV retinitis is very severe, the drugs may also be injected directly into the eye. These drugs have serious side effects  and do not cure the infection. However, treatment slows the disease's progression and may preserve sight. Antiviral drugs are used to treat other severe symptoms due to CMV but are less reliably effective than when used to treat retinitis. If CMV infection occurs in people whose immune system is temporarily weakened or suppressed (by a disorder or drug), the infection usually subsides when the immune system recovers or the drug is stopped.

Cancers may cause blood in the urine or crampy pain in the side. Diagnosis is usually by computed tomography. Treatment is removal of the kidney and ureter. The Ureters, Bladder, and Urethra VIDEO Cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter are much less common than cancers of the rest of the kidney or bladder. They probably occur in fewer than 6,000 people in the United States each year. Symptoms of Renal Pelvis and Ureter Cancer Blood in the urine is usually the first symptom. People may also have pain and burning during urination and an urgent, frequent need to urinate. Crampy pain in the flank (the space between the ribs and hip) or lower abdomen may occur if the flow of urine is obstructed (for example, because a blood clot blocks the ureter). Diagnosis of Renal Pelvis and Ureter Cancer Computed tomography or ultrasonography Ureteroscopy The cancer is usually detected by using computed tomography Computed tomography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.\n【1】 CT and often ultrasonography can help doctors distinguish other noncancerous (benign) kidney and ureteral problems such as stones or blood clots. Microscopic examination of a urine sample may reveal cancer cells. A flexible viewing tube with a camera at its tip—a ureteroscope—threaded up through the bladder may be used to view cancers, obtain tissue samples for confirmation of the diagnosis, and occasionally even treat small cancers. This is typically done under general anesthesia. To determine how extensive cancers are and how far they have spread, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis and chest x-ray or CT of the chest are done. Prognosis for Renal Pelvis and Ureter Cancer If the cancer has not spread and if it can be completely removed surgically, cure is likely. However, if the cancer has spread into the wall of the renal pelvis or ureter or to distant sites, cure is unlikely. Treatment of Renal Pelvis and Ureter Cancer Surgery If the cancer has not spread beyond the area of the renal pelvis and ureter, the usual treatment is surgical removal of the entire kidney and ureter (nephroureterectomy) along with a small part of the bladder. Following surgery, chemotherapy is often instilled into the bladder to help prevent any recurrences in the bladder. However, in some situations—for example, when the kidneys are not functioning well or a person has only one kidney—the kidney is usually not removed because the person would then become dependent on dialysis. For high-grade or high-stage tumors, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery. Some cancers in the renal pelvis and ureter (for example, some low-grade and low-risk cancers) are treated with a laser to destroy the cancer cells or with surgery that removes only the cancer itself while leaving the kidney, the noncancerous portion of the ureter, and the bladder in place. However, these cancers have a higher risk of recurrence and spread. Occasionally, a drug, such as mitomycin C or bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG—a substance that stimulates the body’s immune system) is instilled into the ureter or a chemotherapy drug is given. It is not clear how effective laser treatments and drug instillations are. A cystoscopy (insertion of a flexible viewing tube to examine the inside of the bladder) is done periodically after surgery, indefinitely, because people who have had this type of cancer are at risk of developing bladder cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:38", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:22:10"}

The cause is not known. Muscle-strengthening exercises may help, but no other specific treatment is needed. In fixed kyphosis, children cannot straighten the spine because several of the vertebrae in the upper back are wedge-shaped rather than rectangular. Usually, 3 or more vertebrae are involved.

Diagnosis is by blood culture and exclusion of focal infection. Treatment is with antibiotics, either in the hospital or as outpatients; select children are treated pending blood culture results. The causes, evaluation, and management of possible occult bacteremia vary by children's age and immunization status.\n【1】 Children 3 to 36 months of age In the era before conjugate vaccines, about 3 to 5% of children aged 3 to 36 months with a febrile illness (temperature ≥ 39° C) and no localizing abnormalities (ie, fever without a source) had occult bacteremia. In contrast, children > 36 months with bacteremia almost always looked ill and had an identifiable (ie, non-occult) focus of infection. The majority (80%) of occult bacteremia prior to routine conjugate immunization was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcal Infections Streptococci are gram-positive aerobic organisms that cause many disorders, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, wound and skin infections, sepsis, and endocarditis.\n【2】 Occult bacteremia is a concern because about 5 to 10% of the children develop serious bacterial infections (SBIs)—typically defined as sepsis Neonatal Sepsis Neonatal sepsis is invasive infection, usually bacterial, occurring during the neonatal period.\n【3】 Such infections could be minimized by early identification and treatment of the bacteremia. The likelihood of progression to serious focal illness depended on the cause: 7 to 25% for bacteremia caused by H. influenzae type b but 4 to 6% for bacteremia caused by S. pneumoniae. Currently in the US and Europe, routine vaccination of infants with polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against S. pneumoniae Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci).\n【4】 influenzae type b Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines help prevent Haemophilus infections but not infections caused by other strains of H. influenzae bacteria. H.\n【5】 influenzae type b infections and substantially reduced (≥ 70% overall and ≥ 90% vaccine-type) invasive S. pneumoniae infections. Thus, in this age group, occult bacteremia has become rare except in underimmunized or nonimmunized children, and in children with immunodeficiency. Children < 3 months of age In contrast, febrile infants < 3 months of age continue to have a greater risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI) than older infants, about 8 to 10%. In the past, SBIs in young infants < 3 months of age were more commonly caused by group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae type b. However, chemoprophylaxis during labor Maternal indications for group B streptococcus prophylaxis Neonatal sepsis is invasive infection, usually bacterial, occurring during the neonatal period.\n【6】 In addition, routine conjugate immunization has decreased colonization among older siblings immunized against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b such that the rate of SBI caused by those organisms has decreased as well (herd immunity).\n【7】 Symptoms and Signs The major symptom of occult bacteremia is fever—temperature ≥ 39° C (≥ 38° C for infants < 3 months). By definition, children with apparent focal disease (eg, cough, dyspnea, and pulmonary crackles suggesting pneumonia; skin erythema suggesting cellulitis or septic arthritis) are excluded (ie, because their disease is not occult). A toxic appearance (eg, limpness and listlessness, lethargy, signs of poor perfusion, cyanosis, marked hypoventilation or hyperventilation) suggests sepsis or septic shock; bacteremia in such children is also not classified as occult or fever without a source. However, early sepsis can be difficult to distinguish from occult bacteremia. Diagnosis Blood cultures Urine culture and urinalysis Complete blood count (CBC) and differential Sometimes other tests depending on age and clinical circumstances Diagnosis of bacteremia requires blood cultures; ideally, two samples are taken from separate sites, which helps minimize the problem of false positives due to skin contaminants, and results should be made available within 24 hours. Recommendations for testing and choice of tests vary with age, temperature, and clinical appearance; the goal is to minimize testing without missing an SBI. Children who have indications of focal infection on history or physical examination are evaluated based on those findings.\n【8】 There also are rapid tests for other viruses, but these have not been studied sufficiently to justify using their results to alter testing for SBI. In infants with SBI, the CBC usually shows an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count; however, only about 10% of children with WBC counts of > 15,000/mcL (> 15 × 109/L) are bacteremic, so specificity is low. Acute-phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein with or without procalcitonin) are used by some clinicians but add little information; some clinicians believe that elevated procalcitonin levels may be more specific for serious illness. In children < 3 months, band counts > 1500/mcL (> 1.5 × 109/L) and either low (< 5000/mcL [5 × 109/L]) or high (> 15,000/mcL [> 15 × 109/L]) WBC counts may indicate bacteremia. Children 3 to 36 months of age It is important to note that any febrile infant, regardless of immunization history, who appears seriously ill or toxic requires complete clinical and laboratory evaluation (CBC with differential, blood cultures, urine cultures, lumbar puncture, and, in most cases, admission to the hospital with empiric antimicrobial therapy). Unimmunized, underimmunized, and immunocompromised febrile infants in this age range are more susceptible to SBI than their peers and also typically require the same full clinical and laboratory evaluation for SBI and empiric antibiotics. Children with dyspnea or low oxygen saturation should also have a chest x-ray. In previously immunized febrile infants aged 3 to 36 months who appear well (nontoxic), the risk of bacteremia is now as low or even lower than the rate of false-positive blood cultures due to skin contaminants, leading many experts to forego blood cultures in these children. However, a urinalysis with microscopic examination and urine culture is typically recommended, but additional laboratory examination (eg, CBC, chest x-ray) is not. Although the vast majority of these children have a viral infection, a very small number of well-appearing children will have an early SBI, so caretakers should be advised to monitor the child's symptoms, give antipyretics, and follow up with the clinician (by visit or telephone depending on the circumstances and the caretakers' reliability) in 24 to 48 hours. Children who worsen or remain febrile should have testing done (eg, CBC with differential, blood cultures, possibly chest x-ray or lumbar puncture). Children < 3 months of age Toxic-appearing or seriously ill-appearing infants require immediate clinical evaluation and collection of blood, urine, and spinal fluid cultures and hospitalization for empiric antibiotic therapy. Unlike in older infants, in those < 3 months of age, a nontoxic clinical appearance does not routinely allow deferral of testing. Algorithms have been developed to help guide evaluation of infants in this age group (for one example, see Figure: Evaluation and management of the febrile infant aged < 3 months Evaluation and management of the febrile infant aged < 3 months ). In using the algorithm, many experts consider age < 30 days by itself to be a high-risk criterion (and thus routinely admit them and do additional testing), whereas others do not and manage all infants < 90 days of age using the same criteria. This algorithm is sensitive for SBI but relatively nonspecific.\n【9】 Evaluation and management of the febrile infant aged < 3 months hpf = high-power field. Treatment Antibiotics (empirically, for select patients pending culture results, as well as for those patients with positive cultures) Antipyretics for discomfort Adequate hydration (because of increased losses with fever and possible anorexia); oral hydration if possible, parenteral if not Children who receive antibiotics before bacteremia is confirmed by blood culture seem less likely to develop focal infections, but data are inconsistent. However, because of the low overall incidence of bacteremia, many children would receive unnecessary treatment if all who were tested were empirically treated. As above, management varies by age and other clinical factors. Regardless of age, all children are reexamined in 24 to 48 hours. Those with persistent fever or positive blood or urine cultures who have not been treated already have more cultures done and are hospitalized for evaluation of possible sepsis and parenteral antibiotic therapy. If new signs of focal infection are found on reexamination, evaluation and therapy are directed by the findings. Children 3 to 36 months of age Antipyretics in weight-based dosages are given. Antibiotics are not given unless cultures are positive.\n【10】 Children < 3 months of age One common system for management before culture results  minimizes antibiotic use in most febrile infants who are not likely to have serious bacterial infection and provides antibiotics promptly to the few who need them.\n【11】 Of note, some authorities prefer to hospitalize all febrile infants < 1 month of age, do a full evaluation with cultures of blood, urine, and CSF, and give parenteral antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone) pending culture results because febrile infants < 1 month of age are the age group with the greatest incidence of SBI. Key Points Febrile infants and young children < 36 months of age, who have been appropriately immunized with H. influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, and who look well and have no apparent foci of infection, are unlikely to have occult bacteremia or serious bacterial infection (SBI; eg, sepsis, meningitis). Use blood cultures (2 samples from 2 separate sites) to diagnose occult bacteremia in selected febrile children. All febrile infants < 36 months of age should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (UTI) with urinalysis and urine culture because UTI is now the most common cause of SBI with fever. Toxic-appearing children (and perhaps all febrile infants < 1 month of age of age) also require cultures of blood and spinal fluid and hospitalization for empiric antibiotic therapy. In children 3 to 36 months of age with a temperature ≥ 39° C and who have been appropriately immunized, testing other than urine culture is not indicated for those who appear well; others should have testing based on clinical findings and other circumstances (eg, rapid viral testing for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus during the appropriate seasons). In infants < 3 months of age with a temperature ≥ 38° C, good clinical appearance does not completely exclude an SBI, so testing, including urinalysis, complete blood count with differential, blood and urine cultures, and, if available (depending on the local epidemiology and season), perhaps rapid viral testing for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus, is indicated for all in this age range.

Sometimes the esophagus, collarbone, or shoulder blade is also injured. In the United States, chest injuries cause about 25% of deaths due to severe injury. Many of the injuries that can cause death during the first minutes or hours after injury can be treated or stabilized in the emergency department without the need for major surgery. Causes of Chest Injuries The chest can be injured by blunt force (such as in motor vehicle crashes, falls, or sports injuries) or by an object that penetrates it (such as a bullet or knife). Chest injuries are often serious or immediately life threatening because they interfere with breathing or circulation. Some injuries damage the ribs and chest muscles (called the chest wall) severely enough to make it difficult for the lungs to inflate normally. Damage to the lungs themselves interferes with gas exchange Exchanging Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Inhaled oxygen enters the lungs and reaches the alveoli.\n【1】 Chest injuries can cause circulatory problems if they result in a lot of bleeding. Bleeding is often inside the chest wall, which also interferes with breathing. Also, injury to the heart can affect circulation by interfering with the heart's ability to pump blood to the body. Chest injuries that are common or can be severe include the following: Blunt injury to the heart Blunt Injury to the Heart Blunt injury to the heart is a blow to the chest that bruises the heart muscle, tears (ruptures) the heart's walls, or damages a heart valve.\n【2】 People have pain, usually due to the chest wall injury, and often feel short of breath.\n【3】 Rib fractures cause severe pain, particularly when a person breathes deeply. A chest x-ray is usually taken.\n【4】 It causes the lung to collapse partially or completely.\n【5】 Simple treatments, such as insertion of needles or tubes to treat certain chest injuries, can be lifesaving. Symptoms of Chest Injuries The injured area is usually tender or painful. Pain is worse when people inhale. The chest may be bruised. Sometimes people are short of breath. If the injury is severe, they may feel very short of breath, drowsy, or confused, and the skin may be cold, sweaty, or blue. Such symptoms may develop when the lungs malfunction severely ,respiratory failure Respiratory Failure Respiratory failure is a condition in which the level of oxygen in the blood becomes dangerously low or the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes dangerously high.\n【6】 People in shock typically have dangerously low blood pressure and feel as if their heart is racing. Other symptoms depend on the specific chest injury. For example, sometimes air accumulates under the skin in people with pneumothorax. Affected skin feels crackly and makes a crackling sound when touched. The veins in the neck are sometimes enlarged if blood or fluid accumulates in the sac around the heart and interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood ,called cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is pressure on the heart by blood or fluid that accumulates in the two-layered sac around the heart (pericardium).\n【7】 Diagnosis of Chest Injuries A doctor's evaluation Imaging Usually, a chest injury is obvious. However, the severity of chest injuries cannot be determined without a doctor's evaluation. First, doctors use a stethoscope to determine whether all parts of the lungs are receiving air, and they carefully examine the neck and chest for injuries. When someone is having difficulty breathing, a doctor places a sensor on the person's finger (pulse oximeter) to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood. Sometimes doctors measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood with a blood test (arterial blood gas measurement). A chest x-ray X-Rays of the Chest Anyone thought to have a heart disorder has chest x-rays taken from the front and the side.\n【8】 Chest x-ray shows most cases of pneumothorax Traumatic Pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates between the chest wall and the lung because of an injury. It causes the lung to collapse partially or completely.\n【9】 Rib fractures cause severe pain, particularly when a person breathes deeply. A chest x-ray is usually taken.\n【10】 However, a rapid ultrasound procedure is usually needed to look at the heart and lungs. This procedure, called E-FAST (Extended Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma), is used in trauma centers and emergency departments. Computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.\n【11】 Sometimes blood tests and electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded.\n【12】 Treatment of Chest Injuries Support of breathing and circulation Treatment of the specific injury Injuries that are immediately life threatening are treated as quickly as possible. The specific treatment depends on the injury. For all injuries, doctors take measures to support breathing and circulation if necessary. People may be given oxygen (for example, by nasal prongs, by face mask, or through a breathing tube) and intravenous fluids or sometimes blood transfusions. People with severe chest injuries are admitted to the hospital. People may be given pain relievers (analgesics) to lessen pain. For some injuries, a tube must be inserted into the chest ,thoracostomy, or chest tube insertion Chest Tube Insertion Chest tube insertion (also called tube thoracostomy) is a procedure in which a tube is inserted into the space between the lung and chest wall (called the pleural space).\n【13】 This procedure helps collapsed lungs reinflate.

Sexual sadism disorder is sexual sadism that causes significant distress, substantially interferes with daily functioning, harms another person, or involves someone who has not given consent.  Sexual sadism is a form of paraphilia. Most people with sadistic tendencies do not have sexual sadism disorder. Some amount of sadism and masochism is commonly play-acted in healthy sexual relationships, and mutually compatible partners often seek one another out. For example, the use of silk handkerchiefs for simulated bondage and mild spanking during sexual activity are common practices between consenting partners and are not considered sadomasochistic. Most sadists interact with a consenting partner, who may have sexual masochism Sexual Masochism Disorder Sexual masochism involves acts in which a person experiences sexual excitement from being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise abused.\n【1】 In these relationships, the humiliation and beating are simply acted out, with participants knowing that it is a game and carefully avoiding actual humiliation or injury. Fantasies of total control and dominance are often important, and sadists may bind and gag their partner in elaborate ways. In contrast, sexual sadism disorder involves one or more of the following: People are distressed by their behavior or unable to function because of their behavior. They take these acts to an extreme, sometimes causing severe bodily or psychologic harm or even death. The acts involve partners who do not give their consent (nonconsenting partners). When practiced with nonconsenting partners, sexual sadism is considered a crime and is likely to continue until the sadist is apprehended. Sexual sadism is not synonymous with rape, a complex mixture of sex and power over the victim.

For up to several years before and just after menopause, estrogen levels fluctuate widely, periods become irregular, and symptoms (such as hot flashes) may occur. After menopause, bone density decreases. Menopause is diagnosed when a woman has not had a period for 1 year, but blood tests may be done to confirm it. Certain measures, including hormone therapy and other drugs, can lessen symptoms. During the reproductive years, menstrual periods Menstrual Cycle Menstruation is the shedding of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) accompanied by bleeding.\n【1】 For this cycle to occur regularly, the ovaries must produce enough of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Menopause occurs because as women age, the ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone. During the years before menopause, production of estrogen and progesterone begins to fluctuate, and menstrual periods and ovulation occur less often. Eventually, menstrual periods and ovulation end permanently, and pregnancy can no longer occur naturally. A woman’s last period can be identified only later, after she has had no periods for at least 1 year. (Women who do not wish to become pregnant should use birth control until 1 year has passed since their last menstrual period.) Perimenopause refers to the several years before and the 1 year after the last menstrual period. How many years of perimenopause precede the last menstrual period varies greatly. During perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuate widely. These fluctuations are thought to cause the menopausal symptoms experienced by many women in their 40s. The menopausal transition is the part of perimenopause that leads up to the last menstrual period. It is characterized by changes in the pattern of menstrual periods. The menopausal transition lasts from 4 to 8 years. It lasts longer in women who smoke and in women who were younger when it began. Postmenopause refers to the time after the last menstrual period. In the United States, the average age for menopause is about 52. However, menopause may occur normally in women aged 45 (or even 40) to age 55 or older. Menopause may start at a younger age in women who Smoke Live at a high altitude Are malnourished Menopause is considered premature when it occurs before age 40. Premature menopause Premature Menopause Premature menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods before age 40.\n【2】 Symptoms of menopause can start years before menstrual periods end. The average age for menopause is about 52, but anywhere between age 40 to 55 or older is considered normal. Symptoms of Menopause Perimenopause symptoms During perimenopause, symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, moderate, or severe. Symptoms may last from 6 months to about 10 years, sometimes longer. Irregular menstrual periods may be the first symptom of perimenopause. Typically, periods occur more often, then less often, but any pattern is possible. Periods may be shorter or longer, lighter or heavier. They may not occur for months, then become regular again. In some women, periods occur regularly until menopause. Hot flashes affect 75 to 85% of women. They usually begin before periods stop. They last for an average of almost 7 1/2 years but can last more than 10 years. Usually, hot flashes become milder and occur less frequently as time passes. What causes hot flashes is unknown. But it may involve a resetting of the brain's thermostat (the hypothalamus), which controls body temperature. As a result, very small increases in temperature can make women feel hot. Hot flashes may be related to fluctuations in hormone levels. There is no convincing evidence that alcoholic beverages trigger hot flashes. During a hot flash, blood vessels near the skin surface widen (dilate). As a result, blood flow increases, causing the skin, especially on the head and neck, to become red and warm (flushed). Women feel warm or hot, and perspiration may be profuse. Hot flashes are sometimes called hot flushes because the face can become red. A hot flash lasts from 30 seconds to 5 minutes and may be followed by chills. Night sweats are hot flashes that occur at night. Other symptoms may occur around the time of menopause. The changes in hormone levels that occur at this time may contribute to the following: Breast tenderness Moodiness Worsening of migraines that occur just before, during, or just after menstrual periods (menstrual migraines) Depression, irritability, anxiety, nervousness, sleep disturbances (including insomnia), loss of concentration, headache, and fatigue may also occur. Many women experience these symptoms during perimenopause and assume that menopause is the cause. However, evidence supporting a connection between menopause and these symptoms is mixed. These symptoms are not directly related to the decreases in estrogen levels that occur with menopause. And many other factors (such as aging itself or a disorder) could explain the symptoms. Night sweats may disturb sleep, contributing to fatigue, irritability, loss of concentration, and mood changes. In such cases, these symptoms may be indirectly (through night sweats) related to menopause. However, during menopause, sleep disturbances are common even among women who do not have hot flashes. Midlife stresses (such as struggles with adolescents, concerns about aging, caring for aging parents, and changes in marital relationship) may contribute to sleep disturbances. Thus, the relationship of fatigue, irritability, loss of concentration, and mood changes to menopause seems less clear. Symptoms after menopause Many of the symptoms that occur during perimenopause, although disturbing, become less frequent and less intense after menopause. However, the decrease in estrogen levels causes changes that can continue to negatively affect health (for example, increasing the risk of osteoporosis). These changes may worsen, unless measures to prevent them are taken. The following may be affected: Reproductive tract: The lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic (a condition called vaginal atrophy or sometimes inappropriately called atrophic vaginitis). These changes may make sexual intercourse painful. Other sex organs Overview of the Female Reproductive System The female reproductive system consists of the external genital organs and internal genital organs.\n【3】 Sex drive (libido) commonly decreases with age. Most women can still have an orgasm, but some require more time to reach orgasm. Urinary tract: The lining of the urethra becomes thinner, and the urethra becomes shorter. Because of these changes, microorganisms can enter the body more easily, and some women develop urinary tract infections more easily. A woman with a urinary tract infection Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present.\n【4】 After menopause, the need to urinate may suddenly become compelling ,called urinary urgency Urinary Urgency A compelling need to urinate (urgency), which may feel like almost constant painful straining (tenesmus), can be caused by bladder irritation.\n【5】 Urinary incontinence becomes more common and severe with age. However, how much menopause contributes to incontinence is unclear. Many other factors, such as the effects of childbirth, obesity, and the use of hormone therapy, contribute to incontinence. Skin: The decrease in estrogen, as well as aging itself, causes a decrease in the amount of collagen (a protein that makes skin strong) and elastin (a protein that makes skin elastic). Thus, the skin may become thinner, drier, less elastic, and more vulnerable to injury. Bone: The decrease in estrogen often leads to a decrease in bone density and sometimes to Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【6】 Bone becomes less dense and weaker, making fractures more likely. During the first 5 years after menopause, bone density decreases rapidly. After that, it decreases at about the same rate as it does in men (by about 1 to 3% each year).\n【7】 Levels of high-density lipoprotein Dyslipidemia (HDL—the good) cholesterol remain about the same as before menopause.\n【8】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【9】 However, whether these changes result from aging or from the decrease in estrogen levels after menopause is unclear. Until menopause, the high estrogen levels may protect against coronary artery disease. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a new, more accurate term used to refer to symptoms that affect the vagina and urinary tract and that are caused by menopause. These symptoms include vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse, urinary urgency, and urinary tract infections. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a new term used to refer to symptoms that affect the vagina, vulva, and urinary tract and that are caused by menopause, such as vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse, urinary urgency, and urinary tract infections. Diagnosis of Menopause A doctor's evaluation Rarely blood tests to measure hormone levels In about three fourths of women, menopause is obvious. Thus, laboratory tests are usually not needed. If menopause begins several years before age 50 or if symptoms are not clear-cut, tests may be done to check for disorders that can disrupt menstrual periods. Rarely, if menopause or perimenopause needs to be confirmed, blood tests are done to measure levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (which stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone).\n【10】 Doctors also check for abnormalities in the reproductive organs. A woman's medical history and family history help doctors determine her risk of developing certain disorders after menopause. Mammography, if it has not been done recently, is done as part of routine care. Blood tests may be done.\n【11】 In the United States, about 160,000 people have bariatric surgery each year.\n【12】 Talking with other women who have gone through menopause or with their doctor may also help. Treatment of menopause focuses on relieving symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. General measures may help, but when other treatment is needed, the most effective is Hormone therapy Hormone Therapy for Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【13】 Another term, progestin, refers only to synthetic forms. Effective measures that do not involve hormones include Hypnosis by a qualified health care practitioner to help relieve hot flashes Cognitive-behavioral therapy Other drugs such as two types of antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) or the antiseizure drug gabapentin Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been adapted to be used during the menopause transition and postmenopause. It can help women manage hot flashes and night sweats. General measures The following may help relieve hot flashes: Wearing layers of clothing, which can be taken off when a woman feels hot and which can be put on when she feels cold, can help her cope with hot flashes. Wearing clothing that breathes (such as cotton underwear and sleepwear) or that can wick away moisture (such as certain kinds of underwear and exercise clothes) may enhance comfort. Avoiding things that trigger symptoms (such as hot environments, spicy foods, and bright lights) may also help. Using fans or lowering the thermostat may help. Using a cooling gel mattress topper (a gel-filled layer that is placed over a mattress and pulls body heat away from the person) Wearing a cooling device (such as a wristband, necklace, or neck wrap) Exercising regularly and losing weight may help control hot flashes and have other health benefits. Although mindfulness (the practice of being aware of the present moment), relaxation techniques, and/or yoga may be of general benefit to women, it is not clear whether they relieve hot flashes. To manage sleep disturbances, women can follow a routine to calm themselves before they go to bed and when night sweats wake them up. Developing good sleep habits Sleep hygiene The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n【14】 For these exercises, a woman tightens the pelvic muscles as if stopping urine flow. Women may be taught how to use biofeedback to help them learn to control their pelvic muscles. Biofeedback, a type of mind-body medicine, is a method of bringing unconscious biologic processes under conscious control.\n【15】 It involves using electronic devices to measure information about these processes and to report it back to the conscious mind. Other measures that may help include Limiting fluid intake at certain times—for example, before going out or 3 to 4 hours before bedtime Avoiding foods that irritate the bladder (such as caffeine-containing fluids and spicy or salty foods) If vaginal dryness makes sexual intercourse painful, an over-the-counter vaginal lubricant may help. For some women, applying a vaginal moisturizer every 1 to 3 days helps. Staying sexually active or masturbating also helps by stimulating blood flow to the vagina and the surrounding tissues and by keeping tissues flexible. Drugs Several types of drugs can help relieve some of the symptoms associated with menopause. Paroxetine (an antidepressant) can help relieve hot flashes. Gabapentin, an antiseizure drug, and other antidepressants (such as desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, or venlafaxine) are somewhat effective at relieving hot flashes. Antidepressants Drug therapy for depression may also help relieve depression, anxiety, and irritability. However, none of these drugs are as effective at relieving symptoms of menopause as hormone therapy. A sleep aid Treatment The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n【16】  Complementary and alternative medicine Some women take medicinal herbs and other supplements to relieve hot flashes, irritability, mood changes, and memory loss. However, black cohosh, other medicinal herbs (such as dong quai, evening primrose, ginseng, and St. John’s wort), and over-the-counter drugs do not appear to be more effective than placebo Placebos Placebos are substances that are made to resemble drugs but do not contain an active drug.\n【17】 Also, such remedies are not regulated as drugs are.\n【18】 Studies of soy protein have had mixed results. One soy product, called S-equol, may help relieve hot flashes in some women. Some supplements (for example, kava) can be harmful. Furthermore, some supplements can interact with other drugs and can worsen some disorders. Concerns about using standard hormone therapy have led to an interest in using hormones derived from plants such as yams and soy. These hormones have nearly the same molecular structure as hormones made by the body and thus are called bioidentical hormones. Many of the hormones used in standard hormone therapy are also so-called bioidentical hormones derived from plants. However, the hormones used in standard hormone therapy have been tested and approved, and their use is closely monitored. Sometimes a pharmacist custom-makes (compounds) bioidentical hormones for a person according to a health care practitioner's prescription. These are called compounded bioidentical hormones. Their production is not well-regulated. Thus, many doses, combinations, and forms are possible, and purity, consistency, and potency of the products varies. Compounded bioidentical hormones are often marketed as substitutes for standard hormone therapy and sometimes as a better, safer treatment than standard hormone therapy. But there is no evidence that compounded products are safer, more effective, or even as effective as standard hormone therapy. Sometimes women are not told that compounded bioidentical hormone products have the same risks as standard hormones. Women who are considering taking these compounded hormone therapies are advised to discuss them with a doctor. Hormone Therapy for Menopause Hormone therapy can relieve moderate to severe symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. However, hormone therapy may increase the risk of developing certain serious disorders. Hormone therapy improves quality of life for many women by relieving their symptoms, but it does not improve quality of life if women do not have symptoms. Thus, hormone therapy is not routinely given to postmenopausal women. Whether to take hormone therapy is a decision that must be made by a woman and her doctor based on the woman’s individual situation. Women should ask their doctor about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy before they start taking the drugs. For many women, risks outweigh potential benefits, so this therapy is not recommended. However, for some women, depending on their medical conditions and risk factors, potential benefits may outweigh risks. For example, hormone therapy may be recommended for women who have a high risk of bone loss or fracture plus one of the following: They are under age 60. Menopause was diagnosed fewer than 10 years previously. They cannot take other drugs (such as bisphosphonates) to prevent bone loss and fractures. Hormone therapy reduces bone loss and risk of fracture in these women. Usually, doctors do not recommend that women start taking hormone therapy if Women are older than 60. Menopause was diagnosed more than 10 to 20 years previously. In these women, the risk of coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【19】 When hormone therapy is used, doctors prescribe the lowest hormone dose that controls symptoms and for the shortest time needed. Hormone therapy can include Estrogen A progestogen (such as progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate) Both All hormones used in hormone therapy are made in laboratories. They may or may not be identical to those made in the body, but the way they act in the body is very similar. Progestogens resemble progesterone, a female hormone made by the body. Estrogen and progestogens come in several forms of hormonal therapy Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【20】 Estradiol and conjugated estrogens (a mixture of estrogens) are commonly used forms of estrogen. Women who have a uterus are usually given estrogen plus a progestogen (combination hormone therapy) because taking estrogen alone increases the risk of cancer of the uterine lining Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause.\n【21】 The progestogen helps protect against this cancer. Women who no longer have a uterus may take estrogen alone. The benefits and risks of hormone therapy depend on whether the hormones are taken alone or together. Estrogens with or without a progestogen: Potential benefits and risks Estrogen has several benefits: Hot flashes and other symptoms: Estrogen is the most effective treatment for hot flashes. Drying and thinning of vaginal and urinary tract tissues: Estrogen can prevent these tissues from drying and thinning. Thus, it can reduce pain with sexual intercourse. When the only problem a woman has is drying and thinning of these tissues, doctors may recommend a form of estrogen that is inserted into the vagina. These forms include low-dose estrogen tablets, a low-dose estrogen ring, a low-dose estrogen cream, and suppositories. When a low dose of estrogen is used, women who still have a uterus do not have to take a progestogen. With high doses of estrogen, women with a uterus need to take a progestogen. An urgent need to urinate and recurring urinary tract infections: Forms of estrogen that are inserted into the vagina (creams, tablets, or rings) help relieve these problems. Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【22】 However, taking hormone therapy for the sole purpose of preventing osteoporosis is usually not recommended. Most women can take a bisphosphonate or another drug Drugs to help prevent osteoporosis instead (although these drugs have their own risks). Bisphosphonates increase bone mass by reducing the amount of bone the body breaks down as it re-forms bones. The body continuously breaks bone down and re-forms it to help bones adjust to the changing demands placed on them. As people age, more bone is broken down than is re-formed. Estrogen taken without a progestogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer in women who have a uterus. The risk increases with higher doses and longer use of estrogen. Taking a progestogen with estrogen almost eliminates the risk of endometrial cancer, reducing the risk below that for women who do not take hormone therapy. Nonetheless, doctors evaluate any vaginal bleeding in women taking hormonal therapy to rule out endometrial cancer. Estrogen, taken with or without a progestogen, increases the risk of the following: Breast cancer: The risk of breast cancer begins to increase by a very small amount after taking estrogen plus a progestogen for about 3 to 5 years. But if estrogen is taken alone at the beginning of menopause, risk may not begin to increase until after 10 years or even 15 years. Stroke Blood clots in the legs ,deep vein thrombosis Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs.\n【23】 Bile aids digestion by making cholesterol, fats, and fat-soluble vitamins easier to absorb from the intestine.\n【24】 For certain disorders, determining whether the risk is increased by estrogen alone or by estrogen plus a progestogen (combination therapy) is difficult. Although taking hormone therapy increases the risk of all the above disorders, the risk is still low in healthy women who take hormone therapy for a short time during or shortly after perimenopause. Risk of most of these disorders increases with age, particularly 10 years or more past menopause, whether hormone therapy is taken or not. In older women, taking estrogen plus a progestogen also increases the risk of coronary artery disease. Risks of hormone therapy are thought to be lower when low doses of estrogen are used. Forms of estrogen that are inserted into the vagina (such as estrogen creams or tablets or rings that contain estrogen) often have lower doses than tablets taken by mouth. Estrogen given through a patch on the skin (transdermal form) appears to have a lower risk of blood clots, stroke, and gallbladder disorders (such as gallstones) than with forms taken by mouth. Generally, women who have breast cancer, coronary artery disease, or blood clots in the legs, who have had a stroke, or who have risk factors for these disorders should not take estrogen therapy. Combination hormone therapy reduces the risk of the following: Osteoporosis Colorectal cancer Progestogens: Benefits and risks Progestogens have some benefits: Endometrial cancer: Taking a progestogen with estrogen almost eliminates the risk of endometrial cancer in women who have a uterus. Hot flashes: High-dose progestogens can relieve hot flashes. But they are not as effective as estrogen. Progestogens may increase the risk of the following: An increase in LDL (the bad) cholesterol levels: Progestogens may have this effect. However, micronized progesterone (a natural rather than synthetic progesterone) appears to have a less negative effect on LDL levels than synthetic progestins. Blood clots in the legs and lungs. The effect of a progestogen alone on the risk of other disorders is not clear. Side effects Side effects of estrogen and progestogens, especially at high doses, may include nausea, breast tenderness, headache, fluid retention, and mood changes. Forms of hormonal therapy Estrogen and/or a progestogen can be taken in several ways: Estrogen or a progestogen tablets taken by mouth (oral form) Estrogen creams, tablets, rings, or suppositories inserted into the vagina (vaginal form) Estrogen lotions, sprays, or gels applied externally to the skin (topical form) Estrogen or combination estrogen-progestogen skin patches (transdermal form) As tablets taken by mouth, estrogen and a progestogen may be taken as two tablets or as a combination tablet. Commonly, estrogen and a progestogen are taken every day. This schedule may result in irregular vaginal bleeding during the first year or more of therapy. (However, if bleeding continues for more than a year, women should see their doctor.) Alternatively, estrogen may be taken daily, with a progestogen taken for 12 to 14 days each month. With this schedule, most women have monthly vaginal bleeding on the days after they take progestogen. Vaginal forms of estrogen are inserted into the vagina. These forms include A cream that is inserted with a plastic applicator A tablet that is inserted with a plastic applicator A ring that contains estrogen ,similar to a diaphragm Barrier contraceptives physically block the sperm’s access to a woman’s uterus.\n【25】 Creams and rings may contain a high or low dose of estrogen. If a high dose of estrogen is used in vaginal forms, women are also given a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Usually, a low dose is sufficient for vaginal symptoms. Using a vaginal form of estrogen may be more effective than taking estrogen by mouth for symptoms that affect the vagina (such as drying or thinning). Such treatment helps prevent intercourse from being painful, lessens urinary urgency, and reduces the risk of bladder infections. As a lotion, spray, or gel, estrogen can be applied to the skin. As a patch,estrogen or estrogen plus a progestogen can also be applied to the skin. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) SERMs (such as raloxifene and tamoxifen) function like estrogen in some ways but reverse the effects of estrogen in other ways. Raloxifene is used to treat osteoporosis and prevent breast cancer. Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer. Ospemifene can be used to relieve vaginal dryness. When women take a SERM, hot flashes may temporarily worsen. Bazedoxifene is a SERM that is given with estrogen in a combination tablet. It can relieve hot flashes and symptoms of vaginal atrophy, reduce breast tenderness, improve sleep, and prevent bone loss. Like estrogen, this drug increases the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs, but it may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and affect the breast less. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid that is produced in the adrenal glands and that is converted into sex hormones (estrogens and androgens). It is available as a suppository to be placed in the vagina. DHEA appears to relieve vaginal dryness and other symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

It is characterized by an inability to pay attention, disorientation, an inability to think clearly, and fluctuations in the level of alertness (consciousness). Many disorders, medications, recreational drugs, and poisons cause delirium. Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms and results of a physical examination, and they use blood, urine, and imaging tests to identify the cause. Promptly correcting or treating the condition causing delirium usually cures it.  dysfunction—the inability to acquire, retain, and use knowledge normally.\n【1】 Delirium is an abnormal mental state, not a disease. Although the term has a specific medical definition, it is often used to describe any type of confusion. Overview of Delirium VIDEO Although delirium and Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn.\n【2】 Delirium affects mainly attention, and dementia affects mainly memory. Delirium begins suddenly and often has a definite beginning point. Dementia typically begins gradually and has no definite beginning point . Delirium is never normal and often indicates a usually serious, newly developed problem, especially in older people. People who have delirium need immediate medical attention. If the cause of delirium is identified and corrected quickly, delirium can usually be cured. Because delirium is a temporary condition, determining how many people have it is difficult. Delirium affects 15 to 50% of hospitalized people. Delirium may occur at any age but is more common among older people. Delirium is common among residents of nursing homes. When delirium occurs in younger people, it is usually due to drug use (prescription, over-the-counter, or recreational) or a life-threatening disorder. What Is Confusion? Confusion means different things to different people, but doctors use the term to describe people who cannot process information normally. Confused people cannot Follow a conversation Answer questions appropriately Understand where they are Make critical judgments that affect safety Remember important facts Confusion has many different causes, including the use of certain drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, and recreational) and a wide variety of disorders. Delirium and dementia, though very different disorders, both cause confusion. When a person is confused, doctors try to determine what the cause is, particularly whether it is delirium or dementia. If confusion develops or worsens suddenly, the cause may be delirium. In such cases, medical attention is needed immediately because delirium may be caused by a serious disorder. Also, treating the cause, once identified, can often reverse the delirium. If confusion develops slowly, the cause may be dementia. Medical attention is needed but not urgently. Treatment may slow the mental decline in people with dementia but usually cannot stop the decline. Causes of Delirium Development or worsening of many disorders can cause delirium. Any person can become delirious when extremely ill or taking medications or drugs that affect brain function (psychoactive medications or drugs). Overall, the most common causes of delirium are the following: Drugs or medications (particularly those with anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? or psychoactive effects) and opioids Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration.\n【3】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.\n【4】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.\n【5】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.\n【6】 Delirium often develops during hospitalization in people who have dementia. Delirium can result from less severe conditions in older people and in people who have had a stroke or who have Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn.\n【7】 Less severe conditions that can trigger delirium include Minor illnesses (such as a urinary tract infection) Severe constipation in Adults Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation).  Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration.\n【8】 Hospitalization Being in unfamiliar surroundings such as a hospital Confusion and Mental Decline Due to Hospitalization Being ill, particularly when it involves taking drugs for pain or anxiety, can make anyone confused. The hospital environment adds to the problem.\n【9】 In ICUs, people are isolated in a room that typically has no windows or clocks. Thus, people are deprived of normal sensory stimulation and can become disoriented. Sleep is disturbed by staff members who awaken people during the night to monitor and treat them and by loud beeping monitors, intercoms, voices in the hallway, and alarms. Furthermore, most people in ICUs have serious disorders and may be treated with medications that can trigger delirium. People in ICUs may have seizures Seizure Disorders In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.\n【10】 These seizures can cause delirium, but the seizures may not be recognized because they do not cause convulsions or other typical symptoms of seizures. If the seizures are not recognized, they may not be treated appropriately and promptly. Surgery Delirium is also very common after surgery, probably because of the stress of surgery, the anesthetics used during surgery, and the pain relievers (analgesics) used after surgery. Delirium may also develop when people who are about to have surgery do not have access to a substance they have been using, such as a recreational drug, alcohol, or tobacco. When people stop using such substances, they may have withdrawal Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use.\n【11】 Drug use The most common reversible cause of delirium is use of medications and recreational drugs. In younger people, using recreational drugs and acute intoxication with alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning).\n【12】 In older people, prescription medications are usually the cause. Psychoactive drugs directly affect nerve cells in the brain, sometimes causing delirium. They include the following: Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse.\n【13】 The following are some examples: Medications with anticholinergic effects Benefits and Risks of Prescription Drugs , including many over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines Amphetamines are stimulant drugs that are used to treat certain medical conditions but are also subject to abuse.\n【14】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful.\n【15】 Delirium commonly occurs in people who have alcohol use disorder and who suddenly stop drinking alcohol (called delirium tremens Withdrawal symptoms ) and in people who have heroin use disorder and who suddenly stop using heroin. Disorders Abnormal blood levels of electrolytes Overview of Electrolytes Well over half of the body's weight is made up of water. Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments.\n【16】 Abnormal electrolyte levels may result from use of a diuretic, dehydration, or disorders such as kidney failure and widespread cancer. Blood sugar levels that are extremely high (hyperglycemia) or low ,hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes.\n【17】 An underactive thyroid gland ,hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions.\n【18】 An overactive thyroid gland ,hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions.\n【19】 If liver failure Liver Failure Liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function. Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.\n【20】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.\n【21】 In these disorders, the liver or kidneys do not process and eliminate medications normally. As a result, medications may accumulate in the blood and reach the brain, causing delirium. In younger people (once drugs and alcohol are excluded), the cause of delirium is usually A condition that directly affects the brain—for example, a brain infection, such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space).\n【22】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.\n【23】 Wernicke encephalopathy Wernicke Encephalopathy Wernicke encephalopathy is a brain disorder that causes confusion, eye problems, and loss of balance and results from thiamin deficiency.\n【24】 If untreated, Wernicke encephalopathy can cause severe brain damage, coma, or death.\n【25】 Delirium may be the first symptom in older people with a viral disease, such as COVID-19. Poisons In younger people, ingestion of poisons, such as rubbing alcohol or antifreeze, is a common cause of delirium. Spotlight on Aging: Delirium is more common among older people. It is a common reason that family members of older people seek help from a doctor or at a hospital. About 15 to 50% of older people experience delirium at some time during a hospital stay. Causes In older people, delirium can result from any condition that causes delirium in younger people. But it can also result from less severe conditions, such as the following: Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration.\n【26】 People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence.\n【27】  Use of a bladder catheter (a thin tube used to drain urine from the bladder) Certain age-related changes make older people more susceptible to developing delirium. These changes include An increased sensitivity to medications or drugs Changes in the brain The presence of conditions that increase the risk of delirium Drugs: Older people are much more sensitive to many medications and drugs. In older people, drugs that affect the way the brain functions, such as sedatives, are the most common cause of delirium. However, drugs that do not normally affect brain function, including many over-the-counter medications (especially antihistamines), can also cause it. Older people are more sensitive to the anticholinergic effects Benefits and Risks of Prescription Drugs that many of these medications have. One of these effects is confusion. Age-related changes in the brain: Delirium occurs more often in older people partly because some age-related changes in the brain make them more susceptible. For example, older people tend to have fewer brain cells and lower levels of acetylcholine—a substance that enables brain cells to communicate with each other. Any stress (due to a drug, disorder, or situation) that causes the level of acetylcholine to further decrease can make it harder for the brain to function. Thus, in older people, such stresses are particularly likely to cause delirium. Other conditions: Older people are also more likely to have other conditions that make them more susceptible to delirium, such as the following: Stroke Dementia Parkinson disease Other disorders that cause nerve degeneration Use of three or more medications Dehydration Undernutrition Immobility Delirium is often the first sign of another, sometimes serious disorder. For example, the first symptom in older people with COVID-19 may be delirium, sometimes with no other symptoms of COVID-19. Symptoms Delirium tends to last longer in older people. Confusion, the most obvious symptom, may be harder to recognize in older people. Younger people with delirium may be agitated, but very old people tend to become quiet and withdrawn. In such cases, recognizing delirium is even harder. Having delirium also increases the risk that older people with COVID-19 will have to stay in an intensive care unit (ICU), go to a rehabilitation facility after being discharged from the hospital, and/or die. If psychotic behavior develops in older people, it usually indicates delirium or dementia. Psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder rarely begins during old age. Older people are more likely to have dementia, which makes delirium harder to identify. Both cause confusion. Doctors try to distinguish the two by determining how quickly the confusion developed and what the person’s previous mental function was. Doctors also ask the person a series of questions that test various aspects of thinking ,mental status examination Mental Status When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【28】 Doctors usually treat people whose mental function suddenly worsens—even if they have dementia—as if they have delirium until proved otherwise. Having dementia increases the risk of developing delirium, and some people have both. Treatment Delirium and the hospitalization it usually requires can cause many other problems, such as undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients.\n【29】 Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration.\n【30】 These problems may have serious consequences in older people. Thus, older people can benefit from treatment managed by an interdisciplinary team Interdisciplinary care Providing medical care to older people can be complicated. People often have many different health care practitioners at different locations.\n【31】 Prevention To help prevent delirium in an older person during a hospital stay, family members can ask hospital staff members to help—by doing the following: Encouraging the person to move around regularly Placing a clock and calendar in the room Minimizing the interruptions and noises during the night Making sure the person eats and drinks enough Family members can visit and talk with the person and thus help keep the person oriented. People with delirium may be frightened, and the familiar voice of a family member can have a calming effect. Symptoms of Delirium usually begins suddenly and progresses over hours or days. The actions of people with delirium vary but roughly resemble those of a person who is becoming progressively more intoxicated. The hallmark of delirium is An inability to pay attention People with delirium cannot concentrate, so they have trouble processing new information and cannot recall recent events. Thus, they do not understand what is happening around them. They become disoriented. Sudden confusion about time and often about place (where they are) may be an early sign of delirium. If delirium is severe, people may not know who they or other people are. Thinking is confused, and people with delirium ramble, sometimes becoming incoherent. Their level of awareness (consciousness) may fluctuate. That is, people may be overly alert one moment and drowsy and sluggish the next. Other symptoms also often change within minutes and tend to worsen during the evening (a phenomenon called sundowning). People with delirium often sleep restlessly or reverse their sleep-wake cycle, sleeping during the day and staying awake at night. People may have bizarre, frightening visual hallucinations, seeing things or people that are not there. Some people develop paranoia (unwarranted feelings of being persecuted) or have delusions (false beliefs usually involving a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences). Personality and mood may change. Some people become so quiet and withdrawn that no one notices that they are delirious. Others become irritable, agitated, and restless and may pace. People who develop delirium after taking sedatives are likely to become very drowsy and withdrawn. Those who have taken amphetamines or who have stopped taking sedatives may become aggressive and hyperactive. Some people alternate between the two types of behavior. Delirium can last hours, days, or even longer, depending on the severity and the cause. If the cause of delirium is not quickly identified and treated, people may become increasingly drowsy and unresponsive, requiring vigorous stimulation to be aroused ,a condition called stupor and Coma Stupor is unresponsiveness from which a person can be aroused only by vigorous, physical stimulation.\n【32】 Stupor may lead to coma or death. Psychotic behavior that begins during old age usually indicates delirium or dementia. Diagnosis of Delirium A doctor's evaluation Mental status testing Blood, urine, and imaging tests to check for possible causes Doctors suspect delirium based on symptoms, particularly when people cannot pay attention and when their ability to pay attention fluctuates from one moment to the next. However, mild delirium may be difficult to recognize. Doctors may not recognize delirium in hospitalized people. Most people thought to have delirium are hospitalized to evaluate them and protect them from injuring themselves or others. Diagnostic procedures can be done quickly and safely in the hospital, and any disorders detected can be treated quickly. Because delirium may be caused by a serious disorder (which could be rapidly fatal), doctors try to identify the cause as quickly as possible. Treating the cause, once identified, can often reverse the delirium. Doctors first try to distinguish delirium from other disorders that affect mental function. Doctors do so by collecting as much information about the person’s medical history as possible, by doing a physical examination, and by testing. Medical history Friends, family members, or other observers are asked for information because people with delirium are usually unable to answer. Questions include the following: How the confusion began (suddenly or gradually) How quickly it progressed What the person’s physical and mental health has been like What drugs (including alcohol and recreational drugs, especially if the person is younger) and dietary supplements (including medicinal herbs) the person uses Whether any drugs have been started or stopped recently Information may also come from medical records, the police, emergency medical personnel, or evidence such as pill bottles and certain documents. Documents such as a checkbook, recent letters, or notification of unpaid bills or missed appointments can indicate a change in mental function. If delirium is accompanied by agitation and hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia, it must be distinguished from a psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder, such as manic-depressive illness Bipolar Disorder In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n【33】 Typically, people with a psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder do not have confusion or memory loss, and the level of consciousness does not change.  Physical examination During the physical examination, doctors check for signs of disorders that can cause delirium, such as infections and dehydration. A neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【34】 Mental status testing People who may have delirium are given a mental status test Mental Status When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【35】 First, they are asked questions to determine whether the main problem is being unable to pay attention. For example, they are read a short list and asked to repeat it. Doctors must determine whether people take in (register) what is read to them. People with delirium cannot. The mental status test also includes other questions and tasks, such as testing short-term and long-term memory, naming objects, writing sentences, and copying shapes. People with delirium may be too confused, agitated, or withdrawn to respond to this test. Testing Samples of blood and urine are usually taken and analyzed to check for disorders that doctors think may be causing delirium. For example, abnormalities in electrolyte and blood sugar levels and liver and kidney disorders are common causes of delirium. So doctors usually do blood tests to measure electrolyte and blood sugar levels and to evaluate how well the liver and kidneys are functioning. If doctors suspect a thyroid disorder, tests may be done to evaluate how well the thyroid gland is functioning. Or if doctors suspect that certain medications may be the cause, they may do tests to measure medication levels in the blood. These tests can help determine whether the levels are high enough to have harmful effects and whether a person took an overdose. Cultures Culture of Microorganisms Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.\n【36】 A chest x-ray may be done to determine whether pneumonia may be the cause of delirium, especially in older people who are breathing fast, whether or not they have a fever or cough. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually done. Sometimes a test that records the brain's electrical activity ,electroencephalography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【37】 Electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry (using a sensor that measures oxygen levels in the blood), and a chest x-ray may be used to evaluate how well the heart and lungs are functioning. In people with a fever or headache, a spinal tap Spinal Tap (lumbar puncture) may be done to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. Such analysis helps doctors rule out infection of or bleeding around the brain and spinal cord as possible causes. Treatment of Delirium Treatment of the cause General measures to manage agitation Most people who have delirium are hospitalized. However, when the cause of delirium can be corrected readily (for example, when the cause is low blood sugar), people are observed for a short time in the emergency department and can then return home. Treatment of the cause Once the cause is identified, it is promptly corrected or treated. For example, doctors treat infections with antibiotics, dehydration with fluids and electrolytes given intravenously, and delirium due to stopping alcohol with benzodiazepines (as well as measures to help people not start drinking alcohol again). Prompt treatment of the disorder causing delirium usually prevents permanent brain damage and may result in a complete recovery. Any medications that may be making the delirium worse are stopped if possible. General measures General measures are also important. The environment is kept as quiet and calm as possible. It should be well-lit to enable people to recognize what and who is in their room and where they are. Placing clocks, calendars, and family photographs in the room can help with orientation. At every opportunity, staff and family members should reassure people and remind them of the time and place. Procedures should be explained before and as they are done. People who need glasses or hearing aids should have access to them. People who have delirium are prone to many problems, including Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration.\n【38】 Preventing such problems requires meticulous care. Thus, people, particularly older people, may benefit from treatment managed by an interdisciplinary team Interdisciplinary care Providing medical care to older people can be complicated. People often have many different health care practitioners at different locations.\n【39】 Management of agitation People who are extremely agitated or who have hallucinations may injure themselves or their caregivers. The following measures can help prevent such injuries: Family members are encouraged to stay with the person. The person is put in a room near the nurses’ station. The hospital may provide an attendant to stay with the person. The person's medication regimen is simplified as much as possible. Devices, such as intravenous lines, bladder catheters, or padded restraints, are not used if possible because they can further confuse and upset the person, increasing the risk of injury. However, sometimes during hospitalization, padded restraints must be used—for example, to keep the person from pulling out intravenous lines and to prevent falls. Restraints are applied carefully by a staff member trained in their use, released at frequent intervals, and stopped as soon as possible because they can upset the person and worsen agitation. Medications are used to manage agitation only after all other measures have been ineffective.\n【40】 However, they may prolong or worsen agitation, and some have anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? , including confusion, blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, light-headedness, difficulty starting and continuing to urinate, and loss of bladder control. Newer antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine have fewer side effects than older antipsychotics, such as haloperidol. But if used for a long time, the newer medications may cause weight gain and abnormal fat (lipid) levels ,hyperlipidemia Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【41】 In older people with psychosis and dementia, these medications may increase the risk of stroke, and death. Benzodiazepines (a type of sedative Drugs Used to Treat Anxiety Disorders ), such as lorazepam, are used when delirium is due to withdrawal from a sedative or alcohol. Benzodiazepines are not used to treat delirium caused by other conditions because they can make people, particularly older people, more confused, drowsy, or both. Doctors are careful when prescribing these medications, particularly for older people. They use the lowest dose possible and stop the medication as soon as possible. Prognosis for Delirium Most people with delirium recover fully if the condition causing delirium is rapidly identified and treated. Any delay decreases the chance of a full recovery. Even when delirium is treated, some symptoms may persist for many weeks or months, and improvement may occur slowly. In some people, delirium evolves into chronic brain dysfunction similar to dementia. Hospitalized people who have delirium are more likely to develop complications in the hospital (including death) than those who do not have delirium. About 35 to 40% of people who have delirium while in a hospital die within 1 year, but the cause of death is often another serious disorder, not delirium itself. Hospitalized people who have delirium, particularly older people, have a longer hospital stay, higher treatment costs, and a longer recovery time after they leave the hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:04:40"}

Sometimes, there are tiny reddish-purple spots (called petechiae) on parts of the body that were pressed hard during delivery. However, petechiae on all parts of the body could be a sign of a disorder and need to be evaluated by the doctor. Dryness and peeling of the skin often develop within days, especially at wrist and ankle creases. Many newborns develop a rash about 24 hours after birth.

Some abnormalities occur during delivery Birth Injuries in Newborns Birth injury is damage that occurs as a result of physical pressure during the birthing process, usually during transit through the birth canal.\n【5】 Other abnormalities may be caused by a birth defect Introduction to Birth Defects of the Face, Bones, Joints, and Muscles Birth defects, also called congenital anomalies, are physical abnormalities that occur before a baby is born. \"Congenital\" means \"present at birth.\n【6】 A normal head-first delivery leaves the head slightly misshapen for several days. The bones that form the skull overlap, which allows the head to become compressed for delivery. Some swelling and bruising of the scalp is typical. Sometimes bleeding from one of the bones of the skull and its outer covering causes a small bump on the head that disappears in a few months (called a cephalhematoma). When the baby is delivered buttocks, genitals, or feet first ,breech delivery Breech presentation Position refers to whether the fetus is facing rearward (toward the woman’s back—that is, face down when the woman lies on her back) or forward (face up).\n【7】 However, the buttocks, genitals, or feet may be swollen and bruised. Delivery of a baby in the breech position is now usually avoided. When the baby is in the breech position, doctors usually recommend a cesarean delivery Breech presentation Position refers to whether the fetus is facing rearward (toward the woman’s back—that is, face down when the woman lies on her back) or forward (face up).\n【8】 Pressure during a vaginal delivery may bruise the newborn's face. In addition, compression through the birth canal may make the face initially appear asymmetrical. This asymmetry sometimes results when one of the nerves supplying the face muscles is damaged during delivery. Recovery is gradual over the next few weeks. The delivery process might also cause subconjunctival hemorrhages Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Subconjunctival hemorrhages are small accumulations of blood beneath the conjunctiva (the membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the front of the eye).\n【9】 These hemorrhages are common, do not need treatment, and typically go away within 2 weeks. Doctors examine the ears and note whether they are properly formed and in the correct place. For example, low-set or incorrectly formed ears may mean the newborn has a genetic disorder Overview of Chromosome and Gene Disorders Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain a person's genes.\n【10】 Doctors also examine the mouth for problems. Rarely, newborns are born with teeth, which may need to be removed, or a cleft lip Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate A cleft is an opening that can form in the lip (cleft lip), roof of the mouth (cleft palate), or both if the tissue does not join together completely during pregnancy.\n【11】 Doctors check to see whether newborns have an epulis (a noncancerous growth on the gums) because these growths can cause feeding problems and may block the airways. The neck is examined for swelling, growths, and twisting or spasms. Heart and lungs  The doctor listens to the heart and lungs through a stethoscope to detect any abnormality. Doctors are able to hear abnormal sounds such as a heart murmur or lung congestion. The doctor inspects the newborn's skin color. A blue color of the face and torso may be a sign of congenital heart or lung disease. The rate and strength of the pulse is checked. Doctors watch the newborn breathe and count the number of breaths in a minute. Grunting and/or flaring nostrils with breathing and breathing too fast or too slow can be signs of problems. Abdomen and genitals  than in any other system of the body.\n【12】 The doctor examines the general shape of the abdomen and also checks the size, shape, and position of internal organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Enlarged kidneys may indicate a blockage to the outflow of urine. The doctor examines the genitals to ensure the urethra is open and in the proper location. The doctor also checks to make sure the genitals are clearly male or female. In a boy, the testes should be present in the scrotum. In a girl, the labia are prominent because of exposure to the mother's hormones, and they remain swollen for the first few weeks. Secretions from the baby's vagina that contain blood and mucus are normal. The doctor examines the anus to make sure the opening is normally placed and not sealed shut. Nervous system  The doctor looks at the newborn's level of alertness, muscle tone, and ability to move arms and legs equally. Unequal movement could be a sign of an abnormality of the nerves (such as a nerve palsy). Doctors test the newborn's reflexes using various maneuvers. A newborn's most important reflexes are the Moro, rooting, and sucking reflexes. Three Common Reflexes of Newborns In the Moro reflex, when newborns are startled, they cry and fling their arms wide with fingers outstretched and draw up their legs. In the rooting reflex, when either side of their mouth or lip is stroked, newborns turn their head toward that side and open their mouth. This reflex enables newborns to find the nipple. In the sucking reflex, when an object (such as a pacifier) is placed in their mouth, newborns begin sucking immediately. Muscles and bones  The doctor examines the flexibility and mobility of the arms, legs, and hips and checks to see whether the newborn has broken any bones during delivery (particularly the collar bone) or has unformed or missing limbs Missing or Incompletely Formed Limbs can be missing, deformed, or incompletely developed at birth. Birth defects, also called congenital anomalies, are physical abnormalities that occur before a baby is born.\n【13】 The spine is examined for defects or deformities ,such as spina bifida Neural Tube Defects and Spina Bifida Neural tube defects are a certain type of birth defect of the brain, spine, and/or spinal cord.

People may also have enlarged lymph nodes and a sense of abdominal fullness due to enlargement of the spleen. Blood tests are needed for diagnosis. Treatment includes chemotherapy drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and sometimes radiation therapy.  More than three fourths of the people who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are older than 60, and the disease is extremely rare in children. CLL is the most common type of leukemia Overview of Leukemia Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells or of cells that develop into white blood cells. White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow.\n【1】 It is rare in Japan and Southeast Asia, which suggests that genetics plays some role in its development. The number of cancerous, mature-appearing lymphocytes increases first in the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Cancerous lymphocytes then spread to the liver and spleen, both of which begin to enlarge.\n【2】 The smaller number of healthy lymphocytes that remain are not always able to produce enough antibodies so infection is likely. Also, the immune system, which ordinarily defends the body against foreign organisms and substances, sometimes becomes misguided, reacting to and destroying normal tissues. This misguided immune activity can result in the destruction of red blood cells, neutrophils, or platelets. CLL can sometimes transform into an aggressive cancer called lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, which reside in the lymphatic system and in blood-forming organs. Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\n【3】 This type of transformation, called Richter's transformation, happens in 2 to 10 percent of cases. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia does not occur in children. Symptoms of CLL In early stages of CLL, most people have no symptoms, and the disease is diagnosed only because of an increased white blood cell count. Later symptoms may include Enlarged lymph nodes Fatigue Loss of appetite Weight loss Night sweats Shortness of breath when exercising A sense of abdominal fullness resulting from an enlarged spleen As CLL progresses, people may appear pale and bruise easily. Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections may occur late in the course of the disease as the bone marrow produces fewer healthy white blood cells to fight infection. Diagnosis of CLL Blood tests Sometimes CLL is discovered accidentally when blood counts ordered for some other reason show an increased number of lymphocytes. Specialized blood tests (called flow cytometry and immunophenotyping) to characterize the abnormal lymphocytes can be done on the cells in the blood. Blood tests also may show that the numbers of red blood cells, platelets, and antibodies are low. A bone marrow evaluation Bone Marrow Examination Red blood cells, most white blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow, the soft fatty tissue inside bone cavities.\n【4】 Prognosis for CLL Usually CLL progresses slowly. Doctors determine how far the disease has progressed (staging) to predict the survival time. Staging is based on several factors, including the Number of lymphocytes in the blood Number of lymphocytes in the bone marrow Size of the spleen Size of the liver Number of red blood cells in the blood Number of platelets in the blood People who are in the early stages of CLL often survive 10 to 20 years or longer after the diagnosis is made and usually do not need treatment in the early stages. People who have a low number of red blood cells ,anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.\n【5】 Usually, death occurs because the bone marrow can no longer produce a sufficient number of normal cells to carry oxygen, fight infections, and prevent bleeding. For reasons probably related to changes in the immune system, people who have CLL are more likely to develop other cancers, such as skin cancers Overview of Skin Cancer Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Skin cancer is most common among people who work or play sports outside and among sunbathers.\n【6】 Skin cancer is most common among people who work or play sports outside and among sunbathers.\n【7】 CLL can also transform into a more aggressive type of cancer of the lymphatic system ,lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, which reside in the lymphatic system and in blood-forming organs. Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\n【8】 Treatment of CLL Chemotherapy Immunotherapy Because CLL progresses slowly, many people do not need treatment for years, Doctors usually wait to begin treatment until one or more of the following occur The number of lymphocytes begins to increase and cause symptoms The lymph nodes begin to enlarge The number of red blood cells or platelets decreases Drug treatment of CLL Drugs, including chemotherapy and Other Systemic Cancer Treatments Systemic treatments are those that have effects throughout the body rather than being applied directly to the cancer.\n【9】 These treatments target specific genetic characteristics of the tumor cells.\n【10】 Treatment can control CLL for many years and can often be used again with success when the leukemia regrows. There is no standard combination of drugs that is used for CLL. For B-cell CLL, initial drug treatment usually includes drugs such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, which kill cancer cells by interacting with DNA. Currently, chemotherapy and a monoclonal antibody called rituximab are also used to treat CLL. This combination therapy usually is successful in controlling CLL (inducing remission). Eventually, most CLL becomes resistant to these drugs. Treatments with other drugs or other monoclonal antibodies are then considered. Ibrutinib is a drug that has induced lasting remissions in some people with CLL. It can be used for initial treatment or for CLL that is unlikely to respond to other treatments, for CLL that fails to respond to other treatment (refractory) or for CLL that has relapsed. Obinutuzumab may be used in older people with both CLL and other illnesses.

Anxiety may result in physical symptoms. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with behavioral therapy and drugs, usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n【1】 Some anxiety is a normal aspect of development, as in the following: Most toddlers become fearful when separated from their mother, especially in unfamiliar surroundings. Fears of the dark, monsters, bugs, and spiders are common in 3- to 4-year-olds. Shy children may initially react to new situations with fear or withdrawal. Fears of injury and death are more common among older children. Older children and adolescents often become anxious when giving a book report in front of their classmates. Such difficulties should not be viewed as evidence of a disorder. However, if manifestations of anxiety become so exaggerated that they greatly impair function or cause severe distress and/or avoidance, an anxiety disorder should be considered. Anxiety disorders emerge in about 3% of 6-year-olds and in about 5% of teenage boys and 10% of teenage girls ,1–3 General references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【2】 Children with an anxiety disorder have an increased risk of depression ,4 General references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【3】 Anxiety disorders that can occur in children and adolescents include Agoraphobia in Children and Adolescents Agoraphobia is a persistent fear of being trapped in situations or places without a way to escape easily and without help. Diagnosis is by history.\n【4】 The fears provoke anxiety and avoidance.\n【5】 Merikangas KR, He JP, Burstein M, et al: Lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in US adolescents: Results from the National Comorbidity Study – Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A).

Dalsgaard S, Thorsteinsson E, Trabjerg BB, et al: Incidence rates and cumulative incidences of the full spectrum of diagnosed mental disorders in childhood and adolescence\n【6】 Etiology Evidence suggests that anxiety disorders involve dysfunction in the parts of the limbic system and hippocampus that regulate emotions and response to fear. In mice, loss of expression of the serotonin 1A-receptor (5-HT1AR) in the forebrain during early development results in dysregulation of the hippocampus and leads to anxiety behaviors ,1 Etiology reference Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【7】 Heritability studies indicate a role for genetic and environmental factors. No specific genes have been identified; many genetic variants are probably involved. Anxious parents tend to have anxious children; having such parents may make children’s problems worse than they otherwise might be. Even normal children have difficulty remaining calm and composed in the presence of an anxious parent, and children who are genetically predisposed to anxiety have even greater difficulty.\n【8】 Symptoms and Signs Perhaps the most common manifestation of an anxiety disorder in children and adolescents is school refusal. “School refusal” has largely supplanted the term “school phobia.” Actual fear of school is exceedingly rare. Most children who refuse to go to school probably have separation anxiety, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or a combination. Some have a specific phobia. The possibility that the child is being bullied at school must also be considered. Some children complain directly about their anxiety, describing it in terms of worries—eg, “I am worried that I will never see you again” (separation anxiety) or “I am worried the kids will laugh at me” (social anxiety disorder). However, most children couch their discomfort in terms of somatic complaints: “I cannot go to school because I have a stomachache.” These children are often telling the truth because an upset stomach, nausea, headaches, and sleep problems often develop in children with anxiety. Several long-term follow-up studies confirm that many children with somatic complaints, especially abdominal pain, have an underlying anxiety disorder. Diagnosis Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is through a clinical assessment (1 Diagnosis reference Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【9】 A thorough psychosocial history can usually confirm it. Rating scales can be useful for screening. Several validated scales are freely available: Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders [SCARED] , Spence Children's Anxiety Scale [SCAS] , Preschool Anxiety Scale [PAS] , and General Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] ). The physical symptoms that anxiety can cause in children can complicate the evaluation. In many children, considerable testing for physical disorders is done before clinicians consider an anxiety disorder.\n【10】 Prognosis depends on severity, availability of competent treatment, and the child’s resiliency. Many children struggle with anxiety symptoms into adulthood. However, with early treatment, many children learn how to control their anxiety. Treatment Behavioral therapy ,exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy , 1 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【11】 Anxiety disorders in children are treated with behavioral therapy (using principles of exposure and response prevention), sometimes in conjunction with drug therapy ,4 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【12】 In exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), children are systematically exposed to the anxiety-provoking situation in a graded fashion. By helping children remain in the anxiety-provoking situation (response prevention), therapists enable them to gradually become desensitized and feel less anxiety. Behavioral therapy is most effective when an experienced therapist knowledgeable in child development individualizes these principles. In mild cases, behavioral therapy alone is usually sufficient, but drug therapy may be needed when cases are more severe or when access to an experienced child behavior therapist is limited. SSRIs are usually the first choice for long-term treatment . SSRIs combined with CBT have the highest likelihood of improving symptoms ,4 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【13】 Benzodiazepines are better for acute anxiety (eg, due to a medical procedure) but are not preferred for long-term treatment. Benzodiazepines with a short-half life (eg, lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg to a maximum of 2 mg in a single dose) are the best choice. Buspirone was found to be well tolerated in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17) with a generalized anxiety disorder ,1 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【14】 Reports of improvement in developmental disorders such as Williams syndrome ,5 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.\n【15】 Occasionally, upset stomach, diarrhea, insomnia, or weight gain may occur. Some children have behavioral adverse effects (eg, agitation, disinhibition); these effects are usually mild to moderate. Usually, decreasing the drug dose or changing to a different drug eliminates or reduces these effects. Rarely, behavioral adverse effects (eg, aggressiveness, increased suicidality) are severe. Behavioral adverse effects are idiosyncratic and may occur with any antidepressant and at any time during treatment. As a result, children and adolescents taking such drugs must be closely monitored.\n【16】 Key Points The most common manifestation of an anxiety disorder may be school refusal; most children couch their discomfort in terms of somatic complaints. Consider anxiety as a disorder in children only when anxiety becomes so exaggerated that it greatly impairs functioning or causes severe distress and/or avoidance. Behavioral therapy (using principles of exposure and response prevention) is most effective when done by an experienced therapist who is knowledgeable about child development and who tailors these principles to the child. When cases are more severe or when access to an experienced child behavior therapist is limited, drugs may be needed.

Patients with fight bites require antibiotics Infected Bite Wounds of the Hand A small puncture wound, particularly from a human or cat bite, may involve significant injury to the tendon, joint capsule, or articular cartilage.\n【2】 Rotational deformity due to a fracture in the hand Normally, when the proximal interphalangeal joints are flexed to 90°, lines from the distal phalanges converge at a point on the proximal carpal bones. Deviation of one of these lines suggests a metacarpal fracture. Diagnosis of Metacarpal Neck Fractures X-rays Metacarpal Neck Fractures Metacarpal Neck Fracture The 5th metacarpal neck bone is fractured midshaft.\n【3】 Fracture of the 5th Metacarpal Neck This colored x-ray shows a fracture of the 5th metacarpal neck. In this view, angulation appears to be < 45°, suggesting that reduction is not necessary.\n【4】 Typically, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views are diagnostic. Treatment of Metacarpal Neck Fractures Prophylactic antibiotics for open wounds Splinting For certain fractures, reduction If patients have any wounds, particularly linear punctures, near the metacarpophalangeal joint, they should be specifically questioned about whether they punched someone in the mouth.\n【5】 Treatment of a metacarpal neck fracture is with a splint (eg, an ulnar gutter splint Ulnar gutter splint for fractures of the 4th or 5th metacarpal), usually for at least a few weeks. Whether reduction is needed before the splint is applied depends on the fracture. Reduction is not necessary for dorsal or volar angulation of < 35° for the 4th metacarpal < 45° for the 5th metacarpal Reduction is necessary for Rotational deformity of any metacarpal Fractures of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpals with angulation Usually, closed reduction is possible. Use of a hematoma block or an ulnar nerve block can help reduce the pain during reduction. After the splint is removed, patients can gradually begin range-of-motion exercises. How To Apply an Ulnar Gutter Splint VIDEO Ulnar gutter splint Key Points Metacarpal neck fractures cause pain, swelling, tenderness, and sometimes deformity (eg, rotational deformity). Take anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique x-rays. If patients have wounds near the metacarpophalangeal joint, ask them whether they punched someone in the mouth; if they did, take measures to prevent infection (eg, prophylactic antibiotics). Treat a metacarpal neck fracture with a splint; if angulation is significant or if rotational deformity is present, reduce the fracture first, usually using closed reduction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#3#对于图片的描述，无关句子", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 23:03:26"}

Etiology of Scrotal Pain The most common causes of scrotal pain include Testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply.\n【1】 Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally.\n【2】 Symptoms are testicular pain and swelling. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is symptomatic.\n【3】 Age, onset of symptoms, and other findings can help determine the cause.  Evaluation of Scrotal Pain Expeditious evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are required because untreated testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply.\n【4】 History of present illness should determine location (unilateral or bilateral), onset (acute or subacute), and duration of pain. Important associated symptoms include fever, dysuria, penile discharge, and presence of scrotal mass. Patients should be asked about preceding events, including injury, straining or lifting, and sexual contact. Review of systems should seek symptoms of causative disorders, including purpuric rash, abdominal pain, and arthralgias ,immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis Immunoglobulin A–Associated Vasculitis (IgAV) Immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is vasculitis that affects primarily small vessels. It occurs most often in children.\n【5】 Past medical history should identify known disorders that may cause referred pain, including hernias, abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【6】 Physical examination Physical examination begins with a review of vital signs and assessment of the severity of pain. Examination focuses on the abdomen, inguinal region, and genitals. The abdomen is examined for tenderness and masses (including bladder distention). Flanks are percussed for costovertebral angle tenderness. Inguinal and genital examination should be done with the patient standing. Inguinal area is inspected and palpated for adenopathy, swelling, or erythema. Examination of the penis should note ulcerations, urethral discharge, and piercings and tattoos (sources of bacterial infections). Scrotal examination should note asymmetry, swelling, erythema or discoloration, and positioning of the testes (horizontal vs vertical, high vs low). Cremasteric reflex should be tested bilaterally. The testes, epididymides, and spermatic cords should be palpated for swelling and tenderness. If swelling is present, the area should be transilluminated to help determine whether the swelling is cystic or solid. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Sudden onset of pain; exquisite tenderness; and a high-riding, horizontally displaced testis ,testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply.\n【7】 Clinical findings provide important clues . Aortic catastrophes and Fournier gangrene occur primarily in patients aged > 50 years; the other conditions that require immediate treatment can occur at any age. However, testicular torsion is most common in neonates and postpubertal boys, torsion of the testicular appendage occurs most commonly in prepubertal boys (7 to 14 years), and epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, occasionally accompanied by inflammation of the testis (epididymo-orchitis). Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally.\n【8】 Severe, sudden onset of pain suggests testicular torsion or renal calculus Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【9】 Pain from epididymitis, incarcerated hernia, or appendicitis is acute inflammation of the vermiform appendix, typically resulting in abdominal pain, anorexia, and abdominal tenderness.\n【10】 Patients with torsion of the testicular appendage present with moderate pain that develops over a few days; pain is localized to the upper pole. Bilateral pain suggests infection (eg, orchitis, particularly if accompanied by fever and viral symptoms) or a referred cause. Flank pain that radiates to the scrotum suggests renal calculus or, in men aged > 55 years, abdominal aortic aneurysm. Normal findings on scrotal and perineal examination suggest referred pain. Attention must then be directed to extrascrotal disorders, particularly appendicitis, renal calculi, and, in men > 55, abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【11】 Abnormal scrotal and perineal examination findings often suggest a cause. Sometimes, early in epididymitis, tenderness and induration may be localized to the epididymis; early in torsion, the testis may be clearly high-riding, with a horizontal lie and the epididymis not particularly tender. However, frequently the testis and epididymis are both swollen and tender, there is scrotal edema, and it is not possible to differentiate epididymitis from torsion by palpation.\n【12】 Sometimes, a scrotal mass caused by a hernia may be palpable in the inguinal canal; in other cases, hernia can be difficult to distinguish from testicular swelling. Painful erythema of the scrotum with no tenderness of the testes or epididymides should raise suspicion of infection, either cellulitis is acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue most often caused by streptococci or staphylococci.\n【13】 A vasculitic rash, abdominal pain, and arthralgias are consistent with a systemic vasculitis syndrome such as immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis Immunoglobulin A–Associated Vasculitis (IgAV) Immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is vasculitis that affects primarily small vessels. It occurs most often in children.\n【14】 Testing is typically done. Urinalysis and culture (all patients) STI testing (all patients with positive urinalysis, discharge, or dysuria) Color Doppler ultrasonography to rule out torsion (no clear-cut alternate cause) Other testing as suggested by findings  Urinalysis and culture are always required. Findings of urinary tract infection (UTI—eg, pyuria, bacteriuria) suggest epididymitis. Patients with findings that suggest UTI and patients with urethral discharge or dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation. Some disorders cause a painful ache over the bladder or perineum.\n【15】 Timely diagnosis of testicular torsion is critical. If findings are highly suggestive of torsion, immediate surgical exploration is done in preference to testing. If findings are equivocal and there is no clear alternate cause of acute scrotal pain, color Doppler ultrasonography Doppler is done. If Doppler ultrasonography is not available, radionuclide scanning Radionuclide Scanning Radionuclide scanning uses the radiation released by radionuclides (called nuclear decay) to produce images.\n【16】 Treatment of Scrotal Pain Treatment is directed at the cause and can range from emergency surgery ,testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply.\n【17】 If testicular torsion is present, prompt surgery (< 12 hours after presentation) is generally required. Delayed surgery may lead to testicular infarction, long-term testicular damage, or the loss of a testis. Surgical detorsion of the testis relieves the pain immediately, and simultaneous bilateral orchiopexy prevents recurrence of torsion. Analgesics, such as morphine or other opioids, are indicated for the relief of acute pain. Antibiotics are indicated for cases of bacterial epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, occasionally accompanied by inflammation of the testis (epididymo-orchitis). Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally.\n【18】 Symptoms are testicular pain and swelling. Treatment is symptomatic.\n【19】 Geriatrics Essentials: Scrotal Pain Testicular torsion is uncommon in older men, and when present, the manifestations are usually atypical and therefore diagnosis is delayed. Epididymitis, orchitis, and trauma are more common in older men. Occasionally, inguinal hernia Hernias of the Abdominal Wall A hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or congenital area of weakness or defect in the wall.\n【20】 Causes vary.\n【21】 Key Points Always consider testicular torsion in patients with acute scrotal pain, particularly in children and adolescents; quick, accurate diagnosis is essential. Other common causes of scrotal pain are torsion of the testicular appendage and epididymitis. Color Doppler ultrasonography is usually done when the diagnosis is unclear.

Birth defects, also called congenital anomalies, are physical abnormalities that occur before a baby is born. \"Congenital\" means \"present at birth.\"  The most common cause of congenital torticollis is Injury to the baby's neck during delivery The injury may damage neck muscles and/or cause a collection of blood (hematoma) in the neck muscles. These can lead to an abnormal thickening of neck tissue (fibrosis) and neck muscle stiffening (contracture). Very rarely, bones of the spine (vertebrae) are broken or dislocated during birth.

Virilization is caused by excess production of androgens usually because of a tumor in or enlargement of an adrenal gland or a tumor in an ovary or abnormal hormone production by the ovaries. Symptoms include excess facial and body hair, baldness, acne, deepening of the voice, increased muscularity, and an increased sex drive. The body changes make it easy for doctors to recognize virilization, and the dexamethasone suppression test can help doctors determine the cause. The adrenal gland that contains the tumor is surgically removed, although sometimes drugs can reduce the excess hormone production.  The most common cause of virilization caused by adrenal sex hormones is an Enlargement of the hormone-producing portions of the adrenal cortex (adrenal hyperplasia) Other causes include A hormone-producing tumor (adenoma or cancer) in the adrenal gland A cancer outside the adrenal gland that produces adrenal androgens Large amounts of androgen pills or injections ,anabolic steroids Anabolic Steroids Anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone that are used to increase muscle size.\n【1】 Occasionally, overactivity of androgen secretion by the ovaries may occur in later life. An enzyme abnormality in the adrenal glands is often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and is termed congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Symptoms of Virilization Symptoms depend on the sex and age of the person affected. Symptoms of virilization include excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), baldness, acne, deepening of the voice, increased muscularity, and an increased sex drive. In women, the uterus shrinks, the clitoris enlarges, the breasts become smaller, and normal menstruation stops. In men, the excess adrenal hormones may suppress the function of the testes and cause infertility.

If untreated, the growing centers of the bones (growth plates) may close prematurely and short stature may result. Affected boys may experience premature sexual maturation. Diagnosis of Virilization Measurement of levels of androgens in the blood The combination of body changes makes virilization relatively easy for doctors to recognize. Tests can determine the level of androgens in the blood and, if they are high, whether they are likely coming from the sex organs or the adrenal glands. When the level of adrenal androgens is very high, some centers use a dexamethasone suppression test to help determine whether the problem is an adenoma or adrenal hyperplasia. If the problem is adrenal hyperplasia, giving the drug dexamethasone prevents the adrenal glands from producing androgens. If the problem is an adenoma or cancer, dexamethasone reduces androgen production only partially or not at all. Doctors may do computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain a view of the adrenal glands.

The symptoms can follow mental factors such as conflicts or other stresses. People may complain that an arm or leg is paralyzed or that they have lost their sense of touch, sight, or hearing. Many physical examinations and tests are usually done to make sure symptoms do not result from a physical disorder. Reassurance from a supportive, trusted doctor can help, as can hypnosis Hypnotherapy is a type of mind-body medicine. In hypnotherapy (hypnosis), people are guided into an advanced state of relaxation and heightened attention.\n【1】 As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated nearly as successfully as physical disorders.\n【2】 Functional neurological symptom disorder sometimes follows stress and conflict, which people with this disorder experience as (convert into) physical symptoms. People do not do this intentionally and are not aware they are doing it. They experience their symptoms just as though they were caused by a physical disorder. Although functional neurological symptom disorder tends to develop during late childhood to early adulthood, it may appear at any age. The disorder appears to be more common among women. Symptoms The symptoms of functional neurological symptom disorder—such as paralysis of an arm or leg or loss of sensation in a part of the body—suggest nervous system dysfunction. Other symptoms may resemble a seizure or involve problems with thinking, difficulty swallowing, or loss of one of the special senses, such as vision or hearing. Often, symptoms begin after some distressing social or psychologic event. Symptoms are not consciously produced. That is, people are not faking their symptoms. Symptoms are severe enough to cause substantial distress and to interfere with functioning. People may have only one episode in their lifetime or episodes that occur sporadically. Usually, the episodes are brief. Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation Doctors first check for physical, particularly neurologic, disorders that can account for the symptoms by taking a thorough medical history, doing a thorough physical examination, and doing tests. The key to the diagnosis is that symptoms do not match those caused by any neurologic disorder. For example, the person may tremble and think that the trembling is caused by a seizure disorder. But when the person is distracted, the trembling disappears. If people are having a seizure, distractions do not stop the trembling. Also, for doctors to diagnose functional neurological symptom disorder, the symptoms must cause substantial distress and interfere with functioning. Once doctors determine that the symptoms do not match those caused by any neurologic disorder, doctors consider the diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder. The diagnosis is made based on all the information from the evaluation. Treatment Support from a doctor Hypnosis Psychotherapy A supportive, trustful doctor-patient relationship is essential. The most helpful approach may involve collaboration of a primary care doctor with a psychiatrist and a doctor from another field, such as a neurologist. After the doctor rules out a possible physical disorder and reassures the person that the symptoms do not indicate a serious underlying disorder, the person may begin to feel better, and the symptoms may fade.

Anorectal fistulas are common among people who have an anorectal abscess, Crohn disease, or tuberculosis. Anorectal fistulas can cause pain and produce pus. The diagnosis is based on an examination and other viewing techniques. Treatment may involve surgery, but some less invasive alternatives exist. The rectum is the section of the digestive tract above the anus where stool is held before it passes out of the body through the anus. The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body.  Most fistulas begin in a deep gland in the wall of the anus or rectum.

Sinus cancer happens most often in people from Japan and South Africa—it’s rare in other groups Doctors don’t know what causes sinus cancer but think it may be related to breathing in certain types of wood and metal dust—it isn’t caused by sinus infections You may not have symptoms until the cancer has grown and pushes on other structures To treat sinus cancer, doctors do surgery and radiation therapy What are the symptoms of sinus cancer? The sinuses have empty space in which cancer can grow without pressing on anything. For this reason, you may not have any symptoms at first.

Doctors will look inside your sinuses by putting a flexible viewing tube through your nose and into your sinuses. They may do a biopsy. With a biopsy, they remove a sample of tissue to look at under a microscope. Doctors will do tests to see how big your cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of your body: They'll do this using: CT scan Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles.

Hyposmia is partial loss of smell. If unilateral, anosmia is often unrecognized. Most patients with anosmia have normal perception of salty, sweet, sour, and bitter substances but lack flavor discrimination, which largely depends on olfaction. Therefore, they often complain of losing the sense of taste (ageusia) and of not enjoying food.\n【1】 Drugs can contribute to anosmia in susceptible patients. Other causes include prior head and neck radiation, recent nasal or sinus surgery, nasal and brain tumors, and toxins. The role of tobacco is uncertain. Anosmia may be an early symptom, and thus a clue to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pearls & Pitfalls Immediately quarantine patients at risk of COVID-19 who have sudden loss of smell. Evaluation of Anosmia History of present illness should assess the time course of symptoms and their relation to any URI or head injury. Important associated symptoms are nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or both. The nature of rhinorrhea should be assessed (eg, watery, mucoid, purulent, bloody). Review of systems should assess neurologic symptoms, particularly those involving mental status (eg, difficulty with recent memory) and cranial nerves (eg, diplopia, difficulty speaking or swallowing, tinnitus, vertigo). Past medical history should include history of sinus disorders, cranial trauma or surgery, allergies, drugs used, and exposure to chemicals or fumes. Physical examination The nasal passages should be inspected for swelling, inflammation, discharge, and polyps. Having the patient breathe through each nostril sequentially (while the other is manually occluded) may help identify obstruction. A complete neurologic examination, particularly of mental status and cranial nerves, is done. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Previous head injury Neurologic symptoms or signs Sudden onset Local or global epidemic of COVID-19 Interpretation of findings Sudden onset after significant head trauma Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function.\n【2】 A history of chronic rhinosinusitis sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactions.\n【3】 However, because these findings are common in the population, the physician should be wary of missing another disorder. Progressive confusion and recent memory loss in an older patient suggest Alzheimer disease Alzheimer Disease Alzheimer disease causes progressive cognitive deterioration and is characterized by beta-amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray matter.\n【4】 Waxing and waning neurologic symptoms affecting multiple areas suggest a neurodegenerative disease such as multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord.\n【5】 Slowly progressive anosmia in an older patient with no other symptoms or findings suggests normal aging as the cause. Testing An in-office test of olfaction can help confirm olfactory dysfunction. Commonly, one nostril is pressed shut, and a pungent odor such as from a vial containing coffee, cinnamon, or tobacco is placed under the open nostril; if the patient can identify the substance, olfaction is presumed intact. The test is repeated on the other nostril to determine whether the response is bilateral. Unfortunately, the test is crude and unreliable. If anosmia is present and no cause is readily apparent on clinical evaluation , patients should have CT of the head (including sinuses) with contrast to rule out a tumor or unsuspected fracture of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. MRI is also used to evaluate intracranial disease and may be needed as well, particularly in those patients with no nasal or sinus pathology on CT. A psychophysical assessment of odor and taste identification and threshold detection is done as well. This assessment commonly involves use of one or several commercially available testing kits. One kit uses a scratch-and-sniff battery of odors, whereas another kit involves sequential dilutions of an odorous chemical. If COVID-19 is suspected, patients should be tested and managed according to local protocols. Treatment of Anosmia Specific causes are treated; however, smell does not always recover even after successful treatment of sinusitis. There are no treatments for anosmia. Patients who retain some sense of smell may find adding concentrated flavoring agents to food improves their enjoyment of eating. Smoke alarms, important in all homes, are even more essential for patients with anosmia. Patients should be cautioned about consumption of stored food and use of natural gas for cooking or heating, because they have difficulty detecting food spoilage or gas leaks. Geriatrics Essentials There is a significant loss of olfactory receptor neurons with normal aging, leading to a marked diminution of the sense of smell. Changes are usually noticeable by age 60 and can be marked after age 70. Key Points Anosmia may be part of normal aging. Common causes include URI, sinusitis, and head trauma.

Diagnosis is by endoscopy. Treatment is eradication of H. pylori and sometimes acid suppression.\n【2】 Pathology of Nonerosive Gastritis Superficial gastritis Lymphocytes and plasma cells mixed with neutrophils are the predominant infiltrating inflammatory cells. Inflammation is superficial and may involve the antrum, body, or both. It is usually not accompanied by atrophy or metaplasia. Prevalence increases with age. Deep gastritis Deep gastritis is more likely to be symptomatic (eg, vague dyspepsia). Mononuclear cells and neutrophils infiltrate the entire mucosa to the level of the muscularis, but exudate or crypt abscesses seldom result, as might be expected by such infiltration. Distribution may be patchy. Superficial gastritis may be present, as may partial gland atrophy and metaplasia. Gastric atrophy of gastric glands may follow in gastritis, most often long-standing antral gastritis (sometimes referred to as type B gastritis). Some patients with gastric atrophy have autoantibodies to parietal cells, usually in association with corpus gastritis (type A gastritis) and pernicious anemia. Atrophy may occur without specific symptoms. Endoscopically, the mucosa may appear normal until atrophy is advanced, when submucosal vascularity may be visible. As atrophy becomes complete, secretion of acid and pepsin diminishes and intrinsic factor may be lost, resulting in vitamin B12 malabsorption. Metaplasia Two types of metaplasia are common in chronic nonerosive gastritis: Mucous gland Intestinal Mucous gland metaplasia (pseudopyloric metaplasia) occurs in the setting of severe atrophy of the gastric glands, which are progressively replaced by mucous glands (antral mucosa), especially along the lesser curve. Gastric ulcers may be present (typically at the junction of antral and corpus mucosa), but whether they are the cause or consequence of these metaplastic changes is not clear. Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in the antrum in response to chronic mucosal injury and may extend to the body. Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa—with goblet cells, endocrine (enterochromaffin or enterochromaffin-like) cells, and rudimentary villi—and may even assume functional (absorptive) characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete (most common) or incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia. Intestinal metaplasia may lead to stomach cancer Stomach Cancer Etiology of stomach cancer is multifactorial, but Helicobacter pylori plays a significant role.\n【3】 Symptoms and Signs of Nonerosive Gastritis Most patients with H. pylori–associated gastritis are asymptomatic, although some have mild Dyspepsia is a sensation of pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen; it often is recurrent.\n【4】 Diagnosis of Nonerosive Gastritis Endoscopy Often, the condition is discovered during endoscopy done for other purposes.

Hot smoke usually burns only the pharynx because the incoming gas cools quickly. An exception is steam, which carries much more heat energy than smoke and thus can also burn the lower airways (below the glottis). Many toxic chemicals produced in routine house fires (eg, hydrogen chloride, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, toxic aldehydes, ammonia) cause chemical burns. Some toxic products of combustion, such as carbon monoxide Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes acute symptoms such as headache, nausea, weakness, angina, dyspnea, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma.\n【1】 Burns are injuries of skin or other tissue caused by thermal, radiation, chemical, or electrical contact.\n【2】 Upper airway injury usually causes symptoms within minutes but occasionally over several hours; upper airway edema may cause stridor.

These layers form the myelin sheath.\n【1】 Demyelination is the destruction of the tissues that wrap around nerves, called the myelin sheath. Insulating a Nerve Fiber Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin. These layers form the myelin sheath. Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, the myelin sheath enables nerve signals (electrical impulses) to be conducted along the nerve fiber with speed and accuracy. When the myelin sheath is damaged (called demyelination), nerves do not conduct electrical impulses normally. Sometimes primary demyelinating disorders develop after a viral infection or vaccination against a viral infection. A likely explanation is that the virus or another substance somehow triggers the immune system to attack the body’s own tissues ,autoimmune reaction Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues. What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known.\n【2】 The autoimmune reaction results in inflammation, which damages the myelin sheath and the nerve fiber under it. Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed.\n【3】 Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) This rare type of inflammation leads to demyelination Overview of Demyelinating Disorders Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin. These layers form the myelin sheath.\n【4】 Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is more common among children than among adults. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis usually develops after a viral infection. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is thought to be a misguided immune reaction triggered by the virus. In the United States, this disorder usually results from some types of influenza (Flu) Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses.\n【5】 Enterovirus infections are caused by many different viruses.\n【6】 The virus is spread through kissing.\n【7】 Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that causes various cold-like symptoms and a characteristic rash. Measles is caused by a virus.\n【8】 Typically, the inflammation develops 1 to 3 weeks after the viral illness begins. Symptoms of ADEM Symptoms of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis appear rapidly. At first, people may have a fever, a headache, nausea, and vomiting and feel tired. When the disorder is severe, it can cause seizures and coma. Vision in one or both eyes may be lost. Muscles may become weak, and coordination may be impaired, making walking difficult. People may become paralyzed. Sensation may be lost in parts of the body, making them feel numb. Mental function (including thinking, judgment, and learning) may be affected. Most people recover within days, and within 6 months, most have totally or almost totally recovered. Other people may remain impaired the rest of their life. Muscles may remain weak, and areas of the body may remain numb. People may not recover their vision or mental function. Diagnosis of ADEM A doctor's evaluation Doctors may be able to diagnose acute disseminated encephalomyelitis based on symptoms and results of a physical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done. A spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【9】 Blood tests may be done to check for other disorders that cause similar symptoms. Treatment of ADEM Corticosteroids Immune globulin or plasma exchange Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can be treated with corticosteroids given intravenously. Immune globulin and plasma exchange Plateletpheresis (platelet donation) In addition to normal blood donation and transfusion, special procedures are sometimes used. In plateletpheresis, a donor gives only platelets rather than whole blood.\n【10】 These treatments may be used with or without corticosteroids. Immune globulin consists of antibodies obtained from the blood of people with a normal immune system. For plasma exchange, blood is withdrawn, abnormal antibodies are removed from it, and the blood is returned to the person. Nerve Cells and Fibers VIDEO Adrenoleukodystrophy and Adrenomyeloneuropathy Adrenoleukodystrophy X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy Peroxisomal disorders are a group of hereditary metabolic disorders that occur when peroxisomes are missing or do not function correctly in the body.\n【11】 In these disorders, fats are not broken down as they normally are. These fats accumulate mainly in the brain, spinal cord, and adrenal glands. In the brain, they cause demyelination of nerves. Adrenoleukodystrophy affects young boys, usually between the ages of 4 and 8. A milder, more slowly developing form of the disorder can begin during adolescence or young adulthood. Adrenomyeloneuropathy is a milder form. It begins when men are in the 20s or 30s, In these disorders, widespread demyelination Overview of Demyelinating Disorders Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin. These layers form the myelin sheath.\n【12】 They are endocrine glands, which secrete hormones into the bloodstream. Each adrenal gland has two parts.\n【13】 Boys have behavioral problems and problems with hearing and vision. Eventually, mental deterioration, involuntary and uncoordinated muscle contractions (spasticity), and blindness occur. Some boys with adrenoleukodystrophy are totally disabled or die 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. Often, adults with adrenomyeloneuropathy first notice a problem when their legs become weak and stiff, they lose control of their bladder or bowels (incontinence), and/or erectile dysfunction develops. The diagnosis of adrenoleukodystrophy or adrenomyeloneuropathy is confirmed by genetic testing. No cure for either disorder is known. Dietary supplements with glycerol trioleate and glycerol trierucate (known as Lorenzo’s oil) may help, but further study is needed. When the adrenal gland (but not the brain) is affected, treatment with adrenal hormones may be lifesaving. Many experts now recommend stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder.  called myelin. These layers form the myelin sheath.\n【14】 Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is more common among men. Usually, symptoms begin between the ages of 15 and 35. This disorder is inherited through the mother, and the defective genes seem to be located in mitochondria (structures in cells that provide energy for the cell). Vision may become blurred in one eye or in both eyes at the same time. But if vision in one eye is affected, vision in the other eye begins to be lost within weeks or months. The sharpness of vision (acuity) and color vision deteriorate over time. Some people also have heart problems or muscle symptoms (such as involuntary muscle contractions, muscle weakness, or muscle spasms), which may resemble symptoms of multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed.\n【15】 Doctors can often diagnose Leber hereditary optic neuropathy based on symptoms and results of a physical examination. Testing can identify some of the abnormal genes responsible for the disorders. Electrocardiography Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image. It uses no x-rays.\n【16】 There is no established treatment for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. However, some evidence suggests that the drugs idebenone and ubiquinone may improve sight in people with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, but they cannot reverse damage already done to the optic nerve. Gene therapy is being studied. It involves injecting the normal gene into the eye. Limiting consumption of alcohol and not using tobacco products may help. Alcohol and tobacco may affect the mitochondria, which is where the defective gene that causes Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is located.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:12:46"}

Duodenal gastrinomas, carcinoid tumors of the foregut, benign adrenal adenomas, and lipomas also occur. Clinical features most commonly include hyperparathyroidism and asymptomatic hypercalcemia. Genetic screening is used to detect carriers. Diagnosis is by hormonal and imaging tests. Tumors are surgically removed when possible.\n【1】 MEN 1 is caused by an inactivating mutation of the gene that encodes the nuclear protein menin; > 500 mutations of this gene have been identified. The exact function of menin is unknown, but it appears to have tumor suppressing effects. Some mutations are thought to be associated with a higher rate of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Overview of Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors Pancreatic endocrine tumors arise from islet and gastrin-producing cells and often produce many hormones.\n【2】 About 40% of MEN 1 cases involve tumors of all 3 affected glands: Parathyroids Pancreas Pituitary Almost any combination of the tumors and symptom complexes outlined below is possible. A patient with a MEN 1 gene mutation and one of the MEN 1 tumors is at risk of developing any of the other tumors later on. Age at onset ranges from 4 to 81 years, but peak incidence occurs in the 20s to 40s. Men and women are equally affected.\n【3】Symptoms and Signs of MEN 1 The clinical features depend on the glandular elements affected . Parathyroid Hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism Hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10.4 mg/dL (> 2.60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5.2 mg/dL (> 1.30 mmol/L).\n【4】 Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10.4 mg/dL (> 2.60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5.2 mg/dL (> 1.30 mmol/L).\n【5】 They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【6】 In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia, which is often asymmetric, is typical. Pancreas Pancreatic islet cell tumors (also known as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) occur in 30 to 90% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric and sometimes synthesize several hormones. Multiple adenomas or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs; such tumors may arise from the small bowel rather than the pancreas. About 30% of tumors are malignant and have local or distant metastases. Malignant islet cell tumors due to MEN 1 syndrome often have a more benign course than do sporadically occurring malignant islet cell tumors. The most common functional enteropancreatic tumor in MEN 1 is the gastrinoma A gastrinoma is a gastrin-producing tumor usually located in the pancreas or the duodenal wall.\n【7】 Up to 80% of patients with MEN 1 have either multiple peptic ulcers due to gastrin-stimulated increased gastric acid secretion or asymptomatic elevated gastrin levels. Insulinomas Insulinoma An insulinoma is a rare pancreatic beta-cell tumor that hypersecretes insulin. The main symptom is fasting hypoglycemia.\n【8】 The tumors are often small and multiple. Age of onset is often < 40. Nonfunctioning enteropancreatic tumors occur in about one third of MEN 1 patients. Most islet cell tumors, including nonfunctioning tumors, secrete pancreatic polypeptide. Although the clinical significance is unknown, pancreatic polypeptide may be helpful for screening. The size of the nonfunctioning tumor correlates with risk of metastasis and death. Less commonly, other functional enteropancreatic tumors can occur in MEN 1. A severe secretory diarrhea can develop and cause fluid and electrolyte depletion with non–beta-cell tumors. This complex, referred to as the watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria syndrome ,WDHA Vipoma A vipoma is a non-beta pancreatic islet cell tumor secreting vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), resulting in a syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome).\n【9】 Hypersecretion of glucagon, somatostatin, chromogranin, or calcitonin, ectopic secretion of ACTH or corticotropin-releasing hormone ,causing Cushing syndrome Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.\n【10】 From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea is lactation in any men or in women who are not breastfeeding. It is generally due to a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma.\n【11】 About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, causing Cushing disease Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.\n【12】 Most of the remainder are nonfunctional. Local tumor expansion may cause visual disturbance, headache, and hypopituitarism Generalized Hypopituitarism Generalized hypopituitarism refers to endocrine deficiency syndromes due to partial or complete loss of anterior lobe pituitary function.\n【13】 Other manifestations Carcinoid tumors Overview of Carcinoid Tumors Carcinoid tumors develop from neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract (90%), pancreas, pulmonary bronchi, and rarely the genitourinary tract.\n【14】 Thymic carcinoids are more common in affected males. Carcinoid syndrome may occur. Adrenal adenomas occur in 10 to 20% of patients and may be bilateral. Adenomatous hyperplasia of the thyroid occurs occasionally in MEN 1 patients. Hormone secretion is rarely altered as a result, and the significance of this abnormality is uncertain. Multiple subcutaneous and visceral lipomas, angiofibromas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and collagenomas may also occur. The relative risk of breast cancer Breast Cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.\n【15】Diagnosis of MEN 1 Genetic testing Clinical evaluation for other tumors of the triad Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), gastrin, and prolactin levels Tumor localization with MRI, CT, ultrasonography, or 18F-FDG PET/CT MEN 1 syndrome should be considered in patients with tumors of the parathyroids, pancreas, or pituitary, particularly those with a family history of endocrinopathy.\n【16】 They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【17】 It is generally due to a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma.\n【18】 A gastrin-secreting non–beta-cell tumor of the pancreas or duodenum is diagnosed by elevated basal plasma gastrin levels, an exaggerated gastrin response to infused calcium, and a paradoxical rise in gastrin level after infusion of secretin. An insulin-secreting beta-cell tumor of the pancreas is diagnosed by detecting fasting hypoglycemia with an elevated plasma insulin level. An elevated basal level of pancreatic polypeptide or gastrin or an exaggerated response of these hormones to a standard meal may be the earliest sign of pancreatic involvement. Ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) can help localize tumors. Because these tumors are often small and difficult to localize, other imaging tests (eg, helical [spiral] CT, angiography, MRI, endoscopic ultrasonography, intraoperative ultrasonography) may be necessary.\n【19】 Acromegaly Gigantism and Acromegaly Gigantism and acromegaly are syndromes of excessive secretion of growth hormone (hypersomatotropism) that are nearly always due to a pituitary adenoma.\n【20】 Screening When an index case is identified, 1st-degree relatives should be given the option of genetic screening.\n【21】 Preimplantation genetic diagnosis on embryos conceived via assisted reproductive techniques Assisted Reproductive Techniques Assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) involve manipulation of sperm and ova or embryos in vitro with the goal of producing a pregnancy.\n【22】 Some clinicians monitor gene carriers by doing pancreatic and pituitary imaging every 3 to 5 years, although such screening has not been shown to improve outcomes. Screening for breast cancer Screening Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.\n【23】Treatment of MEN 1 Surgical excision when possible Drug management of hormone excess Treatment of hyperparathyroidism is primarily surgical, with subtotal parathyroidectomy; however, the hyperparathyroidism frequently recurs. Octreotide and cinacalcet may help control recurrent or persistent postoperative hypercalcemia. Prolactinoma is usually managed with dopamine agonists; other pituitary tumors are treated surgically. Islet cell tumors are more difficult to manage because the lesions are often small and difficult to find, multiple lesions are common, and surgery often is not curative.\n【24】 The treatment of gastrin-secreting non–beta-cell tumors is complex. When possible, the tumor is located and removed, although it is unclear whether surgery decreases the likelihood of late metastatic disease. If localization is impossible, a proton pump inhibitor frequently provides long-term control of symptomatic peptic ulcer disease. If a single tumor cannot be found in patients with insulinomas, distal subtotal pancreatectomy with enucleation of any palpable tumors in the head of the pancreas is recommended. Diazoxide or a somatostatin analogue (octreotide, lanreotide) may help treat hypoglycemia. Streptozocin and other cytotoxic drugs may relieve symptoms by reducing tumor burden. Somatostatin analogs also can block hormone secretion from other nongastrin-secreting pancreatic tumors and are well tolerated. Palliative treatments for metastatic pancreatic tumors include hepatic debulking surgery and hepatic artery chemoembolization. Streptozocin, doxorubicin, and other cytotoxic drugs may relieve symptoms by reducing tumor burden. Because MEN 1 tumors do not occur simultaneously, patients tend to have a high fear of disease occurrence for additional tumors in themselves or for disease beginning in their relatives.\n【25】Key Points Consider multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) in patients with tumors of the parathyroids, pancreas, and/or pituitary. The main clinical manifestations are those of hormone excess, particularly hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism. Patients should have genetic testing of the MEN 1 gene and clinical evaluation for other tumors of the syndrome. Tumors are excised when possible, but lesions are often multiple and/or difficult to find. Sometimes hormone excess can be managed by drugs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:36:08"}

High concentrations of protein cause frothy or sudsy urine.\n【1】 Red urine is not always due to RBCs. Red or reddish brown discoloration may result from the following: Hemoglobin or myoglobin in urine Porphyria Overview of Porphyrias are rare disorders in which there are defects in the pathway of heme synthesis due to genetic or acquired deficiencies of enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway.\n【2】 In females, normal or abnormal uterine bleeding may be misdiagnosed as hematuria. Etiology of Isolated Hematuria Most cases involve transient microscopic hematuria that is self-limited and idiopathic. Transient microscopic hematuria is particularly common in children, present in up to 5% of their urine samples. There are numerous specific causes .\n【3】 They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【4】 Cancer and prostate disease are a concern mainly in patients > 50, although younger patients with risk factors may develop cancer. Glomerular disorders can be a cause at all ages. Glomerular disorders Overview of Glomerular Disorders The hallmark of glomerular disorders is proteinuria, which is often in the nephrotic range (≥ 3 g/day).\n【5】 It occurs most often in children.\n【6】 Worldwide, IgA nephropathy Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is deposition of IgA immune complexes in glomeruli, manifesting as slowly progressive hematuria, proteinuria, and, often, renal insufficiency.\n【7】 Thin basement membrane disease and mild IgA nephropathy may cause isolated hematuria; however, most other glomerular causes of hematuria are accompanied by proteinuria. Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic fluke that causes significant disease in Africa (and, to a lesser extent, in India and parts of the Middle East), can invade the urinary tract, causing hematuria. Schistosomiasis is infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which are acquired transcutaneously by swimming or wading in contaminated freshwater.\n【8】 Mycobacterium tuberculosis may also infect the lower or upper urinary tract and cause hematuria, occasionally causing urethral strictures Urethral Stricture Urethral stricture is scarring that obstructs the anterior urethral lumen.\n【9】 Other causes of hematuria include Urinary tract instrumentation or procedure (eg, Foley catheterization, prostate or kidney biopsy, lithotripsy) Radiation cystitis Drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis Vascular etiology—which is rare (eg, renal infarction, renal vein embolism, renal arteriovenous malformation)  Evaluation of Isolated Hematuria History of present illness includes duration of hematuria and any previous episodes. Urinary obstructive symptoms (eg, incomplete emptying, nocturia, difficulty starting or stopping) and irritative symptoms (eg, irritation, urgency, frequency, dysuria) should be noted. Patients should be asked about the presence of pain and its location and severity and whether they have vigorously exercised.\n【10】 Presence of fever, night sweats, or weight loss should also be noted. Past medical history should include questions about any recent infections, particularly a sore throat that may indicate a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Conditions known to cause urinary tract bleeding ,particularly kidney calculi Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【11】 Also, conditions that predispose to a glomerular disorder, such as a connective tissue disorder ,particularly systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women.\n【12】 Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.\n【13】 Risk factors for genitourinary (GU) cancer should be identified, including smoking (the most significant), drugs (eg, cyclophosphamide, phenacetin), and exposure to industrial chemicals (eg, nitrates, nitrilotriacetate, nitrites, trichloroethylene). Family history should identify relatives with known polycystic kidney disease Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure.\n【14】 Patients should be asked about travel to areas where Schistosomiasis is infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which are acquired transcutaneously by swimming or wading in contaminated freshwater.\n【15】 Drug history should note use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (although controlled anticoagulation itself does not cause hematuria), and heavy analgesic use. Physical examination Vital signs should be reviewed for fever and hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.\n【16】 The heart should be auscultated for murmurs ,suggesting endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.\n【17】 The abdomen should be palpated for masses; flanks should be percussed for tenderness over the kidneys. In men, a digital rectal examination should be done to check for prostate enlargement, nodules, and tenderness. The face and extremities should be inspected for edema (suggesting a glomerular disorder), and the skin should be inspected for rashes ,suggesting vasculitis Overview of Vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels, often with ischemia, necrosis, and organ inflammation.\n【18】 It occurs most often in children.\n【19】 Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Gross hematuria and concurrent proteinuria Persistent microscopic hematuria, especially in older patients Age > 50 hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.\n【20】 Depending on results, imaging tests may then be needed. However, some clinical findings provide helpful clues . Blood clots in urine essentially rule out a glomerular disorder. Glomerular disorders are often accompanied by edema, hypertension, or both; symptoms may be preceded by an infection (particularly a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection in children). Calculi usually manifest with excruciating, colicky pain. Less severe, more continuous pain is more likely to result from infection, cancer, polycystic kidney disease Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure.\n【21】 Urinary irritative symptoms suggest bladder or prostate infection but may accompany certain cancers (mainly bladder and prostate). Urinary obstructive symptoms usually suggest prostate disease. An abdominal mass suggests polycystic kidney disease or renal cell carcinoma Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer. Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO).\n【22】 A family history of nephritis, sickle cell disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry.\n【23】 Travel to Africa, the Middle East, or India suggests the possibility of Schistosomiasis is infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which are acquired transcutaneously by swimming or wading in contaminated freshwater.\n【24】 Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss) may indicate cancer or subacute infection (eg, tuberculosis [TB]) or an autoimmune (connective tissue) disorder. On the other hand, some common findings (eg, prostate enlargement, excessive anticoagulation), although potential causes of hematuria, should not be assumed to be the cause without further evaluation. Testing Before testing proceeds, true hematuria should be distinguished from red urine by urinalysis. In women with vaginal bleeding, the specimen should be obtained by straight catheterization to avoid contamination by a nonurinary source of blood. Red urine without red blood cells (RBCs) suggests myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria, porphyria Overview of Porphyrias are rare disorders in which there are defects in the pathway of heme synthesis due to genetic or acquired deficiencies of enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway.\n【25】 Generally, the presence of hematuria should be confirmed by testing a 2nd specimen. Presence of casts, protein, or dysmorphic RBCs (unusually shaped, with spicules, folding, and blebs) indicates a glomerular disorder Overview of Glomerular Disorders The hallmark of glomerular disorders is proteinuria, which is often in the nephrotic range (≥ 3 g/day).\n【26】 White blood cells or bacteria suggest an infectious etiology. However, because urinalysis shows predominantly RBCs in some patients with cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys.\n【27】 A positive culture result warrants treatment with antibiotics. If hematuria resolves after treatment and no other symptoms are present, no further evaluation is required for patients < 50, especially women. If patients < 35 (including children) have only microscopic hematuria and no urine findings suggesting a glomerular disorder, no clinical manifestations suggesting a cause, no risk factors for cancer, and an identified benign cause (eg, infection, mild trauma), they can be observed, with urinalysis repeated every 6 to 12 months. If a benign cause is not evident or hematuria is persistent, testing is indicated ,1 General reference Hematuria is red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, specifically > 3 RBCs per high-power field on urine sediment examination.\n【28】 Patients < 50 with gross hematuria or unexplained systemic symptoms require ultrasonography or CT of the abdomen and pelvis. If urine or clinical findings suggest a glomerular disorder, renal function is evaluated by measuring blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and electrolytes; doing a urinalysis; and periodically determining the urine protein/creatinine ratio. Further evaluation of a glomerular disorder may require serologic tests, kidney biopsy Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist).\n【29】 All patients ≥ 35 require cystoscopy is insertion of a rigid or flexible fiberoptic instrument into the bladder.\n【30】 Men ≥ 50 require discussion of testing for prostate-specific antigen Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is nonmalignant adenomatous overgrowth of the periurethral prostate gland.\n【31】 Treatment of Isolated Hematuria Treatment is directed at the cause. Key Points Red urine should be differentiated from true hematuria (red blood cells in urine). Urinalysis and urine sediment examination help differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular causes. Risk of serious disease increases with aging and with duration and degree of hematuria. Cystoscopy and imaging tests are usually needed for patients > 35 or for younger patients with systemic symptoms or risk factors for cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 01:41:23"}

Intraamniotic infection increases the risk of problems in the woman and in the fetus. Women usually have a fever and often have pelvic pain and a vaginal discharge. Usually, doctors can diagnose the infection by doing a physical examination, but sometimes amniotic fluid must be analyzed. Women are given antibiotics and drugs to lower body temperature, and delivery is scheduled as soon as possible. Pregnancy complications, such as intraamniotic infection, are problems that occur only during pregnancy. They may affect the woman, the fetus, or both and may occur at different times during the pregnancy. However, most pregnancy complications can be effectively treated. Risk factors for intraamniotic infection Intraamniotic infection typically develops because bacteria from the vagina enter the uterus and infect the tissues around the fetus. Normally, mucus in the cervix, the membranes around the fetus, and the placenta prevent bacteria from causing infection. However, certain conditions can make it easier for bacteria to breach these defenses. Intraamniotic infection is also more likely if The membranes around the fetus rupture too soon ,called premature rupture of the membranes Prelabor Rupture of the Membranes (PROM) Prelabor rupture of the membranes is the leaking of amniotic fluid from around the fetus at any time before labor starts. After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows.\n【1】 There is a long delay between rupture of the membranes and delivery of the baby. The longer the delay, the more likely intraamniotic infection is to develop. Labor starts early ,preterm labor Preterm Labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy is considered preterm. Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems. The diagnosis of preterm labor is usually obvious.\n【2】 The amniotic fluid contains meconium (the dark green stool that is produced by the fetus before birth and that is usually only expelled after birth). Bacteria that can cause infections are in the genital tract. Women may not know that these bacteria are present, particularly if they have not had routine prenatal care, when tests for these bacteria would have been done. Doctors or midwives do many pelvic examinations in women with ruptured membranes. Such examinations may introduce bacteria into the vagina and uterus. Labor lasts a long time.\n【3】 For this procedure, doctors monitor the fetus by inserting an electrode (a small round sensor attached to a wire) through the woman’s vagina and attached to the fetus’s scalp. Complications of intraamniotic infection Intraamniotic infection can increase the risk of the following problems in the fetus or newborn: Preterm delivery or preterm premature rupture of the membranes (rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks of pregnancy) Too little oxygen in the blood around the time of delivery Infections, such as a bodywide infection ,sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body.\n【4】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.\n【5】 Intraamniotic infection can increase the risk of the following problems in the woman: A bloodstream infection Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body.\n【6】 In the United States, up to 30% of deliveries are cesarean.\n【7】 An embolus is a blood clot that travels through the bloodstream and blocks an artery.\n【8】 Symptoms of Intraamniotic Infection Intraamniotic infection usually causes fever and often causes abdominal pain and a discharge that can be foul-smelling. The heart rate of the fetus and the woman may be rapid. However, some women do not have typical symptoms. Diagnosis of Intraamniotic Infection A doctor's evaluation A complete blood count Sometimes amniocentesis Doctors do a physical examination and a complete blood count (which includes a white blood cell count). An intraamniotic infection is suspected when women have a fever and at least one other typical symptom, such as a fast heart rate in the fetus or a foul-smelling discharge or an abnormally high white blood cell count in the woman.\n【9】 If preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes occurs, doctors consider the possibility of infection even if women do not have typical symptoms. Prevention of Intraamniotic Infection If women have preterm premature rupture of the membranes, doctors do pelvic examinations only if necessary. Doctors usually also give these women antibiotics intravenously and by mouth to help the pregnancy last longer and reduce the risk of problems in the fetus. Treatment of Intraamniotic Infection Antibiotics Drugs to lower body temperature Delivery Women with an intraamniotic infection are given antibiotics intravenously. They are also given drugs (preferably acetaminophen before delivery) to lower body temperature. Delivery should not be delayed once the diagnosis is made. If labor has not started, labor may be artificially started ,induced Induction of Labor Induction of labor is the artificial starting of labor. Usually, labor is induced by giving the woman oxytocin, a drug that makes the uterus contract more frequently and more forcefully.\n【10】 Immediate cesarean delivery Cesarean Delivery Cesarean delivery is surgical delivery of a baby by incision through a woman’s abdomen and uterus.

This discussion covers neck pain involving the posterior neck (not pain limited to the anterior neck) and low back pain, but it does not cover most major traumatic injuries ,eg, fractures Overview of Fractures A fracture is a break in a bone. Most fractures result from a single, significant force applied to normal bone.\n【1】 Subluxation is partial separation.\n【2】 Pathophysiology of Neck and Back Pain Depending on the cause, neck or back pain may be accompanied by neurologic symptoms. If a nerve root is affected, pain may radiate distally along the distribution of that root (radicular pain). Strength, sensation, and reflexes of the area innervated by that root may be impaired.\n【3】  If the spinal cord is affected, strength, sensation, and reflexes may be impaired at the affected spinal cord level and all levels below (called segmental neurologic deficits). If the cauda equina is affected, segmental deficits develop in the lumbosacral region, typically with disruption of bowel function ,constipation is difficult or infrequent passage of stool, hardness of stool, or a feeling of incomplete evacuation.\n【4】 Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is a bowel management program and perineal exercises, but sometimes colostomy is needed.\n【5】,urinary retention Urinary Retention Urinary retention is incomplete emptying of the bladder or cessation of urination.\n【6】 The disorder is greatly underrecognized and underreported.\n【7】 Any painful disorder of the spine may also cause reflex tightening (spasm) of paraspinal muscles. Etiology of Neck and Back Pain Most neck and back pain is caused by disorders of spinal structures. Muscle pain is a common symptom and is typically caused by irritation of the deeper muscles by the dorsal rami of the spinal nerve and in the more superficial muscles from a local reaction to the spine injury. Strains are very rare in the cervical and lumbar spine.\n【8】 Occasionally, pain is referred from extraspinal disorders Serious uncommon causes (particularly vascular, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary) or herpes zoster. Some uncommon causes—spinal and extraspinal—are serious. Most spinal disorders result from Mechanical problems Only a few involve nonmechanical problems, such as infection, inflammation, cancer, or fragility fractures due to Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.\n【9】 Common causes Most pain caused by mechanical spine disorders is caused by Disk pain Nerve root pain Arthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation).\n【10】 Disk herniation Cervical Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus.\n【11】 Anterior slippage (anterolisthesis) is more common than posterior slippage (retrolisthesis).\n【12】 Several anatomic abnormalities ,eg, disk bulging or degeneration Cervical Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus.\n【13】 However, the etiology of back pain, particularly if mechanical, is often multifactorial, with underlying disorders exacerbated by fatigue, physical deconditioning, muscle pain, poor posture, weakness of stabilizing muscles, decreased flexibility, and sometimes psychosocial stress or psychiatric abnormality. Thus, identifying a single cause is often difficult or impossible.\n【14】 Serious uncommon causes Serious causes may require timely treatment to prevent disability or death. Serious extraspinal disorders include the following: Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【15】 Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity.\n【16】,eg, cholecystitis Acute Cholecystitis Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usually because a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct.\n【17】 Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both clinically and histologically.\n【18】,eg, pleuritis Viral Pleuritis Viral pleuritis is a viral infection of the pleurae. Viral pleuritis is most commonly caused by infection with coxsackie B virus.\n【19】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【20】,eg, prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain.\n【21】 They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【22】 Spinal cord compression Spinal Cord Compression Various lesions can compress the spinal cord, causing segmental sensory, motor, reflex, and sphincter deficits. Diagnosis is by MRI. Treatment is directed at relieving compression.\n【23】 Diagnosis is by MRI or, if unavailable, myelography followed by CT.\n【24】 Nerve compression commonly occurs at the level of a disk herniation paracentrally or in the foramen, centrally or in the lateral recess with stenosis, or in the foramen of an exiting nerve. Other uncommon causes Neck or back pain can result from many other disorders, such as Paget disease of bone Paget Disease of Bone Paget disease of bone is a chronic disorder of the adult skeleton in which bone turnover is accelerated in localized areas. Normal matrix is replaced with softened and enlarged bone.\n【25】 The cause is usually unknown. Diagnosis is clinical.\n【26】 However, clinicians should determine the following if possible: Whether pain has a spinal or extraspinal cause Whether the cause is a serious disorder If serious causes have been ruled out, back pain is sometimes classified as follows: Nonspecific neck or low back pain Neck or low back pain with radicular symptoms Lumbar spinal stenosis with claudication (neurogenic) or cervical stenosis with myelopathy Neck or low back pain associated with another spinal cause History of present illness should include quality, onset, duration, severity, location, radiation, time course of pain, and alleviating and exacerbating factors such as rest, activity, changes in position, weight bearing, and time of day (eg, at night, when awakening). Accompanying symptoms to note include stiffness, numbness, paresthesias, weakness, urinary incontinence or retention Urinary Retention Urinary retention is incomplete emptying of the bladder or cessation of urination.\n【27】 Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is a bowel management program and perineal exercises, but sometimes colostomy is needed.\n【28】 Review of systems should note symptoms suggesting a cause, including fever, sweats, and chills (infection); weight loss and poor appetite (infection or cancer); worsening of neck pain during swallowing (esophageal disorders); anorexia, nausea, vomiting, melena or hematochezia, and change in bowel function or stool (gastrointestinal disorders); urinary symptoms and flank pain (urinary tract disorders), especially if intermittent, colicky, and recurrent ,nephrolithiasis Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【29】 Past medical history includes known neck or back disorders ,including Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.\n【30】 Physical examination Temperature and general appearance are noted. When possible, patients should be dressed in a gown and observed as they move into the examination room, walk, balance on one leg, and climb onto the table to assess gait and balance. The examination focuses on the spine and the neurologic examination. If no mechanical spinal source of pain is obvious, patients are checked for sources of localized or referred pain. How to Examine the Back VIDEO In the spinal examination, the back and neck are inspected for any visible deformity, area of erythema, or vesicular rash. The spine and paravertebral muscles are palpated for tenderness, and change in muscle tone. Gross range of motion is tested. In patients with neck pain, the shoulders are examined. In patients with low back pain, the hips are examined. How to Examine the Neck VIDEO The neurologic examination should assess function of the entire spinal cord.\n【31】 Reflex tests are among the most reliable physical tests for confirming normal spinal cord function. Corticospinal tract dysfunction is indicated by upgoing great toes with the plantar response and by the Hoffman sign, most often with hyperreflexia. To test for the Hoffman sign, clinicians tap the nail or flick the volar surface of the 3rd finger; if the distal phalanx of the thumb flexes, the test is positive, usually indicating corticospinal tract dysfunction caused by stenosis of the cervical cord or a brain lesion. Sensory findings are subjective and may be unreliable. The straight leg raise test helps confirm sciatica is pain along the sciatic nerve. It usually results from compression of lumbar nerve roots in the lower back.\n【32】 The patient is supine with both knees extended and the ankles dorsiflexed. The clinician slowly raises the affected leg, keeping the knee extended. If sciatica is present, 10 to 60° of elevation typically causes symptoms. Although the knee is often palpated from behind to assess for sciatica, it is probably not a valid test for this. For the crossed straight leg raise test, the unaffected leg is raised; the test is positive if sciatica occurs in the affected leg. A positive straight leg test is sensitive but not specific for herniated disk Cervical Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus.\n【33】 The seated straight leg raise test is done while patients are seated with the hip joint flexed at 90°; the lower leg is slowly raised until the knee is fully extended. If sciatica is present, the pain in the spine (and often the radicular symptoms) occurs as the leg is extended. The slump test is similar to the straight leg raise test in applying traction on spinal nerve roots but is done with the patient \"slumping\" (with the thoracic and lumbar spines flexed) and the neck flexed while the patient is seated. The slump test is more sensitive, but less specific, for disk herniation than the straight leg raise test. In the general examination, the lungs are auscultated. The abdomen is checked for tenderness, masses, and, particularly in patients > 55, a pulsatile mass ,which suggests abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【34】 With a fist, clinicians percuss the costovertebral angle for tenderness, suggesting pyelonephritis Chronic Pyelonephritis Chronic pyelonephritis is continuing pyogenic infection of the kidney that occurs almost exclusively in patients with major anatomic abnormalities.\n【35】 Rectal examination, including stool testing for occult blood and, in men, prostate examination, is done. Rectal tone and reflexes are assessed.\n【36】 Lower-extremity pulses are checked. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Abdominal aorta that is > 5 cm (particularly if tender) or lower-extremity pulse deficits Acute, tearing upper and midback pain Cancer, diagnosed or suspected Neurologic deficit Fever or chills Gastrointestinal findings such as localized abdominal tenderness, peritoneal signs, melena, or hematochezia Infection risk factors (eg, immunosuppression; IV drug use; recent surgery, penetrating trauma, or bacterial infection) Meningismus Severe nocturnal or disabling pain Unexplained weight loss Interpretation of findings Although serious extraspinal disorders ,eg, cancers, aortic aneurysms Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【37】 Red flag findings should heighten suspicion of a serious cause .  Other findings are also helpful. Worsening of pain with flexion is consistent with intervertebral disk disease; worsening with extension suggests spinal stenosis Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Lumbar spinal stenosis is narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal causing compression of the nerve rootlets and nerve roots in the cauda equina before their exit from the foramina.\n【38】 Tenderness over certain specific trigger points suggests muscle pain caused by a spinal disorder. Generalized tenderness and nonlocalized allodynia suggests a central pain disorder. Testing Usually, if duration of pain is short (< 4 to 6 weeks), no testing is required unless red flag findings are present, patients have had a serious injury (eg, vehicular crash, fall from a height, penetrating trauma), or evaluation suggests a specific nonmechanical cause ,eg, pyelonephritis Chronic Pyelonephritis Chronic pyelonephritis is continuing pyogenic infection of the kidney that occurs almost exclusively in patients with major anatomic abnormalities.\n【39】 Plain x-rays can identify most disk height loss, anterior spondylolisthesis, malalignment, osteoporotic (or fragility) fractures Fragility fractures Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.\n【40】 However, they do not identify abnormalities in soft tissue (the disks) or nerve tissue (as occurs in many serious disorders). Testing is guided by findings and suspected cause. Testing is also indicated in patients who have failed initial treatment or in those whose symptoms have changed. Testing for specific suspected causes includes the following: Neurologic deficits, particularly those consistent with nerve root compression Nerve Root Disorders Nerve root disorders result in segmental radicular deficits (eg, pain or paresthesias in a dermatomal distribution, weakness of muscles innervated by the root).\n【41】 Diagnosis is by MRI. Treatment is directed at relieving compression.\n【42】 The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【43】 Acute musculoskeletal pain (with or without radiculopathy) is treated with Analgesics Lumbar stabilization and exercise Heat and cold Activity modification and rest (up to 48 hours) as needed Reassurance In patients with acute nonspecific (nonradicular) neck or low back pain, treatment can be started without extensive evaluation to identify a specific etiology. Pearls & Pitfalls Treat patients with nonspecific, nonradicular back pain who have no red flag findings symptomatically, without first requiring testing. Analgesics Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the initial choice of analgesics. Rarely, opioids Opioid Analgesics Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain.\n【44】 Adequate analgesia is important immediately after acute injury to help limit the cycle of pain and spasm. Evidence of benefit for chronic use is weak or absent, so duration of opioid use should be limited. Cervical and lumbar stabilization and exercise When acute pain decreases enough that motion is possible, a cervical or lumbar stabilization program is begun under the supervision of a physical therapist. This program should be started as soon as practical and includes restoration of motion, exercises that strengthen paraspinal muscles, and instruction in work posture; the aim is to strengthen the supporting structures of the back and reduce the likelihood of the condition becoming chronic or recurrent. In low back pain, \"core\" (abdominal and low back) muscle strengthening is important and often begins with a progression from working on a table in a supine or prone position, to quadruped (on hands and knees), and finally to standing activities. Heat and cold Acute muscle spasms may also be relieved by cold or heat. Cold is usually preferred to heat during the first 2 days after an injury. Ice and cold packs should not be applied directly to the skin. They should be enclosed (eg, in plastic) and placed over a towel or cloth. The ice is removed after 20 min, then later reapplied for 20 minutes over a period of 60 to 90 minutes. This process can be repeated several times during the first 24 hours. Heat, using a heating pad, can be applied for the same periods of time. Because the skin on the back may be insensitive to heat, heating pads must be used cautiously to prevent burns. Patients are advised not to use a heating pad at bedtime to avoid prolonged exposure due to falling asleep with the pad still on their back. Diathermy may help reduce muscle spasm and pain after the acute stage. Corticosteroids In patients with severe radicular symptoms and lower back pain, some clinicians recommend a course of oral corticosteroids or early referral to a specialist for epidural injection therapy. Facet joint corticosteroid injection is sometimes used for nonradicular pain. However, evidence supporting the use of systemic and epidural corticosteroid use is controversial. If epidural corticosteroid injection is planned, clinicians should obtain an MRI before injection so that the pathology can be identified, localized, and optimally treated. Muscle relaxants Oral muscle relaxants (eg, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, metaxalone, benzodiazepines) are controversial. Benefits of these drugs should be weighed against their central nervous system (CNS) effects and other adverse effects, particularly in older patients, who may have more severe adverse effects.\n【45】 Rest and immobilization Although a brief initial period (eg, 1 to 2 days) of decreased activity is sometimes needed for comfort, prolonged bed rest, spinal traction, and corsets are not beneficial. Patients with cervical pain may benefit from a cervical collar and contour pillow until pain is relieved and they can participate in a stabilization program. Spinal manipulation Spinal manipulation may help relieve pain caused by muscle spasm or an acute neck or back injury; however, high-velocity manipulation may have risks for patients older than 55 (eg, vertebral artery injury with neck manipulation) and those with severe disk disorders, cervical arthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation).\n【46】 It is typically asymptomatic but may cause dysmenorrhea or, rarely, infertility.\n【47】 Reassurance Clinicians should reassure patients with acute nonspecific musculoskeletal back pain that the prognosis is good and that activity and exercise are safe even when they cause some discomfort. Clinicians should be thorough, kind, firm, and nonjudgmental. If depression persists for several months or secondary gain is suspected, psychologic evaluation should be considered. Geriatrics Essentials: Neck and Back Pain Low back pain affects 50% of adults > 60. Abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.\n【48】 Imaging of the spine may be appropriate for older patients (eg, to rule out cancer) even when the cause appears to be uncomplicated musculoskeletal back pain. Use of oral muscle relaxants (eg, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, metaxalone) and opioids is controversial; anticholinergic, central nervous system, and other adverse effects may outweigh potential benefits in older patients. Key Points Low back pain affects 50% of adults > 60. Most neck and back pain is caused by mechanical spinal disorders, usually nonspecific, self-limited musculoskeletal derangements. Back pain is often multifactorial, making identification of a specific etiology difficult. Most mechanical disorders are treated with analgesics, early mobilization, and exercises; prolonged bed rest and immobilization are avoided. In patients with acute nonradicular back pain, treatment can be started without extensive evaluation to identify a specific etiology. Although serious spinal or extraspinal disorders are unusual causes, red flag findings often indicate the need for testing. Evaluation of spinal cord function during physical examination includes tests of sacral nerve function (eg, rectal tone, anal wink reflex, bulbocavernosus reflex), knee and ankle jerk reflexes, and motor strength. Patients with segmental neurologic deficits suggesting spinal cord compression require MRI or CT myelography as soon as possible. Abdominal aortic aneurysm should be considered in any older patient with low back pain that is not clearly mechanical, even if no physical findings suggest this diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#5#5#,urinary retention前面的，", "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 02:30:21"}

Doctors may not need to treat hives if they go away on their own after a day or two and don't come back. If it's clear what caused the hives, your doctor will have you avoid that substance. To lessen your symptoms, your doctor may: Ask you to bathe in cool water, not scratch your skin, and wear loose clothes until the hives go away Give you certain medicines, such as antihistamine or corticosteroid pills to treat the itching, depending on how severe your symptoms are Ask you to stop taking your medicines, if possible, to see if that helps Antihistamine pills can make you sleepy, particularly if you're older. Be careful about using them if you have to drive or use power tools. On the other hand, antihistamines may help you sleep at night. How can I prevent hives?

Isolated trochanteric bursitis is now believed to occur rarely, and lateral hip pain is more often referred to as greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which most often originates from gluteal medius and minimus tendinopathy, sometimes with an associated bursitis. However, injection therapy (aimed at the point of maximal tenderness) is the same for both disorders. The deep bursae (trochanteric, subacromial, or anserine) lie between bone and overlying tendons. Bursitis of a deep bursa seldom manifests with visible swelling or erythema.\n【1】 Indications For injections of corticosteroid to treat inflammation Symptoms of nonseptic trochanteric bursitis and greater trochanteric pain syndrome are effectively treated with rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exercise therapy. However, when trochanteric bursitis persists despite conservative measures, bursal injection provides rapid relief. Bursal fluid analysis is needed to diagnose septic or crystal-induced bursitis. Contraindications Absolute contraindications Overlying cellulitis or skin ulcer, bacteremia, adjacent prosthetic joint Hypersensitivity to an injected substance For corticosteroid injection, suspected septic bursitis Relative contraindications Unrecognized tendon injury: Analgesia provided by a corticosteroid injection could delay accurate diagnosis. Poorly controlled diabetes: Any benefit of corticosteroids is weighed against risk of worsening glycemic control. Previous corticosteroid injection into same site: Many experts advise waiting 3 to 4 months between injections and not exceeding a lifetime total of 4 injections.\n【2】 Complications are uncommon and include Subcutaneous fat atrophy, skin atrophy and sinus tracts, and temporary skin depigmentation due to inadvertent subcutaneous corticosteroid injection Painful local reaction (sometimes called steroid flare) occurring within a few hours of depot corticosteroid injection and usually lasting ≤ 48 hours (probably an irritation due to crystals in the injection vehicle) Infection In diabetic patients, hyperglycemia that may persist for weeks after a depot corticosteroid injection Equipment Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol) Sterile drapes Sterile gauze, sterile gloves, sterile adhesive bandage Needle insertion site anesthesia (eg, topical freezing spray or injectable 1% lidocaine without epinephrine) For therapeutic injection, 10-mL syringe with about 3 to 10 mL 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, with injectable depot corticosteroid (eg, triamcinolone acetate, 40 mg) Hemostat 2-inch needle, 22 to 25 gauge Some 3-mL syringes Having an assistant is helpful. Additional Considerations For bursal injection therapy, local anesthetic and depot corticosteroid often are mixed in a single syringe (the anesthetic eliminates the pain of the corticosteroid). If the history or physical examination suggests the possibility of septic bursitis, withhold corticosteroid injection. Immediate analgesia after injection of local anesthetic helps confirm correct needle placement and that greater trochanteric pain syndrome is the source of pain. Relevant Anatomy Although tenderness at or near the greater trochanter is characteristic, the trochanteric bursae are usually not the source of the pain. Commonly affected trochanteric bursae are the subgluteus maximus bursa (multiloculated, lies between the greater trochanter and the gluteus maximus tendon) and the bursae between the greater trochanter and gluteus medius and minimus tendons. Pain elicited by palpation is used to determine the site of needle insertion. Positioning Place the patient lying laterally on the unaffected side, with affected leg slightly flexed and adducted to move the lateral muscles away from the greater trochanter. To avoid vasovagal episodes, avert the patient's head and orient your work area so that the patient does not see the needles. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Do the procedure using sterile technique. Prepare the site Mark the site of needle entry on the skin. Prepare the area with antiseptic solution. Apply sterile drapes. Spray freezing spray at the needle insertion site until it just blanches and/or place a skin wheal of local anesthetic (eg, ≤ 1 mL). Inject the bursa Wear sterile gloves. Insert the needle perpendicularly to the skin at the point of maximum tenderness, aiming toward the greater trochanter. Gently pull back on the plunger as you advance to rule out intravascular placement. When the tip of the needle touches the greater trochanter, retract the needle about 1 mm. Slowly inject all of the anesthetic/corticosteroid mixture and withdraw the needle. If the injection meets resistance, the needle tip may be within an overlying tendon. Stop injecting and advance or withdraw the needle until the injection does not meet resistance. Pain is immediately relieved after a properly placed injection of anesthetic. Apply an adhesive bandage or sterile dressing. Aftercare Prescribe limited hip activity (eg, stairs, prolonged walking), ice, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until pain subsides. Instruct the patient to return for reassessment to exclude infection if pain is continuously and progressively increasing after several hours or persists for > 48 hours. Relative immobilization helps minimize the spread of the corticosteroid into adjacent tissues and maximizes its therapeutic effect. Warnings and Common Errors To avoid damaging tendons, do not inject corticosteroid against resistance. Tips and Tricks Consider using a larger (20-gauge) needle to better avoid puncturing a tendon (a larger needle incurs more resistance when it meets a tendon than a smaller needle does).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 01:44:09"}

Flukes are parasitic flatworms that infect various parts of the body (eg, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver) depending on the species. Opisthorchiasis due to O. viverrini occurs mainly in northeast Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia; O. felineus occurs mainly in Europe and Asia, including the former Soviet Union. The life cycle of Opisthorchis requires both snails and fish. Dogs, cats, and other fish-eating mammals are also definitive hosts. After ingestion, metacercariae excyst and ascend through the ampulla of Vater into the biliary ducts, where they attach to the mucosa and mature.

Plain X-Rays Without Contrast Abdominal x-rays without radiopaque contrast agents may be done to check for positioning of ureteral stents or to monitor position and growth of kidney stones. However, for initial diagnosis of urolithiasis Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【1】 X-Rays With Use of Contrast Images taken after administration of water-soluble contrast agents highlight the kidneys and urinary collecting system. Nonionic iso-osmolal agents (eg, iohexol, iopamidol) are now widely used; they have fewer adverse effects than older hyperosmolal agents but still pose a risk of acute kidney injury ,contrast nephropathy Contrast nephropathy Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【2】 In urography, an x-ray is taken after IV, percutaneous antegrade or retrograde, or cystoscopic retrograde administration of a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【3】 Primary contraindications for all patients are iodine allergy and risk factors for contrast nephropathy. IV urography (IVU) IVU (sometimes called IVP, for intravenous pyelography) has been largely superseded by rapid multidimensional CT and MRI with or without a contrast agent. When IVU is done, abdominal compression may improve visualization of the renal pelvis and proximal ureters (with application) and distal ureters (after release). Additional x-rays at 12 and 24 hours after contrast administration may be indicated for detection of postrenal obstruction or hydronephrosis. Percutaneous antegrade urography For percutaneous antegrade urography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【4】 Occasionally, a ureterostomy or an ileal conduit can be used. Antegrade urography is used in the following circumstances: When retrograde urography is unsuccessful (eg, because of tumor obstruction at the bladder level) When large kidney calculi requiring percutaneous surgery must be evaluated When transitional cell carcinoma of the upper collecting system is suspected When patients cannot tolerate general anesthesia or the degree of sedation required for retrograde urography Complications relate to puncture and placement of the catheter in the genitourinary tract and include bleeding, infection, injury to the lungs or colon, hematuria Isolated Hematuria is red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, specifically > 3 RBCs per high-power field on urine sediment examination.\n【5】 Retrograde urography Retrograde urography uses cystoscopy and ureteral catheterization to introduce a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【6】 Sedation or general anesthesia is required. This technique can be used when CT and MRI with IV contrast agents are contraindicated ,eg, in chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【7】 It is also useful for detailed examination of the pelvicaliceal collecting system and ureters to check for injury, stricture, or fistula. Overdistention and backflow from a kidney into the venous system may distort calyces and obscure details. Risk of infection is higher than that with other types of urography. Acute ureteral edema and secondary stricture formation are rare complications. Cystourethrography For cystourethrography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【8】 This technique provides more details than other imaging studies for evaluation of the following: Vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.\n【9】 The disorder is greatly underrecognized and underreported.\n【10】 No patient preparation is necessary. Adverse effects include UTIs and urosepsis. Angiography Conventional catheter angiography has been largely replaced by noninvasive vascular imaging (eg, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning). Remaining indications include renal vein renin imaging and, among patients with renal artery stenosis, angioplasty and stent placement. Arteriography is also rarely used for evaluation and treatment of renal hemorrhage and before kidney-sparing surgery. Digital subtraction angiography is no longer used when rapid-sequence multidimensional CT or helical (spiral) CT is available. Ultrasonography can provide useful images of many genitourinary structures without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. Images are interpreted as they are acquired, so the technician can focus on concerning areas and obtain additional information if necessary. Its main disadvantages are the need for a skilled operator and the time required. A full bladder helps provide better images of certain structures but no other preparation is needed. Structures that can be imaged and common indications include the following: Kidneys: For hydronephrosis, stones Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【11】 Conventional or helical scanners are used for most purposes with or without IV contrast agents Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. Most contrast agents are iodine based.\n【12】 Use of contrast agents with either technique resembles IV urography (IVU) but provides additional detail. Previously, in trauma patients, there was concern that use of contrast would make it difficult to distinguish abdominal hemorrhage from urinary tract disruption, but with modern imaging techniques and protocols, this distinction can be made. Helical CT without a contrast agent is the study of choice for imaging of calculi; dual-energy scanners may provide additional information that can help determine stone composition. The main disadvantage of CT is that it exposes patients to a relatively large dose of ionizing radiation. CT angiography CT angiography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle disease.\n【13】 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Compared with CT, MRI is safer for patients at risk of contrast nephropathy Contrast Nephropathy Contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary.\n【14】 Magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated in patients with ferromagnetic metal (ie, containing iron) implants and magnetically activated or electronically controlled devices (eg, cardiac pacemakers). See also the MRI safety web site. Also, due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, MRI with gadolinium contrast is contraindicated in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min. Urologic application of MRI includes the evaluation of renal cysts and small renal masses. MRI is also helpful in imaging blood vessels ,eg, for renal artery stenosis Renal Artery Stenosis and Occlusion Renal artery stenosis is a decrease in blood flow through one or both of the main renal arteries or their branches.\n【15】 Multiparametric MRI is now the imaging study of choice for staging prostate cancer Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma. Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain.\n【16】 A multiparametric MRI examination includes paramagnetic contrast and consists of 3 separate imaging techniques (parameters): T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. A technique known as MRI fusion biopsy is sometimes used during a prostate biopsy Prostate biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist).\n【17】 An MRI of the prostate is obtained prior to ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, during which the MRI image is digitally combined (fused) with the ultrasound image to better identify lesions that need to be biopsied. Radionuclide Scanning Cortical tracers that bind to proximal tubular cells (eg, technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc DMSA]) are used to image the renal parenchyma. Excretory tracers that are rapidly filtered and excreted into urine (eg, iodine-125 iothalmate, 99mTc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA], 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 [MAG3]) are used to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and overall renal perfusion. Radionuclide scanning can be used to evaluate renal function. It also has the benefit of not requiring IV contrast and may be used safely in patients at risk for contrast nephropathy Contrast Nephropathy Contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary.\n【18】 Radionuclide scanning also provides more information than does IV urography or cross-sectional imaging about the following: Segmental renal emboli Renal parenchymal scarring due to vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.\n【19】 Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally.\n【20】 No patient preparation is necessary for radionuclide scanning, but patients should be asked about known allergies to the tracer. Newly available nuclear positron emission tomographic (PET) agents can detect metastatic prostate cancer. Routine FDG PET scans are not very useful for most cases of prostate cancer but can be useful for other genitourinary tumors such as kidney or testicular cancer. Newer PET imaging includes targeting PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) on the surface of prostate cancer cells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:39:29"}

Most are minimally displaced and angulated. Diagnosis is by plain x-ray or sometimes CT. Most of these fractures can be treated with a sling, a swathe, and early mobilization.\n【1】 Proximal humeral fractures are especially common among older patients. A few patients have axillary nerve damage (reducing sensation over the middle deltoid) or axillary artery damage. Contractures may develop after only a few days of immobilization, particularly in older patients. Key anatomic landmarks in the proximal humerus The surgical neck of the humerus is fractured. Etiology of Proximal Humeral Fractures Most of these fractures result from a fall on an outstretched arm; less often, a direct blow is involved. Classification Fractures are classified by the number of parts that result; a part is defined as a key anatomic structure that is displaced ( > 1 cm) or angulated (> 45°) in relation to its normal anatomic position. The 4 key anatomic structures of the proximal humerus are the Anatomic neck Surgical neck Greater tuberosity Lesser tuberosity For example, if no structures are displaced or angulated, the fracture has one part. If one structure is angulated or displaced, the fracture has 2 parts . Almost 80% of proximal humeral fractures have only one part; they are usually stable, held together by the joint capsule, rotator cuff, and/or periosteum. Fractures with ≥ 3 parts are uncommon. One- and 2-part fractures of the proximal humerus If no structures are displaced or angulated, the fracture has one part. If one structure is angulated or displaced, the fracture has 2 parts. Symptoms and Signs of Proximal Humeral Fractures The shoulder and upper arm are painful and swollen; patients have difficulty raising their arm. Diagnosis of Proximal Humeral Fractures Plain x-rays Sometimes CT X-rays should include at least A true anteroposterior internal rotation view A trans-scapular Y (oblique) view An axillary view to assess the glenohumeral joint CT is done if fractures are complex or poorly visualized on plain x-rays. Treatment of Proximal Humeral Fractures Usually a sling and early range-of-motion exercises Sometimes open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or prosthetic joint replacement One-part fractures rarely require reduction; most (almost 80%) are treated with immobilization in a sling, sometimes with a swathe , and early range-of-motion exercises, such as Codman exercises Codman exercises . These exercises are particularly useful for older adults. Because contractures are a risk, early mobilization is desirable, even if alignment is anatomically imperfect. Codman exercises The patient bends at the waist with the affected arm hanging down perpendicular to the floor. The arm and shoulder should be relaxed, and knees bent. Patients should Slowly swing their arm from side to side, from back to front, and in circles clockwise and counterclockwise Shift their weight from foot to foot in the same direction that their arm swings Gradually increase the arc as tolerated These exercises should cause only minimal pain. Patients should do each exercise 2 times per set and do several sets per day. Patients should gradually increase the duration of the exercises. Fractures with ≥ 2 parts are immobilized, and patients are referred to an orthopedic surgeon. These fractures may require ORIF or placement of a prosthetic joint (shoulder replacement). Key Points Classify proximal humeral fractures based on the number of key humeral structures (anatomic neck, surgical neck, greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity) that are displaced or angulated.

However, if the pediatrician cannot set aside time for the girl to speak privately about personal concerns or is reluctant to provide gynecologic care, another health care practitioner should be found for this care. The gynecologic visit is the time to ask the practitioner questions about reproductive and sexual function and anatomy, including safe sex practices, such as the use of condoms to minimize the risks of sexually transmitted infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 02:19:22"}

The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow.\n【1】 About 50% of nail dystrophies result from fungal infection. The remainder result from various causes, including trauma, congenital abnormalities, psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.\n【2】 Nonfungal dystrophies may require a tissue biopsy of the nail plate or nail matrix to make a diagnosis. Nail dystrophy may resolve with treatment of the cause, but, if not, manicurists may be able to mask nail changes with appropriate trimming and polishes.\n【3】 Congenital nail deformities In some congenital ectodermal dysplasias, patients have no nails (anonychia). In pachyonychia congenita, the nail beds are thickened, discolored, and transversely hypercurved (pincer nail deformity). Nail-patella syndrome Nail-Patella Syndrome Nail-patella syndrome is a rare inherited disorder of mesenchymal tissue characterized by abnormalities of bones, joints, fingernails and toenails, and kidneys. Diagnosis is clinical.\n【4】 Patients with Darier disease can have nails with red and white streaks and a distal V-shaped nick. Nail deformities and dystrophies associated with systemic problems In Plummer-Vinson syndrome Esophageal Web An esophageal web is a thin mucosal membrane that grows across the lumen of the upper esophagus and may cause dysphagia.\n【5】 Yellow nail syndrome is a rare condition characterized by slow-growing, thickened, hypercurved, yellow nails. This condition typically occurs in patients with lymphedema and/or chronic respiratory disorders. Chronic bronchial infections are present in about half of reported cases. Half-and-half nails (Lindsay nails) occur usually with renal failure Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【6】 Half-and-half nails occur in 20 to 50% of patients who have chronic kidney disease; however, this nail abnormality has been reported in various other chronic diseases including Crohn disease, cirrhosis, pellagra, and Kawasaki disease.\n【7】 Terry nails are characterized by whiteness of about 80% of the nail bed with a 0.5- to 3.0-mm brown-to-pink distal band. Terry nails are often associated with cirrhosis, chronic heart failure, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus.\n【8】 White nails occur with cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.\n【9】 Intensely white nails, also called Terry nails, can be present in patients with chronic liver or kidney failure, heart failure, or diabetes. Terry nails are a type of leukonychia; the abnormality is not in the nail itself but rather the nail bed, causing the nail the appear white. In Terry nails, nearly the entire nail is opaque white and the lunula is not visible. There is a thin zone of normal pink nail bed at the distal edge of the nail.\n【10】 Beau lines are horizontal grooves in the nail plate that occur when nail growth temporarily slows, which can occur after infection, trauma, systemic illness, or during cycles of chemotherapy. Onychomadesis similarly results from temporary growth arrest of the nail matrix and differs from Beau lines in that the full thickness of the nail is involved, causing a proximal separation of the nail plate from the nail bed. Onychomadesis most frequently occurs several months after hand-foot-and-mouth disease Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease (HFMD) Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a febrile disorder usually caused by coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, or other enteroviruses.\n【11】 Nails affected by Beau lines or onychomadesis regrow normally with time. Examples of Nail Deformities and Dystrophies Associated With Systemic Problems Koilonychia Characteristic spoon-shaped (concave) nail of a patient with iron-deficiency anemia. \n【12】 Each line corresponds to a cycle of treatment.\n【13】 Nail deformities associated with dermatologic conditions In psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.\n【14】 Nail psoriasis is independently associated with treatment-resistant psoriatic disease and is a risk factor for development of psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy and chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis of the skin or nails.\n【15】 Topical therapies can lead to modest improvement. Device-based therapies (eg, laser, light) need more study to judge their effectiveness.\n【16】 Over time, scarring and irreversible changes may occur, including nail atrophy, pterygium formation, and total nail loss. Lichen planus of the nail unit requires management early in the disease to prevent permanent disfigurement. Treatment options include topical, intralesional, and systemic corticosteroids. However, relapse may occur after therapy in some patients. Pterygium of the nail, which is caused by lichen planus, is characterized by scarring from the proximal nail outward in a V formation, which leads ultimately to nail loss. Alopecia areata Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is typically sudden patchy nonscarring hair loss in people with no obvious skin or systemic disorder.\n【17】 Pits are small and fine. Alopecia areata may also be associated with severe onychorrhexis (brittleness with nail breakage). Treatment options include intralesional and topical corticosteroids and topical sensitizers such as squaric acid dibutylester. Newer therapies including tofacitinib and apremilast have shown some promise.\n【18】 The underlying nail bed is hyperkeratotic.\n【19】 Pitting and onycholysis are visible on the hand (right), suggesting nail psoriasis as the diagnosis.\n【20】 Discoloration Cancer chemotherapy drugs (especially the taxanes) can cause melanonychia (nail plate pigmentation), which can be diffuse or may occur in transverse bands. Some drugs can cause characteristic changes in nail coloration: Quinacrine: Nails appear greenish yellow or white under ultraviolet light. Cyclophosphamide: The onychodermal bands (seal formed at the junction of the nail plate and distal nail bed at the free edge of the nail plate) become slate-gray or bluish. Arsenic: Nails may turn diffusely brown. Tetracyclines, ketoconazole, phenothiazines, sulfonamides, and phenindione: Nails may have brownish or blue discoloration. Gold therapy: Nails may be light or dark brown. Silver salts (argyria): Nails may be diffusely blue-gray. Tobacco smoking or nail polish can result in yellow or brownish discoloration of nails and fingertips. White transverse lines of the nails (Mees lines) may occur with chemotherapy, acute arsenic intoxication, malignant tumors, myocardial infarction, thallium and antimony intoxication, fluorosis, and even during etretinate therapy. These lines are not due to changes in the nail bed, but are a true leukonychia, and the nails can grow out normally if the insulting exposure has been removed. Mees lines also develop with trauma to the finger, although traumatic white lines usually do not span the entire nail. The fungus Trichophyton mentagrophytes causes a chalky white discoloration of the surface of the nail plate. Green-nail syndrome is caused by infection with Pseudomonas. It is generally a harmless infection, usually of 1 or 2 nails, and is noteworthy for its striking blue-green color.\n【21】 If the onycholysis or chronic paronychia is treated effectively, the Pseudomonas infection will resolve. Alternatively, topical gentamycin ointment can be effective in chronic cases. Patients should avoid irritants and excess moisture. Frequent clipping of the nail increases the response to treatment. Median nail dystrophy (median canaliform dystrophy) Median nail dystrophy is characterized by small cracks in the nail that extend laterally and look like the branches of an evergreen tree (eg, fir tree, such as a Christmas tree). The cracks and ridges are similar to those seen in habit-tic nail deformity (which is dystrophy of the central nail caused by repetitive trauma to the nail matrix resulting from rubbing or picking with another finger). The cause of median nail dystrophy is unknown in some cases, but trauma is thought to play a role. Frequent use of personal digital devices that subject the nails to repetitive striking has been implicated in several cases. Tacrolimus 0.1% at bedtime without occlusion has been successful when patients stop all activities that might lead to repetitive low-level trauma. Melanonychia striata Melanonychia striata are hyperpigmented bands that are longitudinal and extend from the proximal nail fold and cuticle to the free distal end of the nail plate. Pigmentation results from deposition of melanin by melanocytes in the nail matrix. Deposition of melanin is increased by melanocyte activation (increased production of melanin in the nail cells) or by melanocytic hyperplasia (increased production of melanocytes in the nail matrix). Melanocyte activation may be a normal physiologic variant in people with darker skin. This variant, often called ethnic melanonychia, requires no treatment. Other causes of melanocyte activation include trauma, pregnancy, Addison disease and other endocrine disorders, infections, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and the use of certain drugs, including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, zidovudine, and psoralens. Melanocytic hyperplasia can be caused by benign conditions, such as nail matrix melanocytic nevus or nail lentigo, or by malignant melanoma. Factors more often associated with malignant melanoma of the nail matrix include new onset after middle age, presence of pigmentation on the dominant thumb or hallux, rapid growth or darkening, bandwidth > 3 mm, associated nail plate dystrophy, or Hutchinson sign (extension of hyperpigmentation onto the proximal and/or lateral nail fold). Rapid biopsy and treatment are essential in cases of suspected melanoma Treatment Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion.\n【22】 Onycholysis is separation of the nail plate from the nail bed or complete nail plate loss. It can occur as a drug reaction in patients treated with tetracyclines (photo-onycholysis), doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cardiovascular drugs (particularly practolol and captopril), cloxacillin and cephaloridine (rarely), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, diflunisal, etretinate, indomethacin, isoniazid, griseofulvin, and isotretinoin. Simple (ie, not associated with another nail or skin disorder) onycholysis may also result from exposure to irritants, such as frequent exposure to water, citrus fruits, or chemicals. Irritant contact dermatitis Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) Contact dermatitis is inflammation of the skin caused by direct contact with irritants (irritant contact dermatitis) or allergens (allergic contact dermatitis).\n【23】 Colonization of the nail bed with Candida albicans may occur, but treating the underlying irritant exposure leads to resolution of the onycholysis, with or without treating the Candida. Partial onycholysis may also occur in patients with psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.\n【24】 Pincer nail deformity Pincer nail deformity is a transverse over-curvature of the nail plate. It is most often caused by onychomycosis is fungal infection of the nail plate, nail bed, or both. The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow.\n【25】 It has also been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women.\n【26】 Patients often have pain at the borders of the nail where the nail plate curves into the tips of the fingers or toes.\n【27】 Trachyonychia (rough, opaque nails) may occur with alopecia areata Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is typically sudden patchy nonscarring hair loss in people with no obvious skin or systemic disorder.\n【28】 It is most common among children. When present in all nails, trachyonychia is often called 20-nail dystrophy. When it occurs in children, it tends to resolve spontaneously. When it occurs in adults, treatment is aimed at the underlying disorder. Nail tumors Benign and malignant tumors can affect the nail unit, causing deformity. Benign tumors include myxoid cysts, pyogenic granulomas Pyogenic Granulomas Pyogenic granulomas are fleshy, moist or crusty, usually scarlet vascular nodules composed of proliferating capillaries in an edematous stroma.\n【29】 Malignant tumors include Bowen disease Bowen Disease Bowen disease is a superficial squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Diagnosis is by biopsy.\n【30】 Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion.\n【31】 When cancer is suspected, expeditious biopsy followed by referral to a surgeon is strongly advised.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:49:11"}

The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury.\n【1】 Measurement of compartment pressure is a hospital-based procedure that requires considerable technical skill; an orthopedic or general surgeon is typically consulted. Compartment pressures can be measured in the 3 compartments of the forearm (volar, dorsal, and mobile wad). The Stryker® system, a commercially available instrument, is used here. Know what equipment is available at your particular institution.\n【2】 Indications Suspected compartment syndrome Compartment syndrome is suggested by worsening pain of the involved compartment that is disproportionate to the apparent severity of the injury and exacerbated by passive stretching of compartment muscles. On palpation, the compartment may be swollen and tense. Contraindications Absolute contraindications None Relative contraindications Infection of skin or deeper tissues at the anticipated site of needle insertion: If possible, use an alternate, uninfected site. Bleeding diathesis, which may need to be corrected before compartment pressure measurement Complications Erroneously high or low pressure measurements that may be due to poorly placed or obstructed needles, faulty or inaccurately calibrated devices, patient agitation, or excess test saline injected into the compartment. These measurement errors can lead to incorrect treatment. Infection, bleeding, or tissue damage resulting from needle insertion may occur.\n【3】 Maintain a low threshold for measuring compartment pressure in at-risk patients because deep compartments may not have palpable tenseness or swelling, pain is nonspecific, and, in obtunded patients, symptoms and signs can be absent or nonspecific. Diagnosis must be made and treatment started before pallor or pulselessness develops. Relevant Anatomy The forearm has 3 compartments: Volar compartment: Includes the flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi radialis muscles and also the ulnar, superficial radial, and median nerves and the radial, ulnar, and anterior interosseus arteries Dorsal compartment: Includes the extensor pollicis longus, abductor pollicis longus, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and the extensor carpi ulnaris muscles and also the posterior interosseus nerve and posterior interosseus artery Mobile wad compartment: Includes the brachioradialis, the extensor carpi radialis brevis, and the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles The volar compartment is most commonly affected by compartment syndrome. Positioning Position the patient with the affected arm at heart level and so that the needle can enter the skin at an angle perpendicular to the compartment being measured. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Prepare the equipment Open the Stryker® system and remove the contents onto a sterile field. Place the needle firmly onto the tapered stem of the diaphragm chamber. Remove the cap on the pre-filled syringe and attach it to the stem on the opposite side. Open the cover of the monitor and place the chamber into the pressure monitor with the black surface down. Carefully push it until it is seated in place. Snap the cover of the monitor closed. Hold the needle at a 45° angle upward and depress the plunger to purge the system of air. Do not allow saline to trickle down the needle into the transducer well. Turn on the monitor and check for a numeric reading to appear in the display window. Calibrate the device: Hold the device at the intended angle of insertion. Press the \"zero\" button and ensure that, after a few seconds, the display reads “00.” The display must read “00” before continuing. For each additional measurement, the unit must be recalibrated to “00.” General steps for all compartments Do a pre-procedure neurovascular examination of the affected forearm. Prepare the skin overlying the area with an antiseptic cleanser such as chlorhexidine. Drape the area. Using a 25- to 27-gauge needle, place a wheal of local anesthetic over the needle entry site. Avoid injecting anesthetic into the deeper tissues of the muscle and fascia. Doing so may falsely elevate the compartment pressure measurement. Hold the assembled and calibrated pressure monitor perpendicular to the compartment being measured and insert the needle as gently as possible through the skin to a depth appropriate for the target compartment. Slowly inject 0.3 mL of saline into the compartment. Wait for the display window to show equilibrium has been reached and record the resultant pressure. For each additional measurement, recalibrate the unit to \"00\" and repeat the process. A measured pressure of more than about 30 mm Hg or within about 30 mm Hg of diastolic blood pressure supports the diagnosis of compartment syndrome and indicates consideration for immediate fasciotomy. Compartment syndrome is possible even if compartment pressure is not elevated; if suspected based on clinical findings, the diagnosis should be presumed and compartment pressures should be measured serially. Specific steps for the volar compartment Position the patient supine with the forearm supinated. Identify the palmaris longus tendon and its proximal course. Insert the needle just medial to the palmaris longus at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the forearm. Advance the needle perpendicularly and direct it toward the posterior border of the ulna to a depth of 1 to 2 cm. Confirm proper needle placement by observing a rise in pressure when you press with your finger over the volar compartment just proximal or distal to the needle insertion site and with extension of the fingers and wrist. Specific steps for the dorsal compartment Position the patient supine with the forearm pronated. Palpate the posterior aspect of the ulna at the level of the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the forearm. Insert the needle at this level, 1 to 2 cm lateral to the posterior aspect of the ulna. Advance the needle perpendicularly to a depth of 1 to 2 cm. Confirm proper needle placement by observing a rise in pressure when you press with your finger over the dorsal compartment just proximal or distal to the needle insertion site and with flexion of the wrist or fingers. Specific steps for the mobile wad compartment Position the patient supine with the arm supinated. Identify the most lateral portions of the forearm at the junction of its proximal and middle thirds. Insert the needle at this level and lateral to the radius. Advance the needle perpendicularly to a depth of 1 to 1.5 cm. Confirm proper needle placement by observing a rise in pressure when you press with your finger over the mobile wad just proximal or distal to the needle entry site and with ulnar deviation of the wrist.\n【4】 Aftercare Apply sterile dressings to all needle entry sites. Repeat the neurovascular examination of the arm. Warnings and Common Errors Compartment syndrome is a clinical, often difficult, diagnosis to make. Presence of distal pulses and capillary refill and even normal compartment pressures do not rule out compartment syndrome. Measure pressures for all possibly affected compartments in the involved extremity.

Breast cancer usually starts in the glands that produce milk (lobules) or the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the glands to the nipple. Among women, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths. Typically, the first symptom is a painless lump, usually noticed by the woman. Breast cancer screening recommendations vary and include periodic mammography, breast examination by a doctor, and breast self-examination. If a solid lump is detected, doctors use a hollow needle to remove a sample of tissue or make an incision and remove part or all of the lump and then examine the tissue under a microscope (biopsy). Breast cancer almost always requires surgery, sometimes with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, other drugs, or a combination. Outcome is hard to predict and depends partly on the characteristics and spread of the cancer.  or cancerous (malignant). Most are noncancerous and not life threatening. Often, they do not require treatment.\n【1】 The Breasts VIDEO Breast disorders Overview of Breast Disorders Breast disorders may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Often, they do not require treatment.\n【2】 Most are noncancerous and not life threatening. Often, they do not require treatment. In contrast, breast cancer can mean loss of a breast or of life. Thus, for many women, breast cancer is their worst fear. However, potential problems can often be detected early when women do both of the following: Are examined regularly by their doctor Have mammograms as recommended Women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel, and men should also be aware of changes in or around their nipples. If a woman notices a change, she may want to do a breast self-examination. Women should report any changes to a health care practitioner right away. Most medical organizations no longer recommend that people do monthly or weekly breast self-examinations Breast self-awareness Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【3】 Doing these examinations when there is no lump or other change does not help detect breast cancer early in women who get screening mammograms. Early detection of breast cancer can be essential to successful treatment. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and, of cancers, is the most common cause of death among Hispanic women and the second most common cause of death in women of other races (after lung cancer). In 2021 in the United States, the following occurred in women: Invasive breast cancer Extent of spread was diagnosed in about 281,550 women. Noninvasive (in situ) breast cancer Extent of spread was diagnosed in almost 49,290 women. Almost 43,600 women died of breast cancer. Breast cancers in men Breast cancer in men Breast disorders occur infrequently in men. Breast disorders include Breast enlargement Breast cancer Breast enlargement in males is called either gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia.\n【4】 In 2021, 2,650 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 530 deaths from it occurred in men in the United States. Many women fear breast cancer, partly because it is common. However, some of the fear about breast cancer is based on misunderstanding. For example, the statement, “One of every eight women will get breast cancer,” is misleading. That figure is an estimate of the risk of developing breast cancer during a woman's life. It means that theoretically, one of eight women will develop breast cancer during her life. However, a 40-year-old woman has only about a 1 in 70 chance of developing it during the next decade. But as she ages, her risk increases. \n【5】 Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Several factors affect the risk of developing breast cancer. Thus, for some women, the risk is much higher or lower than average. Most factors that increase risk, such as age and certain abnormal genes, cannot be modified. However, regular exercise, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood, may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Far more important than trying to modify risk factors is being vigilant about detecting breast cancer so that it can be diagnosed and treated early, when it is more likely to be cured. Early detection is more likely when women have mammograms Mammography Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【6】 Regular breast self-examinations Breast self-awareness Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【7】 Age Increasing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer. Most breast cancers occur in women older than 50. Risk is greatest after age 75. Previous history of breast cancer Having had breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer. After the diseased breast is removed, the risk of developing cancer in the remaining breast is about 0.5 to 1.0% each year. Family history of breast cancer Breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) increases a woman’s risk by 2 to 3 times, but breast cancer in more distant relatives (grandmother, aunt, or cousin) increases the risk only slightly. Breast cancer in two or more first-degree relatives increases a woman’s risk by 5 to 6 times. Breast cancer gene mutation Mutations in two separate genes for breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2) have been identified. Fewer than 1% of women have these gene mutations. About 5 to 10% of women with breast cancer have one of these gene mutations. If a woman has one of these mutations, her lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 50 to 85%. The risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 is about 72% with a BRCA1 mutation and about 69% with a BRCA2 mutation. However, if such a woman develops breast cancer, her chances of dying of breast cancer are not necessarily greater than those of any other woman with breast cancer. These mutations are most common among Ashkenazi Jews. Women likely to have one of these mutations are those who have at least two close, usually first-degree relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer. For this reason, routine screening for these mutations does not appear necessary, except in women who have such a family history. Having a BRCA mutation also increases the risk of ovarian cancer Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Peritoneal Cancer Ovarian cancer is cancer of the ovaries.\n【8】 During their life, women with BRCA1 gene mutations have about a 40% risk of developing ovarian cancer. For women with BRCA2 gene mutations, risk is about 15%. Men who have a BRCA gene mutation have a 1 to 2% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Women with one of these mutations need to be tested monitored more closely for breast cancer—for example, by more frequent testing or being screened with both mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Or they may need to try to prevent cancer from developing by taking tamoxifen or raloxifene Prevention (which is similar to tamoxifen) or sometimes by even having both breasts removed ,double mastectomy Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【9】 Certain benign changes in the breast Some changes in the breast seem to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer. They include Changes in the breast that required a biopsy to rule out cancer Conditions that change the structure, increase the number of cells, or cause lumps or other abnormalities in breast tissue, such as complex fibroadenoma Fibroadenomas of the Breast Fibroadenomas of the breast are small, smooth, solid, rounded noncancerous lumps composed of fibrous and glandular tissue.\n【10】 Having dense breasts means that women have more fibroglandular tissue (composed of fibrous connective tissue and glands) and less fatty tissue in the breast. For women with such changes, the risk of breast cancer is increased only slightly unless abnormal tissue structure is detected during a biopsy or they have a family history of breast cancer. Age at first menstrual period, first pregnancy, and menopause The earlier menstruation begins (especially before age 12), the higher the risk of developing breast cancer. The later the first pregnancy occurs and the later menopause occurs, the higher the risk. Never having had a baby increases the risk of developing breast cancer. However, women who have their first pregnancy after age 30 are at higher risk than those who never have a baby. These factors probably increase risk because they involve longer exposure to estrogen, which stimulates the growth of certain cancers. (Pregnancy, although it results in high estrogen levels, may reduce the risk of breast cancer.) Oral contraceptives or hormonal therapy Some studies show that women taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. Once the pills are stopped, this risk seems to go back to normal within about 10 years. After menopause, taking combination hormone therapy Hormone Therapy for Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【11】 Taking estrogen alone does not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. Diet and obesity Diet may contribute to the development or growth of breast cancers, but evidence about the effect of a particular diet (such as a high-fat diet) is lacking . Risk of developing breast cancer is somewhat higher for women who are obese after menopause. Fat cells produce estrogen, possibly contributing to the increased risk. However, there is no proof that a high-fat diet contributes to the development of breast cancer or that changing the diet can decrease risk. Some studies suggest that obese women who are still menstruating are less likely to develop breast cancer. Research about the link between obesity and cancer is ongoing . Lifestyle Smoking and regularly drinking alcoholic beverages may increase the risk of breast cancer. Experts recommend that women limit themselves to one alcoholic drink a day. One drink is about 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of more concentrated liquor, such as whiskey. Radiation exposure Radiation exposure (such as radiation therapy for cancer or significant exposure to x-rays) before age 30 increases risk. Types of Breast Cancer Breast cancer is usually classified by the following: The kind of tissue in which the cancer starts The extent of the cancer's spread The type of tumor receptors on the cancer cells Kind of tissue There are many different kinds of tissue in the breast. Cancer can develop in most of these tissues, including Milk ducts (called ductal carcinoma) Milk-producing glands, or lobules (called lobular carcinoma) Fatty or connection tissue (called sarcoma): This type is rare. Ductal carcinoma accounts for about 90% of all breast cancers. Paget disease of the nipple Paget Disease of the Nipple Paget disease of the nipple is a type of breast cancer that originates in milk ducts under the nipple but first appears on the skin.\n【12】 The first symptom is a crusty or scaly nipple sore or a discharge from the nipple. About half of the women who have this cancer also have a lump in the breast that can be felt. Women with Paget disease of the nipple may also have another breast cancer that is not felt but that can be seen using imaging tests—mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasonography—done to look for another cancer. Because this disease usually causes little discomfort, women may ignore it for a year or more before seeing a doctor. The prognosis depends on how invasive and how large the cancer is as well as whether it has spread to the lymph nodes. Phyllodes breast tumors are relatively rare, accounting for fewer than 1% of breast cancers. About 10 to 25% are cancerous. They originate in breast tissue around milk ducts and milk-producing glands. The tumor spreads to other parts of the body (metastasizes) in about 10 to 20% of women who have it. It recurs in the breast in about 20 to 35% of women who have had it. The prognosis is good unless the tumor has metastasized. Extent of spread Breast cancer can remain within the breast or spread anywhere in the body through the lymphatic vessels Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system.\n【13】 Cancer cells tend to move into the lymphatic vessels in the breast. Most lymphatic vessels in the breast drain into lymph nodes in the armpit (axillary lymph nodes). One function of lymph nodes is to filter out and destroy abnormal or foreign cells, such as cancer cells. If cancer cells get past these lymph nodes, the cancer can spread to other parts of the body. Breast cancer tends to spread (metastasize) to the bones, brain, lungs, liver, and skin but can spread to any area. Spread to the scalp is uncommon. Breast cancer can appear in these areas years or even decades after it is first diagnosed and treated. If the cancer has spread to one area, it probably has spread to other areas, even if it cannot be detected right away. Breast cancer can be classified as Carcinoma in situ Invasive cancer Carcinoma in situ means cancer in place. It is the earliest stage of breast cancer. Carcinoma in situ may be large and may even affect a substantial area of the breast, but it has not invaded the surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Ductal carcinoma in situ is confined to the milk ducts of the breast. It does not invade surrounding breast tissue, but it can spread along the ducts and gradually affect a substantial area of the breast. This type accounts for 85% of carcinoma in situ and at least half of breast cancers. It is detected most often by mammography. This type may become invasive. Lobular carcinoma in situ develops within the milk-producing glands of the breast (lobules). It often occurs in several areas of both breasts. Women with lobular carcinoma in situ have a 1 to 2% chance each year of developing invasive breast cancer in the affected or the other breast. Lobular carcinoma in situ accounts for 1 to 2% of breast cancers. Usually, lobular carcinoma in situ cannot be seen on a mammogram and is detected only by biopsy. There are two types of lobular carcinoma in situ: classic and pleomorphic. The classic type is not invasive, but having it increases the risk of developing invasive cancer in either breast. The pleomorphic type leads to invasive cancer and, when detected, is surgically removed. Invasive cancer can be classified as follows: Localized: The cancer is confined to the breast. Regional: The cancer has invaded tissues near the breasts, such as the chest wall or lymph nodes. Distant (metastatic): The cancer has spread from the breast to other parts of the body (metastasized). Invasive ductal carcinoma begins in the milk ducts but breaks through the wall of the ducts, invading the surrounding breast tissue. It can also spread to other parts of the body. It accounts for about 80% of invasive breast cancers. Invasive lobular carcinoma begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast but invades surrounding breast tissue and spreads to other parts of the body. It is more likely than other types of breast cancer to occur in both breasts. It accounts for most of the rest of invasive breast cancers. Rare types of invasive breast cancers include Medullary carcinoma Tubular carcinoma Metaplastic carcinoma Mucinous carcinoma Mucinous carcinoma tends to develop in older women and to be slow growing. Women with most of these rare types of breast cancer have a much better prognosis than women with other types of invasive breast cancer. However, the prognosis is significantly worse for women with metaplastic breast cancer than for those with other types of ductal breast cancer. Tumor receptors All cells, including breast cancer cells, have molecules on their surfaces called receptors. A receptor has a specific structure that allows only particular substances to fit into it and thus affect the cell’s activity. Whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors affects how quickly the cancer spreads and how it should be treated. Tumor receptors include the following: Estrogen and progesterone receptors: Some breast cancer cells have receptors for estrogen. The resulting cancer, described as estrogen receptor–positive, grows or spreads when stimulated by estrogen. This type of cancer is more common among postmenopausal women than among younger women. About two thirds of postmenopausal women with cancer have estrogen receptor–positive cancer. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for progesterone. The resulting cancer, described as progesterone receptor–positive, is stimulated by progesterone. Breast cancers with estrogen receptors and possibly those with progesterone receptors grow more slowly than those that do not have these receptors, and the prognosis is better. (Estrogen and progesterone Overview of the Female Reproductive System are female sex hormones.) HER2 (HER2/neu) receptors: Normal breast cells have HER2 receptors, which help them grow. (HER stands for human epithelial growth factor receptor, which is involved in multiplication, survival, and differentiation of cells.) In about 20% of breast cancers, cancer cells have too many HER2 receptors. Such cancers tend to be very fast growing. Other characteristics Sometimes cancer is also classified based on other characteristics. Inflammatory breast cancer is an example. The name refers to the symptoms of the cancer rather than the affected tissue. This type is fast growing, particularly aggressive, and often fatal. Cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels in the skin of the breast, causing the breast to appear inflamed: swollen, red, and warm. Usually, inflammatory breast cancer spreads to the lymph nodes in the armpit. The lymph nodes can be felt as hard lumps. However, often no lump may be felt in the breast itself because this cancer is dispersed throughout the breast. Inflammatory breast cancer accounts for about 1% of breast cancers. Symptoms of Breast Cancer At first, breast cancer causes no symptoms. Most commonly, the first symptom of breast cancer is a lump, which usually feels distinctly different from the surrounding breast tissue. In many breast cancer cases, women discover the lump themselves. Such a lump may be cancer if it is a firm, distinctive thickening that appears in one breast but not the other. Usually, scattered lumpy changes in the breast, especially the upper outer region, are not cancerous and indicate fibrocystic changes Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast Fibrocystic changes of the breast (formerly called fibrocystic breast disease) include breast pain, cysts, and lumpiness that are not due to cancer.\n【14】 In the early stages, the lump may move freely beneath the skin when it is pushed with the fingers. In more advanced stages, the lump usually adheres to the chest wall or the skin over it. In these cases, the lump cannot be moved at all or it cannot be moved separately from the skin over it. Sometimes women can determine whether they have a cancer that even slightly adheres to the chest wall or skin by lifting their arms over their head while standing in front of a mirror. If a breast contains cancer that adheres to the chest wall or skin, this maneuver may make the skin pucker or dimple or make one breast appear different from the other. In very advanced cancer, swollen bumps or festering sores may develop on the skin. Sometimes the skin over the lump is dimpled and leathery and looks like the skin of an orange (peau d’orange) except in color. The lump may be painful, but pain is an unreliable sign. Pain without a lump is rarely due to breast cancer. If the cancer has spread, lymph nodes Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system.\n【15】 The lymph nodes may be stuck together or adhere to the skin or chest wall. They are usually painless but may be slightly tender. Occasionally, the first symptom occurs only when the cancer spreads to another organ. For example, if it spreads to a bone, the bone may ache or become weak, resulting in a fracture. If the cancer spreads to a lung, women may cough or have difficulty breathing. In Paget disease of the nipple, the first symptom is a crusty or scaly nipple sore or a discharge from the nipple. These changes may appear harmless, so women may not think they need to see a health care practitioner. Many women who have this cancer also have a lump in the breast. In inflammatory breast cancer, the breast is warm, red, and swollen, as if infected (but it is not). The skin of the breast may become dimpled and leathery, like the skin of an orange, or may have ridges. The nipple may turn inward (invert). A discharge from the nipple is common. Often, no lump can be felt in the breast, but the entire breast is enlarged. Screening for Breast Cancer Because breast cancer rarely causes symptoms in its early stages and because early treatment is more likely to be successful, screening is important. Screening is the hunt for a disorder before any symptoms occur. Screening for breast cancer may include Yearly breast examination by a health care practitioner Mammography If women have an increased risk of breast cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Concerns about screening for breast cancer It can be challenging to keep up with the latest recommendations for breast cancer screening, such as when to start mammograms. Also, medical organizations may change their recommendations over time, or different organizations may have different recommendations. Some people think that more testing is better, but testing may also have disadvantages. For example, screening tests for breast cancer sometimes indicate a cancer is present when no cancer is present (called a false-positive result). When results of a breast screening test are positive, a breast biopsy Breast biopsy Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【16】 Having a false-positive result means having a biopsy that is not needed and being exposed to unnecessary anxiety, pain, and expense. Because of these potential issues, organizations recommend that some people do not need to have a screening test. These people include those who are younger or older than a certain age . Women should discuss current recommendations and their own risk and priorities with their health care practitioner and decide which type of screening, if any, is appropriate for them. Mammography is one of the best ways to detect breast cancer early. Mammography is designed to be sensitive enough to detect the possibility of cancer at an early stage, sometimes years before it can be felt. Because mammography is so sensitive, it may indicate cancer when none is present (a false-positive result). About 85 to 90% of abnormalities detected during screening (that is, in women with no symptoms or lumps) are not cancer. Typically, when the result is positive, more specific follow-up procedures, usually a breast biopsy, are scheduled to confirm the result. Mammography may miss up to 15% of breast cancers. It is less accurate in women with dense breast tissue. Thus, these women may require additional tests, such as breast ultrasonography, 3-dimensional mammography ,tomosynthesis Breast examination by a health care practitioner Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【17】 For mammography, x-rays are used to check for abnormal areas in the breast. A technician positions the woman’s breast on top of an x-ray plate. An adjustable plastic cover is lowered on top of the breast, firmly compressing the breast. Thus, the breast is flattened so that the maximum amount of tissue can be imaged and examined. X-rays are aimed downward through the breast, producing an image on the x-ray plate. Two x-rays are taken of each breast in this position. Then plates may be placed vertically on either side of the breast, and x-rays are aimed from the side. This position produces a side view of the breast. Mammography: Screening for Breast Cancer Breast tomosynthesis (3-dimensional mammography) may be used with mammography to produce a clear, highly focused 3-dimensional picture of the breast. This technique makes it somewhat easier to detect cancer, especially in women with dense breast tissue. However, this type of mammography exposes women to more radiation as traditional mammography. Recommendations for routine screening with mammography vary. Experts disagree about When it should start How often it should be done When (or if) it should be stopped Experts have different recommendations about when to start routine mammography Breast Cancer: When to Start Screening Mammography? . Screening mammography is recommended for all women starting at age 50, but some experts recommend starting at age 40 or 45. Some experts recommend starting at age 50 because screening mammography is more accurate in women 50 or older. The reason is that as women age, fatty tissue replaces fibroglandular tissue in the breast. Abnormalities next to fatty tissue are easier to detect with a mammogram. The benefit of screening is not as clear in women aged 40 to 49. Experts are also concerned about starting screening too soon or screening too often because exposure to radiation would be increased. Women with risk factors for breast cancer Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【18】 They should discuss the risks and benefits of screening mammograms with their doctor. Whenever it is started, mammography is then repeated every 1 or 2 years. Routine mammography may be stopped at age 75, depending on the woman's life expectancy and her wish for continued screening. Only about 10 to 15% of the abnormalities detected during routine screening with mammography turn out to be cancer. The dose of radiation used in mammography is very low and is considered safe. Mammography may cause some discomfort, but the discomfort lasts only a few seconds. Mammography should be scheduled at a time during the menstrual period when the breasts are less likely to be tender. Deodorants and powders should not be used on the day of the procedure because they can interfere with the image obtained. The entire procedure takes about 15 minutes. Breast Cancer: When to Start Screening Mammography? Experts sometimes disagree about when regular screening with mammography should be started. Because screening identifies cancer and cancers can be fatal, people might think that screening should be started sooner (at age 40) rather than later (at age 50). However, screening has some disadvantages, and the benefits for younger women are not as clear as those for older women. The following are some reasons for the controversy: Screening, particularly in younger women, detects abnormalities that may not be cancers. Finding an abnormality often results in a biopsy to determine what it is. Thus, screening results in many more breast biopsies, sometimes causing women unnecessary anxiety and expense, as well as possibly resulting in scar tissue in the breast. Some breast cancers, such as in situ breast cancers (cancers that have not spread), are not fatal. Some breast cancers grow slowly and would not cause death in a woman's lifetime. However, other breast cancers continue to grow and invade other tissues. How many of the cancers detected by screening would eventually be fatal is unclear. Nonetheless, all cancers are treated because currently, health care practitioners do not have enough evidence to determine which ones should be treated and which ones should not be treated. Mammography is less accurate in younger women. Thus, screening may miss cancers, possibly including those that could be fatal. Mammography is more accurate in women over age 50 partly because, with aging, fibroglandular tissue (composed of fibrous connective tissue and glands) in the breasts tends to be replaced with fatty tissue. Many women must be screened to save one life. When women are older, fewer women need to be screened to save a life. For women 50 and over, screening saves lives and is recommended. Breast self-awareness Women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel, and men should also be aware of changes in or around their nipples. In the past, most doctors recommended that women examine their breasts for lumps each month. Breast examination by a health care practitioner A breast examination may be part of a routine physical examination. However, as with breast self-examination, a doctor's examination may miss a cancer. If women need or want screening, a more sensitive test, such as mammography, should be done, even if a doctor's examination did not detect any abnormalities. Many doctors and medical organizations no longer require an annual breast examination by a doctor. During the examination, a doctor inspects the breasts for irregularities, dimpling, tightened skin, lumps, and a discharge. The doctor feels (palpates) each breast with a flat hand and checks for enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit—the area most breast cancers invade first—and above the collarbone. Normal lymph nodes cannot be felt through the skin, so those that can be felt are considered enlarged. However, noncancerous conditions can also cause lymph nodes to enlarge. Lymph nodes that can be felt are checked to see if they are abnormal. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is usually used to screen women with a high risk of breast cancer, such as those with a BRCA mutation. For these women, screening should also include mammography and breast examination by a health care practitioner. MRI may be recommended for women with dense breast tissue as part of an overall assessment that includes evaluation of risk. Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Mammography Breast examination Biopsy Sometimes ultrasonography If changes in the breast (such nipple discharge or a lump) are detected during a physical examination, ultrasonography is usually done. If results are inconclusive, mammography is done. Mammography can also help identify tissue that should be removed and examined under a microscope (biopsied). If doctors suspect advanced cancer based on results of a physical examination, a biopsy is done first  is a thickening or bump that feels different from surrounding breast tissue. A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor. . Ultrasonography is sometimes used to help distinguish between a fluid-filled sac (cyst Breast Cysts Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop in the breast.  Breast cysts are common.\n【19】 This distinction is important because cysts are usually not cancerous. Cysts may be monitored (with no treatment) or drained (aspirated) with a small needle and syringe. The fluid from the cyst is examined to check for cancer cells only if any of the following occurs: The fluid is bloody or cloudy. Little fluid is obtained. The lump remains after it is drained. Otherwise, the woman is checked again in a few weeks. If the cyst can no longer be felt at this time, it is considered noncancerous. If it has reappeared, it is drained again, and the fluid is examined under a microscope. If the cyst reappears a third time or if it is still present after it was drained, a biopsy may be done. Rarely, when cancer is suspected, cysts are surgically removed. Breast biopsy All abnormalities that suggest cancer are biopsied. Doctors may do one of several types of biopsy: Core needle biopsy: A wide, hollow needle with a special tip is used to remove a sample of breast tissue. Open (surgical) biopsy: Doctors make a small cut in the skin and breast tissue and remove part or all of a lump. This type of biopsy is done when a needle biopsy is not possible. It may also be done after a needle biopsy that does not detect cancer to be sure that the needle biopsy did not miss a cancer. Imaging is often done during a biopsy to help doctors determine where to place the biopsy needle. Using imaging to guide the biopsy improves the accuracy of a core needle biopsy. For example, for a mass (whether felt or seen on a mammogram), ultrasonography is used during the core needle biopsy to accurately target the abnormal tissue. When imaging is used to guide placement of the needle, a clip to mark the spot is typically placed during the biopsy. When an abnormality is seen only on an MRI scan, MRI is used to guide the placement of the biopsy needle. A stereotactic core biopsy is useful when there are abnormal patterns of tiny calcium deposits (called microcalcifications) in the breast. This type of biopsy helps doctors accurately locate and remove a sample of the abnormal tissue. For a stereotactic biopsy, doctors take mammograms from two angles and send the two-dimensional images to a computer. The computer compares them and calculates the precise location of the abnormality in three dimensions. The breast tissue to be biopsied by stereotactic core biopsy is x-rayed to make sure doctors get a sample of the abnormal microcalcifications. Most women do not need to be hospitalized for these procedures. Usually, only a local anesthetic is needed. A pathologist examines the biopsy samples under the microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. Generally, a biopsy confirms cancer in only a few women with an abnormality detected during mammography. Evaluation after cancer diagnosis If cancer is diagnosed, women are seen by a cancer specialists (oncologists), which may include surgeons, medical oncologists (cancer drug treatment specialists), and radiation oncologists. These doctors determine which tests should be done and plan treatment. If cancer cells are detected, the biopsy sample is analyzed to determine the characteristics of the cancer cells, such as Whether the cancer cells have hormone (estrogen or progesterone) receptors How many HER2 receptors are present How quickly the cancer cells are dividing For some types of breast cancer, genetic testing of the cancer cells (multigene panels) This information helps doctors estimate how rapidly the cancer may spread and which treatments are more likely to be effective. After breast cancer is diagnosed, tests may include A chest x-ray to determine whether the cancer has spread Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), liver tests, and measurement of calcium, also to determine whether the cancer has spread In women with risk factors for inherited genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (such as BRCA genes) Breast cancer gene mutation Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【20】 Staging of Breast Cancer When cancer is diagnosed, a stage Staging Cancer is suspected based on a person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, and sometimes the results of screening tests.\n【21】 The stage is a number from 0 to IV (sometimes with substages indicated by letters) that reflects how extensive and aggressive the cancer is: Stage 0 is assigned to in situ breast cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ. In situ means cancer in place. That is, the cancer has not invaded surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Stages I through III are assigned to cancer that has spread to tissues within or near the breast (localized or regional breast cancer) Extent of spread . Stage IV is assigned to metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread from the breast and lymph nodes in the armpit to other parts of the body). Staging the cancer helps doctors determine the appropriate treatment and the prognosis. Many factors go into determining the stage of breast cancer, such as the following: How large the cancer is Whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes Whether it has spread (metastasized) to other organs, such as the lungs or brain Other important staging factors include the following: Grade Grading Cancer is suspected based on a person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, and sometimes the results of screening tests.\n【22】 If the cancer cells do not look very different from normal cells, the cancer is considered well-differentiated. If the cancer cells look very abnormal, they are considered undifferentiated or poorly differentiated. Well-differentiated cancers tend to grow and spread more slowly than undifferentiated or poorly differentiated cancers. Based on these and other differences in microscopic appearance, doctors assign a grade to most cancers. The presence of hormone receptors and gene mutations in the cancer cells affect how the cancer responds to different treatments and what the prognosis is. Prognosis for Breast Cancer Generally, a woman's prognosis depends on How large the cancer is What type of cancer it is Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other organs  Program.) The number and location of lymph nodes that contain cancer cells is one of the main factors that determine whether the cancer can be cured and, if not, how long women will live. The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer (the percentage of women who are alive 5 years after diagnosis) is 99% if the cancer remains at its original site (localized) 86% if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but no further (regional) 29% if the cancer has spread to distant sites (metastasized) 58% if a full evaluation has not been done and the cancer has not been staged Women with breast cancer tend to have a worse prognosis if they have any of the following: Diagnosis of breast cancer during their 20s and 30s Larger tumors Cancer that has rapidly dividing cells, such as tumors that do not have well-defined borders or cancer that is dispersed throughout the breast Tumors that do not have estrogen or progesterone receptors Tumors that have too many HER2 receptors A BRCA1 gene mutation In the United States, women who are Black and non-Hispanic have higher rates of death from breast cancer than women who are White and non-Hispanic. Having the BRCA2 gene mutation probably does not make the current cancer result in a worse outcome. However, having either BRCA gene mutation increases the risk of developing a second breast cancer. Prevention of Breast Cancer Taking drugs that decrease the risk of breast cancer (chemoprevention) may be recommended for the following women: Those who are over age 35 and have had a previous lobular carcinoma in situ or abnormal tissue structure (atypical hyperplasia) in the milk ducts or milk-producing glands Those who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 or another high-risk gene mutation Those who are between the ages of 35 and 59 and have a high risk of developing breast cancer based on their current age, age when menstruation began (menarche), age at the first birth of a child, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and results of prior breast biopsies Drugs that block estrogen receptors in breast tissue may be used to prevent breast cancer. They include Tamoxifen Raloxifene Women should ask their doctor about possible side effects before taking these drugs. Risks of tamoxifen include Cancer of the uterus Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause.\n【23】 Raloxifene appears to be about as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and to have a lower risk of endometrial cancer, blood clots, and cataracts. Both drugs may also increase bone density and thus benefit women who have osteoporosis. Treatment of Breast Cancer Surgery Usually radiation therapy Hormone-blocking drugs (endocrine therapy), chemotherapy, or both Treatment for breast cancer begins after the woman’s condition has been thoroughly evaluated. Treatment options depend on the stage and type of breast cancer and the receptors that the cancer has. However, treatment is complex because the different types of breast cancer differ greatly in characteristics such as growth rate, tendency to spread (metastasize), and response to various treatments. Also, much is still unknown about breast cancer. Consequently, doctors may have different opinions about the most appropriate treatment for a particular woman. The preferences of a woman and her doctor affect treatment decisions. Women with breast cancer should ask for a clear explanation of what is known about the cancer and what is still unknown, as well as a complete description of treatment options. Then, they can consider the advantages and disadvantages of the different treatments and accept or reject the options offered. Doctors may ask women with breast cancer to participate in research studies investigating a new treatment. New treatments aim to improve the chances of survival or quality of life. Women should ask their doctor to explain the risks and possible benefits of participation, so that they can make a well-informed decision. Treatment usually involves surgery and often includes radiation therapy and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. Sometimes a woman can choose whether surgery will involve removing part or all of one or both breasts. Women may be referred to a plastic or reconstruction surgeon, who can remove the cancer and reconstruct the breast in the same operation. Surgery The cancerous tumor and varying amounts of the surrounding tissue are removed. There are two main options for removing the tumor: Breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy Removal of the breast (mastectomy) For women with invasive cancer (stage I or higher), mastectomy is no more effective than breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy as long as the entire tumor can be removed during breast-conserving surgery. In breast-conserving surgery, doctors remove the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue to reduce the risk that tissue that may contain cancer is left behind. Before surgery, chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before removing it. This approach sometimes enables some women to have breast-conserving surgery rather than mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery Breast-conserving surgery leaves as much of the breast intact as possible. When considering the type of surgery, it is more important for doctors to be sure they remove the whole cancer than to risk leaving tissue that may contain cancer. For breast-conserving surgery, doctors first determine how big the tumor is and how much tissue around it (called margins) needs to be removed. The size of the margins is based on how big the tumor is in relation to the breast. Then the tumor with its margins is surgically removed. Tissue from the margins is examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells that have spread outside the tumor. These findings help doctors decide on whether further treatment is needed. Various terms (for example, lumpectomy, wide excision, quadrantectomy) are used to describe how much breast tissue is removed. Breast-conserving surgery is usually followed by radiation therapy Radiation Therapy for Cancer Radiation is a form of intense energy generated by a radioactive substance, such as cobalt, or by specialized equipment, such as an atomic particle (linear) accelerator.\n【24】 The main advantages of breast-conserving surgery are the possibility of preserving breast tissue and how the breast appears after surgery. When the tumor is large in relation to the breast, this type of surgery is less likely to be useful. In such cases, removing the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue means removing most of the breast. Breast-conserving surgery is usually more appropriate when tumors are small. In about 15% of women who have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of tissue removed is so small that little difference can be seen between the treated and untreated breasts. However, in most women, the treated breast shrinks somewhat and may change in contour. If either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy is an option, a woman should consider each option. Some women prefer breast-conserving surgery because they feel that losing a breast would be a very difficult emotional and physical experience and that breast-conserving surgery helps preserve body image. Other women prefer mastectomy because they feel more comfortable having all the breast tissue removed or because if they have a mastectomy, they may not need radiation therapy. Chemotherapy, given to shrink the tumor before removing it, may enable some women to have breast-conserving surgery rather than a mastectomy. mastectomy is the other main surgical option. There are several types. In all types, all breast tissue is removed, but which other tissues and how much of them are left in place or removed vary by type: Skin-sparing mastectomy leaves the muscle under the breast and enough skin to cover the wound. Reconstruction of the breast is much easier if these tissues are left. The lymph nodes in the armpit are not removed. Nipple-sparing mastectomy is the same as skin-sparing mastectomy plus it leaves the nipple and the area of pigmented skin around the nipple (areola). Simple mastectomy leaves the muscle under the breast (pectoral muscle) and the lymph nodes in the armpit. Modified radical mastectomy consists of removing some lymph nodes in the armpit but leaves the muscle under the breast. Radical mastectomy consists of removing the lymph nodes in the armpit and the muscle under the breast. This procedure is rarely done now unless the cancer has invaded the muscle under the breast. Lymph node assessment Doctors assess lymph nodes to determine whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit. If cancer is detected in these lymph nodes, it is more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. In such cases, different treatment may be needed. A network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes ,lymphatic system Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system.\n【25】 Lymph nodes trap foreign or abnormal cells (such as bacteria or cancer cells) that may be contained in this fluid. Thus, breast cancer cells often end up in lymph nodes near the breast, such as those in the armpit. Usually, foreign and abnormal cells are then destroyed. However, the cancer cells sometimes continue to grow in the lymph nodes or pass through the nodes into the lymphatic vessels and spread to other parts of the body. Doctors first feel the armpit to check for enlarged lymph nodes. Depending on what doctors find, they may do one or more of the following: Ultrasonography to check for lymph nodes that may be enlarged A biopsy (by removing a lymph node or taking a sample of tissue with a needle using ultrasonography to guide placement of the needle) Axillary lymph node dissection: Removal of many (typically 10 to 20) lymph nodes in the armpit Sentinel lymph node dissection: Removal of only the lymph node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely to spread to If doctors feel an enlarged lymph node in the armpit or are uncertain whether lymph nodes are enlarged, ultrasonography is done. If an enlarged lymph node is detected, a needle is inserted into it to remove a sample of tissue to be examined (fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy Testing ). Ultrasonography is used to guide placement of the needle. If the biopsy detects cancer, surgical removal of lymph nodes from the armpit (axillary lymph node dissection) may be needed. Removing many lymph nodes in the armpit, even if they contain cancer, does not help cure the cancer. However, it does help doctors decide what treatment to use. Axillary lymph nodes are evaluated again after chemotherapy is given before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy). If the biopsy after ultrasonography does not detect cancer, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is done because even if there are no cancer cells in a biopsy sample, cancer cells may be present in other parts of a lymph node. A sentinel lymph node biopsy is usually done as part of the operation to remove the cancer, such as lumpectomy or mastectomy. It enables doctors to identify and test the most important lymph node related to a breast cancer. If that lymph node is not cancerous, a woman does not need a more extensive surgery to remove all axillary lymph nodes. For a sentinel lymph node biopsy, doctors inject a blue dye and/or a radioactive substance into the breast. These substances map the pathway from the breast to the first lymph node (or nodes) in the armpit. Doctors then make a small incision in the armpit and look for a lymph node that looks blue and/or gives off a radioactive signal (detected by a handheld device). This lymph node is the one that cancer cells are most likely to have spread to. This node is called a sentinel lymph node because it is the first to warn that cancer has spread. Doctors remove this node and send it to a laboratory to be checked for cancer. More than one lymph node may look blue and/or give off a radioactive signal and thus be considered a sentinel lymph node. If the sentinel lymph nodes do not contain cancer cells, no other lymph nodes are removed. If the sentinel nodes contain cancer, axillary lymph node dissection may be done, depending on various factors, such as Whether a mastectomy is planned How many sentinel nodes are present and whether the cancer has spread outside the nodes Sometimes during surgery to remove the tumor, doctors discover that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and axillary lymph node dissection is required. Before the surgery is done, women may be asked whether they are willing to let the surgeon do more extensive surgery if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Otherwise, a second surgical procedure, if needed, is done later. Removal of lymph nodes often causes problems because it affects the drainage of fluids in tissues. As a result, fluids may accumulate, causing persistent swelling (lymphedema) of the arm or hand. After surgery, the risk of developing lymphedema continues throughout life. Arm and shoulder movement may be limited, requiring physical therapy. The more lymph nodes removed, the worse the lymphedema. Sentinel lymph node biopsy causes less lymphedema than axillary lymph node dissection. If lymphedema develops, it is treated by specially trained therapists. They teach women how to massage the area, which may help the accumulated fluid drain, and how to apply a bandage, which helps keep fluid from reaccumulating. The affected arm should be used as normally as possible, except that the unaffected arm should be used for heavy lifting. Women should exercise the affected arm daily as instructed and bandage it overnight indefinitely. If lymph nodes have been removed, women may be advised to ask health care practitioners not to insert catheters or needles in veins in the affected arm and not to measure blood pressure in that arm. These procedures makes lymphedema more likely to develop or worsen. Women are also advised to wear gloves whenever they are doing work that may scratch or injure the skin of the hand and arm on the side of the surgery. Avoiding injuries and infections can help reduce the risk of developing lymphedema. Other problems that may occur after lymph nodes are removed include temporary or persistent numbness, a persistent burning sensation, and infection. What Is a Sentinel Lymph Node? A network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes drain fluid from the tissue in the breast. The lymph nodes are designed to trap foreign or abnormal cells (such as bacteria or cancer cells) that may be contained in this fluid. Sometimes cancer cells pass through the nodes into the lymphatic vessels and spread to other parts of the body. Although fluid from breast tissue eventually drains to many lymph nodes, the fluid usually drains first through one or only a few nearby lymph nodes. Such lymph nodes are called sentinel lymph nodes because they are the first to warn that cancer has spread. Breast reconstruction surgery Breast reconstruction surgery may be done at the same time as a mastectomy or later. Women should consult with a plastic surgeon early during treatment to plan the breast reconstruction surgery. When reconstruction is done depends not only on the woman's preference but also on the other treatments needed. For example, if radiation therapy is done before reconstruction surgery, reconstruction options are limited. Oncoplastic breast surgery, which combines cancer (oncologic) surgery and plastic surgery, is one option. This type of surgery is designed to remove all cancer from the breast and preserve or restore the natural appearance of the breast. Most often, the surgery is done by Inserting an implant (made of silicone or saline) Reconstructing the breast using tissue taken from other parts of the woman’s body Surgeons often obtain tissue for breast reconstruction from a muscle in the lower abdomen. Alternatively, skin and fatty tissue (instead of muscle) from the lower abdomen can be used to reconstruct the breast. Breast Reconstruction VIDEO Before inserting an implant, doctors use a tissue expander, which resembles a balloon, to stretch the remaining chest skin and muscle to make room for the breast implant. The tissue expander is placed under the chest muscle during mastectomy. The expander has a small valve that health care practitioners can access by inserting a needle through the skin. Over the next several weeks, a salt solution (saline) is periodically injected through the valve to expand the expander a little at a time. After expansion is complete, the expander is surgically removed, and the implant is inserted. Alternatively, tissues taken from the woman's body (such as muscle and tissues under the skin) can be used for reconstruction. These tissues are taken from the abdomen, back, or buttock and moved to the chest area to create the shape of a breast. The nipple and surrounding skin are usually reconstructed in a separate operation done later. Various techniques can be used. They include using tissue from the woman's body and tattooing. Surgery may also be done to modify (augment, reduce, or lift) the other breast to make both breasts match. Rebuilding a Breast After a general surgeon removes a breast tumor and the surrounding breast tissue (mastectomy), a plastic surgeon may reconstruct the breast. A silicone or saline implant may be used. Or in a more complex operation, tissue may be taken from other parts of the woman’s body, such as the abdomen, buttock, or back. Reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy—a choice that involves being under anesthesia for a longer time—or later—a choice that involves being under anesthesia a second time. Reconstruction of the nipple and surrounding skin is done later, often in a doctor's office. A general anesthetic is not required. In many women, a reconstructed breast looks more natural than one that has been treated with radiation therapy, especially if the tumor was large. If a silicone or saline implant is used and enough skin was left to cover it, the sensation in the skin over the implant is relatively normal. However, neither type of implant feels like breast tissue to the touch. If skin from other parts of the body is used to cover the breast, much of the sensation is lost. However, tissue from other parts of the body feels more like breast tissue than does a silicone or saline implant. Silicone occasionally leaks out of its sack. As a result, an implant can become hard, cause discomfort, and appear less attractive. Also, silicone sometimes enters the bloodstream. Some women are concerned about whether the leaking silicone causes cancer in other parts of the body or rare diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). There is almost no evidence suggesting that silicone leakage has these serious effects, but because it might, the use of silicone implants has decreased, especially among women who have not had breast cancer. Removal of the Breast Without Cancer Certain women with breast cancer have a high risk of developing breast cancer in their other breast (the one without cancer). Doctors may suggest that these women have the other breast removed before cancer develops in it. This procedure is called contralateral (opposite side) prophylactic (preventive) mastectomy. This preventive surgery may be appropriate for women with any of the following: An inherited genetic mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer (such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) At least two close, usually first-degree relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer Radiation therapy directed at the chest when women were under 30 years old Lobular carcinoma in situ (a noninvasive type) In women with lobular carcinoma in situ in one breast, invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast. Thus, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for these women is to remove both breasts. Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option. Advantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include the following: Longer survival for women with breast cancer and a genetic mutation that increases risk and possibly for women who are under 50 years old when they are diagnosed with breast cancer Decreased need for cumbersome follow-up imaging tests after treatment For some women, decreased anxiety Disadvantages of this procedure include the following: Twice the risk of complications Instead of having a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, some women may choose to have their doctor monitor the breast closely for cancer—for example with imaging tests. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells at and near the site from which the tumor was removed, including nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy after mastectomy is done if the following are present: The tumor is 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) or larger. The cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes. In such cases, radiation therapy after mastectomy reduces the incidence of cancer recurring on the chest wall and in nearby lymph nodes, and it improves the chances of survival. Radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces the incidence of breast cancer recurring near the original tumor and in nearby lymph nodes, and it may improve overall survival. However, if women are over 70 have a lumpectomy and the cancer has estrogen receptors, radiation therapy may not be necessary because it does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence or improve the chances of survival in these women. Side effects of radiation therapy include swelling in the breast, reddening and blistering of the skin in the treated area, and fatigue. These effects usually disappear within several months up to about 12 months. Fewer than 5% of women treated with radiation therapy have rib fractures that cause minor discomfort. In about 1% of women, the lungs become mildly inflamed 6 to 18 months after radiation therapy is completed. Inflammation causes a dry cough and shortness of breath during physical activity that last for up to about 6 weeks. Lymphedema may develop after radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and Hormone-Blocking Drugs Chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs can suppress the growth of cancer cells throughout the body. To decide whether to treat with chemotherapy, doctors evaluate a few factors about a woman and her breast cancer and discuss the risks and benefits with her. Factors that doctors consider include Whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes Whether a woman is premenopausal or postmenopausal What the results of tests for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors are What the results of tests for the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) oncogene are Genetic testing of the cancer (such as the Oncotype DX test) For women with invasive breast cancer, chemotherapy and/or hormone-blocking drugs are usually begun soon after surgery. These drugs are continued for months or years. Some, such as tamoxifen, may be continued for 5 to 10 years. If tumors are larger than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches), chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs may be started before surgery. These drugs delay or prevent the recurrence of cancer in most women and prolong survival in some. Analyzing the genetic material of the cancer (predictive genomic testing) may help predict which cancers are susceptible to chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. If women have a breast cancer with estrogen and progesterone receptors but no HER2 receptors and the lymph nodes are not affected, they may not need chemotherapy. Hormone-blocking therapy alone may be sufficient. Chemotherapy is used to kill rapidly multiplying cells or slow their multiplication. Chemotherapy alone cannot cure breast cancer. It must be used with surgery or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy drugs are usually given intravenously in cycles. Sometimes they are given by mouth. Typically, a day of treatment is followed by 2 or more weeks of recovery. Using several chemotherapy drugs together is more effective than using a single drug. The choice of drugs depends partly on whether cancer cells are detected in nearby lymph nodes. Commonly used drugs include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, and paclitaxel . Side effects (such as vomiting, nausea, hair loss, and fatigue) vary depending on which drugs are used. Chemotherapy can cause infertility and early menopause by destroying the eggs in the ovaries. Chemotherapy may also suppress the production of blood cells by the bone marrow and thus cause anemia or bleeding or increase the risk of infections. So drugs, such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, may by used to stimulate the bone marrow to produce blood cells. Hormone-blocking drugs Hormone-blocking drugs interfere with the actions of estrogen or progesterone, which stimulate the growth of cancer cells that have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. Hormone-blocking drugs may be used when cancer cells have these receptors, sometimes instead of chemotherapy. The benefits of hormone-blocking drugs are greatest when cancer cells have both estrogen and progesterone receptors and are almost as great when only estrogen receptors are present. The benefit is minimal when only progesterone receptors are present. Hormone-blocking drugs include Tamoxifen: Tamoxifen, given by mouth, is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator. It binds with estrogen receptors and inhibits growth of breast tissue. In women who have estrogen receptor–positive cancer, tamoxifen, taken for 5 years, increases the likelihood of survival by about 25%, and 10 years of treatment may be even more effective. Tamoxifen, which is related to estrogen, has some of the benefits and risks of estrogen therapy Estrogens with or without a progestogen: Potential benefits and risks Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【26】 For example, it decreases the risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast. It may decrease the risk of osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【27】 However, it increases the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs. It also increases the risk of developing cancer of the uterus Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause.\n【28】 Thus, if women taking tamoxifen have spotting or bleeding from the vagina, they should see their doctor. However, the improvement in survival after breast cancer far outweighs the risk of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen, unlike estrogen therapy, may worsen the vaginal dryness or hot flashes that occur after menopause. Aromatase inhibitors: These drugs (anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole) inhibit aromatase (an enzyme that converts some hormones to estrogen) and thus reduce the production of estrogen. In postmenopausal women, these drugs may be more effective than tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibitors may be given instead of tamoxifen or after tamoxifen treatment has been completed. Aromatase inhibitors may increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Monoclonal antibodies Monoclonal antibodies are synthetic copies (or slightly modified versions) of natural substances that are part of the body’s immune system. These drugs enhance the immune system’s ability to fight cancer.\n【29】 For ductal carcinoma in situ, treatment usually consists of one the following: A mastectomy Removal of the tumor and a large amount of surrounding normal tissue (wide excision) with or without radiation therapy Some women with ductal carcinoma in situ are also given hormone-blocking drugs as part of their treatment. For lobular carcinoma in situ, treatment includes the following: Classic lobular carcinoma in situ: Surgical removal to check for cancer and, if no cancer is detected, close observation afterward and sometimes tamoxifen, raloxifene, or an aromatase inhibitor to reduce the risk of developing invasive cancer Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ: Surgery to remove the abnormal area and sometimes tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce the risk of developing invasive cancer Observation consists of a physical examination every 6 to 12 months for 5 years and once a year thereafter plus mammography once a year. Although invasive breast cancer may develop, the invasive cancers that develop are usually not fast growing and can usually be treated effectively. Furthermore, because invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for women with lobular carcinoma in situ is removal of both breasts ,bilateral mastectomy Diaphragms A contraceptive is something used for preventing pregnancy (birth control). Barrier contraceptives are a type of birth control that works by keeping sperm from getting to an egg.\n【30】 Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option. Women with lobular carcinoma in situ are often given tamoxifen, a hormone-blocking drug, for 5 years. It reduces but does not eliminate the risk of developing invasive cancer. Postmenopausal women may be given raloxifene or sometimes an aromatase inhibitor instead. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are a type of monoclonal antibody called anti-HER2 drugs. They are used with chemotherapy to treat metastatic breast cancer only when the cancer cells have too many HER2 receptors. These drugs bind with HER2 receptors and thus help prevent cancer cells from multiplying. Sometimes both of these drugs are used. Trastuzumab is usually taken for a year. Both drugs can weaken the heart muscle. So doctors monitor heart function during treatment. Treatment of Early-Stage Invasive Cancer (Stages I and II) For breast cancers that are within the breast and may or may not have spread to nearby lymph nodes, treatment almost always includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. One of the following may be done: Breast-conserving surgery, followed by radiation therapy Mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction The initial surgery may include axillary lymph node dissection Lymph node assessment Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.\n【31】 Women may be given chemotherapy before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy). If the tumor is attached to the chest wall, chemotherapy helps make removing the tumor possible. Chemotherapy is also helpful if a breast cancer is large in relation to the rest of the breast. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the chances of having breast-conserving surgery. Breast-conserving surgery is used only when the tumor is not too large because the entire tumor plus some of the surrounding normal tissue must be removed. If the tumor is large, removing the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue essentially results in removing most of the breast. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also considered for treatment of breast cancers that do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 (called triple negative breast cancer) and cancers that have only HER2 receptors. After surgery, women may be given chemotherapy, hormone-blocking drugs, anti-HER2 drugs, or a combination, depending on analysis of the tumor. Treatment of Locally Advanced Cancer (Stage III) For breast cancers that have spread to more lymph nodes, the following may be done: Before surgery, drugs, usually chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy if the drug given before surgery makes removing the tumor possible After surgery, usually radiation therapy After surgery, chemotherapy, hormone-blocking drugs, or both Whether radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy or other drugs are used after surgery depends on many factors, such as the following: How large the tumor is Whether menopause has occurred Whether the tumor has receptors for hormones How many lymph nodes contain cancer cells Treatment of Cancer That Has Spread (Stage IV) Breast cancer that has spread beyond the lymph nodes is rarely cured, but most women who have it live at least 2 years, and a few live 10 to 20 years. Treatment extends life only slightly but may relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. However, some treatments have troublesome side effects. Thus, deciding whether to be treated and, if so, which treatment to choose can be highly personal. Choice of therapy depends on the following: Whether the cancer has estrogen and progesterone receptors How long the cancer had been in remission before it spread How many organs and how many parts of the body the cancer has spread to (where the metastases are) Whether the woman is postmenopausal or still menstruating If the cancer is causing symptoms (pain or other discomfort), women are usually treated with chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs. Pain is usually treated with analgesics. Other drugs may be given to relieve other symptoms. Chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs are given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Hormone-blocking drugs are preferred to chemotherapy when the cancer has the following characteristics: The cancer is estrogen receptor–positive. Cancer has not recurred for more than 2 years after diagnosis and initial treatment. Cancer is not immediately life threatening. Different hormone-blocking drugs are used in different situations: Tamoxifen: For women who are still menstruating, tamoxifen is often the first hormone-blocking drug used. Aromatase inhibitors: For postmenopausal women who have estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) may be more effective as a first treatment than tamoxifen. Progestins: These drugs, such as medroxyprogesterone or megestrol, may be used after aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen when these drugs are no longer effective. Fulvestrant: This drug may be used when tamoxifen is no longer effective. It destroys the estrogen receptors in cancer cells. Alternatively, for women who are still menstruating, surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation to destroy them, or drugs to inhibit their activity (such as buserelin, goserelin, or leuprolide) may be used to stop estrogen production. These therapies may be used with tamoxifen. Trastuzumab (a type of monoclonal antibody called an anti-HER2 drug) can be used to treat cancers that have too many HER2 receptors and that have spread throughout the body. Trastuzumab can be used alone or with chemotherapy drugs (such as paclitaxel), with hormone-blocking drugs, or with pertuzumab (another anti-HER2 drug). Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy plus pertuzumab slows the growth of breast cancers that have too many HER2 receptors and increases survival time more than trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Trastuzumab can also be used with hormone-blocking drugs to treat women who have estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as lapatinib and neratinib), another type of anti-HER drug, block the activity of HER2. These drugs are being increasingly used in women with cancers that have too many HER2 receptors. In some situations, radiation therapy may be used instead of or before drugs. For example, if only one area of cancer is detected and that area is in a bone, radiation to that bone might be the only treatment used. Radiation therapy is usually the most effective treatment for cancer that has spread to bone, sometimes keeping it in check for years. It is also often the most effective treatment for cancer that has spread to the brain. Surgery may be done to remove single tumors in other parts of the body (such as the brain) because such surgery can relieve symptoms. Mastectomy (removing the breast) may be done to help relieve symptoms. But it is unclear whether removing the breast helps prolong life when cancer has spread to other parts of the body and has been treated and controlled. Bisphosphonates Drugs (used to treat osteoporosis), such as pamidronate or zoledronate, reduce bone pain and bone loss and may prevent or delay bone problems that can result when cancer spreads to bone.  Treatment of Specific Types of Breast Cancer For inflammatory breast cancer, treatment usually consists of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Mastectomy is usually done. For Paget disease of the nipple, treatment is usually similar to that of other types of breast cancer. It often involves simple mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus removal of the lymph nodes. Breast-conserving surgery is usually followed by radiation therapy. Less commonly, only the nipple with some surrounding normal tissue is removed. If another breast cancer is also present, treatment is based on that type of breast cancer. For phyllodes tumors, treatment usually consists of removing the tumor and a large amount of surrounding normal tissue (at least 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) around the tumor)—called a wide margin. If the tumor is large in relation to the breast, a simple mastectomy may be done to remove the tumor plus wide margins. Whether phyllodes tumors recur depends on how wide the tumor-free margins are and whether the phyllodes tumor is noncancerous or cancerous. Cancerous phyllodes tumors can metastasize to distant sites, such as the lungs, bone, or brain. Recommendations for treatment of metastatic phyllodes tumors are evolving, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be useful. Preservation of Fertility Women should not become pregnant while being treated for breast cancer. If women wish to have children (preserve fertility) after being treated, they are referred to a reproductive endocrinologist before treatment is started. These women can then find out about the effect of different chemotherapy drugs on fertility and about procedures that may enable them to have children after treatment. Options to preserve fertility include assisted reproductive techniques Assisted Reproductive Technologies Assisted reproductive technologies involve working with sperm and eggs or embryos in a laboratory (in vitro) with the goal of producing a pregnancy.\n【32】 Choice of the procedure to be used to preserve fertility depends on the following: Type of breast cancer Type of breast cancer treatment that is planned The woman's preferences Assisted reproductive techniques involve use of hormonal drugs. Doctors discuss the risks and benefits of having these treatments with women who have estrogen or progesterone receptor–positive cancer. Follow-up Care After the first phases of treatment are completed, follow-up physical examinations, including examination of the breasts, chest, neck, and armpits, are usually done every year. Regular mammograms and breast self-examinations are also important. Women should promptly report certain symptoms to their doctor: Any lumps or other changes in their breasts Changes in nipples or a discharge Pain—for example in the arm or spine Swelling in the armpit Loss of appetite or weight Chest pain Chronic dry cough Bleeding from the vagina (if not associated with menstrual periods) Severe headaches Blurred vision Dizziness or balance problems Numbness or weakness Any symptoms that seem unusual or that persist Diagnostic procedures, such as chest x-rays, blood tests, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT), are not needed unless symptoms suggest the cancer has recurred. The effects of treatment for breast cancer cause many changes in a woman’s life. Support from family members and friends can help, as can support groups. Counseling may be helpful. End-of-Life Issues For women with metastatic breast cancer, quality of life may deteriorate, and the chances that further treatment will prolong life may be small. Staying comfortable may eventually become more important than trying to prolong life. Cancer pain Many fatal illnesses cause similar symptoms, including pain, shortness of breath, digestive problems, incontinence, skin breakdown, and fatigue.\n【33】 So if women are having pain, they should ask their doctor for treatment to relieve it. Treatments can also relieve other troublesome symptoms, such as constipation, difficulty breathing, and nausea. Psychologic and spiritual counseling may also help. Women with metastatic breast cancer should prepare advance directives Advance Directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions.\n【34】 Also, making or updating a will is important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余标点#18#18#doctor. .

However, advances in surgical techniques have made the definition more complicated. Sometimes lasers, radiation, or other techniques (other than scalpels) are used to cut tissue, and wounds may be closed without stitches. In modern medical care, distinguishing between a surgical procedure and a medical procedure (usually thought of as a procedure that does not involve some cutting or stitching of tissue) is not always easy. However, making that distinction is not important as long as the doctor doing the procedure is well trained and experienced. Surgery is a broad area of care and involves many different techniques. In some surgical procedures, tissue, such as an abscess or tumor, is removed. In other procedures, blockages are opened. In still other procedures, arteries and veins are attached in new places to provide additional blood flow to areas that do not receive enough. In another surgical procedure called transplantation Overview of Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body.\n【1】 Grafts, sometimes made of artificial materials, may be implanted to replace blood vessels or connective tissue, and metal rods may be inserted into bone to stabilize or replace broken parts. A diagnosis is sometimes accomplished by doing surgery. A biopsy, in which a piece of tissue is removed for examination under a microscope, is the most common type of diagnostic surgery. In some emergencies, in which there is no time for diagnostic tests, surgery is used for both diagnosis and treatment. For example, surgery may be needed to quickly identify and repair organs that are bleeding from injuries caused by a gunshot wound or motor vehicle crash. The urgency of surgery is often described by three categories: Emergency Urgent Elective Emergency surgery, such as stopping rapid internal bleeding, is done as soon as possible because minutes can make a difference. Urgent surgery, such as removal of an inflamed appendix, is best done within hours. Elective surgery, such as replacement of a knee joint, can be delayed for some period of time until everything has been done to optimize a person's chances of doing well during and after the surgical procedure. Cosmetic surgery Cosmetic surgery is a type of elective surgery that is focused on enhancing appearance. Cosmetic surgery involves a wide variety of operations, for example Rhytidectomy: Removing wrinkles from the face and neck Abdominoplasty: Removing fat and excess skin from the abdominal area Mammoplasty: Enlarging or reducing breast size Hair replacement surgery: Restoring scalp hair Mandibuloplasty: Altering the appearance of the jaw Blepharoplasty: Altering the appearance of the eyes Rhinoplasty: Altering the appearance of the nose Liposuction: Removing body fat Sclerotherapy: Eliminating varicose veins A person should choose a doctor who has met a medical specialty’s standards for practice (board certification) and who has extensive experience doing the operation. Because obtaining the best results requires close adherence to instructions after the operation, cosmetic surgery is recommended only for highly motivated people. Popular and tempting as cosmetic surgery may be, it is expensive and it poses risks, including serious health risks as well as the possibility that appearance may be less pleasing to the person than it was originally. Anesthesia Because surgery is typically painful, it is almost always preceded by the administration of some type of anesthetic, analgesic, or both. Anesthetics block the perception of pain by causing loss of sensation (numbness) or unconsciousness, and analgesics are drugs given to reduce pain. Anesthetics are typically given by health care practitioners specially trained and certified in providing anesthesia. These practitioners may be doctors (anesthesiologists) or nurse practitioners (nurse anesthetists). Nurse anesthetists practice under the direction of an anesthesiologist. There are three types of anesthesia: Local Regional General Local anesthesia and regional anesthesia These types of anesthesia consist of injections of drugs (such as lidocaine or bupivacaine) that numb only specific parts of the body. In local anesthesia, the drug is injected under the skin of the site to be cut, numbing only that site. In regional anesthesia, which numbs a larger area of the body, the drug is injected around one or more nerves and numbs an area of the body supplied by those nerves. For example, injecting a drug around certain nerves can numb fingers, toes, or specific parts or all of limbs. One type of regional anesthesia involves injecting a drug into a vein (intravenous regional anesthesia). A device such as a woven elastic bandage or blood pressure cuff compresses the area where the limb joins the body, trapping the drug within the veins of that limb. Intravenous regional anesthesia can numb an entire limb. During local anesthesia and regional anesthesia, the person remains awake. However, doctors sometimes give mildly sedating antianxiety drugs intravenously to relax the person. Rarely, numbness, tingling, or pain can persist in the numbed area for days or even weeks after the surgical procedure. Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia are specific types of regional anesthesia in which a drug is injected around the spinal cord in the lower back. Depending on the site of the injection and position of the body, a large area (such as from the waist to the toes) can be numbed. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are useful for operations of the lower body, such as hernia repairs and prostate, rectal, bladder, leg, and some gynecologic operations. These types of anesthesia also can be useful for childbirth. Headaches occasionally develop in the days after spinal anesthesia but usually can be treated effectively. General anesthesia In general anesthesia, a drug that circulates throughout the bloodstream is given, making the person unconscious. The drug can be given intravenously or can be inhaled. Because a general anesthetic slows breathing, the anesthesiologist inserts a breathing tube in the windpipe. For short operations, however, such a tube may not be necessary. Instead, the anesthesiologist can support breathing by using a handheld breathing mask. If the operation is long, a ventilator breathes for the person , Home.\n【2】 General anesthetics affect vital organs, so the anesthesiologist closely monitors the heart rate, heart rhythm, breathing, body temperature, and blood pressure until the drugs wear off. Serious side effects are very rare. Serious side effects of general anesthesia are very rare. Major Surgery and Minor Surgery A distinction is sometimes made between major surgery and minor surgery, but many surgical procedures have characteristics of both. Major surgery Major surgery often involves opening one of the major body cavities (abdomen, chest, and skull). Opening the abdomen is called laparotomy, opening the chest is called thoracotomy, and opening the skull is called craniotomy. Major surgery can stress vital organs. The surgery usually is done using general anesthesia in a hospital operating room by a team of doctors. A stay of at least one night usually is needed after major surgery, but some major surgical procedures are now being done safely in an outpatient setting, whether that is a hospital or a stand-alone ambulatory surgery center. Doctors consider many factors in determining whether a major surgical procedure can be done on an outpatient basis, including the person’s overall health and risk of complications, the complexity of the surgery, and whether a hospital is nearby in case the person needs to be transferred. Minor surgery In minor surgery, major body cavities are not opened. Minor surgery can involve the use of local, regional, or general anesthesia and may be done in an emergency department, an ambulatory surgical center, or a doctor's office. Vital organs usually are not stressed, and surgery can be done by a single doctor, who may or may not be a surgeon. Usually, the person can return home the same day that minor surgery is done. Surgical Risk The risks of surgery, that is, how likely surgery is to cause death or a serious problem, depend on the type of surgery and characteristics of the person. Types of surgery that have the highest risk include Heart or lung surgery Liver surgery Abdominal surgeries that take a long time to complete or have an increased risk of major bleeding Prostate gland removal Major operations on the bones and joints (for example, hip replacement) Generally, the poorer the person's overall health, the higher the risks of surgery. Some particular health problems that increase surgical risk include History of and risk factors for coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【3】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【4】 Obesity is influenced by a combination of factors, which usually results in consuming more calories than the body needs.\n【5】 However, risks are determined more by general health than by age. Chronic disorders that increase surgical risk and other treatable disorders, such as dehydration, infections, imbalances in body fluids and electrolytes, and particularly heart failure and angina, should be controlled with treatment as well as possible before an operation. Second Opinion for Surgery The choice to undergo surgery is not always clear. There may be nonsurgical options for treatment, and there may be several possible surgical procedures.\n【6】 Some health insurance plans require a second opinion for elective surgery. However, experts may disagree on which doctor should give the second opinion. Some experts advise obtaining a second opinion from a doctor who is not a surgeon to eliminate any bias toward surgery when nonsurgical treatment is an option. Other experts advise that another surgeon give the second opinion, believing that a surgeon knows more about the advantages and disadvantages of surgery than would a doctor who is not a surgeon. Some experts recommend establishing up front that any surgeon giving a second opinion will not do the surgical procedure, so that there is no conflict of interest. Surgery Through a Keyhole Technical advances now make it possible to do surgery with smaller incisions and less tissue disruption than occurs with traditional surgery. To do this surgery, surgeons insert tiny lights, video cameras, and surgical instruments through keyhole-sized incisions. The surgeons can then do procedures using the images transmitted to video monitors as guides for manipulating the surgical instruments. In robotic surgery, the cameras provide surgeons with a three-dimensional view and surgeons control surgical instruments from a computer. Keyhole surgery has various names depending on where it is done: laparoscopy in the abdomen, arthroscopy in joints, and thoracoscopy in the chest. Because it causes less tissue damage than traditional surgery, keyhole surgery has several advantages, including the following: A briefer hospital stay (in most cases) Often, less pain after the operation Lower risk of infection at the operative site Earlier return to work A tendency toward smaller scars However, the difficulties of keyhole surgery are often underestimated by people undergoing the surgery and sometimes by surgeons. Because surgeons are using a video monitor, they are seeing only a two-dimensional view of the site on which they are operating. Also, the surgical instruments used have long handles and are controlled from outside of the person’s body, so the surgeon may find that using them feels less natural than using traditional surgical instruments. For these reasons, keyhole surgery has potential disadvantages: Keyhole surgery often takes longer than traditional surgery. More importantly, especially when a procedure is new, errors are more likely to occur than with traditional approaches because of the complexity of keyhole surgery. People also should know that although keyhole surgery may cause less pain than traditional surgery, pain still occurs, often more than anticipated. Because keyhole surgery is technically difficult, people should do the following: Choose a highly experienced surgeon. Establish that surgery is necessary. Ask the surgeon how pain will be treated. Preparing for the Day of Surgery Various preparations are made in the days and weeks before surgery. It is often recommended that physical conditioning and nutrition be improved as much as possible because good general health helps a person recover from the stress of surgery. Valuables should be left at home. Typically, people are told to not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before surgery. Alcohol and drug use Eliminating or minimizing alcohol use before undergoing surgery that involves general anesthesia can increase safety. Excessive alcohol consumption can damage the liver, causing heavy bleeding during surgery and unpredictably increasing or decreasing the effect of the drugs used for general anesthesia General anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities.\n【7】 Therefore, doctors may give sedatives (benzodiazepines) to alcoholics on the day of surgery. Doctors may give opioid analgesics Opioid Pain Relievers Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain. Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.\n【8】 Rarely, opioid addicts are given methadone, which also relieves severe pain, to prevent withdrawal before surgery. Tobacco use Smokers are advised to stop smoking as early as possible before any procedure involving the chest or abdomen. Recent tobacco use makes abnormal heart rhythms more likely to develop during general anesthesia and impairs lung function. People need to stop smoking several weeks before surgery so that the defense mechanisms of the respiratory system Defense Mechanisms of the Respiratory System The average person who is moderately active during the daytime breathes about 20,000 liters (more than 5,000 gallons) of air every 24 hours.\n【9】 Doctors' evaluations The surgeon does a physical examination and takes a medical history, which includes the following: Recent symptoms Past medical conditions Past reactions to anesthetics (if any) Use of tobacco and alcohol Infections Risk factors for blood clots Problems pertaining to the heart and lungs (such as cough or chest pain) Allergies The person is also asked to list all drugs currently being taken. Nonprescription as well as prescription drugs must be listed because serious health problems could result. For example, the use of aspirin, which a person may consider too trivial to mention, can increase bleeding during surgery. Additionally, the use of supplements or medicinal herbs ,for example, ginkgo is derived from the leaves of the ginkgo tree (commonly planted for ornamental purposes).\n【10】 John’s wort St. John’s Wort The reddish substance in the flowers of St. John’s wort contains numerous biologically active compounds, including hypericin and hyperforin.\n【11】 People may be told to stop taking some drugs, such as warfarin and aspirin, 5 to 7 days before surgery. People may be told to continue taking other drugs that control chronic disorders, such as drugs used to lower blood pressure. Most drugs that are taken by mouth can be swallowed with a small sip of water on the day of surgery. Other drugs may have to be given by vein or delayed until after surgery. The anesthesiologist may meet the person before the operation to review test results and identify any medical conditions that might affect the choice of anesthetic. The safest and most effective types of anesthesia may be discussed as well. The anesthesiologist also evaluates people who have a deviated septum or another airway abnormality before surgery that requires a breathing tube is done. Tests Depending on the person's overall health and the type of procedure, tests done before surgery (preoperative testing) may include blood and urine tests, an electrocardiogram Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded.\n【12】 These tests can help determine how well the vital organs are functioning. If organs are functioning poorly, the stress of surgery or anesthesia can cause problems. Preoperative tests occasionally also reveal a hidden, temporary illness, such as an infection, which requires that surgery be delayed. Blood storage for transfusion People may wish to store their own blood in case a blood transfusion is needed during surgery. Using stored blood ,autologous blood transfusion Autologous transfusion In addition to normal blood donation and transfusion, special procedures are sometimes used. In plateletpheresis, a donor gives only platelets rather than whole blood.\n【13】 A pint of blood at a time can be withdrawn from the person and preserved until surgery. Blood should be withdrawn no more often than once weekly, and the last withdrawal should probably be at least 2 weeks before surgery. The body replaces the missing blood during the weeks after the blood withdrawal. Decision making Sometime before the surgery, the surgeon obtains the person's permission to do the operation, a process called informed consent Informed Consent Before performing any invasive test or providing medical treatment, doctors must obtain permission from a competent patient in a manner that is informed and voluntary.\n【14】 The surgeon discusses risks and benefits of the operation, as well as alternative treatments, and answers questions. The person reads and signs a form documenting consent. In cases of emergency surgery in which the person is unable to provide informed consent, doctors try to contact the family. Rarely, emergency surgery must proceed before the family is contacted. A durable power of attorney for health care Health Care Power of Attorney Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions.\n【15】 Preparing the digestive tract Because some of the drugs given during surgery may cause vomiting, people should generally not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours beforehand. For outpatient surgery, people should not eat or drink anything after midnight. Specific guidelines should be given and vary depending on the kind of surgery. People should ask the doctor which of their regularly prescribed drugs should be taken before surgery. People undergoing surgery involving the intestines are given laxatives or enemas for a day or two before the operation. Fingernails Because the device that monitors the level of oxygen in the blood is attached to a finger, nail polish and artificial nails should be removed before going to the hospital. Then, this device can perform more accurately. The Day of Surgery Before most operations, a person removes all clothing, jewelry, hearing aids, false teeth, and contact lenses or eyeglasses and puts on a hospital gown. The person is taken to a designated room (called the holding area) or to the operating room itself for final preparations before surgery. The skin that will be cut (operative site) is scrubbed with an antiseptic, which minimizes the number of bacteria and helps to prevent infection. A health care practitioner may remove hair from the operative site with clippers or with hair-removing liquids or creams. Sometimes a plastic tube (catheter) is inserted into the bladder to collect urine during surgery. A catheter is inserted in one of the veins of the hand or arm. Fluids and drugs are given through the catheter. A drug may be given by vein (intravenously) for sedation. If an operation involves the mouth, intestinal tract, lungs or respiratory tract, or genitourinary tract, people are given one or more antibiotics within 1 hour before the operative site is cut to prevent infection (prophylaxis). Antibiotics are given by mouth or vein depending on the operation and are usually discontinued within 24 hours after surgery. This therapy also applies to people undergoing some other operations in which infections are particularly problematic (for example, joint or heart valve replacement). Diabetes On the day of surgery, people who use insulin to treat their diabetes are typically given one third of their usual insulin dose in the morning. People who take drugs by mouth to treat their diabetes are given half of their usual dose. If possible, surgery is done early in the day. The anesthesiologist monitors the blood sugar (glucose) level during surgery and gives additional insulin or glucose as needed. People do not resume their usual at-home insulin regimen until they resume their regular diet. Dentures Before a breathing tube is inserted in the windpipe, dentures must be removed. Ideally, before people are moved from the holding area, they should give their dentures to a family member. Corticosteroids People who have taken prednisone or another corticosteroid for more than 3 weeks within the past year before surgery may need corticosteroids during surgery. Corticosteroids are not given during minor surgical procedures. The Operating Room If the final preparations are done in the holding area, the person is then taken to the operating room. At this point, the person may still be awake, although groggy, or may already be asleep. The person is moved to the operating table, lit by specially designed surgical lights. Doctors, nurses, and other personnel who will be near or touching the operative site thoroughly scrub their hands with antiseptic soap, which minimizes the number of bacteria and viruses in the operating room. For surgery, they also wear scrub suits, caps, masks, shoe covers, sterile gowns, and sterile gloves. Before the surgery begins, a time out is held during which the surgical team confirms the following: The person’s identity The correct procedure and location and side of the operative site (if applicable) Availability of all needed equipment Verification that appropriate drugs to prevent problems such as infection or blood clots (if needed) were given Local anesthesia and regional anesthesia , regional Local anesthesia and regional anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities.\n【16】 In the Operating Room The operating room provides a sterile environment in which the operating team can do surgery. The operating team consists of the following: Chief surgeon: Directs the surgery One or more assistant surgeons: Help the chief surgeon Anesthesiologist: Controls the supply of anesthetic and monitors the person closely Scrub nurse: Passes instruments to the surgeons Circulating nurse: Provides extra equipment to the operating team The operating room typically contains a monitor that displays vital signs, an instrument table, and an operating lamp. Anesthetic gases are piped into the anesthetic machine. A catheter attached to a suction machine removes excess blood and other fluids, which can prevent surgeons from seeing the tissues clearly. Fluids given by vein, started before the person enters the operating room, are continued. After Surgery After the operation is completed, the person is taken to a recovery room to be closely watched for about 1 or 2 hours while the anesthesia wears off. The care team makes sure the person is able to breathe, is not at risk of choking, and has drugs to control pain. The care team also evaluates whether the person is able to think clearly. Most people feel groggy when awakening, particularly after major surgery. Some people are nauseated for a short while. Some people feel cold. Depending on the nature of the surgery and the type of anesthesia, a person may go home directly from the recovery room or be admitted to the hospital, sometimes in an intensive care unit Types of units People who need specific types of care may be put in special care units. Intensive care units (ICUs) are for people who are seriously ill.\n【17】 Direct discharge home A person being sent home must be Thinking clearly Breathing normally Able to drink fluids Able to urinate Able to walk Free of severe pain People who had anesthesia or who have been given sedatives and then discharged need to be accompanied home by someone else and are not permitted to drive themselves. The operative site should be free of bleeding and unexpected swelling. Hospitalization People who are admitted to the hospital after surgery may awaken to find many tubes and devices in and on them. For example, there may be a breathing tube in the throat, adhesive pads on the chest to monitor the heartbeat, a tube in the bladder, a device attached to a finger to measure the level of oxygen in the blood, a dressing on the operative site, a tube in the nose or mouth, and one or more tubes in the veins. Pain is expected after most operations and can almost always be relieved. Drugs that relieve pain (analgesics) can be given by vein (intravenously), by mouth, or by injection into the muscle or can be applied to the skin as a patch. If epidural anesthesia Local anesthesia and regional anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities.\n【18】 Opioid analgesics, such as morphine, can be injected through the tube. People staying in the hospital who have severe pain may be given a device that continuously injects an opioid analgesic into a vein, which also can deliver a small additional amount of analgesic when people press a button (called patient-controlled analgesia). If pain persists, additional treatment can be requested. Repeated use of opioid analgesics often causes constipation. To prevent constipation, doctors may give the person a stimulant laxative or stool softener. Good nutrition is critical for healing and minimizing the chance of infection. Nutritional needs increase after major surgery. If surgery makes eating impossible for more than a week, an alternative source of nutrition may be needed. People whose digestive tracts are functioning but who are otherwise unable to eat may be given nutrients through a tube placed into the stomach. Such a tube may be passed through the nose, mouth, or an incision in the abdominal wall. Rarely, people who have had surgery of the digestive tract and cannot eat for extended periods may be given nutrients through a catheter inserted in one of the body’s large veins ,parenteral nutrition Intravenous Feeding Intravenous feeding is used when the digestive tract cannot adequately absorb nutrients, as occurs in severe malabsorption disorders.\n【19】 Complications after surgery Complications such as fever, blood clots, wound problems, confusion, difficulty urinating or defecating, muscle loss, and a deterioration in fitness (called deconditioning) can develop during the days after surgery. Fever that develops during the days or weeks after surgery has several common causes, including the following: Infections at the operative site Lung problems such as pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.\n【20】 Another possible cause is inflammation in response to the trauma of an operation. The risk of infections at the operative site, DVTs, and UTIs can be decreased by meticulous care after surgery. The risk of pneumonia and atelectasis may be decreased by periodically breathing forcefully in and out of a handheld device (incentive spirometry) and coughing as needed. Blood clots in the legs or pelvic veins (DVTs) occasionally develop after surgery, particularly if people lie immobile during and after surgery or have had surgery on their leg, pelvis, or both.\n【21】 As a result, the oxygen supply to the rest of the body may be decreased, and sometimes blood pressure may fall. For operations that make blood clots particularly likely and for people who are likely to have to lie still without much movement, doctors give drugs that keep blood from clotting (anticoagulants), such as low-molecular-weight heparin, or put compression stockings on the person's legs to improve blood circulation. However, anticoagulants may not be recommended for operations in which these drugs may substantially increase bleeding. People should begin moving their limbs and walking as soon as it is safe for them to do so. Wound complications may include infection and separation of the wound edges (dehiscence). To decrease the risk of infection, doctors put a dressing on the surgical incision after surgery. The dressing placed in the operating room is typically left on for 24 to 48 hours unless signs of infection (such as increasing pain, swelling, and drainage) develop. The dressing includes a sterile bandage and usually includes an antibiotic ointment. The bandage keeps bacteria away from the incision and absorbs fluids that ooze from the incision. Because these fluids can encourage bacteria to grow and infect the incision, the dressing is changed often, usually twice daily. The wound and any drainage tubes, sutures, or skin staples are examined whenever the dressing is changed, sometimes more often. Occasionally, infection develops despite the best wound care. An infected site becomes increasingly painful 1 or more days after surgery and can become red and warm or drain pus or fluid. Fever can develop.\n【22】 Drugs with anticholinergic effects (such as confusion, blurred vision, and loss of bladder control— Home.see sidebar Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? ), opioids, sedatives, or histamine-2 (H2) blockers may contribute, as may too little oxygen in the blood. Drugs that can cause confusion should be avoided in older people when possible. Difficulty urinating and difficulty defecating (constipation) are common after surgery. Factors that contribute can include use of drugs with anticholinergic effects or opioids, bowel surgery, inactivity, and not eating or drinking. Urine flow may become completely blocked, stretching the bladder. Blockage can lead to urinary tract infections. Sometimes pressing on the lower abdomen while trying to urinate relieves the blockage, but often a catheter needs to be inserted into the bladder. The catheter may be left in place or may be removed as soon as the bladder is emptied. Frequently sitting up may help prevent blockage. People who do not have a bladder blockage may be given bethanechol by mouth to stimulate the bladder to contract. People who develop constipation are given smaller doses of opioids (pain relievers) and other drugs that cause constipation and begin walking as soon as possible. Unless their surgery involved the intestinal tract, people who develop constipation can also be given laxatives that stimulate the intestines, such as bisacodyl, senna, or cascara. Stool softeners such as docusate do not help. Loss of muscle (sarcopenia) and strength occur in all people who need bed rest for a long time. With complete bed rest, young adults lose about 1% of muscle per day, but older people lose up to 5% per day because they have lower levels of growth hormone, which is responsible for maintaining muscle tissue. Adequate amounts of muscle are important for recovery. Thus, people should sit up in bed, move, stand, and exercise as soon as and as much as is safe for them. People who are not receiving proper nutrition are at increased risk of sarcopenia. People are encouraged to eat and drink. If they are not able to eat and drink by themselves, tube feeding Tube Feeding Tube feeding may be used to feed people whose digestive tract is functioning normally but who cannot eat enough to meet their nutritional needs.\n【23】 A person should know what symptoms necessitate contacting the doctor before the scheduled follow-up visit. Resuming normal activity during recovery from surgery should occur gradually.\n【24】 For example, rehabilitation after hip replacement surgery can involve learning ways to walk, stretch, and exercise. Spotlight on Aging: Surgical Risk and Age In the mid-1900s, surgeons often hesitated to do even simple operations on people over age 50. Times have changed. Now, more than one third of all operations in the United States are done on people aged 65 or over. However, age does increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. For example, older people are much more likely than younger people to develop delirium is a sudden, fluctuating, and usually reversible disturbance of mental function.\n【25】 They are also more likely to have serious complications from bed rest, which may occur after surgery. These complications include Blood clots Loss of muscle Pneumonia Urinary tract infections The risk of death during or after surgery also increases with age. More than three quarters of deaths in the period immediately after surgery occur in older people. Further, when emergency surgery is done or when surgery involves the chest or abdomen, the risk of death increases in all age groups, but much more so for the older age group. Although age itself is a risk factor, overall health and the presence of certain disorders increase surgical risk Surgical Risk Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities.\n【26】 Having had a heart attack within 6 months of a surgical procedure greatly increases risk, as does poorly controlled heart failure.\n【27】 Lung problems, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders.\n【28】 Impaired kidney function, type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.\n【29】 Certain surgical procedures pose more risk than others. For example, surgery involving the abdomen or chest, removal of the prostate, and major surgery on a joint (such as hip replacement) rank high on the list of risky procedures. Many procedures that older people commonly undergo, such as cataract surgery and surgery on small joints, pose lower risk. If an older person is generally well, most operations, including ones considered to be higher risk, can be done safely. When the risks of surgery are high, they still may be outweighed by the potential benefits. For example, surgery that involves some risk of death, such as repair of a large aortic aneurysm, should be considered if the person is expected to live for another 8 to 10 years because such aneurysms increase the risk of death if they are not repaired. However, such surgery should probably be avoided if other illnesses limit life expectancy to only 1 to 2 years. When the risks of surgery are low, the low risk may be outweighed by a lack of benefit. For example, some people believe that the risk of even more minor procedures (for example, a skin graft of a pressure sore), which usually is very low, is still much too great to justify putting a person with advanced dementia through such an operation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#22#22#see sidebar Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean?

The narrowing squeezes (compresses) the nerves and sometimes the spinal cord causing neck pain and sometimes weakness and abnormal sensations in the arms or legs.

Treatment includes measures to relieve pain and sometimes surgery. The spinal canal runs through the center of the spine and contains the spinal cord Spinal Cord The spinal cord is a long, fragile tubelike structure that begins at the end of the brain stem and continues down almost to the bottom of the spine.\n【4】 The Spinal Cord VIDEO Along the length of the spinal cord are the spinal nerves. The spinal nerves emerge from the sides through spaces between the vertebrae to connect with nerves throughout the body. The part of the spinal nerve nearest the spinal cord is called the spinal nerve root. Because of their location, spinal nerve roots can be squeezed when the spinal canal is narrowed, resulting in pain. The most common causes of cervical spinal stenosis include Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function.\n【5】 Injuries or a degenerative condition can cause this disorder.\n【6】 Other causes include ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing Spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis is a spondyloarthritis characterized by inflammation of the spine (spondylitis), large joints, and fingers and toes, resulting in stiffness and pain.\n【7】 The Spine A column of bones called vertebrae make up the spine (spinal column). The vertebrae protect the spinal cord (a long, fragile structure contained in the spinal canal), which runs through the center of the spine. Between the vertebrae are disks composed of cartilage, which help cushion the spine and give it some flexibility. Spinal nerves: Emerging from the spinal cord between the vertebrae are 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Each nerve emerges in two short branches (roots)—motor and sensory—which join to form a spinal nerve. The motor roots carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body, particularly to skeletal muscles. The sensory roots carry information to the brain from other parts of the body. Cauda equina: The spinal cord ends about three fourths of the way down the spine, but a bundle of nerves extends beyond the cord. This bundle is called the cauda equina because it resembles a horse's tail. The cauda equina carries nerve impulses to and from the legs, lower intestine, and bladder. Symptoms of Cervical Spinal Stenosis Some people with cervical spinal stenosis do not have symptoms. Other people have neck pain Neck Pain Along with low back pain, neck pain is a very common reason for health care visits.\n【8】 Symptoms of spinal cord compression Fractures of the Spine In a compression fracture of the spine, the drum-shaped part (body) of one or more back bones (vertebrae) collapses into itself and becomes squashed (compressed) into a wedge shape.\n【9】 Diagnosis of Cervical Spinal Stenosis A doctor's evaluation Sometimes imaging tests, electrodiagnostic studies, or both Doctors typically make the diagnosis of cervical spinal stenosis based on the person's symptoms and physical examination. During a physical examination, doctors check a person's strength and reflexes. Doctors may do other tests if people have weakness or numbness or if their symptoms have lasted for more than 6 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.\n【10】 Tests of the nerves and muscles Nerve and muscle tests A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination.\n【11】 Treatment of Cervical Spinal Stenosis Measures to relieve pain Sometimes surgery for severe pain Measures to relieve pain Applying cold therapy (cryotherapy) Professional rehabilitation therapists treat pain and inflammation. Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.\n【12】 Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.\n【13】 Some people may be helped by corticosteroids taken by mouth. People should sleep on their back with a thin pillow under the neck to keep the cervical spine aligned. Physical therapy Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs.\n【14】 Physical therapy focuses on posture, motion, and strength of the muscles around the neck to relieve symptoms. Surgery When measures to relieve pain are not effective in people with cervical stenosis, surgery may be needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and spinal nerves. One surgical procedure is called a cervical laminectomy, in which a portion of the vertebrae called the lamina is removed, taking pressure off the spinal cord and spinal nerves. Laminectomy of the cervical spine is almost always includes attachment of adjacent vertebrae (fusion) to avoid a common consequence of abnormal curvature of the spine in the neck (cervical kyphosis). The more common approach is a cervical decompression from the front (anterior) combined with a removal of the disc and fusion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:40:40"}

Other suspected causes include use of snuff or chewing tobacco, sunlight exposure, previous x-rays of the head and neck, certain viral infections, ill-fitting dental appliances, chronic candidiasis, and poor oral hygiene. In India, oral cancer is extremely common, probably because of chewing betel quid (a mixture of substances, also called paan).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells.\n【8】 The increase in HPV-related cancer has caused an overall increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer, which otherwise would have been expected to decrease because of the decrease in smoking over the last 2 decades or so. The mechanism for viral-mediated tumor genesis appears to be distinct from tobacco-related pathways. Patients who in the past were treated with radiation for acne, excess facial hair, enlarged thymus, or hypertrophic tonsils and adenoids are predisposed to thyroid Cancers There are 4 general types of thyroid cancer. Most thyroid cancers manifest as asymptomatic nodules.\n【9】 A painless salivary mass is the most common sign and is evaluated by fine-needle aspiration biopsy.\n【10】 Epstein-Barr virus Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.\n【11】 Symptoms and Signs of Head and Neck Tumors The manifestations of head and neck cancer depend greatly on the location and extent of the tumor. Common initial manifestations of head and neck cancers include An asymptomatic neck mass Neck Mass Patients or their family members may notice a mass on the neck, or one may be discovered during routine examination. A neck mass may be painless or painful depending on the cause.\n【12】 The condition results from impeded transport of liquids, solids, or both from the pharynx to the stomach.\n【13】 Weight loss caused by perturbed eating and odynophagia is also common. Diagnosis of Head and Neck Tumors Clinical evaluation Biopsy Imaging tests and endoscopy to evaluate extent of disease Routine physical examination (including a thorough oral examination) is the best way to detect cancers early before they become symptomatic. Commercially available brush biopsy kits help screen for oral cancers. Unexplained head and neck symptoms such as sore throat, hoarseness, or otalgia lasting > 2 to 3 weeks should prompt referral to a head and neck specialist who will typically do flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy to evaluate the larynx and pharynx. Definitive diagnosis usually requires a biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration is used for a neck mass Neck Mass Patients or their family members may notice a mass on the neck, or one may be discovered during routine examination. A neck mass may be painless or painful depending on the cause.\n【14】 Oral lesions are evaluated with an incisional biopsy or a brush biopsy. Nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, or laryngeal lesions are biopsied endoscopically. Imaging (CT, MRI, or PET/CT) is done to help determine the extent of the primary tumor, involvement of adjacent structures, and spread to cervical lymph nodes. Staging of Head and Neck Tumors Head and neck cancers are staged according to size and site of the primary tumor (T), number and size of metastases to the cervical lymph nodes (N), and evidence of distant metastases (M) ,1 Staging references Head and neck cancer develops in almost 65,000 people in the United States each year.\n【15】 For oropharyngeal cancer Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oropharyngeal cancer refers to cancer of the tonsil, base and posterior one third of the tongue, soft palate, and posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls.\n【16】 Staging usually requires imaging with CT, MRI, or both, and often PET. Clinical staging (cTNM) is based on the results of the physical examination and tests done before surgery. Pathologic staging (pTNM) is based on the pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor and the number of positive nodes found during surgery. Extranodal extension is incorporated into the \"N\" category for metastatic cancer to neck nodes. Clinical diagnosis of extranodal extension is based on finding evidence of gross extranodal extension during the physical examination together with imaging tests confirming the finding. Pathologic extranodal extension is defined as histologic evidence of tumor in a lymph node extending through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.\n【17】 Prognosis for Head and Neck Tumors Prognosis in head and neck cancer varies greatly depending on the tumor size, primary site, etiology, and presence of regional or distant metastases. In general, the prognosis is favorable if diagnosis is early and treatment is timely and appropriate. Head and neck cancers first invade locally and then metastasize to regional cervical lymph nodes. The spread to regional lymphatics is partially related to tumor size, extent, and aggressiveness and reduces overall survival by nearly half. Distant metastases (most often to the lungs) tend to occur later, usually in patients with advanced-stage disease. Distant metastases greatly reduce survival and are almost always incurable. Advanced local disease (a criterion for advanced T stage) with invasion of muscle, bone, or cartilage also significantly decreases cure rate. Perineural spread, as evidenced by pain, paralysis, or numbness, indicates a highly aggressive tumor, is associated with nodal metastasis, and has a less favorable prognosis than a similar lesion without perineural invasion. With appropriate treatment, 5-year survival can be as high as 90% for stage I, 75 to 80% for stage II, 45 to 75% for stage III, and up to 50% for some stage IV cancers. The survival rates vary greatly depending on the primary site and etiology. Stage I laryngeal cancers have an excellent survival rate when compared to other sites. Oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV have a significantly better prognosis compared with oropharyngeal tumors caused by tobacco or alcohol. Because the prognosis between HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers differs, all tumors of the oropharynx should be routinely tested for HPV. Treatment of Head and Neck Tumors Surgery, radiation therapy, or both Sometimes chemotherapy The main treatments for head and neck cancer are surgery for Cancer Surgery is the oldest effective cancer therapy.\n【18】 Many tumors, regardless of location, respond similarly to surgery and to radiation therapy, allowing other factors such as patient preference or location-specific morbidity to determine choice of therapy. However, at certain locations, there is clear superiority of one modality. For example, surgery is better for early-stage disease involving the oral cavity because radiation therapy has the potential to cause mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Endoscopic surgery has become more frequently used; in select head and neck cancers, it has cure rates similar to or better than those of open surgery or radiation, and its morbidity is significantly less. Endoscopic approaches are most often used for laryngeal surgery and usually use a laser to make the cuts. Endoscopic approaches also are being used in the treatment of selected sinonasal tumors. If radiation therapy is chosen for primary therapy, it is delivered to the primary site and sometimes bilaterally to the cervical lymph nodes. The treatment of lymphatics, whether by radiation or surgery, is determined by the primary site, histologic criteria, and risk of nodal disease. Early-stage lesions often do not require treatment of the lymph nodes, whereas more advanced lesions do. Head and neck sites rich in lymphatics (eg, oropharynx, supraglottis) usually require lymph node radiation regardless of tumor stage, whereas sites with fewer lymphatics (eg, larynx) usually do not require lymphatic radiation for early-stage disease. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivers radiation to a very specific area, potentially reducing adverse effects without compromising tumor control. Advanced-stage disease (stages III and IV) often requires multimodality treatment, incorporating some combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Bone or cartilage invasion requires surgical resection of the primary site and usually regional lymph nodes because of the high risk of nodal spread. If the primary site is treated surgically, then postoperative radiation to the cervical lymph nodes is delivered if there are high-risk features, such as multiple lymph nodes with cancer or extracapsular extension. Postoperative radiation usually is preferred over preoperative radiation because radiated tissues heal poorly. Recent studies have shown that adding chemotherapy to adjuvant radiation therapy to the neck improves regional control of the cancer and improves survival. However, this approach causes significant adverse effects, such as increased dysphagia and bone marrow suppression, so the decision to add chemotherapy should be carefully considered. Advanced squamous cell carcinoma without bony invasion often is treated with concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although advocated as organ-sparing, combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy doubles the rate of acute toxicities, particularly severe dysphagia. Radiation may be used alone for debilitated patients with advanced disease who cannot tolerate the sequelae of chemotherapy and are too high a risk for general anesthesia. Chemotherapy is almost never used as primary treatment for cure. Primary chemotherapy is reserved for chemosensitive tumors, such as Burkitt lymphoma Burkitt Lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in children and adults. Endemic (African), sporadic (non-African), and immunodeficiency-related forms exist.\n【19】 Several drugs—cisplatin, fluorouracil, bleomycin, and methotrexate—provide palliation for pain and shrink the tumor in patients who cannot be treated with other methods. Response may be good initially but is not durable, and the cancer almost always returns. Targeted drugs such as cetuximab are increasingly used instead of traditional chemotherapy drugs for select patients, but efficacy data so far are limited. Because the treatment of head and neck cancer is so complex, multidisciplinary treatment planning is essential. Ideally, each patient should be discussed by a tumor board consisting of members of all treating disciplines, along with radiologists and pathologists, so that a consensus can be reached on the best treatment. Once treatment has been determined, it is best coordinated by a team that includes ear, nose, and throat and reconstructive surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, speech and language pathologists, dentists, and nutritionists. Plastic and reconstructive surgeons play an increasingly important role because the use of free-tissue transfer flaps has allowed functional and cosmetic reconstruction of defects to significantly improve a patient's quality of life after procedures that previously caused excessive morbidity have been done. Common donor sites used for reconstruction include the fibula (often used to reconstruct the mandible), the radial forearm (commonly used for the tongue and floor of mouth), and the anterior lateral thigh (often used for laryngeal or pharyngeal reconstruction). Treatment of tumor recurrence Managing recurrent tumors after therapy is complex and has potential complications. A palpable mass or ulcerated lesion with edema or pain at the primary site after therapy strongly suggests a persistent tumor. Such patients require CT (with thin cuts) or MRI. For local recurrence after surgical treatment, all scar planes and reconstructive flaps are excised along with residual cancer. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both may be done but have limited effectiveness. Patients with recurrence after radiation therapy are best treated with surgery. However, some patients may benefit from additional radiation treatments, but this approach has a high risk of adverse effects and should be done with care. The immune checkpoint inhibitors Immunotherapy and Targeting Inhibitors of Immune Responses A number of immunologic interventions, both passive and active, can be directed against tumor cells.\n【20】 Symptom control Pain is a common symptom in patients with head and neck cancer and must be adequately addressed. Palliative surgery or radiation may temporarily alleviate pain, and in 30 to 50% of patients, chemotherapy can produce improvement that lasts a mean of 3 months. A stepwise approach to pain management, as recommended by the World Health Organization: Guidelines for the pharmacological and radiotherapeutic management of cancer pain in adults and adolescents, is critical to controlling pain. Severe pain is best managed in association with a pain and palliative care specialist. Pain, difficulty eating, choking on secretions, and other problems make adequate symptomatic treatment essential. Patient advance directives Advance Directives Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated.\n【21】 Adverse effects of treatment All cancer treatments have potential complications and expected sequelae. Because many treatments have similar cure rates, the choice of modality is based largely on real, or perceived, differences in sequelae. Although it is commonly thought that surgery causes the most morbidity, many procedures can be done without significantly impairing appearance or function. Increasingly complex reconstructive procedures and techniques, including prostheses, grafts, regional pedicle flaps, and complex free flaps, can restore function and appearance often to near normal. Toxic effects of chemotherapy include malaise, severe nausea and vomiting, mucositis, transient hair loss, gastroenteritis, hematopoietic and immune suppression, and infection. Therapeutic radiation for head and neck cancers has several adverse effects. The function of any salivary gland within the beam is permanently destroyed by a dose of about 40 Gray, resulting in xerostomia is dry mouth caused by reduced or absent flow of saliva.\n【22】 Newer radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), can minimize or eliminate toxic doses to the parotid glands in certain patients.\n【23】 In this condition, tooth extraction sites break down, sloughing bone and soft tissue. Therefore, any needed dental treatment, including scaling, fillings, and extractions, should be done before radiation therapy. Any teeth in poor condition that cannot be rehabilitated should be extracted. It is unclear whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy Recompression Therapy Recompression therapy is administration of 100% oxygen for several hours in a sealed chamber pressurized to > 1 atmosphere, gradually lowered to atmospheric pressure.\n【24】 Radiation therapy may also cause oral mucositis and dermatitis in the overlying skin, which may result in dermal fibrosis. Loss of taste (ageusia) and impaired smell (dysosmia) often occur but are usually transient. Prevention of Head and Neck Tumors Removing risk factors is critical, and all patients should cease tobacco use and limit alcohol consumption. Removing risk factors also helps prevent disease recurrence in patients treated for cancer. A new primary cancer develops in about 5% of patients/year (to a maximum risk of about 20%); risk is lower in those who stop using tobacco. Current vaccines against HPV Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease. HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPV.\n【25】 Cancer of the lower lip may be prevented by sunscreen use and tobacco cessation.

Cancer is the out-of-control growth of cells in your body. Cells are the tiny building blocks of your body. Cells specialize in what they do. For example, your intestines have muscle cells to make them contract, nerve cells to control the muscle cells, and other cells to absorb food. There are many more types of cells in the intestines and in other parts of your body. Cancer Overview VIDEO Normally, new cells in your body grow only to replace cells that have died or gotten too old. Each new cell looks and functions just like its parent cell. Cancerous (malignant) cells are different from normal cells in many ways because they: Multiply very quickly Keep on multiplying even though the organ they're in doesn't need more cells Look abnormal and usually don't function properly Don't stay where they belong—they invade nearby organs or spread to distant parts of your body (metastasize) Some kinds of cancer cells group together to form a solid mass called a tumor. However, not all tumors are cancerous. Tumors that aren't cancerous are called benign (harmless). When doctors talk about the “stage” of cancer (stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV), they're describing how big the cancer is and if and where it has spread. Some cancers grow and spread Development and Spread of Cancer starts when a healthy cell changes. This change can happen: Without any known cause Because you were exposed to a carcinogen A carcinogen is a substance that can cause cancer.\n【1】 These are called aggressive cancers. Why does cancer kill you? If you're healthy and gain 15 or 20 pounds of weight, you'll probably feel fine. However, even a few pounds of cancer cells can be enough to kill you if they: Block an important body function Give off substances that interfere with other organs Dangerous places for cancer to grow include: Lungs: Trouble breathing Belly: Blocking your intestines Brain: High pressure inside your skull Major blood vessels: Heavy or fatal bleeding Bone marrow (the hollow insides of your bones, where blood cells are made): Dangerously low blood count ,anemia Overview of Anemia is not having enough red blood cells or hemoglobin. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all of your other organs.\n【2】 Some of the substances do the following: Take away your appetite: severe weight loss, trouble fighting off infections Interfere with making blood cells: low blood count ,anemia Overview of Anemia is not having enough red blood cells or hemoglobin. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all of your other organs.\n【3】 If something is “neoplastic,” it has to do with the neoplasm.\n【4】 Where in your body can you get cancer? Cancer can develop from almost any cell, including those in your blood, bones, and organs. Each type of cancer is different depending on what type of cell it started from. Cancers are named by the organ they started in. For example, \"lung cancer.\" What are the most common cancers? Cancer isn't one disease, but many.

Malignant tumors may be primary or metastatic. In children, most bone tumors are primary and benign; some are malignant primary tumors Primary Malignant Bone Tumors Primary malignant bone tumors are much less common than metastatic bone tumors, particularly in adults.\n【1】 Very few are metastatic tumors ,eg, neuroblastoma is a cancer arising in the adrenal gland or less often from the extra-adrenal sympathetic chain, including in the retroperitoneum, chest, and neck.\n【2】 In adults, especially those over age 40, metastatic tumors are about 100 times more common than primary malignant tumors.

The American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts & Figures 2022 Symptoms and Signs of Bone and Joint Tumors Bone tumors typically cause unexplained, progressive pain and swelling. Pain can occur with the mechanical stress of weight bearing or without weight bearing (pain at rest), particularly at night. Some tumors (eg, leukemia, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma) can cause fever and/or other constitutional symptoms. Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Tumors Plain x-rays MRI, usually initially without and then with contrast, and sometimes CT Whole-body bone scan or whole-body PET-CT (positron emission tomography combined with CT) if multicentric or metastatic tumors are suspected Biopsy unless imaging studies clearly show benign characteristics or if there are multiple bony lesions consistent with metastatic disease in a patient with a confirmed active primary cancer The most common reason that diagnosis of bone tumors is delayed is that physicians fail to suspect the tumor and order appropriate imaging studies. Bone tumors should be considered in patients who have unexplained bone pain, particularly pain at night or at rest. Persistent or progressive unexplained pain of the trunk or extremities, particularly if associated with a mass, is suggestive of a bone tumor. Some pelvic bone tumors can cause pelvic or proximal buttock pain, mimic sciatica or, rarely, cause true sciatica by compressing the sciatic nerve. Plain x-rays are the first test to identify and characterize a bone tumor. Lesions suggestive of tumors, including those found incidentally on x-rays done for other reasons, usually require further assessment, often with additional imaging studies (eg, CT or MRI) and a biopsy. However, tumors with x-ray findings classic for benign lesions do not require bone scan, CT, or MRI unless the patient has pain in the region of the lesion. Whole-body bone scan in general, rather than just a scan of a selected area, should be done routinely to identify other areas of abnormality, especially if multicentric or metastatic tumors are suspected. Whole-body scan is usually preferred to ensure that other skeletal lesions are identified, particularly because the patient has already received the full dose of radionuclide, and the whole-body component only requires limited additional time. Whole-body PET-CT is an alternative to whole-body bone scan. There are times where gadolinium contrasted MRI is necessary and other times where contrast is not necessary. Adequacy of renal function should be documented before adding MRI contrast, because there may be renal toxicity in patients with reduced renal capacity. The MRI radiologist should make the final decision whether a contrasted MRI should follow the noncontrasted MRI study and what additional MRI sequences are needed. Pearls & Pitfalls Consider a bone tumor in patients who have unexplained bone pain, particularly pain at night or at rest. Consider a bone tumor in patients who have pelvic pain or pain mimicking sciatica and look for a destructive lesion on pelvic x-rays.\n【6】 Radiographic findings that suggest cancer include the following: A lytic, destructive lesion Ill-defined, permeative appearance of bone loss Irregular tumor borders Loculated areas of bone destruction (moth-eaten appearance) Cortical destruction Soft tissue extension Pathologic fracture A lytic appearance is characterized by areas of bone destruction that are sharply demarcated. A permeative appearance is characterized by a faint, gradual loss of bone or an infiltrating pattern without clear borders. Certain tumors have a characteristic appearance. For example, Ewing sarcoma Ewing sarcoma of bone Primary malignant bone tumors are much less common than metastatic bone tumors, particularly in adults.\n【7】 The tumor’s location may also suggest a diagnosis. For example, Ewing sarcoma commonly appears in the shaft of a long bone, osteosarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma) Primary malignant bone tumors are much less common than metastatic bone tumors, particularly in adults.\n【8】 In adults, metastatic lung, breast, prostate, and renal cancer may manifest with multiple bony lesions. Some benign conditions, however, can mimic a malignant tumor: Heterotopic ossification (myositis ossificans) and exuberant callus formation after fracture can cause mineralization around bony cortices and in adjacent soft tissues, mimicking malignant tumors. Langerhans cell histiocytosis Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a proliferation of dendritic mononuclear cells with infiltration into organs locally or diffusely. Most cases occur in children.\n【9】 Most cases occur in children.\n【10】 Most cases occur in children.\n【11】 Most cases occur in children.\n【12】 In solitary lesions, there may be periosteal new bone formation, suggesting a malignant bone tumor. Osteopoikilosis (spotted bones, multiple bone islands) is an asymptomatic condition of no clinical consequence but can mimic osteoblastic bone metastases of breast or prostate cancer. It is characterized by multiple small, round, or oval foci of bony sclerosis, usually in the tarsal, carpal, or pelvic bones or the metaphyseal-epiphyseal regions of tubular bones. Bone infection can manifest with pain and a destructive lesion on x-rays. Other testing The primary cancer location can be identified over 85% of the time with a quality history and physical examination, CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, mammography in females, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in males. CT and MRI may help define the location and extent of a bone tumor and sometimes suggest a specific diagnosis. MRI is usually done if cancer is suspected. If tumors are suspected of being metastatic or involving multiple foci (multicentric), then radioisotopic technetium-99 whole-body bone scanning should be done to search for additional tumors. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may be done, often combined with CT (PET-CT). For possibly metastatic tumors, mammography in females and PSA in males may help identify the primary cancer. Biopsy is usually essential for diagnosis of malignant tumors, unless the imaging studies have a classically benign appearance. The pathologist should be given pertinent details of the clinical history and should review imaging studies. Histopathologic diagnosis may be difficult and requires sufficient viable tissue from a representative portion of the tumor (usually the soft portion). The best results are obtained in centers with extensive experience in bone biopsies. Prompt, accurate, definitive diagnosis is possible in > 90% of cases. Special immunohistologic staining and sometimes cytogenetic studies facilitate accurate diagnosis. Biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of suspected metastatic disease in an isolated, single lesion. However, biopsy may not be needed if there are multiple metastatic lesions in a patient with a confirmed active primary cancer. If a malignant diagnosis is suspected on frozen section histology, often the surgeon will wait for the results of permanent histology before treating definitively. Diagnostic and surgical errors occur more frequently in hospitals that infrequently encounter patients with malignant primary bone tumors. Key Points In children, most bone tumors are primary and benign, some are primary and malignant, and very few are metastatic. In adults, especially those age > 40, metastatic tumors (eg, from breast, lung, prostate, or renal cancer) are about 100 times more common than primary malignant bone tumors.

The goal of a thorough preoperative evaluation should be to provide patients with a personalized surgical plan to minimize operative risk and postoperative complications. In some cases, elective procedures should be delayed when possible so that certain underlying disorders (eg, hypertension, diabetes, hematologic abnormalities) can be optimally controlled. In other cases, patients deemed high risk for major surgery may be identified preoperatively as candidates for less invasive interventions. A thorough preoperative medical evaluation may require input from nonsurgical consultants (eg, internists, cardiologists, pulmonologists) to help assess surgical risk. Such consultants may also help manage preexisting disease (eg, diabetes) and help prevent and treat perioperative and postoperative complications (eg, cardiac, pulmonary, infectious). Psychiatric consultation is occasionally needed to assess capacity or help deal with underlying psychiatric problems that can interfere with recovery. Older patients may benefit from involvement of an interdisciplinary geriatric team Geriatric Interdisciplinary Teams Every 4 years, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) updates its strategic plan and defines its mission and goals.\n【1】 Because not all surgical procedures are elective, the acuity and type of proposed operation should be considered as well as the patient's risk with surgery. For example, if an emergency procedure is required (eg, for intra-abdominal hemorrhage, perforated viscus, necrotizing fasciitis), there is usually no time for a full preoperative evaluation. However, the patient's history should be reviewed as expeditiously as possible, particularly for allergies and to help identify factors that increase risk of emergency surgery (eg, history of bleeding problems or adverse anesthetic reactions). History A relevant preoperative history includes information about all of the following: Current symptoms suggesting an active cardiopulmonary disorder (eg, cough, chest pain, dyspnea during exertion, ankle swelling) or infection (eg, fever, dysuria) Risk factors for excessive bleeding Excessive Bleeding Unusual or excessive bleeding may be indicated by several different signs and symptoms.\n【2】 DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.\n【3】 Physical examination Physical examination should address not only areas affected by the surgical procedure but also the cardiopulmonary system, as well as a search for any signs of ongoing infection (eg, upper respiratory tract, skin). When spinal anesthesia is likely to be used, patients should be evaluated for scoliosis and other anatomic abnormalities that may complicate lumbar puncture. Any cognitive dysfunction, especially in older patients who will be given a general anesthetic, should be noted. Preexisting dysfunction may become more apparent postoperatively and, if undetected beforehand, may be misinterpreted as a surgical complication. Testing Because healthy patients undergoing elective surgery have a low prevalence of silent disease that would otherwise influence perioperative management, routine preoperative testing should not be done in those without clinical symptoms or significant underlying disease. Such testing is not cost-effective and results in false-positive tests, unintended patient alarm, and delays in surgery.\n【4】 In symptomatic patients, those with known underlying disease, or those undergoing operations with a higher risk of significant bleeding or other complications, laboratory evaluation may include the following tests: Complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis (glucose, protein, and cells) usually are done. CBC is particularly relevant in patients > 65 or in younger patients with significant anticipated blood loss. Serum electrolytes and creatinine and plasma glucose are measured unless patients are extremely healthy and < 50, the procedure is considered very low risk, and use of nephrotoxic drugs is not expected. Liver tests are often measured if abnormalities are suspected based on the patient’s history or examination. Coagulation studies and bleeding time are needed only if patients have a personal or family history of bleeding diathesis or a disorder associated with bleeding. ECG is done for patients at risk of coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.\n【5】 Chest x-ray only in patients with symptoms of or risk factors for underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Pulmonary function testing Overview of Tests of Pulmonary Function Pulmonary function tests provide measures of airflow, lung volumes, gas exchange, response to bronchodilators, and respiratory muscle function.\n【6】 Procedural Risk Factors Procedural risk is highest with the following: Heart or lung surgery Hepatic resection Intra-abdominal surgeries that are estimated to require a prolonged operative time or that have a risk of large-volume hemorrhage (eg, Whipple procedure, aortic surgery, retroperitoneal surgery) Open prostatectomy Major orthopedic procedures (eg, hip replacement) Patients undergoing elective surgery that has a significant risk of hemorrhage should consider banking blood for autologous transfusion Blood Collection should it be needed. Autologous transfusion decreases the risks of infection and transfusion reactions. Emergency surgery has a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than the same surgery done electively. Patient Risk Factors The contribution of patient risk factors to perioperative morbidity and mortality is best estimated by validated quantitative risk calculators. For example, the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) has developed a risk calculator to predict perioperative adverse events .\n【7】 Older age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve and greater morbidity if a complication occurs. However, chronic disorders are more closely associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality than is age alone. Older age is not an absolute contraindication to surgery. Cardiac risk factors Cardiac risk factors dramatically increase surgical risk. Perioperative cardiac risk is typically assessed using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association's Revised Cardiac Risk Index . It considers the following independent predictors of cardiac risk: History of coronary artery disease (CAD) History of heart failure History of cerebrovascular disease Diabetes requiring treatment with insulin Serum creatinine (2.0 mg/dL) Risk of cardiac complications increases with increasing risk factors: No risk factors: 0.4% (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.8%) 1 risk factor: 1.0% (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.4%) 2 risk factors: 2.4% (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.5%) ≥ 3 risk factors: 5.4% (95% confidence interval 2.8 to 7.9%) A high-risk surgical procedure (eg, vascular surgery, open intrathoracic or intraperitoneal procedure) also independently predicts a high cardiac perioperative risk. Patients with active cardiac symptoms (eg, of heart failure or unstable angina) have a particularly high perioperative risk. Patients with unstable angina Unstable angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction.\n【8】 In patients with stable angina, risk is proportional to their degree of exercise tolerance. Patients with active cardiac symptoms thus require thorough evaluation. For example, the cause of heart failure should be determined so that perioperative cardiac monitoring and treatment can be optimized before elective surgery.\n【9】 Preoperative care should aim to control active disorders (eg, heart failure, diabetes) using standard treatments. Also, measures should be taken to minimize perioperative tachycardia, which can worsen heart failure and increase risk of myocardial infarction; for example, pain control should be optimized and beta-blocker therapy should be considered, especially if patients are already taking beta-blockers. Coronary revascularization should be considered for patients with unstable angina. If a heart disorder cannot be corrected before surgery or if a patient is at high risk of cardiac complications, intraoperative and sometimes preoperative monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC) Monitoring Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.\n【10】 Sometimes the cardiac risk outweighs the benefit of surgery. In such cases, a less invasive procedure may provide or serve as a bridge to definitive treatment (eg, tube cholecystostomy for cholecystitis) and decrease morbidity and mortality. Algorithm for risk stratification for noncardiac surgery *Active clinical conditions include unstable coronary syndromes, decompensated heart failure, significant arrhythmias, and severe valvular disorders. †See the ACC/AHA ‡Clinical risk factors include coronary artery disease, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and preoperative creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL.

Fleisher LA, Fleischmann KE, Auerbach AD, et al Infections Incidental bacterial infections discovered preoperatively should be treated with antibiotics. However, infections should not delay surgery unless prosthetic material is being implanted; in such cases, surgery should be postponed until the infection is controlled or eliminated. Patients with respiratory infections should be treated and have evidence that the infection has resolved before receiving inhalational anesthesia. Viral infections with or without fever should be resolved before elective surgery is done, especially if a general anesthetic is going to be used. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances Fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before surgery. Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia must be corrected before general anesthesia to decrease risk of potentially lethal arrhythmias. Dehydration and hypovolemia should be treated with IV fluids before general anesthesia to prevent severe hypotension on induction—blood pressure tends to fall when general anesthesia is induced. Nutritional disorders Undernutrition Overview of Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. ,Malnutrition also includes overnutrition.\n【11】 Nutritional status is assessed preoperatively using history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Severe nutritional risk factors include the following: A body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 or a history of unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight over 6 months or 5% over 1 month Suggestive physical examination findings (eg, muscle wasting, signs of specific nutritional deficiencies) Low serum albumin levels (< 3 g/dL without evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction) It is important to ask whether weight loss was intentional, because unintentional weight loss Involuntary Weight Loss Involuntary weight loss generally develops over weeks or months. It can be a sign of a significant physical or mental disorder and is associated with an increased risk for mortality.\n【12】 Serum albumin is an inexpensive, widely available, and reliable indicator of undernutrition; it should be measured preoperatively in patients who may be undernourished. Values < 2.8 g/dL predict increased morbidity (including poor wound healing) and mortality. Because the half-life of serum albumin is 18 to 20 days, levels may not reflect acute undernutrition. If more acute undernutrition is suspected, a protein with a shorter half-life can be measured; for example transferrin (half-life 7 days) or transthyretin (pre-albumin; half-life 3 to 5 days).\n【13】 In some cases, surgery can be delayed so patients can receive nutritional support, sometimes for several weeks (eg, in chronically undernourished patients, to help prevent the refeeding syndrome). Significant obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2) increases perioperative mortality risk because such patients have increased risk of cardiac and pulmonary disorders (eg, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, coronary artery disease). Obesity is an independent risk factor for deep venous thrombosis Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.\n【14】 Obesity also increases risk of postoperative wound complications (eg, fat necrosis, infection, dehiscence, and abdominal wall hernias).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:39:45"}

There are many types of anxiety disorders, distinguished by the main focus of the fear or worry. Most commonly, children refuse to go to school, often using physical symptoms, such as a stomachache, as the reason. Doctors usually base the diagnosis on symptoms but sometimes do tests to rule out disorders that could cause the physical symptoms often caused by anxiety. Behavioral therapy is often sufficient, but if anxiety is severe, drugs may be needed.\n【1】 All children feel some anxiety sometimes. For example, 3- and 4-year-olds are often afraid of the dark or monsters. Older children and adolescents often become anxious when giving a book report in front of their classmates. Such fears and anxieties are not signs of a disorder. However, if children become so anxious that they cannot function or become greatly distressed, they may have an anxiety disorder. Studies show that about 3% of 6-year-olds, 5% of adolescent boys, and 10% of adolescent girls have anxiety disorders. Children with an anxiety disorder are at increased risk of depression and Mood Dysregulation Disorder in Children and Adolescents Depression includes a feeling of sadness (or, in children and adolescents, irritability), and/or loss of interest in activities.\n【2】 Suicidal ideation is thoughts and plans about suicide.\n【3】 People can inherit a tendency to be anxious. Anxious parents tend to have anxious children. Anxiety disorders include Generalized anxiety disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Children Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive, persistent nervousness, worry, and dread about many activities or events.\n【4】 They may have separation anxiety, social anxiety, or panic disorder or a combination. Some children talk specifically about their anxiety. For example, they may say “I am worried that I will never see you again” (separation anxiety) or “I am worried the kids will laugh at me” (social anxiety disorder). However, most children complain of physical symptoms, such as a stomachache. These children are often telling the truth because anxiety often causes an upset stomach, nausea, headaches, and sleep problems in children. Many children who have an anxiety disorder struggle with anxiety into adulthood. However, with early treatment, many children learn how to control their anxiety. Diagnosis Symptoms Doctors usually diagnose an anxiety disorder when the child or parents describe typical symptoms. However, doctors may be misled by the physical symptoms that anxiety can cause and do tests for physical disorders before an anxiety disorder is considered. Treatment Behavioral therapy Sometimes drugs If anxiety is mild, behavioral therapy Behavioral therapy Extraordinary advances have been made in the treatment of mental illness. As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated nearly as successfully as physical disorders.\n【5】 Therapists expose children to the situation that triggers anxiety and help the children remain in the situation. Thus, children gradually become desensitized and feel less anxiety. When appropriate, treating anxiety in parents at the same time often helps. If anxiety is severe, drugs may be used. A type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes.\n【6】 Most children can take SSRIs without any problem. However, some children have an upset stomach, diarrhea, or insomnia or gain weight. A few become restless or more impulsive.\n【7】 If drug treatment is needed only for a short time (for example, because a child is very anxious before a medical procedure), benzodiazepines, a type of sedative, are usually used.

A sensitive child may be overreacting with fear to a teacher's strictness or rebukes. Changes in classroom staffing or curriculum can precipitate school resistance in children with special educational needs. Younger children tend to manifest somatic complaints (eg, stomachache, nausea) or make excuses to avoid school. Some children directly refuse to go to school. Alternatively, children may go to school without difficulty but become anxious or develop physical symptoms during the school day, often going regularly to the nurse’s office.\n【3】 Diagnosis is by history.\n【4】 In the absence of a significant underlying disorder, school avoidance tends to result from Poor academic performance Family difficulties with peers Most children recover from school avoidance, although some develop it again after a real illness or a vacation.

Thick, less-runny hydrocarbons such as lamp oil and motor oil are less likely to enter the lungs but can cause severe and persistent irritation if they do. A person who gets high by breathing hydrocarbon fumes may die suddenly from fatal irregular heartbeats or cardiac arrest. Symptoms of Hydrocarbon Poisoning A person usually coughs and chokes after swallowing or inhaling hydrocarbons. A burning sensation can develop in the stomach, and the person may vomit. If the lungs are affected, the person continues to cough intensely. Breathing becomes rapid, and the skin may become bluish ,cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood.\n【4】 Young children may have cyanosis, hold their breath, and cough persistently.

Giant lysosomal granules develop in neutrophils and other cells (eg, melanocytes, neural Schwann cells). The abnormal lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosomes, so ingested bacteria cannot be lysed normally.

The diagnosis of Chédiak-Higashi syndrome can be confirmed with genetic testing for LYST mutations.

Some units use a traditional labor room and separate delivery suite, to which the woman is transferred when delivery is imminent. The woman's partner or other support person should be offered the opportunity to accompany her. In the delivery room, the perineum is washed and draped, and the neonate is delivered. After delivery, the woman may remain there or be transferred to a postpartum unit. Management of complications during delivery requires additional measures ,such as induction of labor Induction of Labor Induction of labor is stimulation of uterine contractions before spontaneous labor to achieve vaginal delivery.\n【1】 Anesthesia Options include regional, local, and general anesthesia. Local anesthetics and opioids are commonly used. These drugs pass through the placenta; thus, during the hour before delivery, such drugs should be given in small doses to avoid toxicity (eg, central nervous system [CNS] depression, bradycardia) in the neonate. Opioids used alone do not provide adequate analgesia and so are most often used with anesthetics. Regional anesthesia Several methods are available. Lumbar epidural injection Analgesia of a local anesthetic is the most commonly used method. Epidural analgesia is being increasingly used for delivery, including cesarean delivery, and has essentially replaced pudendal and paracervical blocks. When epidural analgesia is used, drugs can be titrated as needed during the course of labor. The local anesthetics often used for epidural injection (eg, bupivacaine) have a longer duration of action and slower onset than those used for pudendal block (eg, lidocaine). Spinal injection (into the paraspinal subarachnoid space) may be used for cesarean delivery, but it is used less often for vaginal deliveries because it is short-lasting (preventing its use during labor) and has a small risk of spinal headache afterward. When spinal injection is used, patients must be constantly attended, and vital signs must be checked every 5 minutes to detect and treat possible hypotension. Local anesthesia Methods include pudendal block, perineal infiltration, and paracervical block. Pudendal block, rarely used because epidural injections are typically used instead, involves injecting a local anesthetic through the vaginal wall so that the anesthetic bathes the pudendal nerve as it crosses the ischial spine. This block anesthetizes the lower vagina, perineum, and posterior vulva; the anterior vulva, innervated by lumbar dermatomes, is not anesthetized. Pudendal block is a safe, simple method for uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal deliveries if women wish to bear down and push or if labor is advanced and there is no time for epidural injection. Complications of pudendal block include intravascular injection of anesthetics, hematoma, and infection. Infiltration of the perineum with an anesthetic is commonly used, although this method is not as effective as a well-administered pudendal block. Paracervical block is rarely appropriate for delivery because incidence of fetal bradycardia is > 10% ,1 Anesthesia reference Many obstetric units now use a combined labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum (LDRP) room, so that the woman, support person, and neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay.\n【2】 It is used mainly for 1st- or early 2nd-trimester abortion. The technique involves injecting 5 to 10 mL of 1% lidocaine or chloroprocaine (which has a shorter half-life) at the 3 and 9 o’clock positions; the analgesic response is short-lasting. General anesthesia Because potent and volatile inhalation drugs (eg, isoflurane) can cause marked depression in the fetus, general anesthesia is not recommended for routine delivery. Rarely, nitrous oxide 40% with oxygen may be used for analgesia during vaginal delivery as long as verbal contact with the woman is maintained. Thiopental, a sedative-hypnotic, is commonly given IV with other drugs (eg, succinylcholine, nitrous oxide plus oxygen) for induction of general anesthesia during cesarean delivery; used alone, thiopental provides inadequate analgesia. With thiopental, induction is rapid and recovery is prompt. It becomes concentrated in the fetal liver, preventing levels from becoming high in the central nervous system (CNS); high levels in the CNS may cause neonatal depression. Epidural analgesia, which can be rapidly converted to epidural anesthesia, has reduced the need for general anesthesia except for cesarean delivery.\n【3】Positions for Birth VIDEO Delivery of the Fetus A vaginal examination is done to determine position and station of the fetal head; the head is usually the presenting part . When effacement is complete and the cervix is fully dilated, the woman is told to bear down and strain with each contraction to move the head through the pelvis and progressively dilate the vaginal introitus so that more and more of the head appears. When about 3 or 4 cm of the head is visible during a contraction in nulliparas (somewhat less in multiparas), the following maneuvers can facilitate delivery and reduce risk of perineal laceration: The clinician, if right-handed, places the left palm over the infant’s head during a contraction to control and, if necessary, slightly slow progress. Simultaneously, the clinician places the curved fingers of the right hand against the dilating perineum, through which the infant’s brow or chin is felt. To advance the head, the clinician can wrap a hand in a towel and, with curved fingers, apply pressure against the underside of the brow or chin (modified Ritgen maneuver). Thus, the clinician controls the progress of the head to effect a slow, safe delivery. How To Do Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery VIDEO Assisting the Birth of Twins VIDEO Sequence of events in delivery for vertex presentations Forceps or a vacuum extractor Operative Vaginal Delivery Operative vaginal delivery involves application of forceps or a vacuum extractor to the fetal head to assist during the 2nd stage of labor and facilitate delivery.\n【4】 The woman has a disorder such as a heart disorder and must avoid pushing during the 2nd stage of labor. If anesthesia is local (pudendal block or infiltration of the perineum), forceps or a vacuum extractor is usually not needed unless complications develop; local anesthesia may not interfere with bearing down. Evaluating Tears After Birth VIDEO Indications for forceps and vacuum extractor are essentially the same. Both procedures have risks. Third- and 4th-degree perineal tears ,1 Delivery of the fetus references Many obstetric units now use a combined labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum (LDRP) room, so that the woman, support person, and neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay.\n【5】 Other fetal risks with forceps include facial lacerations and facial nerve palsy, corneal abrasions, external ocular trauma, skull fracture, and intracranial hemorrhage ,3 Delivery of the fetus references Many obstetric units now use a combined labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum (LDRP) room, so that the woman, support person, and neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay.\n【6】 Fetal risks with vacuum extraction include scalp laceration, cephalohematoma formation, and subgaleal or intracranial hemorrhage; retinal hemorrhages and increased rates of hyperbilirubinemia have been reported. How To Do and Repair an Episiotomy VIDEO An episiotomy is not routinely done for most normal deliveries; it is done only if the perineum does not stretch adequately and is obstructing delivery. A local anesthetic can be infiltrated if epidural analgesia is inadequate. Episiotomy prevents excessive stretching and possible irregular tearing of the perineal tissues, including anterior tears. An episiotomy incision that extends only through skin and perineal body without disruption of the anal sphincter muscles (2nd-degree episiotomy) is usually easier to repair than a perineal tear. The most common episiotomy is a midline incision made from the midpoint of the fourchette directly back toward the rectum. Extension into the rectal sphincter or rectum is a risk with midline episiotomy, but if recognized promptly, the extension can be repaired successfully and heals well. Tears or extensions into the rectum can usually be prevented by keeping the infant’s head well flexed until the occipital prominence passes under the symphysis pubis. Another type of episiotomy is a mediolateral incision made from the midpoint of the fourchette at a 45° angle laterally on either side. This type usually does not extend into the sphincter or rectum ,5 Delivery of the fetus references Many obstetric units now use a combined labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum (LDRP) room, so that the woman, support person, and neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay.\n【7】 Thus, for episiotomy, a midline cut is often preferred. However, use of episiotomy is decreasing because extension or tearing into the sphincter or rectum is a concern. Episioproctotomy (intentionally cutting into the rectum) is not recommended because rectovaginal fistula is a risk. About 35% of women have dyspareunia after episiotomy ,7 Delivery of the fetus references Many obstetric units now use a combined labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum (LDRP) room, so that the woman, support person, and neonate remain in the same room throughout their stay.\n【8】 When the head is delivered, the clinician determines whether the umbilical cord is wrapped around the neck. If it is, the clinician should try to unwrap the cord; if the cord cannot be rapidly removed this way, the cord may be clamped and cut. After delivery of the head, the infant’s body rotates so that the shoulders are in an anteroposterior position; gentle downward pressure on the head delivers the anterior shoulder under the symphysis. The head is gently lifted, the posterior shoulder slides over the perineum, and the rest of the body follows without difficulty. The nose, mouth, and pharynx are aspirated with a bulb syringe to remove mucus and fluids and help start respirations. If appropriate traction and maternal pushing do not deliver the anterior shoulder, the clinician should explain to the woman what must be done next and begin delivery of a fetus with shoulder dystocia Shoulder dystocia Fetal dystocia is abnormal fetal size or position resulting in difficult delivery. Diagnosis is by examination, ultrasonography, or response to augmentation of labor.\n【9】 Cord Around the Neck VIDEO The cord should be double-clamped and cut between the clamps, and a plastic cord clip should be applied about 2 to 3 cm distal from the cord insertion on the infant. If fetal or neonatal compromise is suspected, a segment of umbilical cord is doubly clamped so that arterial blood gas analysis can be done. An arterial pH > 7.15 to 7.20 is considered normal. Delaying clamping of the umbilical cord for 30 to 60 seconds is recommended to increase iron stores, which provides the following: For all infants: Possible developmental benefits For premature infants: Improved transitional circulation and decreased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing Enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acquired disease, primarily of preterm or sick neonates, characterized by mucosal or even deeper intestinal necrosis.\n【10】 However, evidence for or against umbilical cord milking is inadequate. The infant is thoroughly dried, then placed on the mother’s abdomen or, if resuscitation is needed, in a warmed resuscitation bassinet.\n【11】 5.

Bex PJ, Hofmeyr GJ: Perineal management during childbirth and subsequent dyspareunia. Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol 14 (2):97–100, 1987. Delivery of the Placenta Active management of the 3rd stage of labor reduces the risk of postpartum hemorrhage Postpartum Hemorrhage Postpartum hemorrhage is blood loss of > 1000 mL or blood loss accompanied by symptoms or signs of hypovolemia within 24 hours of birth. Diagnosis is clinical.\n【12】 Active management includes giving the woman a uterotonic drug such as oxytocin as soon as the fetus is delivered. Uterotonic drugs help the uterus contract firmly and decrease bleeding due to uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin can be given as 10 units IM or as an infusion of 20 units/1000 mL saline at 125 mL/hour. Oxytocin should not be given as an IV bolus because cardiac arrhythmia may occur. Manual Removal of the Placenta VIDEO After delivery of the infant and administration of oxytocin, the clinician gently pulls on the cord and places a hand gently on the abdomen over the uterine fundus to detect contractions; placental separation usually occurs during the 1st or 2nd contraction, often with a gush of blood from behind the separating placenta. The mother can usually help deliver the placenta by bearing down. If she cannot and if substantial bleeding occurs, the placenta can usually be evacuated (expressed) by placing a hand on the abdomen and exerting firm downward (caudal) pressure on the uterus; this procedure is done only if the uterus feels firm because pressure on a flaccid uterus can cause it to invert Inverted Uterus Inverted uterus is a rare medical emergency in which the corpus turns inside out and protrudes into the vagina or beyond the introitus.\n【13】 If this procedure is not effective, the umbilical cord is held taut while a hand placed on the abdomen pushes upward (cephalad) on the firm uterus, away from the placenta; traction on the umbilical cord is avoided because it may invert the uterus. If the placenta has not been delivered within 45 to 60 minutes of delivery, manual removal may be necessary; appropriate analgesia or anesthesia is required. For manual removal, the clinician inserts an entire hand into the uterine cavity, separating the placenta from its attachment, then extracts the placenta. In such cases, an abnormally adherent placenta ,placenta accreta Placenta Accreta Placenta accreta is an abnormally adherent placenta, resulting in delayed delivery of the placenta.\n【14】 How to Deliver and Inspect the Placenta VIDEO The placenta should be examined for completeness because fragments left in the uterus can cause hemorrhage or infection later. If the placenta is incomplete, the uterine cavity should be explored manually. Some obstetricians routinely explore the uterus after each delivery. However, exploration is uncomfortable and is not routinely recommended. Examining the Placenta VIDEO Immediate Postpartum Care The cervix and vagina are inspected for lacerations, which, if present, are repaired, as is episiotomy if done. Immediate Care After Birth VIDEO Then if the mother and infant are recovering normally, they can begin bonding. Many mothers wish to begin breastfeeding soon after delivery, and this activity should be encouraged. Mother, infant, and father or partner should remain together in a warm, private area for an hour or more to enhance parent-infant bonding. Then, the infant may be taken to the nursery or left with the mother depending on her wishes. For the first hour after delivery, the mother should be observed closely to make sure the uterus is contracting (detected by palpation during abdominal examination) and to check for bleeding, blood pressure abnormalities, and general well-being. The time from delivery of the placenta to 4 hours postpartum has been called the 4th stage of labor; most complications, especially hemorrhage Postpartum Hemorrhage Postpartum hemorrhage is blood loss of > 1000 mL or blood loss accompanied by symptoms or signs of hypovolemia within 24 hours of birth.

Threatened abortion is vaginal bleeding without cervical dilation before 20 weeks in a confirmed viable intrauterine pregnancy. Diagnosis is by pelvic examination, measurement of beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, and ultrasonography. Treatment is usually expectant observation for threatened abortion and, if spontaneous abortion has occurred or appears unavoidable, observation or uterine evacuation. Spontaneous abortion, by definition, is death of the fetus. About 20 to 30% of women with confirmed pregnancies bleed during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy; half of these women spontaneously abort. Thus, incidence of spontaneous abortion is up to about 20% in confirmed pregnancies. Incidence in all pregnancies is probably higher because some very early abortions are mistaken for a late menstrual period. Fetal death and early delivery are classified as follows: Spontaneous abortion: Death of the fetus, sometimes with passage of products of conception (fetus and placenta), before 20 weeks gestation Fetal demise ,stillbirth is fetal death (fetal demise) at ≥ 20 weeks gestation (> 28 weeks in some definitions). Management is delivery and postpartum care.\n【1】 About 40% of unintended pregnancies end in induced abortion; 90% of procedures are done during the 1st trimester.\n【2】 As many as 25% of all pregnancies end in a spontaneous abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Incidence in all pregnancies is probably higher because some very early abortions are mistaken for a late menstrual period.\n【3】 Etiology of Spontaneous Abortion Early spontaneous abortion is often caused by chromosomal abnormalities Overview of Chromosomal Anomalies Chromosomal anomalies cause various disorders.\n【4】 Maternal reproductive tract abnormalities (eg, bicornuate uterus, fibroids, adhesions) may also cause pregnancy loss through 20 weeks gestation. Isolated spontaneous abortions may result from certain viruses—most notably cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, and rubella virus. Other causes include immunologic abnormalities and major trauma. Most often, the cause is unknown.\n【5】 Pregnancy does not change the symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.\n【6】 Symptoms and Signs of Spontaneous Abortion Symptoms of spontaneous abortion include crampy pelvic pain, uterine bleeding, and eventually expulsion of tissue. Late spontaneous abortion may begin with a gush of fluid when the membranes rupture. Hemorrhage is rarely massive. A dilated cervix indicates that abortion is inevitable. If products of conception remain in the uterus after spontaneous abortion, uterine bleeding may occur, sometimes after a delay of hours to days. Infection may also develop, causing fever, pain, and sometimes sepsis ,called septic abortion Septic Abortion Septic abortion is serious uterine infection during or shortly before or after a spontaneous or an induced abortion.\n【7】 Diagnosis of Spontaneous Abortion Usually ultrasonography and quantitative beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) Pelvic examination Pregnancy is diagnosed with a urine or blood beta-hCG test. Ultrasonography is done to confirm intrauterine pregnancy and check for fetal cardiac activity, which is usually detectable after 5.5 to 6 weeks gestation. However, gestational age is often somewhat uncertain, and serial ultrasonography may be required. If cardiac activity is absent and had been detected previously during this pregnancy, fetal death is diagnosed. Alternatively, serial beta-hCG levels that decrease across ≤ 3 measurements are consistent with a failed pregnancy. Assessment is also done to determine the status of the abortion process as follows: Threatened abortion: Patients have uterine bleeding and it is too early to assess whether the fetus is alive and viable and the cervix is closed. Potentially, the pregnancy may continue without complications. Inevitable abortion: The cervix is dilated. If the cervix is dilated, the volume of bleeding should be evaluated because it is sometimes significant. Incomplete abortion: The products of conception are partially expelled. Complete abortion: The products of conception have passed and the cervix is closed .  Missed abortion is suspected if the uterus does not progressively enlarge or if quantitative beta-hCG is low for gestational age or does not double within 48 to 72 hours.\n【8】 Treatment of Spontaneous Abortion For threatened abortion, observation For inevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions, observation or surgical or medical uterine evacuation If the mother is Rh-negative, Rho(D) immune globulin Sometimes pain medication Emotional support For threatened abortion, treatment is observation, but health care practitioners may periodically evaluate the woman's symptoms or do ultrasonography. No evidence suggests that bed rest decreases risk of subsequent completed abortion. For inevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions, treatment is uterine evacuation or waiting for spontaneous passage of the products of conception. For patients managed expectantly, evacuation is done if excessive bleeding or infection occur or if the products of conception do not pass after about 2 to 4 weeks. At < 12 weeks, evacuation may be done with suction curettage Instrumental evacuation In the US, about half of pregnancies are unintended. About 40% of unintended pregnancies end in induced abortion; 90% of procedures are done during the 1st trimester.\n【9】 For medical evacuation, misoprostol (800 mcg intravaginally) is given; if there is no response to the first dose, one additional dose may be given at least 3 hours after first dose and typically within 7 days ,1 Treatment reference Spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation.\n【10】 A dose of mifepristone (200 mg orally) 24 hours before misoprostol administration should be considered if available. Evacuation is typically done with dilation and evacuation Instrumental evacuation at 12 to 23 weeks or medication induction Induced Abortion In the US, about half of pregnancies are unintended. About 40% of unintended pregnancies end in induced abortion; 90% of procedures are done during the 1st trimester.\n【11】 For dilation and evacuation, the later the gestational age, the greater the likelihood of placental bleeding, uterine perforation by long bones of the fetus, and difficulty dilating the cervix. These complications are reduced by preoperative use of osmotic cervical dilators (eg, laminaria) or by medical induction. If complete abortion is suspected, uterine evacuation is not done routinely. Uterine evacuation can be done if bleeding occurs and/or if other signs indicate that products of conception may be retained. Pain medications should be given, as appropriate.\n【12】 After a spontaneous abortion, parents may feel grief or guilt. They should be given emotional support and, in most cases of spontaneous abortions, reassured that their actions were not the cause. Formal counseling or support groups may be made available if appropriate.\n【13】Key Points Spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation; it probably occurs in up to 20% of pregnancies. Spontaneous abortion is often caused by chromosomal abnormalities or maternal reproductive tract abnormalities (eg, bicornuate uterus, fibroids), but etiology in an individual case is usually not confirmed. Confirm spontaneous abortion and determine pregnancy status with quantitative beta-hCG, ultrasonography, and pelvic examination; a dilated cervix means that abortion is inevitable. Treat with expectant management (observe for passage of products of conception) or surgical or medication (with misoprostol or sometimes mifepristone) uterine evacuation. Often, uterine evacuation is not needed for threatened and complete abortions.

They are extremely common in both healthy patients and patients with a heart disorder. VPB may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment is usually not required.\n【1】 Ventricular premature beats (VPBs), also called premature ventricular contractions (PVC), may occur erratically or at predictable intervals (eg, every 3rd [trigeminy] or 2nd [bigeminy] beat). VPBs may increase with stimulants (eg, anxiety, stress, alcohol, caffeine, sympathomimetic drugs), hypoxia, or electrolyte abnormalities. VPBs may be experienced as missed or skipped beats; the VPB itself is not sensed but rather the following augmented sinus beat. When VPBs are very frequent, particularly when they occur at every 2nd heart beat, mild hemodynamic symptoms are possible because the sinus rate has been effectively halved. Existing ejection murmurs may be accentuated because of increased cardiac filling and augmented contractility after the compensatory pause. Diagnosis of Ventricular Premature Beats ECG Diagnosis of ventricular premature beats is by electrocardiography (ECG) showing a wide QRS complex without a preceding P wave, typically followed by a fully compensatory pause. Prognosis for Ventricular Premature Beats VPBs are not significant in patients without a heart disorder, and no treatment is required beyond avoiding obvious triggers.

Screening tests Screening Tests Test results may help make a diagnosis in symptomatic patients (diagnostic testing) or identify occult disease in asymptomatic patients (screening).\n【2】 The rationale is that early diagnosis may decrease cancer mortality by detecting cancer at an early and curable stage. Early detection may allow for less radical therapy and reduce costs. Risks include false-positive results, which necessitate confirmatory tests (eg, biopsy, endoscopy) that can lead to anxiety, significant morbidity, and significant costs; and false-negative results, which may give a mistaken sense of security, causing patients to ignore subsequent symptoms. Screening for cancer should be done in the following circumstances: When distinct high-risk groups can be identified such as people who have a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, hematologic, colonic, or prostate cancers When a screening test is proved to have a benefit that exceeds risk and is recommended by competent health authorities Recommended screening schedules are constantly evolving based on ongoing studies , US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and American College of Physicians (ACP) Screening Procedures in Average-Risk* Asymptomatic People as Recommended by the American Cancer Society (ACS), US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and American College of Physicians (ACP)† . Current considerations regarding screening include the developing understanding that some findings (particularly in prostate and breast tissues) that appear cancerous may not actually progress to cancer within a person's remaining lifetime. For example, routine screening for blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men and routine screening mammograms in women may result in biopsy findings that a pathologist considers a cancer but that will not manifest clinically as a cancer or that manifest as a cancer that does not adversely affect survival. In such cases, people may receive cancer treatments (eg, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) that do not benefit them. The key issue in screening is how many people need to be screened to prevent one cancer death and how many people will receive unnecessary interventions or be given unnecessary concern. Because of these complexities, there is considerable controversy regarding who should be screened and at what ages for what cancers. Recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS), the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and various subspecialty organizations may differ. The American College of Physicians (ACP) offers recommendations based on a review of existing guidelines and the evidence they include for breast cancer and colon cancer screening.  Screening Procedures in Average-Risk* Asymptomatic People as Recommended by the American Cancer Society (ACS), US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and American College of Physicians (ACP)† Type of Cancer Procedure Frequency Breast cancer Mammography ACS: Recommended at the following ages: 40 to 44: Optional 45 to 54: Yearly ≥ 55: Every 2 years, continued as long as women are expected to live ≥ 10 years USPSTF: Every 2 years for women ages 50 to 74 ACP: Recommended at the following ages: 40 to 49: Optional, after discussing potential benefits and harms (but for most women, harms outweigh benefits) 50 to 74: Every 2 years ≥ 75 or women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less: Discontinue screening Cervical cancer Papanicolaou (Pap) test and/or human papillomavirus (HPV) test ACS: Recommended at the following ages: < 25: No screening tests 25–65: HPV test alone every 5 years or Pap test plus HPV test every 5 years or Pap test every 3 years > 65: No testing if previous testing was done and results were normal USPSTF: Recommended at the following ages: 21 to 29: Cervical cytology alone every 3 years 30 to 65: Cervical cytology alone every 3 years or human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone or combined with cytology (co-testing) every 5 years. > 65: No testing if previous testing was done and results were normal Prostate cancer Blood test for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) ACS: Because the benefit of screening is uncertain, patient and physician should discuss the potential harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening beginning at age 50 (age 45 for African Americans or those who have a father or brother who had prostate cancer before age 65) USPSTF: The patient and physician should discuss the potential harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening beginning at age 55, but recommends against screening at age 70 or older. Colorectal cancer Stool testing: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT), high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), or multi-target stool DNA test or Colonoscopy or Flexible sigmoidoscopy (with or without periodic FIT) or CT colonography ACS: Ages for screening: Begin at age 45 and continue until age 75; at ages 76-85, individualize recommendation (eg, based on general health, life expectancy, and patient preferences) ACS: Screening tests: FIT or gFOBT every year or Multi-target stool DNA test every 3 years, or Colonoscopy every 10 years, or CT colonography or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years USPSTF: Ages for screening: 45 to 75; individualize for ages 76 to 85.

For example, the ACS recommends that patients ages 55 to 74 at high risk for lung cancer, such as smokers with a 30 pack year history, who have smoked withing the last 15 years, and who are otherwise in good health, undergo periodic screening with low dose CT. The USPSTF recommends similar screening until age 80. † Examinations for cancers of the thyroid, oral cavity, skin, lymph nodes, testes, and ovaries should also be done during routine medical care.

Labor is the first stage of childbirth. During labor the muscles of your womb (uterus) squeeze again and again to push your baby out. These squeezes are called contractions.

Labor has 2 parts: Early labor Active labor During early labor: Your cervix begins to thin and opens up about 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 centimeters) Contractions come and go and get stronger and more evenly spaced The pain isn't too bad During active labor: Your cervix opens fully, about 4 inches (10 centimeters) and thins out completely Your baby drops (moves lower into your pelvis and gets ready to enter the birth canal) You start to feel like you need to push the baby out Pain is more intense Your water breaking is when the amniotic sac breaks and amniotic fluid comes out of your vagina. This may happen before labor starts or during labor. You can't deliver your baby Delivery Labor is the first stage of childbirth. During labor the muscles of your womb (uterus) squeeze over and over to open your cervix and push your baby out.\n【5】 How will I know when labor starts? The main signs of labor are: Contractions, which may feel like menstrual cramps that come and go at regular intervals Back pain Before contractions or back pain, early signs that labor is about to start include: Bloody show (a small amount of blood and mucus that comes out of your vagina at the start of labor) Your \"water breaking\" If your water breaks, you should call your doctor or midwife right away. Usually, labor starts within 24 hours. However, if it doesn’t start within several hours, your doctor or midwife may start your labor with medicines. If your water breaks more than 6 weeks before your due date, your doctor may give you medicine to stop labor. This lets the baby grow a little more before being born. When should I go to my hospital or birthing center? You should go to your hospital or birthing center when one of the following happens: Your water breaks Your contractions last 30 seconds or more and are less than 6 minutes apart A doctor or midwife will check to see whether you're actually in labor. Near their due date, some women have cramps that feel like labor but aren't. If you’re not in labor yet, you'll be sent home. If you're in labor, your doctor will: Check your vagina to see if your water has broken and, if it has, check the color of the fluid Touch your cervix to see how far it's open Feel your belly to see what position the baby is in Put an IV into an arm vein to help give you medicines and fluids during labor If you've delivered a baby before and it was fast (took less than 6 hours), you should let your doctor know as soon as you think labor has started. You'll likely deliver quickly because each labor is usually shorter than the one before. How do doctors check the baby during labor? During labor, the main thing that tells doctors how the baby's doing is: The baby's heart rate Doctors may check the baby’s heartbeat using: A stethoscope An ultrasound device placed on your belly An electronic fetal heart monitor placed inside your vagina to continuously record your baby’s heartbeat If your baby’s heartbeat is too fast or too slow, your baby may be having complications Introduction to Complications of Labor and Delivery Usually, labor and delivery occur without any problems. Serious problems are relatively rare, and most can be anticipated and treated effectively.\n【6】 Your doctors may do an ultrasound of the baby. The Vaginal Exam in Labor VIDEO How do doctors treat labor pain? The amount of pain during labor varies. Some women need more pain relief than others during labor. Taking childbirth classes during pregnancy and having a support person with you can help you feel more comfortable during labor and may lower your need for pain medicine. During pregnancy, you'll talk with your doctor or midwife about what kind of pain relief you want. Pain medicines during labor include: IV opioid pain medicines, such as morphine or fentanyl, which make you more comfortable but may cause your baby to breathe too slowly if you get the medicine too close to when the baby is delivered An epidural block, which is an injection of numbing medicine (local anesthetic) or pain medicine into your lower back to numb nerves around your spinal cord A nerve block, in which doctors inject numbing medicine inside your vagina to block pain signals from major nerves Local anesthesia, shots of numbing medicine around the outside of your vagina just before the baby comes out Natural childbirth uses relaxation and breathing techniques instead of medicine to control labor pains and lower your need for pain medicine. Some women doing natural childbirth don't use any pain medicine. To prepare, you and a support person usually take childbirth classes over several weeks to learn about labor and how to breathe and relax through it.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#4#4# During labor the muscles of your womb (uterus) squeeze over and over to open your cervix and push your baby out.与上文无联接并第一段重复", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 23:16:32"}

Renal artery occlusion is a complete blockage of blood flow through one or both of the main renal arteries or its branches. Stenosis and occlusion are usually due to thromboemboli, atherosclerosis, or fibromuscular dysplasia. Symptoms of acute occlusion include steady, aching flank pain, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hematuria. Acute kidney injury may develop. Chronic, progressive stenosis causes refractory hypertension and may lead to chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis is by imaging tests (eg, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography). Treatment of acute occlusion is with anticoagulation and sometimes fibrinolytics and surgical or catheter-based embolectomy, or a combination. Treatment of chronic, progressive stenosis includes angioplasty with stenting or surgical bypass. Renal hypoperfusion results in renovascular hypertension Renovascular Hypertension Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing.\n【1】 Etiology of Renal Artery Stenosis and Occlusion may be acute or chronic. Acute occlusion is usually unilateral. Chronic occlusion may be unilateral or bilateral. Acute renal artery occlusion The most common cause is thromboembolism. Emboli may originate in the heart ,due to atrial fibrillation Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm. Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope.\n【2】 Thrombosis may occur in a renal artery spontaneously or after trauma, surgery, angiography, or angioplasty. Other causes of acute occlusion include aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel).\n【3】 Rapid, total occlusion of large renal arteries for 30 to 60 minutes results in infarction. The infarct is typically wedge-shaped, radiating outward from the affected vessel. Chronic progressive renal artery stenosis About 90% of cases are due to atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.\n【4】 Almost 10% of cases are due to fibromuscular dysplasia Fibromuscular Dysplasia Fibromuscular dysplasia includes a heterogenous group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial changes, causing some degree of vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.\n【5】 Less than 1% of cases result from Takayasu arteritis Takayasu Arteritis Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the aorta, its branches, and pulmonary arteries. It occurs predominantly in young women. Etiology is unknown.\n【6】 Atherosclerosis develops primarily in patients > 50 (more often men) and usually affects the aortic orifice or proximal segment of the renal artery. Chronic progressive stenosis tends to become clinically evident after about 10 years of atherosclerosis, causing renal atrophy and chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【7】 FMD is pathologic thickening of the arterial wall, most often of the distal main renal artery or the intrarenal branches. The thickening tends to be irregular and can involve any layer (but most often the media). This disorder develops primarily in younger adults, particularly in women aged 20 to 50. It is more common among 1st-degree relatives of patients with FMD and among people with the ACE1 gene. Symptoms and Signs Manifestations depend on rapidity of onset, extent, whether unilateral or bilateral, and duration of renal hypoperfusion. Stenosis of one renal artery is often asymptomatic for a considerable time. Acute complete occlusion of one or both renal arteries causes steady and aching flank pain, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Gross hematuria, oliguria, or anuria may occur; hypertension is rare.\n【8】 If the cause was thromboembolic, features of thromboembolism at other sites (eg, blue toes, livedo reticularis, retinal lesions on funduscopic examination) also may be present. Chronic progressive stenosis causes hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.\n【9】 Physical examination may detect an abdominal bruit or signs of atherosclerosis. Symptoms and signs of chronic kidney disease Symptoms and Signs Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【10】 Diagnosis Clinical suspicion Imaging Diagnosis is suspected in patients with renal failure and who have Symptoms of acute renal artery occlusion Symptoms or signs of thromboembolism Hypertension that begins before age 30 or is refractory to treatment with > 3 antihypertensive drugs Blood and urine tests are done to confirm renal failure. Diagnosis is confirmed by imaging tests . Which tests are done depends on the patient’s renal function and other characteristics and on test availability.\n【11】 Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) requires the use of gadolinium contrast; in patients with severe chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【12】 When results of other tests are inconclusive or negative but clinical suspicion is strong, arteriography is necessary for definitive diagnosis. Arteriography may also be needed before invasive interventions.  When a thromboembolic disorder is suspected, electrocardiography (to detect atrial fibrillation) and hypercoagulability studies may be needed to identify treatable embolic sources. Transesophageal echocardiography is done to detect atheromatous lesions in the ascending and thoracic aorta and cardiac sources of thrombi or valvular vegetations. Blood and urine tests are nondiagnostic but are done to confirm renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and by hyperkalemia. Leukocytosis, gross or microscopic hematuria, and proteinuria may also be present. Treatment Restoration of vascular patency in acute occlusions and, if patients have refractory hypertension or potential for renal failure, in chronic stenosis Treatment depends on the cause. Acute renal artery occlusion A renal thromboembolic disorder may be treated with a combination of anticoagulation, fibrinolytics, and surgical or catheter-based embolectomy. Treatment within 3 hours of symptom onset is likely to improve renal function. However, complete recovery is unusual, and early and late mortality rates are high because of extrarenal embolization or underlying atherosclerotic heart disease.\n【13】 However, such rapid diagnosis and treatment are rare. All patients with a thromboembolic disorder require anticoagulation Treatment Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.\n【14】 Long-term anticoagulation with oral warfarin can be initiated simultaneously with heparin if no invasive intervention is planned. Non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) can be considered in appropriate patients. Anticoagulation should be continued for at least 6 to 12 months—indefinitely for patients with a recurrent thromboembolic disorder or a hypercoagulability disorder. Surgery to restore vascular patency has a higher mortality rate than fibrinolytic therapy and has no advantage in recovery of renal function. However, surgery, particularly if done within the first few hours, is preferred for patients with traumatic renal artery thrombosis. If patients with nontraumatic, severe renal failure do not recover function after 4 to 6 weeks of drug therapy, surgical revascularization (embolectomy) can be considered, but it helps only a few. If the cause is thromboemboli, the source should be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic progressive renal artery stenosis Treatment is indicated for patients who meet one or more of the following 5 criteria: Hypertension refractory to medical treatment with ≥ 3 drugs Deterioration of renal function despite optimal medical therapy A short duration of elevated blood pressure prior to the diagnosis of renovascular disease Recurrent flash pulmonary edema Pulmonary Edema Pulmonary edema is acute, severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous hypertension and alveolar flooding.\n【15】 Surgery is usually more effective than PTA for atherosclerotic occlusion; it cures or attenuates hypertension in 60 to 70% of patients. However, surgery is considered only if patients have complex anatomic lesions or if PTA is unsuccessful, particularly with repeated in-stent restenosis. PTA is preferred for patients with fibromuscular dysplasia; risk is minimal, success rate is high, and restenosis rate is low.\n【16】 However, the 2014 CORAL study showed that renal-artery stenting plus medical therapy had no significant benefit over medical therapy alone for preventing adverse cardiovascular or renal events ,1 Treatment reference Renal artery stenosis is a decrease in blood flow through one or both of the main renal arteries or their branches.\n【17】 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or renin inhibitors can be used in unilateral and, if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is monitored closely, in bilateral renal artery stenosis. These drugs can reduce GFR and increase serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.\n【18】 Key Points Renal artery stenosis or occlusion may be acute (usually due to thromboembolism) or chronic (usually due to atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia). Suspect acute occlusion if patients have steady, aching flank or abdominal pain, and sometimes fever, nausea and vomiting, and/or gross hematuria. Suspect chronic occlusion in patients who develop unexplained severe or early-onset hypertension. Confirm the diagnosis with vascular imaging. Restore vascular patency for patients who have acute occlusion and for selected patients (eg, with severe complications or refractory disease) who have chronic occlusion. Hypertension may be difficult to control until vascular patency is restored, but begin treatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or renin inhibitors; closely monitor GFR; and substitute calcium channel blockers or vasodilators if GFR decreases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 19:08:22"}

Symptoms of vaginitis are one of the most common gynecologic complaints. Pathophysiology of Vaginal Itching and Discharge Physiologic vaginal discharge occurs daily in many women, and volume may increase when estrogen levels are high. Estrogen levels are high in the following situations: A few days before ovulation During the few months before menarche and during pregnancy (when estrogen production increases) With use of drugs that contain estrogen or that increase estrogen production (eg, some fertility drugs) During the first 2 weeks of life (because maternal estrogens are transferred before birth) However, irritation, burning, and pruritus are never normal. Normally in women of reproductive age, Lactobacillus species is the predominant constituent of normal vaginal flora. Colonization by these bacteria keeps vaginal pH in the normal range (3.8 to 4.2), thereby preventing overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. Factors that predispose to overgrowth of bacterial vaginal pathogens include Use of antibiotics (which may decrease lactobacilli) Alkaline vaginal pH due to menstrual blood or semen Vaginal douching Pregnancy Diabetes mellitus An intravaginal foreign body (eg, a forgotten tampon or vaginal pessary) Etiology of Vaginal Itching and Discharge The most common causes of vaginal itching and discharge vary by patient age . Children In children, a common cause is nonspecific vulvovaginitis Overview of Vaginitis is infectious or noninfectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, sometimes with inflammation of the vulva.\n【2】 A common contributing factor in girls aged 2 to 6 years is poor perineal hygiene (eg, wiping from back to front after bowel movements, not washing their hands after bowel movements). Chemicals in bubble baths or soaps may cause inflammation and pruritus of the vulva, which often recur. Foreign bodies may cause nonspecific vaginitis, often with a scant bloody discharge.\n【3】 If abuse is suspected, measures to ensure the child’s safety must be taken, and a report must be made to state authorities. Women of reproductive age Vaginitis is also a common cause in women of reproductive age. The most common types are Bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow.\n【4】 albicans.\n【5】 These infections may also cause pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur.\n【6】 Genital herpes Genital Herpes Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by human herpesvirus 1 or 2. It causes ulcerative genital lesions.\n【7】 Vaginitis may also result from foreign bodies (eg, a forgotten tampon).\n【8】 Women who are incontinent or bedbound may develop chemical vulvitis. Women of all ages At any age, a fistula between the intestines and genital tract can predispose to vaginal or vulvar infection.\n【9】 Noninfectious vulvitis accounts for up to 30% of vulvovaginitis cases. It may result from hypersensitivity or irritant reactions to various agents, including hygiene sprays or perfumes, menstrual pads, laundry soaps, bleaches, fabric softeners, and sometimes spermicides, vaginal creams or lubricants, latex condoms, vaginal contraceptive rings, and diaphragms.  Evaluation of Vaginal Itching and Discharge History of present illness includes nature of symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, pain, discharge), duration, and intensity. If vaginal discharge is present, patients should be asked about the color and odor of the discharge and any exacerbating and remitting factors (particularly those related to menses and intercourse). They should also be asked about use of hygiene sprays or perfumes, spermicides, vaginal creams or lubricants, latex condoms, vaginal contraceptive rings, diaphragms, and pessaries. Review of systems should seek symptoms suggesting possible causes, including the following: Fever or chills and abdominal or suprapubic pain: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or cystitis Polyuria and polydipsia: New-onset diabetes Past medical history should note risk factors for the following: Candidal infection (eg, recent antibiotic use, diabetes, HIV infection, other immunosuppressive disorders) Fistulas (eg, Crohn disease, genitourinary or gastrointestinal cancer, pelvic or rectal surgery, lacerations during delivery) Sexually transmitted infections (eg, unprotected intercourse, multiple partners) If sexual abuse of a child is suspected, a structured forensic interview based on the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol can be used. It helps the child report information about the experienced event and improves the quality of information obtained. Physical examination Physical examination focuses on the pelvic examination. The external genitals are examined for erythema, excoriations, and swelling. A water-lubricated speculum is used to check the vaginal walls for erythema, discharge, and fistulas. The cervix is inspected for inflammation (eg, trichomoniasis) and discharge. Vaginal pH is measured, and samples of secretions are obtained for testing. A bimanual examination is done to identify cervical motion tenderness and adnexal or uterine tenderness (indicating PID). Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Fever or pelvic pain Bloody discharge in postmenopausal women Fecal discharge (suggesting a fistula, even if not seen) Trichomonal vaginitis in children (suggesting sexual abuse) Interpretation of findings Often, the history and physical examination help suggest a diagnosis , although there can be much overlap. In children, a vaginal discharge suggests a foreign body in the vagina. If no foreign body is present and children have trichomonal vaginitis, sexual abuse is likely. If they have unexplained vaginal discharge, cervicitis is infectious or noninfectious inflammation of the cervix. Findings may include vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, and cervical erythema and friability.\n【10】 Nonspecific vulvovaginitis is a diagnosis of exclusion. In women of reproductive age, discharge due to vaginitis must be distinguished from normal discharge: Normal vaginal discharge is commonly white or clear, odorless, and nonirritating. Bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow.\n【11】 A trichomonal infection Trichomoniasis is infection of the vagina or male genital tract with Trichomonas vaginalis.\n【12】 Candidal vaginitis Candidal Vaginitis Candidal vaginitis is vaginal infection with Candida species, usually C. albicans.\n【13】 Contact irritant or allergic reactions cause significant irritation and inflammation with comparatively minimal discharge. Discharge due to cervicitis is infectious or noninfectious inflammation of the cervix. Findings may include vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, and cervical erythema and friability.\n【14】 Abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, or cervical inflammation suggests PID. In women of all ages, vaginal pruritus and discharge may result from skin disorders ,eg, psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.\n【15】 Discharge that is watery, bloody, or both may result from vulvar cancer Vulvar Cancer Vulvar cancer is usually a squamous cell cancer, most often occurring in older women. It usually manifests as a palpable lesion. Diagnosis is by biopsy.\n【16】 The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Diagnosis is by biopsy.\n【17】 The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.\n【18】 In genitourinary syndrome of menopause, discharge is scant and may be watery and thin or thick and yellowish. Dyspareunia is common, and vaginal tissue appears thin and dry. Testing All patients with vaginal itching or discharge require the following in-office testing: pH Wet mount Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation Testing for gonorrhea Diagnosis Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n【19】 Vaginal secretions are tested using pH paper with 0.2 intervals from pH 4.0 to 6.0. Then, a cotton swab is used to place secretions on 2 slides; secretions are diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride on one slide (saline wet mount) and with 10% KOH on the other (KOH preparation). The KOH preparation is sniffed (whiff test) for a fishy odor, which results from amines produced in trichomonal vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis. The slide is examined using a microscope; KOH dissolves most cellular material except yeast hyphae, making identification easier. The saline wet mount is examined using a microscope as soon as possible to look for clue cells and motile trichomonads, which can become immotile and more difficult to recognize within minutes after slide preparation. If clinical criteria and in-office test results are inconclusive, the discharge may be cultured for fungi and trichomonads. Treatment of Vaginal Itching and Discharge Any specific cause of the itching or discharge is treated. Soaps and unnecessary topical preparations (eg, feminine hygiene sprays) should be avoided. If a soap is needed, a hypoallergenic soap should be used. Intermittent use of ice packs or warm sitz baths may reduce soreness and pruritus. Flushing the genital area with lukewarm water may also provide relief. If chronic vulvar inflammation is due to being bedbound or incontinent, better vulvar hygiene may help. Prepubertal girls should be taught good vulvar hygiene (eg, wiping front to back after bowel movements and voiding). Women should be advised not use vaginal douches. If symptoms are moderate or severe or do not respond to other measures, drugs may be needed. For pruritus, topical antifungals or low-potency corticosteroids (eg, 1% hydrocortisone twice a day as needed) can be applied to the vulva, if appropriate, but not into the vagina. Geriatrics Essentials In postmenopausal women, a marked decrease in estrogen causes the vaginal pH to become less acidic and causes vaginal thinning. Vaginal thinning is one symptom of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In this syndrome, vaginal inflammation often results in an abnormal discharge, which is scant and may be watery and thin or thick and yellowish. Dyspareunia is common, and vaginal tissue appears fragile and dry. Other common causes of decreased estrogen in older women include oophorectomy, pelvic radiation, and certain chemotherapy drugs. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is the preferred treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Poor hygiene (eg, in patients who are incontinent or bedbound) can lead to chronic vulvar inflammation due to chemical irritation by urine or feces. Bacterial vaginosis, candidal vaginitis, and trichomonal vaginitis may occur in postmenopausal women. After menopause, risk of cancer increases, and a bloody discharge is more likely to be due to cancer; thus, any vaginal discharge in postmenopausal women should be promptly evaluated. Key Points Causes of vaginal pruritus and itching vary depending on the patient’s age. For most patients, measure vaginal pH and obtain a sample of secretions for microscopic examination and testing; if needed, do testing for sexually transmitted infections. In postmenopausal women, promptly evaluate any vaginal discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#4#4#与上下文内容无联接", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-02 01:02:32"}

It requires less force than many other methods, can sometimes be done without analgesia, and is a popular first choice for anterior shoulder dislocation reduction. ,See also Overview of Shoulder Dislocation Reduction Techniques Overview of Shoulder Dislocation Reduction Techniques Many techniques are available to reduce a closed dislocation of the shoulder. No technique is universally successful, so operators should be familiar with several.\n【1】 Subluxation is partial separation.\n【2】 Scapular manipulation is a preferred technique because it is gentle, easy to do, and free of complications. Indications for Scapular Manipulation Anterior dislocation of the shoulder Reduction should be attempted soon (eg, within 30 minutes) after the diagnosis is made. Reduction should be attempted immediately if an associated neurovascular deficit or skin tenting (due to a displaced bone fracture, or, less commonly, a fracture-dislocation, with potential for skin penetration or breakdown) is present. If an orthopedic surgeon is unavailable, closed reduction can be attempted, ideally using minimal force; if reduction is unsuccessful, it may need to be done in the operating room under general anesthesia. Open dislocations require surgery, but closed reduction techniques and immobilization should be done as interim treatment if the orthopedic surgeon is unavailable and a neurovascular deficit is present.\n【3】 Other reasons to consult with an orthopedic surgeon prior to reduction include The joint is exposed (ie, an open dislocation) The patient is a child, in whom a physeal (growth plate) fracture is often present; however, if a neurovascular deficit is present, reduction should be done immediately if the orthopedic surgeon is unavailable. The dislocation is older than 7 to 10 days, due to an increased risk of damaging the axillary artery during the reduction, especially in older patients Complications of Scapular Manipulation Complications are uncommon with the scapular manipulation technique. Equipment for Scapular Manipulation Intra-articular anesthetic*: 20 mL of 1% lidocaine, 20-mL syringe, 2-inch 20-gauge needle, antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine), gauze pads Shoulder immobilizer or sling and swathe * Patients are offered analgesia; however, if the patient wishes, one reduction attempt without analgesia may be done. Additional Considerations for Scapular Manipulation Reduction attempts are more likely to succeed if patients are calm and can relax their muscles. Analgesia and sedation help patients relax, as may external distractions such as pleasant conversation.\n【4】 Regional anesthesia can be used (eg, ultrasound-guided interscalene nerve block) but has the disadvantage of limiting post-reduction neurologic examination. Relevant Anatomy for Scapular Manipulation In most anterior dislocations, the humeral head is trapped outside and against the anterior lip of the glenoid fossa. Reduction techniques must distract the humeral head away from the lip and then return the humeral head into the fossa. Deficits of the axillary nerve are the most frequent nerve deficits with anterior shoulder dislocations. They often resolve within several months, sometimes soon after the shoulder reduction. Axillary artery injury is rare with anterior shoulder dislocations and suggests possible concurrent brachial plexus injury (because the brachial plexus surrounds the artery). Positioning for Scapular Manipulation Position the patient sitting upright (easiest) or lying prone. If sitting upright, raise the head of the stretcher 90° and seat the patient sideways on the stretcher with the unaffected side leaning against the upright portion of the stretcher. Step-by-Step Description of Scapular Manipulation Neurovascular examination Do a pre-procedure neurovascular examination of the affected arm, and repeat the examination after each reduction attempt. Generally, testing motor function is more reliable than testing sensation, partly because cutaneous nerve territories may overlap. Assess the following: Distal pulses, capillary refill, cool extremity (axillary artery) Light touch sensation of the lateral aspect of the upper arm (axillary nerve), thenar and hypothenar eminences (median and ulnar nerves), and dorsum of the 1st web space (radial nerve) Shoulder abduction against resistance, while feeling the deltoid muscle for contraction (axillary nerve): However, if this test worsens the patient's pain, omit it until after the shoulder has been reduced. Thumb-index finger apposition (\"OK\" gesture) and finger flexion against resistance (median nerve) Finger abduction against resistance (ulnar nerve) Wrist and finger extension against resistance (radial nerve) Intra-articular analgesia If a cooperative patient chooses to try reduction without analgesia, only one such attempt should be made. To give intra-articular analgesia: The needle insertion site is about 2 cm inferior to the lateral edge of the acromion process (into the depression created by the absence of the humeral head). Swab the area with antiseptic solution, and allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute. Optional: Place a skin wheal of local anesthetic (≤ 1 mL) at the site. Insert the intra-articular needle perpendicular to the skin, apply back pressure on the syringe plunger, and advance the needle medially and slightly inferiorly about 2 cm. If any blood is aspirated from the joint, hold the needle hub motionless, switch to an empty syringe, aspirate all of the blood, and re-attach the anesthetic syringe. Inject 10 to 20 mL of anesthetic solution (eg, 1% lidocaine). Wait for analgesia to occur (up to 15 to 20 minutes) before proceeding. Reduce the shoulder—Scapular manipulation If the patient is seated upright, have an assistant face the patient, use one hand to apply gentle traction to the affected arm while holding it in 90° of flexion, and use the assistant's other arm (outstretched and with hand placed on the clavicle of the affected side) to provide a counterforce. If the patient is prone, the affected arm hangs over the side of the stretcher. Gentle downward traction can be applied manually by an assistant or by attaching weights. Regardless of patient position, slight external rotation of the affected arm may facilitate reduction. Manipulate the scapula: Regardless of patient position, use the fingers of one hand to stabilize the superior aspect (base) of the scapula while using both of your thumbs to gently and gradually apply a medial and dorsal force to the inferior tip of the scapula. Attempt to slightly displace the tip dorsally while pushing it toward the spine. Reduction usually occurs within several minutes and may be subtle or even go unnoticed. Optional: \"Best-of-both\" technique The \"best-of-both\" (BOB) technique combines the scapular manipulation and the external rotation techniques. Raise the head of the stretcher 90° and seat the patient sideways on the stretcher with the unaffected side leaning against the head of the stretcher. Apply downward traction and gently rotate the arm internally or externally as needed. Have an assistant manipulate the scapula as described above. How To Reduce Anterior Shoulder Dislocations: Scapular Manipulation VIDEO Aftercare for Scapular Manipulation Successful reduction is preliminarily confirmed by restoration of a normal round shoulder contour, by decreased pain, and by the patient's renewed ability to reach across the chest and place the palm of the hand upon the opposite shoulder. Immobilize the shoulder with a sling and swathe or with a shoulder immobilizer. Because the joint can spontaneously dislocate after successful reduction, do not delay immobilizing the joint. Do a post-procedure neurovascular examination. A neurovascular deficit warrants immediate orthopedic evaluation. Do post-procedure x-rays to confirm proper reduction and identify any coexisting fractures. Arrange orthopedic follow-up. Warnings and Common Errors for Scapular Manipulation Apparent shoulder dislocation in a child is often a fracture involving the growth plate, which tends to fracture before the joint is disrupted. Tips and Tricks for Scapular Manipulation The lateral border of the scapula is located more laterally than one might expect. The scapular manipulation technique may be more difficult in larger patients having obscure anatomic landmarks. Operators not familiar with this technique may prefer the prone patient position because of the ease of identifying the scapular landmarks. In patients who return with increased pain within 48 hours after a reduction, hemarthrosis is likely (unless the shoulder has again dislocated).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:33:08"}

Natural unprocessed cranberry juice contains anthocyanidins (eg, proanthocyanidin), which prevent Escherichia coli from attaching to the urinary tract wall. Some people take cranberry juice to reduce fever and treat certain cancers; however, there is no scientific proof that it is effective for these uses. Evidence The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that it authorized (allowed) qualified health claims for a reduced risk of recurrent UTIs in healthy women . In 1966, the first clinical trial, uncontrolled, evaluating the positive effects of cranberry juice in preventing UTIs was published ,1 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【2】 Since that time numerous trials have been performed evaluating different populations, severity of medical conditions, dosages, time, and form of supplement in juice or extract capsule/tablet. The majority of evidence suggests that cranberry juice or extract can have a small, yet significant effect on preventing the recurrence of UTIs over 12 months, but that supplementation cannot treat UTIs ,2 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【3】 However, a 2012 Cochrane review of 24 studies (4473 participants) placed some doubt on the effectiveness of the supplement, indicating a small trend toward fewer UTIs with supplementation, but that the finding was not statistically significant ,3 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【4】 A 2017 meta-analysis of 28 studies (4947 participants) found that UTIs are decreased significantly by 33% ,4 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【5】 A different meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in women at risk for UTIs also found that cranberry reduced UTI risk by 26% ,5 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【6】 Standardization of cranberry products and specifying proanthocyanidin (PAC) content may help to clarify results and resolve the discrepancy. Physiologic differences in the urinary tract and proper hygiene of female individuals studied also could contribute to the variability in response. Due to concern for antibiotic resistance, the American Urological Association 2019 guidelines in women with recurrent UTIs has stated that clinicians may offer cranberry prophylaxis, although this is a Grade C evidence level recommendation ,6 References Cranberries are fruit that can be consumed whole or made into food products such as jellies and juices.\n【7】 Adverse Effects No adverse effects are known. However, because most cranberry juice is highly sweetened to offset its tart taste, people with diabetes should not consume cranberry juice unless it is artificially sweetened. Because cranberry increases urinary acidity, it may promote stone formation in patients with uric acid kidney stones. Drug Interactions Cranberry products may increase the effects of warfarin.

Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness. Hair loss is often of great concern to people for cosmetic reasons, but it can also be a sign of a bodywide (systemic) disorder.\n【1】 Each cycle consists of A long growing phase (anagen) lasting 2 to 6 years A brief transitional phase (catagen) lasting 3 weeks A short resting phase (telogen) lasting 2 to 3 months At the end of the resting phase, the hair falls out (exogen), and the cycle begins again as a new hair starts growing in the follicle. Normally, about 50 to 100 scalp hairs reach the end of resting phase each day and fall out. Disorders of the growth cycle that lead to hair loss include Anagen effluvium: Disruption of the growing phase that causes loss of anagen hairs Telogen effluvium: Many more than 100 hairs a day go into resting phase and then fall out Doctors sometimes classify hair loss as focal (confined to one part of the scalp) or diffuse (widespread). Hair loss may also be classified by whether or not scarring exists. Causes of Alopecia The most common cause of hair loss is Male-pattern and female-pattern baldness ,androgenetic alopecia Androgenetic alopecia Hair loss, also called alopecia, can occur on any part of the body. Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness.\n【2】 Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness.\n【3】 Symptoms of tinea capitis include a dry patch of scale, a patch of hair loss, or both on the scalp.\n【4】 Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness.\n【5】 Causes are multifactorial. Less common causes include primary hair shaft abnormalities (that is, the abnormality originates in the hair shaft), lichen planopilaris (lichen planus of the scalp) and frontal fibrosing alopecia, , and rare skin conditions. About 50 to 100 scalp hairs normally fall out each day. Androgenetic alopecia This form of alopecia increases with age and affects over 70% of men (male-pattern hair loss) and 57% of women (female-pattern hair loss) over the age of 80. The hormone dihydrotestosterone plays a major role, along with heredity. The hair loss can begin at any age during or after puberty, even during adolescence . Androgenetic alopecia is more common among White people than among Asian and Black people. In men, hair loss usually begins at the temples or on the top of the head toward the back. Some men lose only some hair and have only a receding hairline or a small bald spot in the back. Other men, especially when hair loss begins at a young age, lose all of the hair on the top of the head but retain hair on the sides and back of the scalp. This pattern is called male-pattern hair loss. In women, hair loss occurs on the top of the head and is usually a thinning of the hair rather than a complete loss of hair. The hairline typically stays intact. This pattern is called female-pattern hair loss. Losing Hair In men, hair is usually first lost at the temples or on the top of the head toward the back. In women, hair is usually first lost on the top of the head. Typically, the hair thins rather than is completely lost, and the hairline stays intact. Alopecia areata In alopecia areata Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder.\n【6】 More extensive loss of scalp and body hair can also occur. This disorder is believed to be caused by a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues (called an autoimmune reaction). Autoimmune Disorders VIDEO Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is the most common cause of scarring alopecia in Black women. The combination of damage to the scalp, possibly resulting from hot combs, chemical relaxers, or hair weaves, and a genetic predisposition to follicular damage due to abnormal hair follicles leads to progressive hair loss and scarring on the top and back of the scalp. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus In cutaneous lupus erythematosus, areas of hair may be lost. Hair loss may be permanent if the hair follicle is completely destroyed. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus can affect people who have or do not have systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls.\n【7】 Systemic lupus erythematosus affects various organs throughout the body and can cause widespread nonscarring hair loss. In cutaneous lupus erythematosus, hair tends to be lost in patches and scarring or permanent hair loss can occur. Hormone imbalance If women have excessive amounts of male hormones or are more sensitive to the effects of male hormones (for example, genetically), they can develop scalp hair loss, acne is a common skin condition causing pimples and other abnormalities on the face and upper torso.\n【8】 Women who have PCOS usually have excess face and body hair, and some have loss of scalp hair (female-pattern baldness). Virilization occurs when androgen levels are high enough to cause not only scalp hair loss but also additional signs and symptoms such as deepening of the voice, decrease in the size of the breasts, increased muscle bulk, irregular menstrual periods, an enlarged clitoris (the smaller female organ that corresponds to the penis), and increased libido. Rarely, an ovarian or adrenal tumor can secrete male hormones, causing virilization. Virilization may also develop in a female who is taking anabolic steroids Anabolic Steroids Anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone that are used to increase muscle size.\n【9】 Drugs Male-pattern or female-pattern baldness can occur when anabolic steroids are used. Chemotherapy drugs typically cause disruption of the growing phase that causes loss of anagen hairs (anagen effluvium). Other prescription drugs (for example, blood thinners and drugs used to treat high blood pressure, acne, thyroid disorders, or seizures) typically cause hair loss by inducing a telogen effluvium. Nutritional disorders Nutritional disorders are a less common cause of hair loss. Symptoms vary according to the specific nutritional disorder: Excess vitamin A Vitamin A Excess Vitamin A excess (toxicity) can be sudden (acute), usually due to accidental ingestion by children, or chronic.\n【10】 Hair typically falls out a few months after the stress. This type of hair loss tends not to be permanent. Psychologic stresses These stresses can lead to the habitual twisting, teasing, or pulling out of normal hair ,trichotillomania Hair-Pulling Disorder (Trichotillomania) In hair-pulling disorder, people repeatedly pull their hair out, resulting in hair loss.\n【11】 The habit is most common among children but may occur in adults. The hair pulling may not be noticed for a long time, confusing doctors and parents, who may mistakenly think that a disorder such as alopecia areata Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder.\n【12】 Severe, prolonged psychologic stress also can cause hair to fall out on its own (telogen effluvium). This hair loss, however, involves major, chronic stress and not the routine stresses of daily life. Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) Scalp ringworm Scalp Ringworm (Tinea Capitis) Scalp ringworm is a dermatophyte (fungal) infection of the scalp. Symptoms of tinea capitis include a dry patch of scale, a patch of hair loss, or both on the scalp.\n【13】 The infection begins as a dry, scaly patch that gradually enlarges. Hairs may eventually break off, usually flush with the surface of the scalp, looking like black dots. Sometimes the hair breaks off above the surface of the scalp, leaving short stubs. Hair loss may be permanent, especially if the infection is left untreated. Traction alopecia This disorder is hair loss caused by tight braids, rollers, or ponytails that pull constantly on hair. Hair loss most often occurs at the hairline of the forehead and temples. Evaluation of Alopecia The following information can help people decide whether a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation. Warning signs The following are of particular concern: Signs of a bodywide disorder In women, development of masculine characteristics (virilization), such as a deepened voice, hair in locations more typical of male hair growth ,hirsutism Hairiness In men, the amount of body hair varies greatly , but very few men are concerned enough about excess hair to see a doctor.\n【14】 Women who have developed masculine characteristics should call their doctor to discuss how soon they should be seen. Other people should see a doctor when possible, but an appointment is not urgent unless other symptoms develop. What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history and then do a physical examination. What doctors find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the hair loss and the tests that may need to be done. Doctors ask about the hair loss: Whether hair loss began gradually or suddenly How long it has been present Whether hair loss is increasing Whether hair is being lost over the entire head or in one specific area They note other symptoms such as itching and scaling. They ask about hair care, including whether braids, rollers, and hair dryers are used and whether the hair is routinely pulled or twisted. Doctors ask whether the person has been recently exposed to drugs, toxins, or radiation or has experienced significant stress (such as that resulting from surgery, chronic illness, fever, or psychologic stress). They ask about other characteristics that may suggest a cause, including dramatic weight loss, dietary practices (including various restrictive diets), and obsessive-compulsive behavior Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions are recurring, persistent, unwanted, anxiety-provoking, intrusive ideas, images, or urges.\n【15】 Doctors review the person's current and recent drug use and family history of hair loss. During the physical examination, doctors focus on the scalp, noting the distribution of hair loss, the presence and characteristics of any skin abnormalities, and the presence of any scarring. They measure the width of the central part of the scalp at several points ( Home.see figure Losing Hair Losing Hair ) and look at hairs under a microscope for abnormalities of the hair shafts. Doctors evaluate hair loss elsewhere on the body (such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, arms, and legs). They look for rashes that may be associated with certain types of alopecia and for signs of virilization in women such as a deepened voice, hirsutism, an enlarged clitoris, and acne. They also examine the thyroid gland.  Testing is usually unnecessary if a cause is identified based on the doctor's examination. For example, male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss generally requires no testing. However, if hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history of hair loss, the doctor may question him about use of anabolic steroids Anabolic Steroids Anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone that are used to increase muscle size.\n【16】 Women who have significant hair loss and who have developed masculine characteristics may be asked whether they use prescription or illegal drugs and may undergo blood tests to measure levels of the hormones testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). If the doctor's examination detects signs of other hormonal abnormalities or other serious illness, blood tests to identify those disorders may be needed (for example, tests to measure luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] may be done to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]). The pull test helps doctors evaluate hair loss. Doctors gently pull on a bunch of hairs (about 40) on at least 3 different areas of the scalp. Doctors then count the number of hairs that come out with each pull and examine them under a microscope to determine their phase of growth. If more than 4 to 6 hairs in the telogen phase come out with each pull, the pull test is positive, and the person most likely has telogen effluvium. During the pluck test, doctors abruptly pull out about 50 individual hairs (“by the roots”). Doctors examine the roots and shafts of the plucked hairs under a microscope to assess the hair shaft and determine the phase of growth. These results help doctors tell whether the person has a telogen effluvium, a primary hair shaft abnormality, or some other problem. Daily hair counts can be done to quantify hair loss when the pull test is negative and it is not clear whether hair loss is actually excessive. Hairs lost while combing first thing in the morning or during shampooing are collected in clear plastic bags daily for 14 days. The number of hairs in each bag is then recorded. Loss of more than 100 hairs a day is abnormal except after shampooing, when up to 250 hairs may be lost. Hairs may be brought in by the person for examination under a microscope. A biopsy Doctors can identify many skin disorders simply by looking at the skin. A full skin examination includes examination of the scalp, nails, and mucous membranes.\n【17】 A biopsy helps determine whether hair follicles are normal and can help differentiate alopecia that causes scarring (by destroying the hair follicle) from alopecia that does not. If the hair follicles are abnormal, the biopsy may indicate possible causes. Treatment of Alopecia Treatment of specific causes Sometimes hair replacement methods Specific causes of hair loss are treated when possible: Drugs that are causing hair loss are switched or stopped. Hormonal disorders can be treated with drugs or surgery, depending on the cause. Iron or zinc supplements can be given if these minerals are deficient . Vitamin A intake can be decreased in people who have alopecia caused by vitamin A excess. Alopecia areata Treatment Alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder.\n【18】 Other topical and oral drugs may be given. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, and frontal fibrosing alopecia can usually be treated with corticosteroids that are injected into the skin or applied topically or with other topical or oral drugs. Traction alopecia is treated by eliminating physical traction or stress to the scalp. Scalp ringworm Scalp Ringworm (Tinea Capitis) Scalp ringworm is a dermatophyte (fungal) infection of the scalp. Symptoms of tinea capitis include a dry patch of scale, a patch of hair loss, or both on the scalp.\n【19】 Trichotillomania Hair-Pulling Disorder (Trichotillomania) In hair-pulling disorder, people repeatedly pull their hair out, resulting in hair loss.\n【20】 Hair loss due to physical stresses such as recent weight loss, surgery, a severe illness with a high fever, or delivery of a baby (telogen effluvium) is not typically treated because it tends to resolve on its own. Applying minoxidil to the scalp may be helpful for some people. Hair replacement methods can be tried if hair does not regrow on its own, including Drugs to prevent further hair loss or grow new hair transplantation Wigs Drugs Male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss can sometimes be treated effectively with drugs. Minoxidil may prevent further hair loss and increase hair growth. When applied directly to the scalp twice a day, topical minoxidil is effective for male- and female-pattern hair loss. Hair regrowth can take 8 to 12 months and is noticeable in only about 30 to 40% of people. The most common side effects are skin irritation, such as itching and rash. An increase in hair on the face can also occur. Minoxidil can also be taken by mouth. Finasteride works by blocking the effects of male hormones on the hair follicles and is taken by mouth daily. Finasteride is occasionally used in women who are postmenopausal. It should never be used by pregnant women because it causes birth defects in animals, so whether it is safe in pregnancy is unknown. In men, its effectiveness at stopping hair loss and stimulating hair growth is usually evident within 6 to 8 months of treatment and increases over time but can vary from person to person. Finasteride can decrease libido, increase breast size, contribute to erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.\n【21】 Finasteride can also decrease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Men should discuss how finasteride can affect prostate cancer screening Prostate cancer begins in a small area of the prostate gland, an organ found only in males. The risk of prostate cancer increases as men age.\n【22】 The most important effect of minoxidil or finasteride may be to prevent further hair loss. The effects last only as long as the drugs are taken.\n【23】 Hair transplantation is a more permanent solution. In this procedure, hair follicles are removed from one part of the scalp and transplanted to the bald area. In this technique, only one or two hairs are transplanted at a time. Another surgical option involves removing some bald parts of the scalp skin and stretching the parts that have hair over a wider area. Wigs often offer the best treatment for temporary hair loss (for example, that caused by chemotherapy). People undergoing chemotherapy should consult a wig maker even before therapy begins so that an appropriate wig can be ready when needed. When hair regrows, it may be different in color and texture from the original hair. Other options Laser light therapy is an alternate or additional treatment for male- and female-pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) that has been shown to promote hair growth. Over-the-counter devices are available, or doctors can do laser light therapy in the office.\n【24】TooltipReadMore (small blood cells that help blood clot). Platelets are thought to contain substances that trigger hair growth. In this treatment, called platelet-rich plasma therapy or PRP therapy, blood is taken from a person and processed to remove the platelet-rich plasma. The platelet-rich plasma is then injected into bald patches and may stimulate the growth of new hair. Some people conceal thinning hair by using camouflage powders, hair loss concealers (products that contain fibers that bind to existing hair), and a form of tattooing called scalp micropigmentation. Key Points Male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss is the most common type of hair loss. Doctors look for an underlying disorder in women with signs of virilization. Microscopic hair examination or scalp biopsy may be required to determine the reason for the hair loss. Doctors treat the specific cause of hair loss when possible; otherwise, treatments for male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss include drugs, hair replacement, laser light therapy, and injections of platelet-rich plasma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 22:26:54"}

Initial infection may cause nonspecific febrile illness. Risk of subsequent manifestations—related to immunodeficiency—is proportional to the level of CD4+ lymphocyte depletion. HIV can directly damage the brain, gonads, kidneys, and heart, causing cognitive impairment, hypogonadism, renal insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy. Manifestations range from asymptomatic carriage to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is defined by the presence of an AIDS-defining illness (serious opportunistic infections or cancers) or a CD4 count of < 200/mcL. HIV infection can be diagnosed by antibody, nucleic acid (HIV RNA), or antigen (p24) testing. Screening should be routinely offered to all adults and adolescents. Treatment aims to suppress HIV replication by using combinations of ≥ 2 drugs that inhibit HIV enzymes; treatment can restore immune function in most patients if suppression of replication is sustained.  Infection in Infants and Children Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Infants and Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2).\n【1】 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus. Retroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses defined by their mechanism of replication via reverse transcription to produce DNA copies that integrate into the host cell's genome. There are 2 HIV types, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 causes most HIV infections worldwide, but HIV-2 causes a substantial proportion of infections in parts of West Africa. In some areas of West Africa, both viruses are prevalent and may coinfect patients. HIV-2 appears to be less virulent than HIV-1. HIV-1 originated in Central Africa in the first half of the 20th century, when a closely related chimpanzee virus first infected humans. Epidemic global spread began in the late 1970s, and AIDS was recognized in 1981. Epidemiology of HIV Infection The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates  that in 2021, approximately 38 million people worldwide, including 1.7 million children (< 15 years), were living with HIV; 54% were women and girls. Approximately 25.6 million (about 67%) of people living with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. In many sub-Saharan African countries, incidence of HIV infection is declining markedly from the very high rates of the 1990s; nevertheless, important gaps remain to meet the World Health Organization's Fast-Track strategy to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. In 2021, approximately 1.5 million people were newly infected with HIV, of whom approximately 860,000 (57%) were in sub-Saharan Africa. Among people living with HIV in 2021, approximately 85% knew their HIV status and 75% were accessing treatment. In 2021, approximately 650,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1.9 million in 2004 and 1.4 million in 2010. However, through international efforts, as of 2021, an estimated 28.7 million people living with HIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy (up from 7.8 million in 2010), dramatically reducing deaths and transmission in many countries . In the United States, at the end of 2019, an estimated 1,189,700 people ≥ 13 years were living with HIV, including an estimated 158,500 (13%) people whose infections had not been diagnosed. In 2020, over 30,600 people received an HIV diagnosis in the United States, and 20,758 cases were due to male-to-male sexual contact; data for 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance activities.  HIV has spread in epidemiologically distinct patterns: Heterosexual intercourse (affecting men and women about equally) Men who have sex with men Contact with infected blood (eg, through sharing needles; through transfusions before effective screening of donors) Most HIV infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact, but risk factors vary according to region. For instance, transmission among men who have sex with men is usually the most common way infection occurs in high-resource countries, but people who inject drugs are disproportionally affected in Southern Asia. In areas where heterosexual transmission is dominant, HIV infection follows routes of trade, transportation, and economic migration to cities and spreads secondarily to rural areas. In Africa, particularly southern Africa, the HIV epidemic has killed tens of millions of young adults, creating millions of orphans. Factors associated with increased rates of spread include Poverty and sexual violence Lack of education Health care systems that do not provide access to HIV testing and antiretroviral drugs Stigmatization, criminalization, and discrimination against people with HIV Many opportunistic infections that complicate HIV are reactivations of latent infections. Thus, epidemiologic factors that determine the prevalence of latent infections also influence risk of specific opportunistic infections. In many countries with high rates of HIV infection, prevalence of latent tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【2】 Dramatic increases in reactivated tuberculosis and toxoplasmic encephalitis have followed the epidemic of HIV-induced immunosuppression in these countries. Similarly in the United States, incidence of coccidioidomycosis is a pulmonary or hematogenously spread disseminated disease caused by the fungi Coccidioides immitis and C.\n【3】 Human herpesvirus 8 infection, which causes Kaposi sarcoma Kaposi Sarcoma Kaposi sarcoma is a multicentric vascular tumor caused by herpesvirus type 8.\n【4】 Thus, in the United States, > 90% of AIDS patients who have developed Kaposi sarcoma are men who have sex with men. Transmission of HIV Infection Transmission of HIV requires contact with body fluids—specifically blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, or exudates from wounds or skin and mucosal lesions—that contain free HIV virions or infected cells. Transmission is more likely with the high levels of virions that are typical during primary infection, even when such infections are asymptomatic. Transmission by saliva or droplets produced by coughing or sneezing, although conceivable, is extremely unlikely. HIV is not transmitted by contact that does not involve exchange of body fluids. Transmission is usually Sexual: Direct transmission through sexual intercourse Needle- or instrument-related: Sharing of blood-contaminated needles or exposure to contaminated instruments Transfusion- or transplant-related Vertical: Transmission from an infected mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or through breast milk Sexual transmission of HIV Sexual practices such as fellatio (oral sex done to a male) and cunnilingus (oral sex done to a female) appear to be relatively low risk but not absolutely safe . Risk does not increase significantly if semen or vaginal secretions are swallowed. However, open sores in the mouth may increase risk. The sexual practices with the highest risks are those that cause mucosal trauma, typically intercourse. Anal-receptive intercourse poses the highest risk. Mucous membrane inflammation facilitates HIV transmission; sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n【5】 It causes ulcerative genital lesions.\n【6】 Other practices that cause mucosal trauma include fisting (inserting most or all of the hand into the rectum or vagina) and using sexual toys. When used during intercourse with a partner infected with HIV and/or with multiple concurrent sex partners, these practices increase the risk of HIV transmission. Risk of transmission is increased in the early and advanced stages of HIV infection when HIV concentrations in plasma and genital fluids are higher.\n【7】 Circumcision seems to reduce the risk of males acquiring HIV infection by about 50%, by removing the penile mucosa (underside of foreskin), which is more susceptible to HIV infection than the keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium that covers the rest of the penis.  HIV Transmission Risk for Several Sexual Activities Risk Activity None (unless sores are present) Dry kissing Body-to-body rubbing and massage Using unshared inserted sexual devices (eg, sex toys) Genital stimulation by a partner but no contact with semen or vaginal fluids Bathing or showering together Contact with feces or urine if skin is intact Theoretical (extremely low risk unless sores are present) Wet kissing Fellatio (oral sex done to a male) without ejaculation or if a condom is used Cunnilingus (oral sex done to a female) if a barrier is used Oral-anal contact Digital vaginal or anal penetration, with or without a glove Use of shared but disinfected inserted sexual devices Low Fellatio without a condom and with ejaculation Cunnilingus if no barrier is used Vaginal or anal intercourse if a condom is used correctly Use of shared but not disinfected inserted sexual devices High Vaginal or anal intercourse with or without ejaculation if a condom is not used or is not used correctly Needle- and instrument-related transmission Risk of HIV transmission after skin penetration with a medical instrument contaminated with infected blood is on average about 1/300 without postexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis. Immediate prophylaxis probably reduces risk to < 1/1500. Risk appears to be higher if the wound is deep or if blood is inoculated (eg, with a contaminated hollow-bore needle). Risk is also increased with hollow-bore needles and with punctures of arteries or veins compared with solid needles or other penetrating objects coated with blood because larger volumes of blood may be transferred. Thus, sharing needles that have entered the veins of other people is a very high risk activity. Risk of transmission from infected health care practitioners who take appropriate precautions is unclear but appears minimal. In the 1980s, one dentist transmitted HIV to ≥ 6 of his patients by unknown means. However, extensive investigations of patients cared for by other physicians infected with HIV, including surgeons, have uncovered few other cases.\n【8】 Transmission rates can be reduced significantly by treating mothers with HIV infection with antiretroviral drugs while they are pregnant, in labor, and breastfeeding. Cesarean delivery and treatment of the infant for several weeks after birth also reduce the risk. HIV is excreted in breast milk.\n【9】 In high-resource countries, women with HIV infection are advised not to breastfeed . However, in resource-limited settings, breastfeeding is associated with reduced infant morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition and infectious diseases. For women living with HIV in low-resource settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends antiretroviral treatment and adherence support combined with breastfeeding for at least 12 months . Because many women with HIV infection and their infants are treated or take prophylactic antiretroviral medications during pregnancy, the incidence of AIDS in children is decreasing in many countries  Infection in Infants and Children Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in Infants and Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2).\n【10】 Transfusion- and transplant-related transmission Screening of blood donors with tests for both antibody to HIV and HIV RNA has minimized risk of transmission via transfusion. Current risk of transmitting HIV via blood transfusion is estimated to be < 1/2,000,000 per unit transfused in the United States. However, in many high HIV burden countries, where blood and blood products are not screened for HIV, the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection remains high. Rarely, HIV has been transmitted via transplantation of organs from HIV-seropositive donors. Infection has developed in recipients of kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, bone, and skin—all of which contain blood—but screening for HIV greatly reduces risk of transmission. HIV transmission is even more unlikely from transplantation of cornea, ethanol-treated and lyophilized bone, fresh-frozen bone without marrow, lyophilized tendon or fascia, or lyophilized and irradiated dura mater. HIV transmission is possible via artificial insemination using sperm from HIV-positive donors. Some cases of infection occurred in the early 1980s, before safeguards were introduced. In the United States, sperm washing is considered an effective method of reducing the risk of partner insemination from a known HIV-positive sperm donor.\n【11】 Pathophysiology of HIV Infection HIV attaches to and penetrates host T cells via CD4+ molecules and chemokine receptors . After attachment, HIV RNA and several HIV-encoded enzymes are released into the host cell. Viral replication requires that reverse transcriptase (an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) copy HIV RNA, producing proviral DNA; this copying mechanism is prone to errors, resulting in frequent mutations and thus new HIV genotypes. These mutations facilitate the generation of HIV that can resist control by the host’s immune system and by antiretroviral drugs. Proviral DNA enters the host cell’s nucleus and is integrated into the host DNA in a process that involves integrase, another HIV enzyme. With each cell division, the integrated proviral DNA is duplicated along with the host DNA. Subsequently, the proviral HIV DNA can be transcribed to HIV RNA and translated to HIV proteins, such as the envelope glycoproteins 41 and 120. These HIV proteins are assembled into HIV virions at the host cell inner membrane and budded from the cell surface within an envelop of modified human cell membrane. Each host cell may produce thousands of virions. After budding, protease, another HIV enzyme, cleaves viral proteins, converting the immature virion into a mature, infectious virion. Simplified HIV life cycle HIV attaches to and penetrates host T cells, then releases HIV RNA and enzymes into the host cell. HIV reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA as proviral DNA. Proviral DNA enters the host cell’s nucleus, and HIV integrase facilitates the proviral DNA’s integration into the host’s DNA. The host cell then produces HIV RNA and HIV proteins. HIV proteins are assembled into HIV virions and budded from the cell surface. HIV protease cleaves viral proteins, converting the immature virion to a mature, infectious virus. Infected CD4+ lymphocytes produce > 98% of plasma HIV virions. A subset of infected CD4+ lymphocytes constitutes a reservoir of HIV that can reactivate (eg, if antiviral treatment is stopped). In moderate to heavy HIV infection, about 108 to 109 virions are created and removed daily. The HIV average half-life in plasma is about 36 hours, about 24 hours intracellularly, and about 6 hours as an extracellular virus. Every day roughly 30% of the total HIV burden in an infected individual is turned over.\n【12】 Hence, AIDS results from a continuous and consistent replication of HIV, leading to the virus and immune-mediated killing of CD4 lymphocytes. Further, the high volume of HIV replication and high frequency of transcription errors by HIV reverse transcriptase result in many mutations, increasing the chance of producing strains resistant to host immunity and drugs. Infection with another type of retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), is less common but can also cause serious disease. Immune system Two main consequences of HIV infection are Damage to the immune system, specifically depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes Immune activation CD4+ lymphocytes are involved in cell-mediated and, to a lesser extent, humoral immunity. CD4+ depletion may result from the following: Direct cytotoxic effects of HIV replication Cell-mediated immune cytotoxicity Thymic damage that impairs lymphocyte production Infected CD4+ lymphocytes have a half-life of about 2 days, which is much shorter than that of uninfected CD4+ cells. Rates of CD4+ lymphocyte destruction correlate with plasma HIV level. Typically, during the initial or primary infection, HIV levels are highest (> 106 copies/mL), and the CD4 count drops rapidly. The normal CD4 count is about 750/mcL, and immunity is minimally affected if the count is > 350/mcL. If the count drops below about 200/mcL, loss of cell-mediated immunity allows a variety of opportunistic pathogens to reactivate from latent states and cause clinical disease. The humoral immune system is also affected. Hyperplasia of B cells in lymph nodes causes lymphadenopathy, and secretion of antibodies to previously encountered antigens increases, often leading to hyperglobulinemia. Total antibody levels (especially IgG and IgA) and titers against previously encountered antigens may be unusually high. However, antibody response to new antigens (eg, in vaccines) decreases as the CD4 count decreases. Abnormal elevation of immune activation may be caused in part by absorption of components of bowel bacteria. Immune activation contributes to CD4+ depletion and immunosuppression by mechanisms that remain unclear. Other tissues HIV also infects nonlymphoid monocytic cells (eg, dendritic cells in the skin, macrophages, brain microglia) and cells of the brain, genital tract, heart, and kidneys, causing disease in the corresponding organ systems.\n【13】 Thus, HIV levels and resistance patterns in these compartments may vary independently from those in plasma. Disease progression During the first few weeks of primary infection, there are humoral and cellular immune responses: Humoral: Antibodies to HIV are usually measurable within a few weeks after primary infection; however, antibodies cannot fully control HIV infection because mutated forms of HIV that are not controlled by the patient’s current anti-HIV antibodies are generated. Cellular: Cell-mediated immunity is a more important means of controlling the high levels of viremia (usually over 106 copies/mL) at first. But rapid mutation of viral antigens that are targeted by lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity subvert control of HIV in all but a small percentage of patients. Plasma HIV virion levels, expressed as number of HIV RNA copies/mL, stabilize after about 6 months at a level (set point) that varies widely among patients but averages 30,000 to 100,000/mL (4.2 to 5 log10/mL).\n【14】 Chronic meningitis lasts ≥ 4 weeks.\n【15】 A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common.\n【16】 Without treatment, risk of progression to AIDS is about 1 to 2%/year in the first 2 to 3 years of infection and about 5 to 6%/year thereafter. Eventually, AIDS almost invariably develops in untreated patients. HTLV Infections Infection with human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) 1 or 2 can cause T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and immunocompromise. Some HTLV-infected patients develop infections similar to those that occur in patients infected with HIV.\n【17】 Symptoms and Signs of HIV Infection Initial HIV infection Initially, primary HIV infection may be asymptomatic or cause transient nonspecific symptoms (acute retroviral syndrome). Acute retroviral syndrome usually begins within 1 to 4 weeks of infection and usually lasts 3 to 14 days. Symptoms and signs are often mistaken for infectious mononucleosis or benign, nonspecific viral syndromes and may include fever, malaise, fatigue, several types of dermatitis, sore throat, arthralgias, generalized lymphadenopathy, and septic meningitis. After the first symptoms disappear, most patients, even without treatment, have no symptoms or only a few mild, intermittent, nonspecific symptoms for a highly variable time period (2 to 15 years). Symptoms during this relatively asymptomatic period may result from HIV directly or from opportunistic infections. The following are most common: Lymphadenopathy White plaques due to oral candidiasis Herpes zoster Diarrhea Fatigue Fever with intermittent sweats Asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate cytopenias (eg, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) are also common. Some patients experience progressive wasting (which may be related to anorexia and increased catabolism due to infections) and low-grade fevers or diarrhea. Worsening HIV infection When the CD4 count drops to < 200/mcL, nonspecific symptoms may worsen and a succession of AIDS-defining illnesses develop. In patients with HIV infection, certain syndromes are common and may require different considerations .\n【18】 In other patients, neurologic dysfunction may occur. Evaluation may detect infections that do not typically occur in the general population, such as Disseminated mycobacterial infections Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infections There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental.\n【19】 gattii.\n【20】 albicans.\n【21】 AIDS-associated KS is an aggressive, multicentric tumor that may involve the face, trunk, mucosal surfaces, lymphatics, or gastrointestinal tract. Lesions appear as bluish to violaceous macules, plaques, or tumors.\n【22】 Kaposi Sarcoma (Early Stage) Purplish red nodules over the lower eyelid skin in an HIV-positive patient suggest Kaposi sarcoma.\n【23】S. Greenspan, BDS, University of California, San Francisco and Sol Silverman, Jr.\n【24】 Edward R. Cachay.\n【25】 The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.\n【26】 gattii.\n【27】 The primary symptom is watery diarrhea, often with other signs of gastrointestinal distress.\n【28】 A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common.\n【29】 Endemic (African), sporadic (non-African), and immunodeficiency-related forms exist.\n【30】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【31】Diagnosis of HIV Infection HIV antibody testing with or without HIV P24 antigen tests Nucleic acid amplification assays to determine HIV RNA level (viral load) HIV infection is suspected in patients with persistent, unexplained, generalized adenopathy or any of the AIDS-defining illnesses . It may also be suspected in high-risk patients with symptoms that could represent acute primary HIV infection. Diagnostic tests Detection of antibodies to HIV is sensitive and specific except during the first few weeks after infection (termed the \"window period\" of acute HIV infection). However, the HIV p24 antigen (a core protein of the virus) is already present in the blood during most of this time and can be detected by assays. Currently, a 4th-generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is recommended; it detects antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as the p24 HIV antigen. The laboratory version is probably preferred over the point-of-care one for diagnosing early infection, but both can be done quickly (within 30 minutes). If the test result is positive, an assay to differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2 and an HIV RNA assay are done. Earlier-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody assays are highly sensitive, but because they do not test for antigen, they are not positive as early as the 4th-generation combination test. Also, results are rarely false-positive. Positive ELISA results are therefore confirmed with a more specific test such as Western blot. However, these tests have drawbacks: ELISA requires complex equipment. Western blot requires well-trained technicians and is expensive. The full testing sequence takes at least a day. Point-of-care tests using blood or saliva (eg, particle agglutination, immunoconcentration, immunochromatography) can be done quickly (in 15 minutes) and simply, allowing testing in a variety of settings and immediate reporting to patients. Positive results of these rapid tests should be confirmed by standard blood tests (eg, ELISA with or without Western blot) in high-resource countries and repetition with one or more other rapid tests in high HIV burden countries. Negative tests need not be confirmed. If HIV infection is suspected despite negative antibody test results (eg, during the first few weeks after infection), the plasma HIV RNA level may be measured. The nucleic acid amplification assays used are highly sensitive and specific. HIV RNA assays require advanced technology, such as reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is sensitive to extremely low HIV RNA levels. Measuring p24 HIV antigen by ELISA is less sensitive and less specific than directly detecting HIV RNA in blood. Staging HIV infection can be staged based on the CD4 count. In patients ≥ 6 years old, stages are as follows: Stage 1: ≥ 500 cells/mcL Stage 2: 200 to 499 cells/mcL Stage 3: < 200 cells/mcL The CD4 count after 1 to 2 years of treatment provides an indication of ultimate immune recovery; CD4 counts may not return to the normal range despite prolonged suppression of HIV. Monitoring When HIV is diagnosed, the following should be determined: CD4 count Plasma HIV RNA level Both are useful for determining prognosis and monitoring treatment. The CD4 count is calculated as the product of the following: White blood cell count (eg, 4000 cells/mcL) Percentage of white blood cells that are lymphocytes (eg, 30%) Percentage of lymphocytes that are CD4+ (eg, 20%) Using the numbers above, the CD4 count (4000 x 0.3 x 0.2) is 240 cells/mcL, or about 1/3 of the normal CD4 count in adults, which is about 750 ± 250/mcL. Plasma HIV RNA level (viral load) reflects HIV replication rates. The higher the set point (the relatively stable virus levels that occur after primary infection), the more quickly the CD4 count decreases and the greater the risk of opportunistic infection, even in patients without symptoms. Baseline HIV genotype can be determined using a sample of blood; availability of this testing varies by location. HIV genotyping is used to identify mutations known to cause resistance to certain antiretroviral drugs and to help select a drug regimen likely to be effective for a specific patient with HIV infection. Diagnosis of HIV-related conditions Diagnosis of the various opportunistic infections, cancers, and other syndromes that occur in patients infected with HIV is discussed elsewhere in The Manual. Many have aspects unique to HIV infection. Hematologic disorders (eg, cytopenias, lymphomas, cancers) are common and may be usefully evaluated with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. This procedure can also help diagnose disseminated infections with MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex), M. tuberculosis, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, human parvovirus B19, P. jirovecii, and Leishmania. Most patients have normocellular or hypercellular marrow despite peripheral cytopenia, reflecting peripheral destruction. Iron stores are usually normal or increased, reflecting anemia of chronic disease (an iron-reutilization defect). Mild to moderate plasmacytosis, lymphoid aggregates, increased numbers of histiocytes, and dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells are common. HIV-associated neurologic syndromes can be differentiated via lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis and central nervous system contrast-enhanced CT or MRI . Screening for HIV Screening antibody tests or newer combination antigen/antibody tests should be offered routinely to adults and adolescents, particularly pregnant women, regardless of their perceived risk. For people at highest risk, especially sexually active people who have multiple partners and who do not practice safe sex, testing should be repeated every 6 to 12 months. Such testing is confidential and available, often free of charge, in many public and private facilities throughout the world. Rapid tests have the advantage of offering preliminary test results at the initial encounter in less than 25 minutes. They are especially useful for people who are unlikely to return for their test results. People receiving HIV testing should also be provided information on prevention, care, and treatment services. In the United States, screening for HIV infection is recommended in all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years and in younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of infection . Screening is also recommended in all pregnant persons, including those who present in labor or at delivery whose HIV status is unknown. The World Health Organization suggests that, in settings with a high HIV burden, HIV testing be done using rapid antibody tests and enzyme immunoassays .\n【32】 Treatment with ART is recommended for all patients, because disease-related complications can occur even in untreated patients with high CD4 counts and because the toxicity of antiretrovirals has decreased as new drugs have been developed. The benefits of ART outweigh the risks in every patient group and setting that has been carefully studied. In the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, 5472 treatment-naïve patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts > 350 cells/mcL were randomized to start ART immediately (immediate initiation) or to defer ART until their CD4 count decreased to < 250 cells/mcL (deferred initiation).\n【33】 A few exceptional patients can control their HIV strain without treatment; they maintain normal CD4 counts and very low blood levels of HIV (long-term nonprogressors) or normal CD4 counts and undetectable blood levels of HIV (elite controllers). These patients may not require ART, but studies to determine whether treating them is helpful have not been done and would be difficult because there are few of these patients and they would likely do well not taking ART for long periods. Antiretroviral therapy: General principles ART aims to Reduce the plasma HIV RNA level to undetectable (ie, < 20 to 50 copies/mL) Restore the CD4 count to a normal level (immune restoration or reconstitution) A poor CD4 count response is more likely if the CD4 count at initiation of treatment is low (especially if < 50/mcL) and/or the HIV RNA level is high. However, marked improvement is likely even in patients with advanced immunosuppression. An increased CD4 count correlates with markedly decreased risk of opportunistic infections, other complications, and death. With immune restoration, patients, even those with complications that have no specific treatment (eg, HIV-induced cognitive dysfunction) or that were previously considered untreatable (eg, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), may improve. Outcomes are also improved for patients with cancers (eg, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma) and most opportunistic infections. Patients with most acute opportunistic infections benefit from early ART (initiated during the management of the opportunistic infection). However, for some opportunistic infections, such as tuberculous meningitis or cryptococcal meningitis, the evidence suggests that ART should be delayed (2 to 4 weeks in most cases) until the first phase of antimicrobial therapy for these infections is finished because of the increased frequency of adverse events and death. The goal of ART can usually be achieved if patients take their medications > 95% of the time. However, maintaining this degree of adherence is difficult. Partial suppression (failure to lower plasma HIV RNA levels to undetectable levels) may select for single or multiple accumulated mutations in HIV that make viruses partially or completely resistant to a single drug or entire classes of drugs. Unless subsequent treatment uses drugs of other classes to which HIV remains sensitive, treatment is more likely to fail. The success of ART is assessed by measuring plasma HIV RNA levels every 8 to 12 weeks for the first 4 to 6 months or until HIV levels are undetectable and every 6 months thereafter. Increasing HIV levels are the earliest evidence of treatment failure and may precede a decreasing CD4 count by months. Maintaining patients on failing drug regimens selects for HIV mutants that are more drug-resistant. However, compared with wild-type HIV, these mutants appear less able to reduce the CD4 count, and failing drug regimens are often continued when no fully suppressive regimen can be found. If treatment fails, drug susceptibility (resistance) assays can determine the susceptibility of the dominant HIV strain to all available drugs. Genotypic and phenotypic assays are available and can help clinicians select a new regimen that should contain at least 2 and preferably 3 drugs to which the HIV strain is more susceptible. The dominant HIV strain in the blood of patients who are taken off antiretroviral therapy may revert over months to years to the wild-type (ie, susceptible) strain because the resistant mutants replicate more slowly and are replaced by the wild type. Thus, if patients have not been treated recently, the full extent of resistance may not be apparent through resistance testing, but when treatment resumes, strains with resistance mutations often reemerge from latency and again replace the wild-type HIV strain. Many patients living with HIV infection are taking complex regimens involving multiple pills to control the HIV RNA level (viral load), but often, no conventional HIV RNA resistance tests were done when viral treatment failed. With the availability of new co-formulated HIV drugs, many patients could benefit from simplification of their ART regimen, guided by HIV DNA archive genotype testing (GenoSure Archive). The HIV DNA genotype archive provides HIV-1 antiretroviral drug resistance data when conventional HIV RNA resistance testing cannot be done because patients have a low plasma HIV RNA level (< 500 copies/mL). The HIV DNA archive genotype test analyzes integrated and unintegrated archived HIV-1 proviral DNA embedded in host cells. The test amplifies cell-associated HIV-1 DNA from infected cells in whole blood samples, then uses next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the HIV-1 polymerase region. The positive predictive value of the HIV DNA archive resistance test results may enable clinicians to identify HIV-resistance mutations that were previously unidentified and to select a potentially simpler regimen with co-formulated drugs (≥ 2 drugs in a single pill). Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Patients beginning ART sometimes deteriorate clinically, even though HIV levels in their blood are suppressed and their CD4 count increases, because of an immune reaction to subclinical opportunistic infections or to residual microbial antigens after successful treatment of opportunistic infections. IRIS usually occurs in the first months of treatment but is occasionally delayed. IRIS can complicate virtually any opportunistic infection and even tumors (eg, Kaposi sarcoma) but is usually self-limited or responds to brief regimens of corticosteroids. IRIS has two forms: Paradoxical IRIS, which refers to worsening symptoms due to a previously diagnosed infection Unmasked IRIS, which refers to the first appearance of symptoms of an infection not previously diagnosed Paradoxical IRIS typically occurs during the first few months of treatment and usually resolves on its own. If it does not, corticosteroids, given for a short time, are often effective. Paradoxical IRIS is more likely to cause symptoms and symptoms are more likely to be severe when ART is started soon after treatment of an opportunistic infection is started. Thus, for some opportunistic infections, ART is delayed until treatment of the opportunistic infection has reduced or eliminated the infection. In patients with unmasked IRIS, the newly identified opportunistic infection is treated with antimicrobial drugs. Occasionally, when the symptoms are severe, corticosteroids are also used. Usually, when unmasked IRIS occurs, ART is continued. An exception is cryptococcal meningitis. Then ART is temporarily interrupted until the infection is controlled. Determining whether clinical deterioration is caused by treatment failure, IRIS, or both requires assessment of the persistence of active infections with cultures and can be difficult. Interruption of antiretroviral therapy Interruption of ART is usually safe if all drugs are stopped simultaneously, but levels of slowly metabolized drugs (eg, nevirapine) may remain high and thus increase the risk of resistance. Interruption may be necessary if intervening illnesses require treatment or if drug toxicity is intolerable or needs to be evaluated. After interruption to determine which drug is responsible for toxicity, clinicians can safely restart most drugs as monotherapy for up to a few days. NOTE: The most important exception is abacavir; patients who had fever or rash during previous exposure to abacavir may develop severe, potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions with reexposure. Risk of an adverse reaction to abacavir is 100-fold higher in patients with HLA-B*57:01, which can be detected by genetic testing. Pearls & Pitfalls Patients who had an adverse reaction to abacavir should not be given the drug again. If they are reexposed to the drug, they may have a severe, potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. Prevention of opportunistic infections  Effective chemoprophylaxis is available for many opportunistic infections and reduces rates of disease due to P. jirovecii, Candida, Cryptococcus, and MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). If therapy restores CD4 counts to above threshold values for > 3 months, chemoprophylaxis can be stopped. Primary prophylaxis depends on the CD4 count: CD4 count < 200/mcL or oropharyngeal candidiasis (active or previous): Prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia is recommended. Double-strength trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) tablets given once/day or 3 times/week are effective. Some adverse effects can be minimized with the 3 times/week dose or by gradual dose escalation. Some patients who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX can tolerate dapsone (100 mg once/day).\n【34】 For the few patients who cannot tolerate either drug because of a troublesome adverse effect (eg, fever, neutropenia, rash), aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once/month or atovaquone 1500 mg once/day can be used. CD4 count < 50/mcL: Prophylaxis against disseminated MAC consists of azithromycin or clarithromycin; if neither of these drugs is tolerated, rifabutin can be used. Azithromycin can be given weekly as two 600-mg tablets; it provides protection (70%) similar to daily clarithromycin and does not interact with other drugs. If latent tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection. Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【35】 For primary prophylaxis against some fungal infections (eg, esophageal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis or pneumonia), oral fluconazole 100 to 200 mg once/day or 400 mg weekly is successful but is infrequently used because the cost per infection prevented is high and diagnosis and treatment of these infections are usually successful. Secondary prophylaxis (after control of the initial infection) is indicated if patients have had the following: Recurrent oral, vaginal, or esophageal candidiasis (Invasive) Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C. albicans), manifested by mucocutaneous lesions, fungemia, and sometimes focal infection of multiple sites.\n【36】 gattii.\n【37】 Histoplasmosis is a pulmonary and hematogenous disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum; it is often chronic and usually follows an asymptomatic primary infection.\n【38】 Latent Toxoplasmosis is infection with Toxoplasma gondii.\n【39】 TMP/SMX (in doses used to prevent P. jirovecii pneumonia) is used to prevent reactivation and consequent toxoplasmic encephalitis. Latent infection is less common (about 15% of adults) in the United States than in Europe and most high HIV burden countries (up to 70 to 80% of adults). P.\n【40】 Immunization The CDC 2022 recommendations for vaccination of HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 19 years include the following: Patients who have not received a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci).\n【41】 All patients should be given the hepatitis B vaccine Hepatitis B (HepB) Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine is 80 to 100% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis B in people who complete the vaccine series.\n【42】 Patients at risk of hepatitis A or desiring protection from it should be given the hepatitis A vaccine Hepatitis A (HepA) Vaccine Both hepatitis A vaccines provide long-term protection against hepatitis A.\n【43】 At the appropriate age, males and females should be given the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease. HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPV.\n【44】 Adults who have not been previously vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine Meningococcal Vaccine The meningococcal serogroups that most often cause meningococcal disease in the US are serogroups B, C, and Y. Serogroups A and W cause disease outside the US.\n【45】 Patients who did not receive tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine Vaccines that contain diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis help protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, but they do not prevent all cases.\n【46】 For patients who are beginning or continuing their Td series and have not yet been given Tdap, Tdap should be substituted for one of the Td boosters.\n【47】 The varicella vaccine Varicella Vaccine Varicella vaccination provides effective protection against varicella (chickenpox). It is not known how long protection against varicella lasts.\n【48】 Generally, inactivated vaccines should be used. These vaccines are effective less often in patients who are HIV-positive than in those who are HIV-negative.\n【49】 Prognosis for HIV Infection Risk of AIDS, death, or both is predicted by the CD4 count in the short term Plasma HIV RNA level in the longer term For every 3-fold (0.5 log10) increase in viral load, mortality over the next 2 to 3 years increases about 50%. HIV-associated morbidity and mortality vary by the CD4 count, with the most deaths from HIV-related causes occurring at counts of < 50/mcL.\n【50】 Hence, prompt diagnosis of HIV before the disease is too advanced and immediate initiation of HIV treatment are essential to prognosis. Another, less well-understood prognostic factor is the level of immune activation as determined by evaluating the expression of activation markers on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes. Activation, which may be caused by leakage of bacteria across the HIV-damaged colonic mucosa, is a strong prognostic predictor but is not used clinically because this test is not widely available and antiretroviral therapy changes the prognosis, making this test less important. A subgroup of people infected with HIV (termed long-term nonprogressors) remains asymptomatic with high CD4 counts and low HIV levels in the blood without antiretroviral treatment. These people usually have vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses to their infecting HIV strain as measured by assays in vitro. The specificity of this effective response is shown by the following: When these people acquire a superinfection with a second strain of HIV to which their immune response is not as effective, they convert to a more typical pattern of progression. Thus, their unusually effective response to the first strain does not apply to the second strain. These cases provide a rationale for counseling people infected with HIV that they still need to avoid exposure to possible HIV superinfection through unsafe sex or needle sharing. Cure of HIV infection has not been thought possible, and thus lifelong drug treatment is considered necessary. Patients living with HIV infection should be urged to take their antiretroviral drugs consistently.\n【51】 Periodic HIV treatment interruption is also detrimental.\n【52】 End-of-life care Although antiretroviral therapy has dramatically increased life expectancy for patients with AIDS, many patients still deteriorate and die. Death may result from the following: Inability to take ART consistently, resulting in progressive immunosuppression Occurrence of untreatable opportunistic infections and cancers Liver failure due to hepatitis B or C Accelerated aging and age-related disorders Non-AIDS–related cancers that occur at a higher rate in patients with otherwise well-controlled HIV infection Death is rarely sudden; thus, patients usually have time to make plans. Nonetheless, patients should record their plans for health care early, with clear instructions for end-of-life care. Other legal documents, including powers of attorney Durable power of attorney for health care Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated.\n【53】 As patients near the end of life The Dying Patient Dying patients can have needs that differ from those of other patients. So that their needs can be met, dying patients must first be identified.\n【54】 The profound weight loss in many people during the last stages of AIDS makes good skin care difficult. The comprehensive support provided by hospice programs helps many patients because hospice providers are unusually skilled at symptom management, and they support caregivers and patient autonomy.\n【55】 Prevention of HIV Infection Vaccines against HIV have been difficult to develop because HIV surface proteins mutate easily, resulting in an enormous diversity of antigenic types. Nonetheless, various vaccine candidates are under investigation, and a few have shown promise in clinical trials. At the present time, there is no effective AIDS vaccine. Prevention of transmission Vaginal microbicides (including antiretroviral drugs) inserted before sexual contact have thus far proved ineffective, and some appear to increase risk for women, perhaps by causing cellular damage and thus decreasing natural barriers to HIV. Effective measures include the following: Public education: Education is effective and appears to have decreased rates of infection in some countries, notably Thailand and Uganda. Because sexual contact accounts for most cases, teaching people to avoid unsafe sex practices is the most relevant measure . Safer sex practices: People living with HIV who are not virally suppressed (ie, undetectable viral load) should practice safer sex behaviors that are essential to prevent the spread of the infection.\n【56】 Safer sex practices should be used by a patient infected with HIV whose infection is not virally suppressed whether they have sex with partners who are not infected with HIV or with partners with HIV infection. Safer sex practices are advised when both partners are HIV-positive and one or both partners are not virally suppressed; unprotected sex between people with virally unsuppressed-HIV infection may expose a person to resistant or more virulent strains of HIV. In addition, safer sex practices help to prevent transmission of other viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus) that cause severe disease in AIDS patients, as well as to syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including concerning infections such as multi-drug–resistant gonorrhea and sexually transmitted Neisseria meningitidis. Condoms offer the best protection. Oil-based lubricants should not be used because they may dissolve latex, increasing the risk of condom failure. information on HIV Transmission. Counseling for people who use parenteral drugs: Counseling about the risk of sharing needles is important but is probably more effective if combined with provision of sterile needles and syringes to reduce transmission of HIV and other bloodborne viruses that are acquired by sharing contaminated injecting equipment, treatment of drug dependence, and rehabilitation. Confidential testing for HIV infection: Testing should be offered routinely to adolescents and adults in virtually all health care settings. To facilitate routine testing, some states no longer require written consent or extensive pre-test counseling.\n【57】 If pregnant women are known to have HIV infection or test positive for HIV, they should be counseled about the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Pregnant women with HIV infection should be encouraged to accept therapy to prevent infection of the fetus or newborn, typically beginning at about 14 weeks gestation. Combination therapy is typically used because it is more effective than monotherapy and less likely to result in drug resistance. Some drugs can be toxic to the fetus or woman and should be avoided. If women meet criteria for ART, they should begin a regimen tailored to their history and stage of pregnancy and continue it throughout pregnancy. Cesarean delivery can also reduce risk of transmission.\n【58】 Some women choose to terminate their pregnancy because HIV can be transmitted in utero to the fetus or for other reasons. Screening of blood and organs: Transmission by blood transfusion is still remotely possible in the United States because antibody results may be false-negative during early infection. Currently, screening blood for antibody and p24 antigen is mandated in the United States and probably further reduces risk of transmission. Risk is reduced further by asking people with risk factors for HIV infection, even those with recent negative HIV antibody test results, not to donate blood or organs for transplantation. The FDA has issued guidance for deferral of blood donation, including deferral for 3 months after the most recent sexual contact for men who have had sex with another man and for women who have had sex with a man who has had sex with another man . However, use of sensitive HIV screening tests and deferral of donors of organs, blood, and blood products have not been implemented consistently in high HIV burden countries. Preexposure prophylaxis with antiretrovirals (PrEP): In PrEP, people who are not infected with HIV but are at high risk (eg, by having an HIV-infected sex partner) take an antiretroviral drug daily to reduce their risk of infection.\n【59】 The combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) can be used. Use of PrEP does not eliminate the need to use other methods of reducing risk of HIV infection, including using condoms and avoiding high-risk behaviors (eg, needle sharing). Data concerning infants of HIV-negative mothers taking TDF/FTC PrEP during pregnancy are incomplete, but currently, no adverse effects have been reported in children born to HIV-infected women treated with TDF/FTC. Use of PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who user injection drugs is being studied. Long-acting antiretroviral agents are licensed in the United States and other countries to further improve PrEP in high-risk populations with poor medication adherence; however, their availability remains limited. For the current CDC recommendations, see Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States (2021 Update) – Clinical Practice Guideline. Circumcision of men: Data from young African men show that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection from female partners during vaginal sex by about 50%; male circumcision is probably similarly effective in other male-patient populations. Whether male circumcision reduces HIV transmission from HIV-positive men to women or reduces the risk of acquiring HIV from an infected male partner is unknown. Universal precautions: Medical and dental health care practitioners should wear gloves in situations that may involve contact with any patient’s mucous membranes or body fluids and should be taught how to avoid needlestick accidents. Home caregivers of patients with HIV infection should wear gloves if their hands may be exposed to body fluids. Surfaces or instruments contaminated by blood or other body fluids should be cleaned and disinfected. Effective disinfectants include heat, peroxide, alcohols, phenolics, and hypochlorite (bleach). Isolation of patients infected with HIV is unnecessary unless indicated by an opportunistic infection (eg, tuberculosis). Treatment of HIV infection: Treatment with ART lowers the risk of transmission. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) Potential consequences of exposure to HIV have prompted the development of policies and procedures, particularly preventive treatment, to decrease risk of infection to health care workers. Preventive treatment is indicated after Penetrating injuries involving HIV-infected blood (usually needlesticks) Heavy exposure of mucous membranes (eye or mouth) to infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal fluids, or other body fluids containing blood (eg, amniotic fluid) Body fluids such as saliva, urine, tears, nasal secretions, vomitus, or sweat are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody. After initial exposure to blood, the exposed area is immediately cleaned with soap and water for skin exposures and with antiseptic for puncture wounds. If mucous membranes are exposed, the area is flushed with large amounts of water. The following are documented: Type of exposure Time elapsed since exposure Clinical information (including risk factors and serologic tests for HIV) about the source patient for the exposure and the person exposed Type of exposure is defined by Which body fluid was involved Whether exposure involved a penetrating injury (eg, needlestick, cut with sharp object) and how deep the injury was Whether the fluid had contact with nonintact skin (eg, abraded or chapped skin) or mucous membrane Risk of infection is about 0.3% (1:300) after a typical percutaneous exposure and about 0.09% (1:1100) after mucous membrane exposure. These risks vary, reflecting the amount of HIV transferred to the person with the injury; the amount of HIV transferred is affected by multiple factors, including viral load of the source and type of needle (eg, hollow or solid). However, these factors are no longer taken into account in PEP recommendations. The source is qualified by whether it is known or unknown. If the source is unknown (eg, a needle on the street or in a sharps disposal container), risk should be assessed based on the circumstances of the exposure (eg, whether the exposure occurred in an area where injection drug use is prevalent, whether a needle discarded in a drug-treatment facility was used). If the source is known but HIV status is not, the source is assessed for HIV risk factors, and prophylaxis is considered. The goal is to start PEP as soon after exposure as possible if prophylaxis is warranted. CDC recommends providing PEP within 24 to 36 hours after exposure; a longer interval after exposure requires the advice of an expert.\n【60】 The drugs should be carefully selected to minimize adverse effects and provide a convenient dosing schedule and thus encourage PEP completion. Preferred regimens include a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and an integrase inhibitor, either raltegravir or dolutegravir. In patients with childbearing potential, raltegravir is preferred because dolutegravir is possibly teratogenic during the first trimester of pregnancy—this is under epidemiologic investigation. Alternative regimens include 2 NRTIs plus a protease inhibitor. For detailed recommendations, see the CDC's Updated Guidelines for Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV—United States, 2016 (Updated May 2018) and Interim Statement Regarding Potential Fetal Harm from Exposure to Dolutegravir – Implications for HIV Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). If the source’s virus is known or suspected to be resistant to ≥ 1 drug, an expert in antiretroviral therapy and HIV transmission should be consulted. However, clinicians should not delay PEP pending expert consultation or drug susceptibility testing. Also, clinicians should provide immediate evaluation and face-to-face counseling and not delay follow-up care.\n【61】 Key Points HIV infects CD4+ lymphocytes and thus interferes with cell-mediated and, to a lesser extent, humoral immunity. HIV is spread mainly by sexual contact, parenteral exposure to contaminated blood or transplanted tissue or organs, and vertical transmission (in utero, during childbirth, or through breastfeeding). Frequent viral mutations combined with immune system damage significantly impair the body's ability to clear the HIV infection. Various opportunistic infections and cancers can develop and are the usual cause of death in untreated patients. Diagnose using antibody tests, and monitor by measuring viral load and CD4 count. Treat with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which can restore immune function to nearly normal in most patients if they take the drugs consistently. Periodically counsel patients living with HIV about safer sex. Use postexposure and preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis when indicated. Give primary prophylaxis against opportunistic infections based on the CD4 count.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#39#39# P.\n无关文本#60#60# For detailed ......Implications for HIV Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).  参见部分的引用", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:37", "update_time": "2024-04-01 18:53:42"}

It is used by anesthesiologists in many settings that previously required endotracheal intubation.\n【1】 The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a commonly used supraglottic airway. The LMA is an orally introduced supraglottic airway tube with a cuffed mask at one end that forms a low-pressure seal around the laryngeal inlet. LMA ventilation has several advantages over other methods. Unlike endotracheal tubes, LMAs can be successfully inserted blindly and by operators with only basic training.\n【2】 They bypass soft tissue obstruction of the upper airway, and they cause less gastric insufflation than BVM ventilation. Some available types of LMAs allow passage of an endotracheal tube (intubating LMAs) or a gastric decompression tube. Some have a fixed, anatomically correct shape that further optimizes ease of insertion. Some newer mask designs replace the inflatable cuff with a gel–filled cuff that molds to the airway. LMAs, like the other supraglottic airways ,eg, King laryngeal tube and esophageal-tracheal double lumen tube [Combitube] How To Insert an Esophageal-Tracheal Double Lumen Tube (Combitube) or a King Laryngeal Tube The esophageal-tracheal double lumen tube (Combitube) and the King laryngeal tube are supraglottic airway devices (also called retroglottic airway devices).\n【3】,cricothyrotomy If the upper airway is obstructed because of a foreign body or massive facial trauma or if ventilation cannot be accomplished by other means, surgical entry into the trachea is required.\n【4】 How To Insert a Laryngeal Mask Airway VIDEO Indications for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Apnea, severe respiratory failure, or impending respiratory arrest in which endotracheal intubation cannot be accomplished Certain elective anesthesia cases LMAs are useful in situations where bag-valve-mask ventilation is difficult: Patients with severe facial deformity (traumatic or natural), thick beard, or other factors that interfere with the face mask seal Contraindications to Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Absolute contraindications There is no medical contraindication to providing ventilatory support to a patient; however, a legal contraindication (do-not-resuscitate order or specific advance directive) may be in force Maximum mouth opening between incisors < 2 cm (nasotracheal intubation or a surgical airway would be indicated in this case) Impassable upper airway obstruction (surgical airway would be indicated in this case) Relative contraindications Consciousness or presence of a gag reflex ,patients should be unconscious or receive drugs to aid intubation Drugs to Aid Intubation Pulseless and apneic or severely obtunded patients can (and should) be intubated without pharmacologic assistance.\n【5】 In emergencies, use of an LMA can proceed even with these relative contraindications. Need for high pressure ventilation (the tighter seal of an endotracheal tube or a special LMA designed to form a tighter seal is needed for patients with excessive airflow resistance in the infraglottic airways or lungs) Complications of Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Complications include Vomiting and aspiration Tongue edema due to prolonged placement or balloon overinflation Dental or oropharyngeal soft tissue trauma during insertion Equipment for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Gloves, mask, gown, and eye protection (ie, universal precautions) 30- to 60-mL syringe Sterile water-soluble lubricant or anesthetic jelly Laryngeal mask airway Bag-valve apparatus Oxygen source (100% oxygen, 15 L/minute) Suctioning apparatus to clear the pharynx as needed Pulse oximeter, capnometer (end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor), and appropriate sensors Drugs to aid intubation Drugs to Aid Intubation Pulseless and apneic or severely obtunded patients can (and should) be intubated without pharmacologic assistance.\n【6】 Use low-pressure ventilation with a LMA to prevent air from escaping the low-pressure seal and causing gastric insufflation. If the seal is inadequate, lower the cuff pressure somewhat. If this approach does not work, a larger mask size should be tried. Overinflation of the cuff will make a poor seal worse. LMAs do not protect the airway from aspiration. However, some types of LMA feature improved laryngeal seals as well as ports for insertion of gastric decompression tubes. Relevant Anatomy for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Aligning the ear with the sternal notch may help open the upper airway and establishes the best position to view the airway if endotracheal intubation becomes necessary. The degree of head elevation that best aligns the ear and sternal notch varies (eg, none in children because in children the occiput is relatively large, but a large degree in patients with obesity). Positioning for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Optimal patient position for LMA insertion is the sniffing position. The operator may stand at the head of the stretcher while an assistant stands at the side. The sniffing position is used only in the absence of cervical spine injury: Position the patient supine on the stretcher. Place folded towels or other materials under the head, neck, and shoulders, flexing the neck to elevate the head until the external auditory meatus lies in the same horizontal plane as the sternal notch. Tilt the head so that the face aligns on a parallel horizontal plane; this second plane will be above the first. In patients with obesity, many folded towels or a commercial ramp device may be needed to sufficiently elevate the shoulders and neck . Head and neck positioning to open the airway A: The head is flat on the stretcher; the airway is constricted. B: Establishing the sniffing position, the ear and sternal notch are aligned, with the face parallel to the ceiling, opening the airway. Adapted from Levitan RM, Kinkle WC: The Airway Cam Pocket Guide to Intubation, ed. 2. Wayne (PA), Airway Cam Technologies, 2007. If cervical spine injury is a possibility: Position the patient supine or at a slight incline on the stretcher.\n【7】 LMAs that are anatomically contoured can be inserted without any neck manipulation or need for finger insertion into the mouth. They may cause posterior pressure on the cervical spine; however, they are generally considered safe for patients with unstable cervical spine injury. Step-by-Step Description of Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Do not allow a patient to awaken during insertion or ventilation with a laryngeal mask airway. If necessary, prevent the patient from waking up or gagging by using sedatives and/or paralytic medications or remove the airway as clinically indicated. Select the appropriately sized LMA and note the maximum cuff inflation volume. The size and maximum inflation volume are usually printed on the side of the tube. Generally, size #4 is suitable for adults weighing 50 to70 kg and size #5 is suitable for adults weighing 70 to 100 kg. Inflate and deflate the cuff to check its volume and ensure there are no leaks. With the cuff completely deflated, apply a small amount of sterile, water-soluble lubricant to the posterior surface of the distal mask and cuff. Pre-oxygenate the patient with bag-valve-mask ventilation if possible. Flex the patient’s neck, lift the chin, and maintain manual counter-pressure on the occiput as needed when you insert the tube.\n【8】 Push the tube cephalad, so the lubricated posterior surface of the mask follows the curve of the hard and soft palates. The mask should enter the hypopharynx along the posterior wall, to avoid deflecting and possibly causing a tube obstruction by the epiglottis. At the proper distance of insertion (as confirmed by markings on the tube), the mask will overlie the laryngeal opening, and the tip of the mask will meet definitive resistance to further insertion (at the top of the esophageal opening) . Release your hand from the tube before inflating the cuff. Inflate the cuff. Use half the recommended maximum cuff volume. As the mask seats over the glottic area, the tube will protrude 1 to 2 cm out of the mouth. Connect a bag-valve apparatus to the tube. Begin ventilation (8 to 10 breaths/minute, each about 500 mL and lasting about 1 second). Assess lung ventilation by auscultation and chest rise. Check end-tidal carbon dioxide to confirm placement. Fix the tube in place as appropriate. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) The LMA is a tube with an inflatable cuff that is inserted into the oropharynx. A: The deflated cuff is inserted into the mouth. B: With the index finger, the cuff is guided into place above the larynx. C: Once in place, the cuff is inflated. Some cuffs use a gel that molds to the airway rather than an inflatable cuff. Warnings and Common Errors for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Do not allow a patient to awaken during insertion or ventilation with a supraglottic or endotracheal airway. If necessary, prevent the patient from waking up or gagging (using sedative and/or paralytic medications) or remove the airway as clinically indicated. Do not over-inflate the cuff. Generally, start with half the maximal cuff volume and adjust as necessary. Tips and Tricks for Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion To improve difficult or inadequate LMA ventilation: Adjust the cuff volume. Try both lower and higher volumes (a poor cuff seal may be caused by either too low or too high cuff volumes). Adjust patient positioning while doing bag-valve ventilation to help make ventilation easier. Try a better configured sniffing position, a chin-to chest position, jaw thrust, or chin-lift maneuvers. Do the up-down maneuver. Withdraw the LMA 5 to 6 cm, without deflating the cuff, and then reinsert it to release an epiglottis trapped under the cuff or inside the mask. Rotate the LMA deeper into the hypopharynx and elevate the handle toward the ceiling. Deflate the cuff and remove the LMA. Then repeat LMA insertion, using the same LMA or one of a larger size. Consider using another airway, such as an intubating laryngeal mask airway, King laryngeal tube, endotracheal intubation, or a surgical airway.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#6#6#Adapted from Levitan RM, Kinkle WC: The Airway Cam Pocket Guide to Intubation, ed. 2.

Many patients are well aware that it is a warning of potential life-threatening disorders and seek evaluation for minimal symptoms. Other patients, including many with serious disease, minimize or ignore its warnings. Pain perception (both character and severity) varies greatly between individuals as well as between men and women. However described, chest pain should never be dismissed without an explanation of its cause. Pathophysiology of Chest Pain The heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels provide afferent visceral input through the same thoracic autonomic ganglia. A painful stimulus in these organs is typically perceived as originating in the chest, but because afferent nerve fibers overlap in the dorsal ganglia, thoracic pain may be felt (as referred pain) anywhere between the umbilicus and the ear, including the upper extremities. Painful stimuli from thoracic organs can cause discomfort described as pressure, tearing, gas with the urge to eructate, indigestion, burning or aching. Uncommonly, other descriptions of chest pain are given such as stabbing or sharp needle-like pain. When the sensation is visceral in origin, many patients deny they are having pain and insist it is merely “discomfort.” Etiology of Chest Pain Many disorders cause chest pain or discomfort. These disorders may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, or musculoskeletal systems . Some disorders are immediately life threatening: Acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.\n【1】 Often no cause can be confirmed even after full evaluation. Overall, the most common causes are Chest wall disorders (ie, those involving muscle, rib, or cartilage) Pleural disorders Gastrointestinal disorders ,eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, causing burning pain.\n【2】 In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones.\n【3】  Evaluation of Chest Pain History of present illness should note the location, duration, character, and quality of the pain. The patient should be asked about any precipitating events (eg, straining or overuse of chest muscles), as well as any triggering and relieving factors. Specific factors to note include whether pain is present during exertion or at rest, presence of psychologic stress, whether pain occurs during respiration or coughing, difficulty swallowing, relationship to meals, and positions that relieve or exacerbate pain (eg, lying flat, leaning forward). Previous similar episodes and their circumstances should be noted with attention to the similarity or lack thereof and whether the episodes are increasing in frequency and/or duration.\n【4】 Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including leg pain, swelling, or both ,deep venous thrombosis Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism.\n【5】 Past medical history should document known causes, particularly cardiovascular and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and any cardiac investigations or procedures (eg, stress testing, catheterization). Risk factors for coronary artery disease Risk Factors Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.\n【6】 Drug history should note use of drugs that can trigger coronary artery spasm (eg, cocaine, triptans) or GI disease (particularly alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Family history should note history of myocardial infarction (particularly among 1st-degree relatives at an early age, ie, < 55 in men and < 60 in women) and hyperlipidemia. Physical examination The extent of physical examination is guided by clinical suspicion. Vital signs and weight are measured, and body mass index (BMI) is calculated. Pulses are palpated in both arms and both legs, blood pressure is measured in both arms. General appearance is noted (eg, pallor, diaphoresis, cyanosis, anxiety). The neck is inspected for venous distention and hepatojugular reflux. The neck is palpated for carotid pulses, lymphadenopathy, or thyroid abnormality. The carotid arteries are auscultated for bruit. Lungs are percussed and auscultated for presence and symmetry of breath sounds Auscultation Key components in the evaluation of patients with pulmonary symptoms are the history, physical examination, and, in many cases, a chest x-ray.\n【7】 The cardiac examination notes the intensity and timing of the 1st heart sound (S1) and 2nd heart sound (S2), the respiratory movement of the pulmonic component of S2, pericardial friction rubs, murmurs, and gallops. When murmurs are detected, the timing, duration, pitch, shape, and intensity and the response to changes of position, handgrip, and the Valsalva maneuver should be noted. When gallops are detected, differentiation should be made between the 4th heart sound (S4), which is often present with diastolic dysfunction or myocardial ischemia, and the 3rd heart sound (S3), which is present with systolic dysfunction. The chest is inspected for skin lesions of trauma or herpes zoster infection and palpated for crepitance (suggesting subcutaneous air) and tenderness. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, organomegaly, and masses or tenderness, particularly in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. The legs are examined for arterial pulses, adequacy of perfusion, edema, varicose veins, and signs of DVT (eg, swelling, erythema, tenderness). Pulsus paradoxus Pulsus paradoxus Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart.\n【8】 Red flags Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chest pain: Abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, bradycardia, tachypnea, hypotension) Signs of hypoperfusion (eg, confusion, ashen color, diaphoresis) Shortness of breath Hypoxemia on pulse oximetry Asymmetric breath sounds or pulses New heart murmurs Pulsus paradoxus > 10 mm Hg Interpretation of findings Symptoms and signs of thoracic disorders vary greatly, and those of serious and nonserious conditions often overlap. Although red flag findings indicate a high likelihood of serious disease, and many disorders have “classic” manifestations , many patients who have serious illness do not present with these classic symptoms and signs. For example, patients with myocardial ischemia may complain only of indigestion or have a very tender chest wall on palpation. A high index of suspicion is important when evaluating patients with chest pain. Nonetheless, some distinctions and generalizations are possible. Duration of pain can provide clues to the severity of the disorder. Long-standing pain (ie, for weeks or months) is not a manifestation of a disorder that is immediately life threatening. Such pain is often musculoskeletal in origin, although gastrointestinal origin or a cancer should be considered, particularly in patients who are older. Similarly, brief (< 5 seconds), sharp, intermittent pains rarely result from serious disorders. Serious disorders typically manifest pain lasting minutes to hours, although episodes may be recurrent ,eg, unstable angina Unstable Angina Unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction. Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis.\n【9】 Patient age is helpful in evaluating chest pain. Chest pain in children and young adults (< 30 years) is less likely to result from myocardial ischemia, although myocardial infarction can occur in people in their 20s. Musculoskeletal and pulmonary disorders are more common causes in these age groups. Exacerbation and relief of symptoms also are helpful in evaluating chest pain. Although angina can be felt anywhere between the ear and the umbilicus, it is typically consistently related to physical or emotional stress, ie, patients do not experience angina from climbing one flight of stairs one day and tolerate 3 flights the next day. Nocturnal angina is characteristic of acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.\n【10】 Pain from many disorders, both serious and minor, can be exacerbated by respiration, movement, or palpation of the chest. These findings are not specific for origin in the chest wall; about 15% of patients with acute myocardial infarction have chest tenderness on palpation. Nitroglycerin may relieve pain of both myocardial ischemia and noncardiac smooth muscle spasm (eg, esophageal or biliary disorders); its efficacy or lack thereof should not be used for diagnosis. Associated findings may also suggest a cause. Fever is nonspecific but, if accompanied by cough, suggests a pulmonary cause.\n【11】 Symptoms typically last 4 to 72 hours and may be severe.\n【12】 The presence or absence of risk factors for CAD Risk Factors Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.\n【13】 Patients with those factors may well have another cause of chest pain, and patients without them may have an acute coronary syndrome Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.\n【14】 However, known CAD in a patient with chest pain raises the likelihood of that diagnosis as the cause (particularly if the patient describes the symptoms as “like my angina” or “like my last heart attack”). A history of peripheral vascular disease Peripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia.\n【15】 Testing For adults with acute chest pain, immediate life threats must be ruled out.\n【16】 In patients with hemodynamic instability, a bedside echocardiogram can also be useful in further evaluating potential life-threatening causes. Echocardiography can be particularly useful in identifying left ventricular or right ventricular dysfunction, evidence of RV pressure overload, valvular pathology, pericardial effusions, and signs of pericardial tamponade. If symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.\n【17】 Expeditious evaluation is essential because if myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome is present, the patient should be considered for urgent heart catheterization (when available). Immediate catheterization is indicated in patients with ST-elevation on ECG or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) causing hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, or persistent chest pain despite optimal medical management. Some abnormal findings on these tests confirm a diagnosis ,eg, acute myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.\n【18】 Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or result from trauma or medical procedures.\n【19】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【20】 Other abnormalities suggest a diagnosis or at least the need to pursue further investigation ,eg, abnormal aortic contour on chest x-ray suggests need for testing for thoracic aortic dissection Aortic Dissection Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen (channel).\n【21】 Thus, if these initial test results are normal, thoracic aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are highly unlikely. However, in acute coronary syndromes, ECG may not change for several hours or sometimes not at all, and in pulmonary embolism, oxygenation may be normal. Thus, other studies may need to be obtained based on findings from the history and physical examination . Because a single normal set of cardiac markers does not rule out a cardiac cause, patients whose symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome should have serial measurement of the cardiac marker troponin and ECGs.\n【22】 A diagnostic trial of sublingual nitroglycerin or an oral liquid antacid does not adequately differentiate myocardial ischemia from gastroesophageal reflux disease or gastritis. Either drug may relieve symptoms of either disorder. Troponin will be elevated in acute coronary syndromes except unstable angina, and often in other disorders that damage the myocardium ,eg, myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium with necrosis of cardiac myocytes.\n【23】 Creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated due to damage to any muscle tissue, but creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevation is specific to damage to the myocardium. However, troponin is the standard marker of cardiac muscle injury. Advances in high-sensitivity troponin assays allow for more rapid serial evaluation of a possible acute coronary syndrome. With improved negative predictive value, high sensitivity troponin also has the potential to decrease the necessity of further testing in patients with negative biomarkers and has been demonstrated to allow patients to be discharged more quickly ,1 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint.\n【24】 Recent guidelines recommend using normal troponin levels and negative coronary CT scanning as a reliable strategy to exclude acute coronary syndrome in patients with chest pain and no red flags ,2 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint.\n【25】 ST-segment abnormality on the ECG may be nonspecific or due to antecedent disorders, so comparison with previous ECGs is important. Some clinicians follow initial testing (acutely or within several days) with a stress ECG or a stress imaging test. If a pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered possible, D-dimer testing is done in low- and intermediate-risk patients. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism is affected by a number of clinical factors, which can be used to derive an approach to testing. Many of these factors are included in scoring systems that help determine the probability of PE such as the Wells Scoring System, the Revised Geneva Scoring System, and the Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria ,PERC— 3–5 Diagnosis references Chest pain is a very common complaint.\n【26】 In patients with chronic chest pain, immediate threats to life are unlikely. Most clinicians initially obtain a chest x-ray and do other tests based on symptoms and signs.\n【27】 Treatment of Chest Pain Specific identified disorders are treated. If etiology is not clearly benign, patients are usually admitted to the hospital or an observation unit for cardiac monitoring and more extensive evaluation.\n【28】 Pain relief following opioid treatment should not diminish the urgency of ruling out serious and life-threatening disease. If pulmonary embolism is highly likely, antithrombin drugs should be given while the diagnosis is pursued; another embolus in a patient who is not receiving anticoagulants may be fatal. Geriatrics Essentials: Chest Pain The probability of serious and life-threatening disease increases with age. Many older patients recover more slowly than younger patients but survive for significant time if properly diagnosed and treated. Drug doses are usually lower, and rapidity of dose escalation is slower. Chronic disorders (eg, chronic kidney disease) are often present and may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Key Points Immediate life threats must be ruled out first. Some serious disorders, particularly coronary ischemia and pulmonary embolism, often do not have a classic presentation. Most patients should have pulse oximetry, ECG, cardiac marker measurement, and chest x-ray. Evaluation must be prompt so that patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or other criteria for intervention can be in the heart catheterization laboratory (or have thrombolysis) within the 90-minute standard. If PE is highly likely, antithrombin drugs should be given while the diagnosis is pursued; another embolus in a patient who is not receiving anticoagulants may be fatal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-02 00:49:07"}

Eventually, the ducts become blocked and then obliterated. Cirrhosis, liver failure, and sometimes bile duct cancer develop. Symptoms begin gradually and include worsening fatigue, itchiness, and, later, jaundice. An imaging test can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, but liver transplantation can prolong life. Bile is a fluid that is produced by the liver and aids in digestion. Bile is transported through small tubes (bile ducts) that carry bile through the liver and then from the liver to the gallbladder and to the small intestine.  In primary sclerosing cholangitis, bile ducts become inflamed, which can lead to scarring of the bile ducts and liver tissue that progresses, eventually becoming severe (cirrhosis). The scar tissue narrows and blocks the bile ducts. As a result, bile salts, which help the body absorb fats, are not secreted normally. The disorder resembles primary biliary cholangitis Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is inflammation with progressive scarring of the bile ducts in the liver.\n【1】 The cause is not known but is likely to be autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues. What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known.\n【2】 Overview of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis VIDEO Primary sclerosing cholangitis most often affects young men and is diagnosed at an average age of 40. It commonly occurs in people with inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n【3】 It tends to occur in families, suggesting that genes may be involved. An infection or injury of the bile ducts may trigger the disorder in people who have genes that make them susceptible to the disorder. Symptoms of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Symptoms usually begin gradually with worsening fatigue and itchiness. Jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia.  tends to develop later. Inflammation and recurring infection of the bile ducts (bacterial cholangitis) sometimes occur. Bacterial cholangitis causes attacks of pain in the upper abdomen, jaundice, and fever. Because bile salts are not secreted normally, people may be unable to absorb enough fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Such impaired bile secretion results in osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【4】 Gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder.\n【5】 The liver and spleen may enlarge. As the disorder progresses, symptoms of cirrhosis Symptoms Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.\n【6】 Advanced cirrhosis causes the following: Increased blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the intestines to the liver ,portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver) and its branches.\n【7】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.\n【8】 Symptoms may not appear for up to 10 years. Cancer of the bile ducts ,cholangiocarcinoma Tumors of the Bile Ducts and Gallbladder Tumors, both noncancerous and cancerous, within the bile ducts or gallbladder are rare. Ultrasonography or MRI/MRCP can usually detect a tumor in the bile ducts or gallbladder.\n【9】 Usually, primary sclerosing cholangitis worsens gradually. Liver failure typically occurs on average approximately 12 years after the disorder is diagnosed.\n【10】 This test helps confirm primary sclerosing cholangitis and rule out other causes of bile duct obstruction.\n【11】 ERCP is less desirable than MRCP because ERCP is more invasive and requires injection of a contrast agent. However, ERCP can also sometimes be used to treat complications of the disorder. Blood tests and MRCP may be done regularly to check for cancer of the bile ducts and liver tissue. When people are diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis, they should also have a colonoscopy with biopsies .\n【12】 Treatment of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Treatment of symptoms and complications Sometimes liver transplantation If people have no symptoms, no treatment is required. But at least twice a year, they need to have a physical examination and blood tests to monitor the progression of the disorder. The drugs ursodeoxycholic acid and cholestyramine may help relieve itching. Recurring bacterial cholangitis is treated with antibiotics. ERCP is done as needed to widen (dilate) the blocked ducts. Sometimes tubes to keep the ducts open (stents) are inserted temporarily.

Diagnosis is by measuring FSH and estradiol levels. Typically, treatment is with combined estrogen/progestogen therapy. In primary ovarian insufficiency, the ovaries stop functioning normally in women who are < 40. This disorder used to be called premature ovarian failure or premature menopause; however, these terms are misleading because women with primary ovarian insufficiency do not always stop menstruating and their ovaries do not always completely stop functioning. Thus, a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency does not always mean that pregnancy is impossible. Also, this disorder does not imply that a woman is aging prematurely; it means only that her ovaries are no longer functioning normally. In primary ovarian insufficiency, the ovaries Stop releasing eggs or release them only intermittently Stop producing the hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone or produce them only intermittently Etiology of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Primary ovarian insufficiency has various causes , including the following: The number of ovarian follicles present at birth is insufficient. The rate of follicular atresia is accelerated, as occurs when the ovaries are damaged during surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. The follicles are dysfunctional (as occurs in autoimmune ovarian dysfunction). Certain genetic disorders are present. Genetic disorders that can cause premature ovarian insufficiency include Turner syndrome Turner Syndrome In Turner syndrome, girls are born with one of their two X chromosomes partly or completely missing. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and is confirmed by cytogenetic analysis.\n【1】 Diagnosis is with molecular DNA analysis.\n【2】 These disorders, which are usually evident by age 35, increase risk of ovarian germ cell cancer.\n【3】 Women with overt primary ovarian insufficiency or premature ovarian failure typically have amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) can be primary or secondary.\n【4】 They may also have changes in mood, including depression. The ovaries are usually small and barely palpable but occasionally are enlarged, usually when the cause is an immune-mediated disorder. Women may also have symptoms and signs of the causative disorder (eg, dysmorphic features due to Turner syndrome; intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and autism due to Fragile X syndrome; rarely, orthostatic hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and decreased axillary and pubic hair due to adrenal insufficiency). Unless women with primary ovarian insufficiency receive estrogen therapy until about age 51 (the average age for menopause), the risk of osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.\n【5】 Diagnosis is clinical; laboratory and imaging tests are usually used to identify treatable causes.\n【6】 If primary ovarian insufficiency is caused by an autoimmune disorder, women are at risk of potentially life-threatening primary adrenal insufficiency ,Addison disease Addison Disease Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex.\n【7】 A pregnancy test is done, and serum FSH and estradiol levels are measured weekly for 2 to 4 weeks; if FSH levels are high (> 20 mIU/mL, but usually > 30 mIU/mL) and estradiol levels are low (usually < 20 pg/mL), ovarian insufficiency is confirmed. Then, further tests are done based on which cause is suspected. Because antimüllerian hormone is produced only in small ovarian follicles, blood levels of this hormone have been used to attempt to diagnose decreased ovarian reserve. Normal levels are between 1.5 and 4.0 ng/mL. A very low level suggests decreased ovarian reserve. Reproductive endocrinologists use antimüllerian hormone levels to help predict which women may respond poorly to fertility medications and generally which couples are less likely to be successful with fertility treatment. Antimüllerian hormone can be drawn at any time during the menstrual cycle. Newer, more sensitive antimüllerian hormone tests may help clinicians diagnose early menopause. Genetic counseling and testing for the FMR1 premutation are indicated if women have a family history of primary ovarian insufficiency or have intellectual disability, tremor, or ataxia. Karyotype is determined if women with confirmed ovarian insufficiency or failure are < 35 or if the FMR1 premutation is suspected. If karyotype is normal or if an autoimmune cause is suspected, tests for serum adrenal and anti-21 hydroxylase antibodies (adrenal autoantibodies) are done.\n【8】 If an autoimmune cause is suspected, tests to check for autoimmune hypothyroidism are also done; they include measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4), and antithyroid–peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies. If adrenal insufficiency Testing Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex.\n【9】 Other tests for an autoimmune dysfunction should be done; they include a complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and measurement of antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor. Bone density is measured if women have symptoms or signs of estrogen deficiency. Ovarian biopsy is not indicated.\n【10】 PMID: 12694633; PMCID: PMC153539. Treatment of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Estrogen/progestogen contraceptives or hormone therapy (combination hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy) In vitro fertilization if pregnancy is desired Women who have primary ovarian insufficiency and do not desire pregnancy may be treated with estrogen/progestin contraceptives (cyclical or extended cycle) or estrogen/progestin therapy (cyclical or continuous). Cyclical combination hormone therapy Hormone Therapy Menopause is physiologic or iatrogenic cessation of menses (amenorrhea) due to decreased ovarian function.\n【11】 Once women reach the average age of menopause, whether to continue hormone therapy depends on the woman's individual circumstances (eg, severity of symptoms, risk of fractures). For women who desire pregnancy, one option is in vitro fertilization In vitro fertilization (IVF) Assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) involve manipulation of sperm and ova or embryos in vitro with the goal of producing a pregnancy.\n【12】 The age of the oocyte donor is more important than the age of the recipient. This technique is fairly successful, but even without this technique, some women with diagnosed primary ovarian insufficiency become pregnant. No treatment has been proved to increase the ovulation rate or restore fertility in women with primary ovarian insufficiency. However, fertility restoration is being studied. Other options for women who desire pregnancy include cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos and embryo donation. These techniques may be used before or during ovarian failure, especially in cancer patients. Neonatal and adult ovaries possess a small number of oogonial stem cells that can stably proliferate for months and produce mature oocytes in vitro; these cells may be used to develop infertility treatments in the future.\n【13】 About 5 to 10% of women with primary ovarian insufficiency eventually become pregnant on their own, without fertility treatments. Unless contraindicated, hormonal therapy or estrogen/progestin contraceptives are recommended rather than other bone-specific treatments (eg, bisphosphonates) to prevent bone loss in women with premature ovarian insufficiency; these treatments are given until women reach the average age for menopause (about age 51), when treatment may be reassessed. To help prevent osteoporosis Antiresorptive drugs Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.\n【14】 Women with a Y chromosome require bilateral oophorectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy because risk of ovarian germ cell cancer is increased.\n【15】 2.

Massive hemoptysis is production of ≥ 600 mL of blood (about a full kidney basin’s worth) within 24 hours. Pathophysiology of Hemoptysis Most of the lung’s blood (95%) circulates through low-pressure pulmonary arteries and ends up in the pulmonary capillary bed, where gas is exchanged. About 5% of the blood supply circulates through high-pressure bronchial arteries, which originate at the aorta and supply major airways and supporting structures. In hemoptysis, the blood generally arises from this bronchial circulation, except when pulmonary arteries are damaged by trauma, by erosion of a granulomatous or calcified lymph node or tumor, or, rarely, by pulmonary arterial catheterization or when pulmonary capillaries are affected by inflammation. Etiology of Hemoptysis Blood-streaked sputum is common in many minor respiratory illnesses, such as upper respiratory infection and viral bronchitis. The differential diagnosis is broad .\n【1】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【2】 Cavitary Aspergillus infection is increasingly recognized as a cause but is not as common as cancer. In children, common causes are Lower respiratory tract infection Foreign body aspiration Esophageal Foreign Bodies Food and a variety of other swallowed objects can become impacted in the esophagus. Esophageal foreign bodies cause dysphagia and sometimes lead to perforation.\n【3】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【4】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【5】 Patients may need specific prompting to differentiate between true hemoptysis, pseudohemoptysis (ie, bleeding originating in the nasopharynx that is subsequently coughed up), and hematemesis. A sensation of postnasal drip or any bleeding from the nares without coughing is suggestive of pseudohemoptysis. Concomitant nausea and vomiting with black, brown, or coffee-ground–colored blood is characteristic of hematemesis. Frothy sputum, bright red blood, and (if massive) a sensation of choking are characteristic of true hemoptysis. Review of systems should seek symptoms suggesting possible causes, including fever and sputum production ,pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection. Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【6】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs.\n【7】 Patients should be asked about risk factors for causes. These risk factors include HIV infection, use of immunosuppressants (TB, fungal infection); exposure to TB; long smoking history (cancer); and recent immobilization or surgery, known cancer, prior or family history of clotting, pregnancy, use of estrogen-containing drugs, and recent long-distance travel (pulmonary embolism). Past medical history should cover known conditions that can cause hemoptysis, including chronic lung disease ,eg, COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke.\n【8】 Exposure to TB is important, particularly in patients with HIV infection or another immunocompromised state. A history of frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising, or liver disease suggests possible coagulopathy. The drug profile should be reviewed for use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation. Constitutional signs (eg, cachexia) and level of patient distress (eg, accessory muscle use, pursed lip breathing, agitation, decreased level of consciousness) should also be noted. A full lung examination is done, particularly including adequacy of air entry and exit, symmetry of breath sounds, and presence of crackles, rhonchi, stridor is a high-pitched, predominantly inspiratory sound.\n【9】 It is a symptom as well as a physical finding.\n【10】 Signs of consolidation (eg, egophony, dullness to percussion) should be sought. The cervical and supraclavicular areas should be inspected and palpated for lymphadenopathy (suggesting cancer or TB). Neck veins should be inspected for distention, and the legs and presacral area should be palpated for pitting edema (suggesting heart failure). Heart sounds should be auscultated with notation of any extra heart sounds or murmur that might support a diagnosis of heart failure and elevated pulmonary pressure. The abdominal examination should focus on signs of hepatic congestion or masses, which could suggest either cancer or hematemesis from potential esophageal varices. The skin and mucous membranes should be examined for ecchymoses, petechiae, telangiectasia, gingivitis, or evidence of bleeding from the oral or nasal mucosa. If the patient can reproduce hemoptysis during examination, the color and amount of blood should be noted. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Massive hemoptysis Back pain Presence of a pulmonary artery catheter or tracheostomy Malaise, weight loss, or fatigue Extensive smoking history Dyspnea at rest during examination or absent or decreased breath sounds Interpretation of findings The history and physical examination often suggest a diagnosis and guide further testing . Despite the many possibilities, some generalities can be made. A previously healthy person with a normal examination and no risk factors (eg, for TB, pulmonary embolism) who presents with acute-onset cough and fever most likely has hemoptysis due to an acute respiratory illness; chronic disorders are much lower on the list of possibilities. However, if risk factors are present, those specific disorders must be strongly suspected. Clinical prediction can help estimate the risk of pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis.\n【11】 A normal oxygen saturation does not exclude pulmonary embolism. Patients whose hemoptysis is due to a lung disorder (eg, COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis) or heart disease (eg, heart failure) typically have a clear history of those disorders. Hemoptysis is not an initial manifestation. Patients with known immunocompromise should be suspected of having TB or a fungal infection. Patients with symptoms or signs of chronic illness but no known disorders should be suspected of having cancer or TB, although hemoptysis can be the initial manifestation of lung cancer in a patient who is otherwise asymptomatic. Several specific findings are of note: Known renal failure or hematuria suggests a pulmonary-renal syndrome (eg, Goodpasture syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may have nasal mucosal lesions. Visible telangiectasias suggest arteriovenous malformations. Patients with hemoptysis due to a bleeding disorder usually have cutaneous findings (petechiae, purpura, or both) or a history of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug use. Recurrent hemoptysis coinciding with menses strongly suggests pulmonary endometriosis. Testing Patients with massive hemoptysis require treatment and stabilization, usually in an intensive care unit, before testing. Patients with minor hemoptysis can undergo outpatient testing. Imaging is always done, typically chest x-ray, although sometimes (eg, with known bronchiectasis) CT is the initial test. Patients with normal results, a consistent history, and nonmassive hemoptysis can undergo empiric treatment for bronchitis. Patients with abnormal results and patients without a supporting history should undergo CT and bronchoscopy. CT may reveal pulmonary lesions that are not apparent on the chest x-ray and can help locate lesions in anticipation of bronchoscopy and biopsy. CT angiography or, less commonly, ventilation/perfusion scanning with or without pulmonary arteriography can confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. CT and pulmonary angiography can also detect pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. Fiberoptic inspection of the pharynx, larynx, and airways may be indicated along with esophagogastric endoscopy when the etiology is obscure to distinguish hemoptysis from hematemesis and from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal bleeding. Laboratory testing is also done. Patients usually should have a complete blood count, a platelet count, and measurement of PT (prothrombin time) and PTT (partial thromboplastin time). Anti-factor Xa testing can be used to detect supratherapeutic anticoagulation in patients receiving low molecular weight heparin. Urinalysis should be done to look for signs of glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria, casts). TB skin testing and sputum culture should be done as the initial tests for active TB, but negative results do not preclude the need to induce sputum or do fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain samples for further acid-fast bacillus testing if an alternative diagnosis is not found. Cryptogenic hemoptysis The cause of hemoptysis remains unknown in 30 to 40% of patients, but the prognosis for patients with cryptogenic hemoptysis is generally favorable, usually with resolution of bleeding within 6 months of evaluation. Treatment of Hemoptysis Massive hemoptysis Initial treatment of massive hemoptysis has two objectives: Prevent aspiration of blood into the uninvolved lung (which can cause asphyxiation) Prevent exsanguination due to ongoing bleeding It can be difficult to protect the uninvolved lung because it is often initially unclear which side is bleeding. Once the bleeding side is identified, strategies include positioning the patient with the bleeding lung in a dependent position and selectively intubating the uninvolved lung and/or obstructing the bronchus going to the bleeding lung. Prevention of exsanguination involves reversal of any bleeding diathesis and direct efforts to stop the bleeding. Clotting deficiencies can be reversed with fresh frozen plasma and factor-specific or platelet transfusions. Desmopressin is used to reverse platelet dysfunction associated with uremia and kidney disease. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug being increasingly used to promote hemostasis. Laser therapy, cauterization, or direct injection with epinephrine or vasopressin can be done bronchoscopically. Massive hemoptysis is one of the few indications for rigid (as opposed to flexible) bronchoscopy is the introduction of an endoscope into the airways. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is used for virtually all diagnostic, and most therapeutic, indications.\n【12】 Embolization via bronchial artery angiography is becoming the preferred method with which to stop massive hemoptysis, with reported success rates of up to 90% ,1 Treatment references Hemoptysis is coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract. Massive hemoptysis is production of ≥ 600 mL of blood (about a full kidney basin’s worth) within 24 hours.\n【13】 Emergency surgery is indicated for massive hemoptysis not controlled by rigid bronchoscopy or embolization and is generally considered a last resort. Once a diagnosis is made, further treatment is directed at the cause ,2, 3 Treatment references Hemoptysis is coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract. Massive hemoptysis is production of ≥ 600 mL of blood (about a full kidney basin’s worth) within 24 hours.\n【14】 Minor hemoptysis Treatment of minor hemoptysis is directed at the cause. Early resection may be indicated for bronchial adenoma or carcinoma. Broncholithiasis (erosion of a calcified lymph node into an adjacent bronchus) may require pulmonary resection if the stone cannot be removed via rigid bronchoscopy. Bleeding secondary to heart failure or mitral stenosis usually responds to specific therapy for heart failure. In rare cases, emergency mitral valvulotomy is necessary for life-threatening hemoptysis due to mitral stenosis. Bleeding from a pulmonary embolism is rarely massive and almost always stops spontaneously. If emboli recur and bleeding persists, anticoagulation may be contraindicated, and placement of an inferior vena cava filter is the treatment of choice. Because bleeding from bronchiectatic areas usually results from infection, treatment of the infection with appropriate antibiotics and postural drainage is essential. Antifibrolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid are being increasingly used and studied in minor hemoptysis ,4 Treatment references Hemoptysis is coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract. Massive hemoptysis is production of ≥ 600 mL of blood (about a full kidney basin’s worth) within 24 hours.\n【15】 Key Points Hemoptysis needs to be distinguished from hematemesis and nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal bleeding. Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscess are the most common causes in adults. Lower respiratory tract infection and foreign body aspiration are the most common causes in children. Patients with massive hemoptysis require treatment and stabilization before testing. With massive hemoptysis, if the side of bleeding is known, patients should be positioned with the affected lung in the dependent position. Bronchial artery embolization is the preferred treatment for massive hemoptysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-02 00:35:11"}

IV access should be established early during evaluation in case such complications occur. History of present illness should include the following: The patient’s gravidity (number of confirmed pregnancies), parity (number of deliveries after 20 weeks), and number of abortions (spontaneous or induced) Description and amount of bleeding, including how many pads were soaked and whether clots or tissue were passed Presence or absence of pain If pain is present, onset, location, duration, and character should be determined. Review of symptoms should note fever, chills, abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, and neurologic symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, syncope, or near syncope. Past medical History should include risk factors for ectopic pregnancy History and spontaneous abortion History . Physical examination Physical examination includes review of vital signs for fever and signs of hypovolemia (tachycardia, hypotension). Evaluation focuses on abdominal and pelvic examinations. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity, guarding), and uterine size. Fetal heart sounds should be checked with a Doppler ultrasound probe. Pelvic examination includes inspection of external genitals, speculum examination, and bimanual examination. Blood or products of conception in the vaginal vault, if present, are removed; products of conception are sent to a laboratory for confirmation. The cervix should be inspected for discharge, dilation, lesions, polyps, and tissue in the os. If the pregnancy is < 14 weeks, the cervical os may be gently probed (but no more than fingertip depth) using ringed forceps to determine the integrity of the internal cervical os. If the pregnancy is ≥ 14 weeks, the cervix should not be probed because the vascular placenta may tear, especially if it covers the internal os (placenta previa). Bimanual examination should check for cervical motion tenderness, adnexal masses or tenderness, and uterine size. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia, or both) Orthostatic changes in pulse or blood pressure Syncope or near-syncope Peritoneal signs (rebound, rigidity, guarding) Fever, chills, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge Interpretation of findings Clinical findings help suggest a cause but are rarely diagnostic . However, a dilated cervix plus passage of fetal tissue and crampy abdominal pain strongly suggests spontaneous abortion, and septic abortion is usually apparent from the circumstances and signs of severe infection (fever, toxic appearance, purulent or bloody discharge). Even if these classic manifestations are not present, threatened or missed abortion is possible, and the most serious cause—ruptured ectopic pregnancy—must be excluded. Although the classic description of ectopic pregnancy includes severe pain, peritoneal signs, and a tender adnexal mass, ectopic pregnancy can manifest in many ways and should always be considered, even when bleeding appears scant and pain appears minimal. Testing A self-diagnosed pregnancy is verified with a urine test.\n【5】 If bleeding is substantial, testing should also include complete blood count and either type and screen (for abnormal antibodies) or cross-matching. For major hemorrhage or shock, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) is also determined. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography is done to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy unless products of conception have been obtained intact (indicating completed abortion). If patients are in shock or bleeding is substantial, ultrasonography should be done at the bedside. The quantitative beta-hCG level helps interpret ultrasound results. Beta-hCG levels of ≥ 1000 to 2000 mIU/mL are commonly used as the discriminatory level; if the level is above the discriminatory level, a gestational sac may be visible if the pregnancy is intrauterine. However, intrauterine pregnancy is still possible even if it is not seen on transvaginal ultrasonography. No established beta-hCG level can exclude an intrauterine pregnancy. The discriminatory level at the facility where the test is done should be used to guide clinical management. ,1 Diagnosis reference Vaginal bleeding occurs in 20 to 30% of confirmed pregnancies during the first 20 weeks of gestation; about half of these cases end in spontaneous abortion.\n【6】 In stable patients, serial ultrasonography can help guide management when beta-hCG levels are near this discriminatory level. Ultrasonography can also help identify a ruptured corpus luteum cyst and gestational trophoblastic disease. It can show products of conception in the uterus, which are present in patients with incomplete, septic, or missed abortion. If the patient is stable and clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy is low, serial beta-hCG levels may be done on an outpatient basis. Normally, the level doubles every 1.4 to 2.1 days up to 41 days gestation; in ectopic pregnancy (and in abortions), levels may be lower than expected by dates and usually do not double as rapidly. If clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy is moderate or high (eg, because of substantial blood loss, adnexal tenderness, or both), diagnostic uterine evacuation or dilation and curettage (D & C) or diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered.\n【7】 Spontaneous abortion is the most common cause of bleeding during early pregnancy.

The immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders.\n【1】 Joints (typically the small joints of the limbs) become painful and have stiffness that persists for more than 60 minutes on awakening and after inactivity. Fever, weakness, and damage to other organs may occur. Diagnosis is based mainly on symptoms but also on blood tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and on x-rays. Treatment can include exercises and splinting, medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and immunosuppressive drugs), and sometimes surgery. Worldwide, rheumatoid arthritis develops in about 1% of the population, regardless of race or country of origin, affecting women 2 to 3 times more often than men. Usually, rheumatoid arthritis first appears between 35 years and 50 years of age, but it may occur at any age. A disorder similar to rheumatoid arthritis can occur in children. The disease is then called juvenile idiopathic arthritis Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a group of related childhood diseases that begin by age 16 and involve persistent or recurring inflammation of the joints.\n【2】 However, the prognosis for juvenile idiopathic arthritis is often somewhat different. The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known. It is considered an autoimmune disease Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues. What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known.\n【3】 Components of the immune system attack the soft tissue that lines the joints (synovial tissue) and can also attack connective tissue in many other parts of the body, such as the blood vessels and lungs. Eventually, the cartilage, bone, and ligaments of the joint erode (wear away), causing deformity, instability, and scarring within the joint. The joints deteriorate at a variable rate. Many factors, including genetic predisposition, may influence the pattern of the disease. Unknown environmental factors (such as viral infections and cigarette smoking) are thought to play a role. Risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis include the following: Smoking Obesity Changes in the microbiome (the group of microorganisms that normally live in a particular part of the body, such as the digestive tract, mouth, and lungs) Periodontal disease ,periodontitis is a severe form of gingivitis, in which the inflammation of the gums extends to the supporting structures of the tooth.\n【4】 Although some people who have rheumatoid arthritis find that specific foods may cause flare-ups, no specific foods have been proved to cause flare-ups or prevent joint inflammation and damage. Autoimmune Disorders VIDEO Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis People with rheumatoid arthritis may have Relatively mild symptoms Occasional flare-ups with long periods of remission (in which the disease is inactive) A severe, steadily progressive disease, which may be slow or rapid Rheumatoid arthritis may start suddenly, with many joints becoming inflamed at the same time. More often, it starts subtly, gradually affecting different joints. Usually, the inflammation is symmetric, with joints on both sides of the body affected about equally. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect any joint, but most often the first inflamed are the small joints in the Hands Wrists Fingers Feet Toes Other commonly affected joints include the Knees Shoulders Elbows Ankles Hips Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the neck. The lower spine and the joints at the tips of the fingers are not affected. The inflamed joints are usually painful and often stiff, especially just after awakening (such stiffness generally lasts for more than 60 minutes) or after prolonged inactivity. Some people feel tired and weak, especially in the early afternoon. Rheumatoid arthritis may cause a loss of appetite with weight loss and a low-grade fever. Affected joints are often tender, warm, and enlarged because of swelling of the soft tissue lining the joint (synovitis) and sometimes fluid within the joint (synovial fluid). Joints can quickly become deformed. Joints may freeze in one position so that they cannot bend or open fully, which leads to a limited range of motion. The fingers may tend to dislocate slightly from their normal position toward the little finger on each hand, causing tendons in the fingers to slip out of place, or may develop other deformities  of the base of the finger, a straightening out (extension) of the middle joint, and a bending in (flexion) of the outermost joint.\n【5】 When the Fingers Are Abnormally Bent Some disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and injuries can cause the fingers to bend abnormally. In swan-neck deformity, the joint at the base of the finger bends in (flexes), the middle joint straightens out (extends), and the outermost joint bends in (flexes). In boutonnière deformity, the middle finger joint is bent inward (toward the palm), and the outermost finger joint is bent outward (away from the palm). Swollen wrists can pinch a nerve and result in numbness or tingling due to carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful compression (pinching) of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.\n【6】 Cysts, which may develop behind affected knees, can rupture, causing pain and swelling in the lower legs. Up to 30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis have hard bumps just under the skin (called rheumatoid nodules), usually near sites of pressure (such as the back of the forearm near the elbow). Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis causes an inflammation of blood vessels ,vasculitis Overview of Vasculitis Vasculitic disorders are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). Vasculitis can be triggered by certain infections or drugs or can occur for unknown reasons.\n【7】 Vasculitis reduces the blood supply to tissues and may cause nerve damage or leg sores (ulcers). Inflammation of the membranes that cover the lungs (pleura) or of the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium) or inflammation and scarring of the lungs or heart can lead to chest pain or shortness of breath. Some people develop swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), Felty syndrome (a low white blood cell count and an enlarged spleen), Sjögren syndrome Sjögren Syndrome Sjögren syndrome is a common autoimmune connective tissue disorder and is characterized by excessive dryness of the eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes.\n【8】 Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the neck, making the bones unstable and increasing the risk of the bones putting pressure on (compressing) the spinal cord Compression of the Spinal Cord Injuries and disorders can put pressure on the spinal cord, causing back or neck pain, tingling, muscle weakness, and other symptoms.\n【9】 Neck involvement is common in longstanding, active rheumatoid arthritis and usually causes headaches and pain and stiffness, sometimes with pain that radiates down the arms or legs. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for early coronary artery disease Coronary Artery Disease and bone disease, such as osteopenia Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【10】 Rheumatoid Arthritis Swan-Neck Deformity In swan-neck deformity, the finger takes on a curved shape, like the neck of a swan.\n【11】 Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis Blood tests X-rays Examination of joint fluid In addition to the important characteristic pattern of symptoms, doctors follow established criteria when evaluating a person for rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors suspect people have rheumatoid arthritis if they have more than one joint with definite swelling of the joint's lining that is not caused by another disorder. Doctors diagnose people with rheumatoid arthritis if they have certain combinations of the following criteria: Involvement of the joints that are most typical of rheumatoid arthritis High blood levels of rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, or both High blood levels of C-reactive protein, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or both Symptoms that have lasted at least 6 weeks Doctors check blood tests to determine a person's levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies and usually C-reactive protein, ESR, or both. They also frequently do x-rays of the hands, wrists, and affected joints. X-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees). In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease.\n【12】 Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.\n【13】 Doctors may also insert a needle into a joint to draw a sample of synovial fluid. The fluid is examined to determine whether it is consistent with features of rheumatoid arthritis and to rule out other disorders that cause symptoms similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid needs to be analyzed to establish that a person has rheumatoid arthritis but does not always need to be analyzed whenever a flare-up causes joints to become swollen. Blood tests Many people with rheumatoid arthritis have distinctive antibodies in their blood, such as rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies. However, doctors do not rely only on blood tests to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is present in 70% of people with rheumatoid arthritis. (Rheumatoid factor also occurs in several other diseases, such as cancers, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis, and some other infections. Some people without any disorder, particularly older adults, have rheumatoid factor in their blood.) Anti-CCP antibodies are present in over 75% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis and are almost always absent in people who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor, especially in people who smoke cigarettes, predicts that their arthritis will be more severe. C-reactive protein levels are often high in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of C-reactive protein (a protein that circulates in the blood) dramatically increase when there is inflammation. High C-reactive protein levels can mean the disease is active. The ESR is increased in 90% of people who have active rheumatoid arthritis. The ESR is another test for inflammation and measures the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube containing blood. However, similar increases in the ESR, C-reactive protein level, or both occur in many other disorders. Doctors may monitor the ESR or C-reactive protein to help determine whether the disease is active. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis have mild anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.\n【14】 Rarely, the white blood cell count becomes abnormally low. When a person with rheumatoid arthritis has a low white blood cell count and an enlarged spleen, the disorder is called Felty syndrome. Prognosis for Rheumatoid Arthritis The course of rheumatoid arthritis is unpredictable. The disorder progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year, and 80% of untreated people develop permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years. Rheumatoid arthritis decreases life expectancy by 3 to 7 years. Heart disease (a risk with rheumatoid arthritis), infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding are the most common complications that cause death. Side effects of drug treatment, cancer, and the underlying disease also may be responsible. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis resolves spontaneously. Treatment relieves symptoms in 3 of 4 people. However, at least 10% of people with rheumatoid arthritis are eventually severely disabled despite full treatment. Factors that tend to predict a poorer prognosis include the following: Being White, a woman, or both Having rheumatoid nodules Being older when the disorder begins Having inflammation in 20 or more joints Being a cigarette smoker Obesity Having a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Having high levels of rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Medications Lifestyle measures, such as rest, diet, exercise, and stopping smoking Physical therapy and occupational therapy Sometimes surgery Treatments include simple, conservative measures in addition to medications and surgical treatments. Simple measures are meant to help the person’s symptoms and include rest, adequate nutrition, and physical treatments. People should take measures that decrease their risk of heart disease, such as stopping smoking and getting treated, if necessary, for high blood pressure and high blood lipids or cholesterol. Medications Because disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints.\n【15】 For other medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, see Medications for Rheumatoid Arthritis Medications for Rheumatoid Arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints.\n【16】 Rest and nutrition Complete bed rest is rarely necessary, even for a short time. However, quality sleep is important, because poor sleep increases pain. Severely inflamed joints should be rested because using them can aggravate the inflammation. Regular rest periods often help relieve pain, and sometimes a short period of bed rest helps relieve a severe flare-up in its most active, painful stage. Splints can be used to immobilize and rest one or several joints, but some systematic movement of the joints is needed to prevent nearby muscles from weakening and joints from freezing in place. A regular, healthy diet is generally appropriate. A diet rich in fish (omega-3 fatty acids) and plant oils but low in red meat can partially relieve symptoms in some people. Some people may have flare-ups after eating certain foods, and if so, these foods should be avoided, but such flare-ups occur rarely. No specific foods have been proved to cause flare-ups. Many diets have been proposed but have not proved helpful. Fad diets should be avoided. Physical treatments Along with medications to reduce joint inflammation, a treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis should include nondrug therapies, such as exercise, physical therapy Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs.\n【17】 Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.\n【18】 Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.\n【19】 Inflamed joints should be gently stretched so they do not freeze in one position. Heat therapy can be helpful because heat improves muscle function by reducing stiffness and muscle spasm. As the inflammation subsides, regular, active exercises can help, although a person should not exercise to the point of excessive fatigue. For many people, exercise in warm water may be easier. Treatment of tight joints consists of intensive exercises and occasionally the use of splints to gradually extend the joint. Cold therapy (cryotherapy) Professional rehabilitation therapists treat pain and inflammation. Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.\n【20】 People who are disabled by rheumatoid arthritis can use several aids to accomplish daily tasks. For example, specially modified orthopedic or athletic shoes can make walking less painful, and self-help devices such as grippers reduce the need to squeeze the hand forcefully. Surgery If medications have not helped, surgical treatment may be needed. Surgical repair must always be considered in terms of the total disease. For example, deformed hands and arms limit a person’s ability to use crutches during rehabilitation, and seriously affected knees and feet limit the benefits of hip surgery. Reasonable objectives for each person must be determined, and ability to function must be considered. Surgical repair may be performed while the disease is active. Surgically replacing knee or hip joints is the most effective way to restore mobility and function when the joint disease is advanced. Joints can also be removed or fused together, especially in the foot, to make walking less painful. The thumb can be fused to enable a person to pinch, and unstable vertebrae at the top of the neck can be fused to prevent them from compressing the spinal cord. Joint repair with prosthetic joint replacement is indicated if damage severely limits function. Total hip replacements and knee replacements are most consistently successful. Replacing All of a Hip (Total Hip Replacement) Sometimes the whole hip joint must be replaced. The whole hip joint is the top (head) of the thighbone (femur) and the surface of the socket into which the head of the thighbone fits. This procedure is called total hip replacement or total hip arthroplasty. The head of the thighbone is replaced with a ball-shaped part (prosthesis), made of metal. The prosthesis has a strong stem that fits within the center of the thighbone. The socket is replaced with a metal shell lined with durable plastic. Replacing a Knee A knee joint damaged by osteoarthritis may be replaced with an artificial joint. After a general anesthetic is given, the surgeon makes an incision over the damaged knee. The knee cap (patella) may be removed, and the ends of the thigh bone (femur) and shinbone (tibia) are smoothed so that the parts of the artificial joint (prosthesis) can be attached more easily. One part of the artificial joint is inserted into the thigh bone, the other part is inserted into the shinbone, and then the parts are cemented in place. Medications for Rheumatoid Arthritis The main goal of drug treatment is to reduce inflammation and thereby prevent erosions, progression of the disease, and loss of joint function. The main categories of medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis are Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints.\n【21】 For example, doctors may prescribe two DMARDs together or a corticosteroid plus a DMARD. However, the best combinations of medications are not yet clear. Typically, biologic agents are not used in combination with other biologic agents because these combinations increase the frequency of infections. All the categories of drugs have potentially serious side effects that must be looked for during treatment.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain. Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.\n【22】 They do not prevent the damage caused by rheumatoid arthritis from progressing and thus should not be considered the primary treatment.  NSAIDs can reduce the swelling in affected joints and relieve pain and stiffness. They can be taken by mouth or applied directly to the skin over painful joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, unlike osteoarthritis, causes considerable inflammation. Thus, medications that decrease inflammation, including NSAIDs, have an important advantage over medications such as acetaminophen that reduce pain but not inflammation. However, NSAIDs should generally not be taken by people who have a history of digestive tract (peptic) ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.\n【23】 Medications called proton pump inhibitors (such as esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole) can reduce the risk of stomach or duodenal ulcers . Other possible side effects of NSAIDs may include headache, confusion, elevation of blood pressure, worsening of kidney function, swelling, and decreased platelet function, causing bruising or bleeding. People who get hives, inflammation and swelling in the nose, or asthma after they take aspirin may have the same symptoms after taking other NSAIDs. NSAIDs may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The risk appears to be higher if the drug is used at higher doses and for longer periods of time. Aspirin is no longer used to treat rheumatoid arthritis because effective doses are often toxic. The cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors (coxibs, such as celecoxib) are NSAIDs that act similarly to the other NSAIDs but are slightly less likely to damage the stomach and do not affect platelet function and cause bruising or bleeding like the other NSAIDs. However, if a person also takes aspirin, stomach damage is almost as likely to occur as with other NSAIDs. Caution should be taken with use of coxibs and probably all NSAIDs for long periods or by people with risk factors for heart attack and stroke. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) DMARDs, such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine, slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and are given to nearly all people with rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors typically prescribe these drugs as soon as the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is made. Many take weeks to have an effect. Even if pain is decreased with NSAIDs, a doctor will likely prescribe a DMARD because the disease may otherwise progress even if symptoms are lessened.  About two thirds of people improve overall, and complete remissions are becoming more common. The progression of arthritis usually slows, but pain may remain. People should be fully aware of the risks of DMARDs and monitored carefully for evidence of toxicity. Combinations of DMARDs may be more effective than single drugs. For example, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate together are more effective than methotrexate alone or the other two together. Also, combining biologic agents with a DMARD is often more effective than using a single drug or certain combinations of DMARDs. For example, methotrexate can be combined with a TNF inhibitor. Methotrexate is taken by mouth once weekly. It is anti-inflammatory at the low doses used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It is very effective and begins to work within 3 to 4 weeks, which is relatively rapid for a DMARD. The liver can scar, but this scarring most often can be detected by monitoring with regular blood tests and reversed before major damage develops. People must refrain from drinking alcohol to minimize the risk of liver damage. Bone marrow suppression (suppression of the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) may occur. Blood counts should be tested about every 2 to 3 months in all people taking the drug. Inflammation of the lung (pneumonitis) is rare. Inflammation in the mouth and nausea can also develop. Severe relapses of arthritis can occur after methotrexate is discontinued. Folate (folic acid) tablets may decrease some of the side effects, such as mouth ulcers. Rheumatoid nodules may enlarge with methotrexate therapy. Hydroxychloroquine is given daily by mouth. Side effects, which are usually mild, include rashes, muscle aches, and eye problems. However, some eye problems can be permanent, so people taking hydroxychloroquine must have their eyes checked by an ophthalmologist before treatment begins and every 12 months during treatment. If the medication has not helped after 9 months, it is discontinued. Otherwise, hydroxychloroquine can be continued as long as necessary. Leflunomide is taken daily by mouth and has benefits that are similar to those of methotrexate but it is less likely to cause suppression of blood cell production in the bone marrow, abnormal liver tests, or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). It can be given at the same time as methotrexate. The major side effects are rashes, liver dysfunction, hair loss, diarrhea, and rarely nerve damage (neuropathy). Sulfasalazine is initially given by mouth and can relieve symptoms and slow the development of joint damage. Sulfasalazine can also be used in people who have less severe rheumatoid arthritis or added to other medications to boost their effectiveness. The dose is increased gradually, and improvement usually is seen within 3 months. Because sulfasalazine may quickly cause a person's white blood cell count to become very low (neutropenia), blood tests are done after the first 2 weeks and then about every 12 weeks while the person is taking the drug. Like the other DMARDs, it can cause stomach upset, diarrhea, liver problems, blood cell disorders, and rashes. In males, sulfasalazine may cause a low sperm count, which is reversible. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that suppress the immune system. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the most dramatically effective drugs for reducing inflammation and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis anywhere in the body.  There is some controversy as to whether corticosteroids can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the long-term use of corticosteroids almost invariably leads to side effects, potentially involving almost every organ in the body . Consequently, doctors usually reserve corticosteroids for short-term use in the following situations: When beginning treatment for severe symptoms (until a DMARD has taken effect) In severe flare-ups when many joints are affected They are also useful in treating rheumatoid inflammation outside of joints, for example, in the membranes covering the lungs (pleura) or in the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium). Because of the risk of side effects, the lowest effective dose is almost always used. When corticosteroids are injected into a joint, the person does not get the same side effects as when taking a corticosteroid by mouth (orally) or vein (intravenously). Corticosteroids can be injected directly into affected joints for fast, short-term relief of pain and swelling. When used for a long time, corticosteroids may cause weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes, thinning and bruising of the skin, glaucoma and other eye problems such as cataracts, and increase the risk of certain infections. Corticosteroids: Uses and Side Effects Corticosteroids are the strongest drugs available for reducing inflammation in the body. They are useful in any condition in which inflammation occurs, including rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue disorders, multiple sclerosis, and in emergencies such as brain swelling due to cancer, asthma attacks, and severe allergic reactions. When inflammation is severe, use of these drugs is often lifesaving. Corticosteroids can be Given by vein (intravenously—especially in emergency situations) Taken by mouth (orally) Directly applied to the inflamed area (topically; for example, as eye drops or as skin creams) Inhaled (as in inhaled versions for the lungs, used to treat disorders such as asthma and COPD) Injected into a muscle (intramuscularly) Injected into a joint For example, corticosteroids can be used as an inhaled preparation for treatment of asthma. They can be used as a nasal spray to treat hay fever ,allergic rhinitis Allergic Rhinitis is inflammation and swelling of the mucous membrane of the nose, characterized by a runny nose and stuffiness and usually caused by the common cold or a seasonal allergy.\n【24】 They can be used as eye drops to treat eye inflammation ,uveitis is inflammation anywhere in the pigmented inside lining of the eye, known as the uvea or uveal tract.\n【25】 They may be applied directly to an affected area for treatment of certain skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. They can be injected into joints inflamed by rheumatoid arthritis or another disorder. Corticosteroids are prepared synthetically to have the same action as cortisol (or cortisone), a steroid hormone produced by the outer layer (cortex) of the adrenal glands—hence the name “corticosteroid.” Many synthetic corticosteroids are, however, more powerful than cortisol, and most are longer acting. Corticosteroids are chemically related to, but have different effects than, anabolic steroids (such as testosterone) that are produced by the body and sometimes abused by athletes. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, beclomethasone, flunisolide, and fluticasone. All of these drugs are very strong (although strength depends on the dose used). Hydrocortisone is a milder corticosteroid that is available in over-the-counter skin creams. Corticosteroids reduce the body’s ability to fight infections by reducing inflammation, typically when they are taken by mouth or given by vein. Because of this side effect, they are used with extreme care when infections are present. Oral and intravenous use may cause or worsen high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes, peptic ulcers, and osteoporosis. Therefore, corticosteroids are used in such conditions only when their benefit is likely to exceed their risk. When they are taken by mouth or by injection for more than about 2 weeks, corticosteroids should not be stopped abruptly. This is because corticosteroids inhibit the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, and this production must be given time to recover. Thus, at the end of a course of corticosteroids, the dose is gradually reduced. It is important for a person who takes corticosteroids to follow the doctor’s instructions on dosage very carefully. The long-term use of corticosteroids, particularly at higher doses and particularly when given by mouth or vein, invariably leads to many side effects, involving almost every organ in the body. Common side effects include thinning of the skin with stretch marks and bruising, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, cataracts, puffiness in the face (moon face) and abdomen, thinning of the arms and legs, poor wound healing, stunted growth in children, loss of calcium from the bones (which can lead to osteoporosis), hunger, weight gain, and mood swings. Inhaled corticosteroids and corticosteroids that are applied directly to the skin have far fewer side effects than corticosteroids given by mouth, vein, or injection. Adrenal Corticosteroids VIDEO Biologic agents A biologic agent is something made from a living organism, often using cells in a laboratory. Many biologic agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis are antibodies. Biologic agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include abatacept, rituximab, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–inhibiting drugs (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab), an interleukin-1 receptor blocker (anakinra), and interleukin-6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab and sarilumab).  Biologic agents may suppress the inflammation so that corticosteroids can be avoided or given in lower doses. But by interfering with the immune system, biologic agents may increase the risks of infection and certain cancers. Because treatment with biologic agents increases the risk of infection, before starting treatment with a biologic agent people should be up to date on vaccinations . Etanercept, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and adalimumab are TNF inhibitors and can be dramatically effective for people who do not respond sufficiently to methotrexate alone. Etanercept is given once a week by injection under the skin. Infliximab is given by vein. After the first dose of infliximab is given, the next two doses are given at 2 and at 6 weeks. Then infliximab is given every 8 weeks. Golimumab is given by injection under the skin once every 4 weeks. Certolizumab pegol is given by injection under the skin. After the first dose, the next two doses are given at 2 and at 4 weeks. Then the drug is given at 2-week or 4-week intervals, depending on the dose. Adalimumab is injected under the skin once every 1 to 2 weeks. TNF is an important part of the body’s immune system, so inhibition of TNF can impair the body’s ability to fight infections, particularly a reactivated tuberculosis infection. These drugs should be avoided in people who have active infections and should be discontinued before major surgery. Etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab can be and are often used with methotrexate. People who have severe heart failure should not take high doses of infliximab. Side effects of TNF inhibitors include the potential risk of reactivation of infection ,particularly tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic contagious infection caused by the airborne bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved.\n【26】 They were once thought to be plants but are now classified as their own kingdom. Some fungi cause infections in people.\n【27】 Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor blocker, which means it interrupts one of the major chemical pathways involved in inflammation. Anakinra is given as a single daily injection under the skin. Pain and itching at the injection site are the most common side effects. IL-1 is part of the immune system, so inhibiting IL-1 can impair the ability to fight infections. Anakinra can also suppress production of white blood cells. It should not be used with TNF inhibitors. It is prescribed less often because it must be given every day. Rituximab is a biologic agent that decreases the number of B-cell lymphocytes, one of the white blood cells responsible for causing inflammation and for fighting infection. Rituximab is usually reserved for people who do not improve enough after taking methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor. It is injected in a vein, usually as 2 doses given 2 weeks apart. Side effects, as with other immunosuppressive drugs, may include increased risk of infections. In addition, rituximab can cause effects while it is being given, such as rashes, nausea, back pain, itching, and high or low blood pressure. It can cause severe liver damage by reactivating hepatitis B Hepatitis B, Acute hepatitis B is inflammation of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis B virus and that lasts from a few weeks up to 6 months.\n【28】 The COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines provide protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n【29】 Therefore, doctors now try to reserve rituximab for people who did not respond to other biologic DMARDs and to those with certain lymphatic disorders and cancers. Abatacept is another biologic agent that interferes with the communication between cells that coordinates inflammation. Side effects include lung problems, headache, increased susceptibility to infection, and upper respiratory infection. The first injection in the vein takes over 30 minutes to complete. After that, it is injected in a vein or under the skin at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks after the first dose and every 4 weeks thereafter. Sarilumab is an IL-6 receptor blocker, which means it interrupts one of the major chemical pathways involved in inflammation. This drug is given to people who have not been helped by or who cannot tolerate DMARDs. Sarilumab causes suppression of blood cell production in the bone marrow (neutropenia), suppression of platelet production in the bone marrow (sometimes with increased susceptibility to bleeding), and increased liver enzymes. It is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously) once every 2 weeks. Tocilizumab also is an IL-6 receptor blocker. It is often used to treat people who are also taking methotrexate. Side effects include infection ,such as tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic contagious infection caused by the airborne bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved.\n【30】 It is given by vein every 4 weeks. There may be an increased risk when people who have had diverticulitis use tocilizumab. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors Janus kinase inhibitors are small molecule agents that interfere with the communication between cells that coordinate inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme JAK. JAK inhibitors include tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib.  Because treatment with JAK inhibitors increases the risk of infection, including herpes zoster infection, people should be vaccinated against zoster Shingles Vaccine There are two herpes zoster (shingles) vaccines. The newer herpes zoster vaccine is preferred over the older herpes zoster vaccine because it provides better and longer-lasting protection.\n【31】 Baricitinib is given to people who have not been helped by or who cannot tolerate TNF antagonists. Baricitinib increases the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, high cholesterol levels Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【32】 It is taken by mouth once a day. Tofacitinib is used if a person has taken methotrexate and has not improved enough. Tofacitinib can be used at the same time as methotrexate. Side effects include nonmelanoma skin cancer and high cholesterol levels Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【33】 Tofacitinib is taken by mouth twice a day. Upadacitinib is given to adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis when methotrexate has not been effective enough.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#7#7#Sjögren syndrome多次重复应删除一次\n无关文本#28#28#与上下文内容无联接", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-01 02:13:34"}

It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause. Pathophysiology of Dyspnea Although dyspnea is a relatively common problem, the pathophysiology of the uncomfortable sensation of breathing is poorly understood. Unlike those for other types of noxious stimuli, there are no specialized dyspnea receptors (although MRI studies have identified a few specific areas in the midbrain that may mediate perception of dyspnea). The experience of dyspnea likely results from a complex interaction between chemoreceptor stimulation, mechanical abnormalities in breathing, and the perception of those abnormalities by the central nervous system. Some authors have described the imbalance between neurologic stimulation and mechanical changes in the lungs and chest wall as neuromechanical uncoupling. Etiology of Dyspnea has many pulmonary, cardiac, and other causes ,1 Etiology reference Dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing. It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause.\n【1】 The most common causes include Asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction.\n【2】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【3】Evaluation of Dyspnea History of present illness should cover the duration, temporal onset (eg, abrupt, insidious), and provoking or exacerbating factors (eg, allergen exposure, cold, exertion, supine position). Severity can be determined by assessing the activity level required to cause dyspnea (eg, dyspnea at rest is more severe than dyspnea only when climbing stairs). Physicians should note how much dyspnea has changed from the patient’s usual state.\n【4】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings.\n【5】 Past medical history should cover disorders known to cause dyspnea, including Asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction.\n【6】 Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Examination focuses on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. A full lung examination is done, particularly including adequacy of air entry and exit, symmetry of breath sounds, and presence of crackles, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing. Signs of consolidation (eg, egophony, dullness to percussion) should be sought. The cervical, supraclavicular, and inguinal areas should be inspected and palpated for lymphadenopathy. Neck veins should be inspected for distention, and the legs and presacral area should be palpated for pitting edema (both suggesting heart failure). Heart sounds should be auscultated with notation of any extra heart sounds, muffled heart sounds, or murmur. Testing for pulsus paradoxus Pulsus paradoxus Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart.\n【7】 As the cuff is further deflated, the point at which the first Korotkoff sound is audible during both inspiration and expiration is recorded. If the difference between the first and second measurement is > 12 mm Hg, then pulsus paradoxus is present. Conjunctiva should be examined for pallor. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Dyspnea at rest during examination Decreased level of consciousness or agitation or confusion Accessory muscle use and poor air excursion Chest pain Crackles Weight loss Night sweats Palpitations Interpretation of findings The history and physical examination often suggest a cause and guide further testing ,1 Evaluation reference Dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing. It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause.\n【8】 Several findings are of note: Wheezing is a relatively high-pitched whistling noise produced by movement of air through narrowed or compressed small airways. It is a symptom as well as a physical finding.\n【9】 Stridor is a high-pitched, predominantly inspiratory sound.\n【10】 Crackles suggest left heart failure, interstitial lung disease, or, if accompanied by signs of consolidation, pneumonia. However, the symptoms and signs of life-threatening conditions such as myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific. Furthermore, the severity of symptoms is not always proportional to the severity of the cause (eg, pulmonary embolism in a fit, healthy person may cause only mild dyspnea). Thus, a high degree of suspicion for these common conditions is prudent. It is often appropriate to rule out these conditions before attributing dyspnea to a less serious etiology. A clinical prediction rule can help estimate the risk of pulmonary embolism. Note that normal oxygen saturation does not exclude pulmonary embolism. Hyperventilation syndrome Hyperventilation Syndrome Hyperventilation syndrome is anxiety-related dyspnea and tachypnea often accompanied by systemic symptoms.\n【11】 Because hypoxia may cause tachypnea and agitation, it is unwise to assume every rapidly breathing, anxious young person merely has hyperventilation syndrome. Testing Pulse oximetry should be done in all patients, and a chest x-ray should be done as well unless symptoms are clearly caused by a mild or moderate exacerbation of a known condition. For example, patients with asthma or heart failure do not require an x-ray for each flare-up, unless clinical findings suggest another cause or an unusually severe attack. Most adults should have an ECG to detect myocardial ischemia (and serum cardiac marker testing if suspicion is high) unless myocardial ischemia can be excluded clinically. In patients with severe or deteriorating respiratory status, arterial blood gases (ABGs) should be measured to more precisely quantify hypoxemia, measure PaCO2, diagnose any acid-base disorders Acid-Base Disorders Acid-base disorders are pathologic changes in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2) or serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) that typically produce abnormal arterial pH values.\n【12】 Patients who have no clear diagnosis after chest x-ray and ECG and are at moderate or high risk of having pulmonary embolism (from a clinical prediction rule) should undergo CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion scanning. Patients who are at low risk may have D-dimer testing (a normal D-dimer level effectively rules out pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient). Chronic dyspnea may warrant additional tests, such as CT, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and bronchoscopy.\n【13】Treatment of Dyspnea Treatment is correction of the underlying disorder. Hypoxemia (in the absence of compensatory hyperventilation) is treated with supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation > 88% or PaO2 > 55 mm Hg (> 7.3 kPa) because levels above these thresholds provide adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Levels below these thresholds are on the steep portion of the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve, where even a small decline in arterial oxygen tension can result in a large decline in hemoglobin saturation. Oxygen saturation should be maintained at > 93% if myocardial or cerebral ischemia is a concern, although data suggest that supplemental oxygen is not beneficial in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction unless the patient has hypoxia. Morphine 0.5 to 5 mg IV helps reduce anxiety and the discomfort of dyspnea in various conditions, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and the dyspnea that commonly accompanies terminal illness. However, opioids can be deleterious in patients with acute airflow limitation (eg, asthma, COPD) because they suppress the ventilatory drive and can worsen respiratory acidemia. Key Points Pulse oximetry is a key component of the examination. Low oxygen saturation (< 90%) indicates a serious problem, but normal saturation does not rule one out. Accessory muscle use, a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, or a decreased level of consciousness requires emergency evaluation and hospitalization. Myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism are relatively common, but symptoms and signs can be nonspecific.

Dilated funduscopic findings are diagnostic; color photographs, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography assist in confirming the diagnosis and in directing treatment. Treatment is with dietary supplements, intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs, laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, and low-vision devices. AMD is the leading cause of permanent, irreversible vision loss in older adults. It is more common among White people. Etiology of AMD Risk factors include the following: Age Genetic variants (eg, abnormal complement factor H) Family history Smoking Cardiovascular disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas.\n【1】 About 85% of people with AMD have only dry AMD. Wet (exudative or neovascular): Wet AMD occurs in about 15% of people. Although only 15% of patients with AMD have the wet form, 80 to 90% of the severe vision loss caused by AMD results from wet AMD. Dry AMD causes changes of the retinal pigment epithelium, typically visible as dark pinpoint areas. The retinal pigment epithelium plays a critical role in keeping the cones and rods healthy and functioning well. Accumulation of waste products from the rods and cones can result in drusen, which appear as yellow spots. Areas of chorioretinal atrophy (referred to as geographic atrophy) occur in more advanced cases of dry AMD. There is no elevated macular scar (disciform scar), edema, hemorrhage, or exudation. Wet AMD occurs when new abnormal blood vessels develop under the retina in a process called choroidal neovascularization (abnormal new vessel formation). Localized macular edema or hemorrhage may elevate an area of the macula or cause a localized retinal pigment epithelial detachment. Eventually, untreated neovascularization causes a disciform scar under the macula. Symptoms and Signs of AMD Dry AMD The loss of central vision occurs over years and is painless, and most patients retain enough vision to read and drive. Central blind spots (scotomas) usually occur late in the disease and can sometimes become severe. Symptoms are usually bilateral. Funduscopic changes include the following: Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium Drusen Areas of chorioretinal atrophy Wet AMD Rapid vision loss, usually over days to weeks, is more typical of wet AMD. The first symptom is usually visual distortion, such as a central blind spot (scotoma) or curving of straight lines (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision and color vision are generally unaffected; however, the patient may become legally blind (< 20/200 vision) in the affected eye, particularly if AMD is not treated. Wet AMD usually affects one eye at a time; thus, symptoms of wet AMD are often unilateral. Funduscopic changes include the following: Subretinal fluid, appearing as localized retinal elevation Retinal edema Gray-green discoloration under the macula Exudates in or around the macula Detachment of retinal pigment epithelium (visible as an area of retinal elevation) Subretinal hemorrhage in or around the macula Diagnosis of AMD Funduscopic examination Color fundus photography Fluorescein angiography Optical coherence tomography Both forms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are diagnosed by funduscopic examination. Visual changes can often be detected with an Amsler grid Visual field testing . Color photography and fluorescein angiography are done when findings suggest wet AMD. Angiography shows and characterizes subretinal choroidal neovascular membranes and can delineate areas of geographic atrophy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) aids in identifying intraretinal and subretinal fluid and can help assess response to treatment. Treatment of AMD Dietary supplements for high-risk dry or unilateral wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs or laser treatments for wet AMD Supportive measures Dry AMD There is no way to reverse damage caused by dry AMD. Patients with extensive drusen, pigment changes, and/or geographic atrophy can reduce the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% by taking daily supplements of the following: Zinc oxide 80 mg Copper 2 mg Vitamin C 500 mg Vitamin E 400 IU units Lutein 10 mg/zeaxanthin 2 mg (or beta-carotene 15 mg or vitamin A 28,000 units for patients who have not smoked) In current and former smokers, beta-carotene can increase the risk of lung cancer. Substitution of beta-carotene with lutein plus zeaxanthin has been shown to have comparable efficacy ,1 Treatment references Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible central vision loss in older patients.\n【2】 Therefore, such a substitution should be considered in current or former smokers. Beta-carotene yellows the skin in some patients. The zinc component of these supplements increases risk of hospitalization for genitourinary tract disorders. Reducing cardiovascular risk factors as well as regularly eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids and dark green leafy vegetables may help slow disease progression; however, recent large trials have not shown that taking supplements of omega-3 fatty acids reduces disease progression. Wet AMD Patients with unilateral wet AMD should take the daily nutritional supplements that are recommended for dry AMD to reduce the risk of AMD-induced vision loss in the other eye. The choice of other treatments depends on the size, location, and type of neovascularization. Intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs (usually ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept) can substantially reduce the risk of vision loss and can help restore reading vision in up to one third of patients. Recently, an implantable port delivery system for ranibizumab became available for the treatment of wet AMD ,2 Treatment references Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible central vision loss in older patients.\n【3】 This is a surgically placed permanent refillable ocular implant that continuously delivers ranibizumab into the vitreous and can be refilled repeatedly. In 2020, intravitreal brolucizumab became available for the treatment of wet AMD ,3 Treatment references Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible central vision loss in older patients.\n【4】 It causes sudden, painless, unilateral, and usually severe vision loss.\n【5】 In a small subset of patients, thermal laser photocoagulation of neovascularization outside the fovea may prevent severe vision loss. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser treatment, also helps under specific circumstances. Corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone) are sometimes injected intraocularly along with an anti-VEGF drug. Other treatments, including transpupillary thermotherapy, subretinal surgery, and macular translocation surgery, are seldom used.\n【6】 Supportive measures For patients who have lost central vision, low-vision devices such as magnifiers, high-power reading glasses, large computer monitors, and telescopic lenses are available. Also, certain types of software can display computer data in large print or read information aloud in a synthetic voice. Low-vision counseling is advised. Key Points AMD is more common among White people and is the leading cause of permanent vision loss in older adults. AMD can be dry (nonexudative or atrophic) or wet (exudative or neovascular). Although 85% of AMD is dry, 80 to 90% of severe vision loss caused by AMD results from the wet type. Funduscopic changes in dry AMD include drusen, areas of chorioretinal atrophy, and changes to the retinal pigment epithelium. Funduscopic changes in wet AMD include retinal edema and localized elevation, detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium, a gray-green discoloration under the macula, and exudates in and around the macula. If patients have AMD on funduscopy, do color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Prescribe dietary supplements for unilateral wet or high-risk dry AMD.

Many anomalies are asymptomatic and diagnosed via prenatal ultrasonography or part of a routine evaluation for other congenital anomalies. Other anomalies are diagnosed during evaluation of urinary tract obstruction Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy).\n【1】 Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Incidence of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is about 1/10,000 to 1/20,000 births; it is caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene, located in chromosome 6p21. In contrast, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure.\n【2】 Symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are usually not present until adulthood. Rarely, symptoms manifest in infancy in the more aggressive form. Children may be diagnosed earlier when a cyst is found incidentally or via family history. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease affects the Kidneys Liver The kidneys are usually greatly enlarged and contain small cysts; renal failure is common in childhood. The liver is enlarged and has periportal fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and scattered cysts; the remainder of the hepatic parenchyma is normal. Fibrosis causes portal hypertension by age 5 to 10 years, but hepatic function is normal or minimally impaired. Disease severity and progression vary. Severe disease may manifest prenatally or soon after birth or in early childhood with renal-related symptoms; less severely affected patients present in late childhood or adolescence with hepatic-related symptoms. Affected neonates have a protuberant abdomen with huge, firm, smooth, symmetric kidneys. Severely affected neonates commonly have pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to the in utero effects of renal dysfunction and oligohydramnios. In patients aged 5 to 10 years, signs of portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein. It is caused most often by cirrhosis (in North America), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities.\n【3】 If the patient presents in adolescence, nephromegaly is less marked, renal insufficiency may be mild to moderate, and the major symptoms are those related to portal hypertension. Diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease may be difficult, especially without a family history. Ultrasonography may show renal or hepatic cysts; definitive diagnosis may require biopsy. Ultrasonography in late pregnancy usually allows presumptive in utero diagnosis. If postnatal ultrasonography is not definitive, MRI or CT may be diagnostic. If needed, molecular testing for PKHD1 can be done when clinical criteria is not met. Many neonates die in the first few days or weeks of life from pulmonary insufficiency. Most who survive develop progressive renal failure often requiring renal replacement therapy. Experience with renal transplantation with or without hepatic transplantation is limited. When transplantation is done, hypersplenism is cytopenia caused by splenomegaly.\n【4】 Portal hypertension may be treated by portacaval or splenorenal shunts, which reduce morbidity but not mortality. Duplication anomalies Supernumerary collecting systems may be unilateral or bilateral and may involve the renal pelvis and ureters (accessory renal pelvis, double or triple pelvis and ureter), calyx, or ureteral orifice. Duplex kidneys have a single renal unit with more than one collecting system. This anomaly differs from fused kidneys, which involves fusion of two renal parenchymal units maintaining their respective individual collecting systems. Some duplication anomalies have ureteral ectopy with or without ureterocele Ureteral anomalies frequently occur with renal anomalies but may occur independently.\n【5】 Management depends on the anatomy and function of each separately drained segment. Surgery may be necessary to correct obstruction or VUR. Fusion anomalies With fusion anomalies, the kidneys are joined, but the ureters enter the bladder on each side. These anomalies increase the risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.\n【6】 Horseshoe kidney, the most common fusion anomaly, occurs when renal parenchyma on each side of the vertebral column is joined at the corresponding (usually lower) poles; an isthmus of renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue joins at the midline. The ureters course medially and anteriorly over this isthmus and generally drain well. Obstruction, if present, is usually secondary to insertion of the ureters high in the renal pelvis. Pyeloplasty relieves the obstruction and can be done without resecting the isthmus. Overview of Horseshoe Kidney VIDEO Crossed fused renal ectopia is the second most common fusion anomaly. The renal parenchyma (representing both kidneys) is on one side of the vertebral column. One of the ureters crosses the midline and enters the bladder on the side opposite the fused kidneys. When ureteropelvic junction obstruction is present, pyeloplasty is the treatment of choice. Fused pelvic kidney (pancake kidney) is much less common. A single pelvic kidney is served by two collecting systems and ureters. If obstruction is present, reconstruction is needed. Malrotation is usually of little clinical significance. Ultrasonography often shows hydronephrosis. Further evaluation with a magnetic resonance urogram or renal scan may be done when clinicians are concerned about possible obstruction. Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) In this condition, there is a nonfunctioning renal unit consisting of noncommunicating cysts with intervening solid tissue composed of fibrosis, primitive tubules, and foci of cartilage. Usually, ureteral atresia is also present. The contralateral kidney is usually normal, but up to 10% of patients may have vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.\n【7】 Frequently, the kidney progressively involutes and eventually is no longer visible on ultrasonography. Development of tumors, infection, and/or hypertension is rare. Most experts recommend observation to monitor for involution. Nephrectomy may be considered for the presence of solid tissue, progressive enlargement, or rarely hypertension or a ruptured cyst that is causing pain. Renal agenesis Bilateral renal agenesis as part of a syndrome of oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and extremity and facial anomalies (classic Potter syndrome) is fatal within minutes to hours because of the pulmonary hypoplasia and subsequent respiratory distress. Fetal demise is common. Unilateral renal agenesis accounts for about 5% of renal anomalies. Many cases result from complete involution in utero of a multicystic dysplastic kidney. It usually is accompanied by ureteral agenesis with absence of the ipsilateral trigone and ureteral orifice. However, the ipsilateral adrenal gland is unaffected. No treatment is necessary; compensatory hypertrophy of the solitary kidney maintains normal renal function. Because the kidneys share a common embryologic origin with the vas deferens and uterus, boys may have agenesis of the vas deferens and girls may have uterine anomalies. Renal dysplasia In renal dysplasia (a histologic diagnosis), the renal vasculature, tubules, collecting ducts, or drainage apparatus develops abnormally. Diagnosis of renal dysplasia is by biopsy. If dysplasia is segmental, treatment of renal dysplasia is often unnecessary. If dysplasia is extensive, renal dysfunction may necessitate nephrologic care, including renal replacement therapy. Renal ectopia Renal ectopia (abnormal renal location) usually results when a kidney fails to ascend from its origin in the true pelvis; a rare exception occurs with a superiorly ascended (thoracic) kidney. Pelvic ectopia increases the incidence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.\n【8】 Obstruction and severe reflux may be corrected surgically when indicated (if causing hypertension, recurrent infections, or renal growth retardation). Renal hypoplasia usually occurs because inadequate ureteral bud branching causes an underdeveloped, small kidney with histologically normal nephrons. If hypoplasia is segmental, hypertension can occur, and ablative surgery may be needed. Patients should be evaluated for vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-01 21:41:53"}

Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes that cause these disorders on to their children.\n【1】 The result is a characteristic facial appearance and abnormalities of the bones, eyes, liver, and spleen, sometimes accompanied by intellectual disability. Mucopolysaccharidoses occur when parents pass the defective genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.\n【2】 Mucopolysaccharidoses occur when the body lacks enzymes needed to break down and store complex sugar molecules. Typically, symptoms include short stature, hairiness, stiff finger joints, and coarseness of the face. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical examination, and blood tests. Although a normal life span is possible, some types cause premature death. Treatment may include lifelong enzyme replacement therapy, and sometimes a bone marrow transplant. There are different types of inherited disorders Inheritance of Single-Gene Disorders Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.\n【3】 In many hereditary metabolic disorders, both parents of the affected child carry a copy of the abnormal gene. Because usually two copies of the abnormal gene are necessary for the disorder to occur, usually neither parent has the disorder. Some hereditary metabolic disorders are X-linked X-Linked Recessive Disorders , which means only one copy of the abnormal gene can cause the disorder in boys.  Complex sugar molecules called mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) are essential parts of many body tissues. In mucopolysaccharidoses, the body lacks enzymes needed to break down (metabolize) and store mucopolysaccharides. As a result, excess mucopolysaccharides enter the blood and are deposited in abnormal locations throughout the body. Types of mucopolysaccharidosis There are many types of mucopolysaccharidosis depending on which specific enzyme is missing. The types are classified by Roman numerals and sometimes also given a specific name (for example, Hurler syndrome and Hunter syndrome). Symptoms of Mucopolysaccharidoses Different types of mucopolysaccharidosis have slightly different symptoms but, in general, during infancy and childhood, short stature, hairiness, and abnormal development become noticeable. The face may appear heavy with a large head, prominent forehead, short nose, and large lips and tongue.\n【4】 In some types, vision or hearing may become impaired. The arteries or heart valves can be affected. Finger joints are often stiff.\n【5】 After birth, a doctor usually bases the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses on the symptoms and a physical examination. The presence of a mucopolysaccharidosis in other family members also suggests the diagnosis. Urine tests may help but are sometimes inaccurate. X-rays may show characteristic bone abnormalities. Mucopolysaccharidoses also are diagnosed by analyzing blood cells. Genetic testing Genetic Screening Before Pregnancy Genetic screening is used to determine whether a couple is at increased risk of having a baby with a hereditary genetic disorder.\n【6】 Other tests are done depending on symptoms. For example, children who have heart problems may undergo the imaging test echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image. It uses no x-rays.\n【7】 Prognosis for Mucopolysaccharidoses The prognosis depends on the type of mucopolysaccharidosis. A normal life span is possible. Some types, usually those that affect the heart, may cause premature death. Treatment of Mucopolysaccharidoses Enzyme replacement Sometimes bone marrow or stem cell transplantation Lifelong enzyme replacement therapy is being used to treat some mucopolysaccharidoses and may prevent the disorders from getting worse and reverse some of the complications. Bone marrow transplantation or stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder.\n【8】 However, these procedures may result in death or disability, so these treatments remain somewhat controversial.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-02 01:12:30"}

Mastitis is different from the pain and cracking of nipples that frequently accompanies the start of breastfeeding. Diagnosis of mastitis is clinical. Treatment of Mastitis Treatment of pain and complete emptying of breast milk Antistaphylococcal antibiotics Initial therapy is to manage pain and swelling with cold compresses and analgesics, such as acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. when milk ducts are full,the breast should be completely emptied via breastfeeding or pumping.

Symptoms are primarily severe neonatal cyanosis and occasionally heart failure, if there is an associated VSD. Heart sounds and murmurs vary depending on the presence of associated congenital anomalies. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Definitive treatment is surgical repair.\n【1】 DTGA: A more common variation in which the aorta is positioned to the right and front of the pulmonary artery, arising from the right ventricle rather than the left. L-TGA: A less common variation in which the aorta is positioned to the left and front of the pulmonary artery. This anomaly is usually associated with ventricular inversion due to leftward looping of the primitive heart tube, resulting in the condition commonly known as congenitally corrected transposition. Because D-TGA is by far the most common form, it is often simply called transposition.\n【2】 There are also other rare variants of the transposition of the great arteries, but D-TGA and L-TGA are the most common. Dextro-transposition of the great arteries  accounts for 5 to 7% of congenital heart anomalies. About 30 to 40% of patients have a ventricular septal defect Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an opening in the interventricular septum, causing a shunt between ventricles.\n【3】 Dextro-transposition of the great arteries Unoxygenated blood returning to the right heart enters the AO, causing severe cyanosis. Oxygenated blood returning to the LA enters the pulmonary circulation again. The RV is hypertrophied, and the foramen ovale permits minimal mixing. Atrial pressures are mean pressures. AO = aorta; IVC = inferior vena cava; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; PA = pulmonary artery; PV = pulmonary veins; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; SVC = superior vena cava. Pathophysiology of TGA Systemic and pulmonary circulations are completely separated in transposition of the great arteries. After returning to the right heart, desaturated systemic venous blood is pumped into the systemic circulation without being oxygenated in the lungs; oxygenated blood entering the left heart goes back to the lungs rather than to the rest of the body. This anomaly is not compatible with life unless desaturated and oxygenated blood can mix through openings at one or more levels (eg, atrial, ventricular, or great artery level). Overview of Transposition of the Great Arteries VIDEO Symptoms and Signs of TGA Severe cyanosis occurs within hours of birth, followed rapidly by metabolic acidosis secondary to poor tissue oxygenation. Patients with a moderate or large atrial septal defect Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an opening in the interatrial septum, causing a left-to-right shunt and volume overload of the right atrium and right ventricle.\n【4】 Except for generalized cyanosis, physical examination is rather unremarkable. Heart murmurs may be absent unless associated anomalies are present. The 2nd heart sound (S2) is single and loud. Diagnosis of TGA Chest x-ray and ECG Echocardiography Diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries is suspected clinically, supported by chest x-ray and ECG, and established by 2-dimensional echocardiography with color flow and Doppler studies. On chest x-ray, the cardiac shadow may have the classic egg-on-a-string appearance with a narrow upper mediastinum. ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy but may be normal for a neonate. Cardiac catheterization is not usually necessary for diagnosis but may be done to enlarge the atrial communication (balloon atrial septostomy) or to further elucidate complex coronary artery anatomy. Treatment of TGA Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion Sometimes balloon atrial septostomy Surgical repair Unless arterial oxygen saturation is only mildly decreased and the atrial communication is adequate, a PGE1 infusion may help by opening and maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus; this infusion increases pulmonary blood flow, which may promote left-to-right atrial shunting, leading to improved systemic oxygenation. However, if the patent foramen ovale has a small opening, PGE1 may have the opposite effect because the increased blood return to the left atrium may close the flap of the foramen ovale, leading to decreased mixing, along with elevation of left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema. Also, opening the ductus may decrease systemic blood flow. Thus, PGE1 must be used with caution and patients must be monitored closely. Metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilatory support. Pearls & Pitfalls PGE1 infusion is usually helpful in D-TGA, but it can be harmful if the patent foramen ovale is small. For severely hypoxemic neonates who do not immediately respond to PGE1 or who have a very restrictive foramen ovale, cardiac catheterization and balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure) can immediately improve systemic arterial oxygen saturation. A balloon-tipped catheter is advanced into the left atrium through the patent foramen ovale. The balloon is inflated and abruptly withdrawn to the right atrium to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum. As an alternative to taking the neonate to the catheterization laboratory, the septostomy procedure can be done at the bedside under echocardiographic guidance. Definitive repair of D-TGA is the arterial switch (Jatene) operation, typically done during the first week of life. The proximal portions of the great arteries are transected, the coronary arteries are transplanted to the native pulmonary root, which will become the neoaortic root, the aorta is connected to the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle. Survival rate after surgery is > 95%. An associated VSD should be closed at the time of primary repair unless it is small and hemodynamically insignificant. Native pulmonic stenosis is problematic unless it is mild because pulmonic stenosis will effectively become aortic stenosis after the arterial switch procedure. If pulmonic stenosis is moderate or severe, other surgical options may need to be considered.\n【5】 This operation reconstructed the atrial septum and placed an intra-atrial baffle to divert the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava return to the left ventricle and the pulmonary venous return to the right ventricle.\n【6】 However, these patients have a very high incidence of the long-term sequelae of dysfunction of the systemic right ventricle, atrial arrhythmias, and baffle obstructions. Because of those sequelae, the arterial switch procedure became the preferred approach once it was technically feasible. Endocarditis prophylaxis Prevention Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.\n【7】 3.\n【8】 Key Points In dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA), the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in independent pulmonary and systemic circulations. D-TGA is incompatible with life unless mixing of the circulations occurs through an atrial and/or ventricular septal opening, or a patent ductus. Severe cyanosis occurs within hours of birth, followed rapidly by metabolic acidosis; there are no murmurs unless other anomalies are present. Relieve cyanosis by giving prostaglandin E1 infusion to keep the ductus arteriosus open and sometimes by using a balloon catheter to enlarge the foramen ovale.

Your heart rate is how fast your heart beats. Your heart should always have a regular, rhythmic beat, like the ticking of a clock. What is an abnormal heart rhythm? Abnormal heart rhythms are heartbeats that are: Irregular Too fast (tachycardia) Too slow (bradycardia) Abnormal heart rhythms are also called arrhythmias. Most common arrhythmias do not cause symptoms, are harmless, and do not need treatment Heart disorders are the most common cause of an abnormal heart rhythm You may feel fine, but sometimes you can feel your abnormal heart rhythm ,what you feel is called palpitations are the awareness of heartbeats. The sensation may feel like pounding, fluttering, racing, or skipping beats.\n【1】 It's quick, painless, and harmless. The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram.\n【2】 The Conduction System VIDEO Pacemaker cells send out regular electrical signals to your heart muscle to make it contract The pacemaker cells have their own natural rhythm of 60 to 100 signals per minute. However, nerves from your brain can send messages to the cells telling them to speed up or slow down. Your heart's conduction system has tiny strips of tissue sort of like electrical wires. The conduction system carries the pacemaker signals to the rest of your heart The conduction system includes a gateway called the AV node (atrioventricular node). The AV node controls how signals pass from the upper chambers of your heart (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles). When the conduction system is working properly, the signals get to each of your heart muscle cells at just the right time so your heart gives a good, strong beat that pumps blood properly. Hormones, such as thyroid hormone What are thyroid hormones? Your thyroid is a gland below the Adam’s apple in the front of your neck. Glands make and release hormones. Hormones stimulate other cells or tissues into action.\n【3】 Many drugs, medicines, and chemicals also affect your heart rhythm. You also need the right balance of minerals ,electrolytes Overview of Electrolytes are minerals that circulate in your blood. These minerals are also in your stomach juices, in your stool (poop), in your urine, and inside your body's tissues.\n【4】 What causes abnormal heart rhythms? Your heart rhythm can become abnormal if there's a problem with: Your pacemaker cells Your heart's conducting system Chemicals and drugs in your blood The most common cause of a heart rhythm problem is a heart disorder, such as: Coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) The heart is a muscle that pumps blood. Like all muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of blood to work. Blood that pumps through the heart doesn't feed the heart muscle.\n【5】 Your heart has four chambers. The atria are the two upper chambers in your heart—the right atrium and the left atrium.\n【6】 Four heart valves control how blood flows in and out of your heart.\n【7】 Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should.\n【8】 This can damage the pacemaker cells or the conducting system. Other causes of abnormal heart rhythms include: Medicines Heart abnormalities you were born with Sometimes doctors can't tell what's causing your abnormal heart rhythm. What are the symptoms of an abnormal heart rhythm? Your symptoms depend mainly on whether your heart is: Pumping enough blood Not pumping enough blood If your heart is pumping enough blood, you may feel normal. Or you may feel like your heart is skipping beats (called palpitations). Some people say strong palpitations may feel like a fish flopping around in their chest. If your heart is not pumping enough blood, you also may have: Weakness Problems exercising Shortness of breath Feeling light-headed or dizzy Chest pain Fainting Go to the doctor if you have any of these symptoms. How can doctors tell if I have an abnormal heart rhythm? Doctors feel your pulse and do: An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. It's quick, painless, and harmless. The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram.\n【9】 Doctors then may have you: Wear a small device under your clothes that records your heart's electrical activity for a day or more ,event monitor Continuous Ambulatory Electrocardiography A standard electrocardiograph (ECG) records the heart's electrical activity for only a few seconds.\n【10】 You'll be in a unit where your heart rate and rhythm can be recorded and seen by the nurses and doctors.\n【11】 The doctor puts a thin plastic tube (catheter) through an artery and into your heart.\n【12】 Doctors insert a thin flexible tube (catheter) into a large blood vessel (for example, one in your leg) and thread it up into your heart. The catheter has electrodes on its tip that record your heart's electrical activity from the inside. The catheter can also stimulate your heart electrically to see how it responds. How do doctors treat abnormal heart rhythms? Some abnormal heart rhythms are harmless and don’t need treatment. Sometimes, lifestyle changes help, such as: Changing or stopping one of your medicines Not drinking alcohol or caffeine Not smoking Not doing heavy exercise (if an abnormal heart rhythm happens during exercise) Different abnormal rhythms require different treatment. Doctors may use: Medicines An artificial pacemaker (a small electrical device that doctors put in your chest or belly to signal your heart when to beat) An electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm (called cardioversion, defibrillation, or electroversion) A treatment called ablation to destroy the abnormal heart tissue Artificial pacemakers sometimes include a defibrillator so the same device can trigger a normal heart beat or stop an abnormal rhythm with a shock. This combination device is called an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). Doctors do ablation if they find that one small bit of heart tissue is causing the abnormal rhythm. Getting rid of the tissue often gets rid of the rhythm problem. Often they do ablation during electrophysiologic testing. They use a catheter to deliver a high-frequency electrical current that destroys a small area of the heart.

Treatment involves antibiotics to prevent infections and immune globulin, but the only effective treatments are stem cell transplantation and possibly gene therapy.  Severe combined immunodeficiency is a serious, potentially fatal immunodeficiency disorder. It is present at birth and can be caused by mutations in many different genes. All forms are hereditary. The most common form results from a mutation in a gene on the X (sex) chromosome ,called an X-linked disorder X-Linked Inheritance Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.\n【3】 Another form is usually inherited as an autosomal (not sex-linked) recessive Inheritance of Single-Gene Disorders Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.\n【4】 That is, two genes for the disorder, one from each parent, are required. Another form of the disorder is due to a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase. This enzyme breaks down a toxic substance in white blood cells, If there is not enough adenosine deaminase, the toxic substance builds up, killing the white blood cells. Thus, there are fewer white blood cells to fight infection.\n【5】 Natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that recognizes and kills abnormal cells (such as certain infected cells and cancer cells). In people with severe combined immunodeficiency, the immune system provides virtually no protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The result is repeated and persistent infections. Symptoms of SCID Most infants with severe combined immunodeficiency develop pneumonia, persistent viral infections, thrush Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by several species of the yeast Candida, especially Candida albicans.\n【6】 More serious infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in Immunocompromised People Pneumonia is infection of the lungs.\n【7】 As a result, infants do not grow and develop normally ,called failure to thrive Failure to Thrive in Children Failure to thrive is a delay in weight gain and physical growth that can lead to delays in development and maturation.\n【8】 They may have peeling rashes. All infants with this disorder have a severely underdeveloped thymus gland. If not treated, these children usually die before age 1 year. Diagnosis of SCID Blood tests Possibly a screening test for newborns Symptoms suggest the disorder. Blood tests are done to measure the number of B and T cells and immunoglobulin levels and to evaluate how well B and T cells are functioning. Some experts recommend screening all newborns for severe combined immunodeficiency with a blood test that determines whether they have abnormal or too few T cells—called the T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) test. TREC testing of all newborns is now required in many U.S. states. Identifying infants with this disorder early can help prevent their death at a young age. Doctors may use genetic tests to identify the specific mutation causing the disorder and thus help determine how severe the disorder is and what the prognosis is. Treatment of SCID Reverse isolation Antibiotics, antifungal drugs, and immune globulin to prevent infections Stem cell transplantation Sometimes replacement of adenosine deaminase or gene therapy People with this disorder are kept in a protected environment to prevent exposure to possible infections (called reverse isolation ). In the past, children with this disorder were kept in strict isolation, sometimes in a plastic tent, leading to the disorder being called bubble boy syndrome. Treatment with antibiotics and immune globulin (antibodies obtained from the blood of people with a normal immune system) helps prevent infections but does not cure the disorder. The only effective treatment is transplantation of stem cells Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. . If transplantation is done by age 3 months, 96% of infants survive. If adenosine deaminase is deficient and transplantation is not possible, replacement of that enzyme, given by injection, can be partially effective. Gene therapy may be effective, depending on which form of severe combined immunodeficiency is present. Gene therapy consists of removing some white blood cells from the infant’s bone marrow, inserting a normal gene into the cells, and returning the cells to the infant.

Causes include obstructive uropathy Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy).\n【2】 They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【3】 Pathologically, there is atrophy and calyceal deformity with overlying parenchymal scarring. Chronic pyelonephritis may progress to chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.\n【4】 Patients with chronic pyelonephritis may have residual foci of infection that may predispose to bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.\n【5】 Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) is an unusual variant that appears to represent an abnormal inflammatory response to infection. Giant cells, lipid-laden macrophages, and cholesterol clefts account for the yellow color of the infected tissue. The kidney is enlarged, and perirenal fibrosis and adhesions to adjacent retroperitoneal structures are common. The disorder is almost always unilateral and most often occurs in middle-aged women with a history of recurrent UTIs. Long-term urinary tract obstruction ,usually by a calculus Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【6】 The most common pathogens are Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Symptoms and Signs Symptoms and signs are often vague and inconsistent. Some patients have fever, flank or abdominal pain, malaise, or anorexia. In xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, a unilateral mass can usually be palpated. Diagnosis Urinalysis and urine culture Imaging Chronic pyelonephritis is suspected in patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys.\n【7】 However, most patients, except for children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), do not have such a history. Sometimes the diagnosis is suspected because typical findings are incidentally noted on an imaging study. Symptoms, because they are vague and nonspecific, may not suggest the diagnosis. Urinalysis In patients with renal disorders, symptoms and signs may be nonspecific, absent until the disorder is severe, or both.\n【8】 Urinary sediment is usually scant, but renal epithelial cells, granular casts, and occasionally white blood cell (WBC) casts are present. Proteinuria is almost always present and can be in the nephrotic range if VUR causes extensive renal damage. When both kidneys are involved, defects in concentrating ability and hyperchloremic acidosis may appear before significant azotemia occurs. Urine culture may be sterile or positive, usually for gram-negative organisms. Initial imaging is usually with ultrasonography, helical CT, or intravenous urography (IVU). The hallmark of chronic pyelonephritis (usually with reflux or obstruction) on imaging is classically a large, deep, segmental, coarse cortical scar usually extending to one or more of the renal calyces. The upper pole is the most common site. Renal cortex is lost, and the renal parenchyma thins. Uninvolved renal tissue may hypertrophy locally with segmental enlargement. Ureteral dilation may be present, reflecting the changes induced by chronic severe reflux. Similar changes can occur with urinary tract tuberculosis Genitourinary tuberculosis outside the lung usually results from hematogenous dissemination. Sometimes infection directly extends from an adjacent organ.\n【9】 In xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, urine cultures almost always grow P. mirabilis or E. coli. CT imaging is done to detect calculi Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection.\n【10】 Imaging shows an avascular mass with a variable degree of extension around the kidney. Sometimes, to differentiate cancer ,eg, renal cell carcinoma Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer. Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO).\n【11】 Prognosis The course of chronic pyelonephritis is extremely variable, but the disease typically progresses very slowly. Most patients have adequate renal function for ≥ 20 years after onset. Frequent exacerbations of acute pyelonephritis, although controlled, usually further deteriorate renal structure and function. Continued obstruction predisposes to or perpetuates pyelonephritis and increases intrapelvic pressure, which damages the kidney directly. Treatment Correction of the obstruction Long-term antibiotic therapy Sometimes nephrectomy, sometimes followed by renal transplantation If obstruction cannot be eliminated and recurrent urinary tract infections are common, long-term therapy with antibiotics (eg, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, a fluoroquinolone, nitrofurantoin) is useful and may be required indefinitely. Complications of uremia or hypertension Hypertensive Emergencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys).\n【12】 For xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, an initial course of antibiotics should be given to control local infection, followed by en bloc nephrectomy with removal of all involved tissue. Patients undergoing renal transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation.\n【13】 Key Points Chronic pyelonephritis usually affects patients predisposed to urinary reflux into the renal pelvis (eg, by VUR, obstructive uropathy, or struvite calculi). Suspect chronic pyelonephritis if patients have recurrent acute pyelonephritis, but the diagnosis is often first suspected based on incidental findings on imaging.

Diagnosis is made using clinical criteria and/or molecular genetic testing. Treatment is with surgery or sometimes radiation therapy or, for retinal angiomas, laser coagulation or cryotherapy. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a neurocutaneous syndrome that occurs in 1 of 36,000 people and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait Autosomal Dominant Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood.\n【1】 The VHL gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25.3). Over 1500 different mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with VHL. In 20% of affected people, the abnormal gene appears to be a new mutation. VHL most commonly causes Cerebellar hemangioblastomas Retinal angiomas Tumors, including pheochromocytomas Pheochromocytoma A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of chromaffin cells typically located in the adrenals. It causes persistent or paroxysmal hypertension.\n【2】 About 10% of people with VHL develop an endolymphatic tumor in the inner ear, threatening hearing. Risk of developing renal cell carcinoma Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer. Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO).\n【3】 Manifestations typically appear between ages 10 and 30 but can appear earlier. Symptoms and Signs of VHL Symptoms of Von Hippel-Lindau depend on the size and location of the tumors. Symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, weakness, ataxia, impaired vision, and high blood pressure. Retinal angiomas, detected by direct ophthalmoscopy, appear as a dilated artery leading from the disk to a peripheral tumor with an engorged vein. These angiomas are usually asymptomatic, but if they are centrally located and enlarge, they can result in substantial loss of vision. These tumors increase risk of retinal detachment, macular edema, and glaucoma. Untreated, VHL can result in blindness, brain damage, or death. Death usually results from complications of cerebellar hemangioblastomas or renal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis of VHL Direct ophthalmoscopy Central nervous system imaging, typically MRI Sometimes molecular genetic testing Von Hippel-Lindau disease is diagnosed when one of the following criteria is met: Family history of VHL and presence of ≥ 1 VHL tumor (retinal, brain, or spinal hemangioblastoma; pheochromocytoma; renal cell carcinoma; or pancreatic endocrine tumor) Two or more characteristic VHL tumors in patients with no known family history of VHL If clinical features are not conclusive, the diagnosis can also be established by using molecular genetic testing to identify a VHL gene mutation. If a specific mutation for the VHL gene is identified in a patient, genetic testing should be done to determine whether at-risk family members also have that mutation. Treatment of VHL Surgery or sometimes radiation therapy For retinal angiomas, laser coagulation or cryotherapy Regular monitoring Treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau often involves surgical removal of the tumor before it becomes harmful. Pheochromocytomas are surgically removed; sometimes continued treatment of hypertension Treatment Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.\n【4】 Renal cell carcinomas are surgically removed; advanced cancers may respond to pharmacologic treatment Palliative treatments Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer. Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO).\n【5】 Some tumors can be treated with focused high-dose radiation. Belzutifan, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha inhibitor, is now available for use in adult patients with renal cell carcinomas, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic endocrine tumors that do not require immediate surgical removal. The recommended dosage is 120 mg orally once a day. This drug can be used until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Typically, retinal angiomas are treated with laser coagulation or cryotherapy to preserve vision. Use of propranolol to reduce the size of the hemangiomas is being studied. Screening to check for complications and early treatment can improve prognosis.

Infection is usually acquired by eating undercooked freshwater fish. Most infections are asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, indigestion, fatigue, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is by identifying eggs in the feces or duodenal contents. Treatment is with praziquantel or albendazole. Flukes are parasitic flatworms that infect various parts of the body (eg, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver) depending on the species. Clonorchis is endemic in East Asia (China, South Korea, northern Vietnam, Taiwan, and parts of Russia), and infection occurs elsewhere among immigrants and people eating raw or undercooked fish, or sometimes shrimp, from endemic areas. The number of people infected with C. sinensis is growing, from an estimated 7 million in the 1990s to 15 million worldwide in the 2000s. Pathophysiology of Clonorchiasis Adult forms of C. sinensis live in the bile ducts. Eggs are passed in the stool and ingested by snails. Cercariae (free-swimming larvae) released from infected snails subsequently infect a variety of freshwater fish and shrimp. Humans become infected by eating raw, undercooked, dried, salted, or pickled fish, or less commonly freshwater shrimp, containing encysted metacercariae (resting or maturing stage). Metacercariae are released in the duodenum, enter the common bile duct through the ampulla of Vater, and migrate to smaller intrahepatic ducts (or occasionally the gallbladder and pancreatic ducts), where they mature into adults in about 1 month. The adults may live ≥ 25 years and grow to about 10 to 25 mm by 3 to 5 mm. Some U.S. Vietnam veterans have had serologic evidence of exposure to liver fluke infection when tested 5 decades after the war ended, but none had detectable liver fluke parasites by fecal examination ,1 Symptoms and signs references Clonorchiasis is infection with the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Infection is usually acquired by eating undercooked freshwater fish.\n【1】 Symptoms and Signs of Clonorchiasis Light trematode infections are usually asymptomatic; symptoms typically occur in patients with a greater worm burden and longer duration of infection. In the acute phase, heavier infections can cause fever, chills, epigastric pain, tender hepatomegaly, mild jaundice, and eosinophilia. Later, diarrhea may occur. Symptoms usually last for 2 to 4 weeks. Chronic cholangitis in heavy infections may progress to atrophy of liver parenchyma and portal fibrosis Hepatic Fibrosis Hepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing in which excessive connective tissue builds up in the liver. The extracellular matrix is overproduced, degraded deficiently, or both.\n【2】 Jaundice may occur if a mass of flukes obstructs the biliary tree. Other complications include suppurative cholangitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and, late in the course, cholangiocarcinoma Primary liver cancer is usually hepatocellular carcinoma. The first manifestations of liver cancer are usually nonspecific, delaying the diagnosis.\n【3】 Vietnam veterans who develop cholangiocarcinoma may have been infected with Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis viverrini while they served in Southeast Asia ,1 Symptoms and signs references Clonorchiasis is infection with the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. Infection is usually acquired by eating undercooked freshwater fish.\n【4】 The risk of cholangiocarcinoma is increased in parts of South East Asia and mortality is more common in men aged 40 to 65 years.\n【5】 eCollection 2015. Diagnosis of Clonorchiasis Microscopic examination of stool Diagnosis of clonorchiasis is by finding eggs in the feces or duodenal contents. Eggs typically become detectable in the stool only 3 to 4 weeks after infection. The eggs are difficult to distinguish from those of Opisthorchis. Occasionally, the diagnosis is made by identifying adult flukes in surgical specimens or by doing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Other tests are nondiagnostic but may be abnormal; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin may be elevated. High levels of circulating eosinophils and serum IgE are also common. Eosinophilia distinguishes liver fluke infection from acute viral hepatis Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies.\n【6】 A plain abdominal x-ray occasionally shows intrahepatic calcification. Hepatic ultrasonography, CT, MRI, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or cholangiography may show ductal irregularities and evidence of scarring. Ultrasound screening for periductal fibrosis in high risk patients (male, >50 years old) in endemic areas can improve early detection of cholangiocarcinoma and thus survival rate ,1 Symptoms and signs references Clonorchiasis is infection with the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis.

Most people become infected when they inhale dust or eat food contaminated with the urine, feces, or another body fluid of an infected mouse or hamster. Most people with lymphocytic choriomeningitis have no or mild symptoms, but some have a flu-like illness, and a few develop meningitis or a brain infection. To diagnose lymphocytic choriomeningitis, doctors do a spinal tap and blood tests to check for the virus. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, but if people have meningitis or a brain infection, they are hospitalized and may be given an antiviral drug. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is caused by an arenavirus Arenaviruses Arbovirus, arenavirus, and filovirus are viruses that are spread from animals to people and, with some viruses, from people to people. The animal involved depends on the type of virus.\n【1】 Usually, people become infected when they inhale dust or eat food contaminated with the urine, feces, or another body fluid of an infected hamster or gray house mouse. When lymphocytic choriomeningitis is transmitted by mice, it occurs mainly in adults during the autumn and winter. Symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Most people with lymphocytic choriomeningitis have no or mild symptoms. Symptoms, if they occur, develop about 1 to 2 weeks after people are infected. Some people have a flu-like illness, with fever, chills, a general feeling of illness (malaise), weakness, muscle aches (especially in the lower back), and pain behind the eyes. People may be sensitive to light, lose their appetite, and feel nauseated or light-headed. Sore throat occurs less often. After 5 days to 3 weeks, people usually improve for 1 or 2 days. Many of them then worsen. Fever and headache return, and a rash may appear. The joints of the fingers and hands may swell. Infection may spread to the salivary glands ,causing mumps is a contagious viral infection that causes painful enlargement of the salivary glands.

Ankylosing spondylitis is 3 times more frequent in men than in women and begins most often between ages 20 and 40. It is 10 to 20 times more common among 1st-degree relatives of patients with ankylosing spondylitis than in the general population. The human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) allele is present in 90% of White patients with ankylosing spondylitis, but it is also present in up to 10% of the general population depending on ethnicity. The risk of ankylosing spondylitis in 1st-degree relatives with the HLA-B27 allele is about 20%. Increased prevalence of HLA-B27 in White people or HLA-B7 in Black people supports a genetic predisposition. However, the concordance rate in identical twins is only about 50%, suggesting that environmental factors contribute. Classification of Ankylosing Spondylitis Most patients have predominantly axial involvement (called axial ankylosing spondylitis). Some have predominately peripheral involvement. Among those with axial involvement, some have no evidence of sacroiliitis on plain x-rays. Thus, some experts have classified ankylosing spondylitis as follows: Axial ankylosing spondylitis: Has predominantly axial involvement and findings typical of bilateral sacroiliitis on imaging Nonradiographic ankylosing spondylitis: Clinically similar to axial ankylosing spondylitis but without findings typical of sacroiliitis on imaging Peripheral ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis with predominantly peripheral involvement Symptoms and Signs of Ankylosing Spondylitis The most frequent manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis is inflammatory back pain, but disease can begin in peripheral joints, especially in children and women, and rarely with acute iridocyclitis (iritis, anterior uveitis). Other early symptoms and signs are diminished chest expansion from diffuse costovertebral involvement, and occasionally fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and anemia. Back pain—often nocturnal and of varying intensity—eventually becomes recurrent. Morning stiffness, typically relieved by activity, and paraspinal muscle spasm develop. A flexed or bent-over posture eases back pain and paraspinal muscle spasm; thus, kyphosis is common in untreated patients. Severe hip and shoulder arthritis can eventually develop and usually has a poor prognosis. In late stages, the patient has accentuated kyphosis, loss of lumbar lordosis, and fixed bent-forward posturing, with compromised pulmonary function and inability to lie flat. There may be peripheral potentially deforming joint involvement, sometimes involving isolated digits diffusely (dactylitis). Achilles and patellar tendinitis can occur. Systemic manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis occur in one third of patients. Recurrent, acute anterior uveitis is common and usually responds to local therapy; less commonly it becomes protracted and severe enough to impair vision. Neurologic signs occasionally result from compression radiculitis or sciatica, vertebral fracture or subluxation, or cauda equina syndrome. Cardiovascular manifestations can include aortic insufficiency, aortitis, angina, pericarditis, and cardiac conduction abnormalities (which may be asymptomatic). Dyspnea, cough, or hemoptysis can rarely result from nontuberculous fibrosis or cavitation of an upper lobe of the lung; cavitary lesions can become secondarily infected with Aspergillus. Nonspecific colitis has been noted in 30% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Subcutaneous nodules, like those in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, do not develop in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis Lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac joint radiography Blood tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, human leukocyte antigen B27 [HLA-B27], and complete blood count) or explicit clinical criteria (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria) Pelvic/spine MRI in select patients Ankylosing spondylitis should be suspected in patients, particularly young men, with nocturnal back pain plus prolonged morning stiffness and kyphosis, diminished chest expansion, Achilles or patellar tendinitis, or unexplained anterior uveitis Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well.\n【2】 A 1st-degree relative with ankylosing spondylitis should raise suspicion. Patients should generally be tested with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood count. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies are needed only if peripheral arthritis suggests other diagnoses. The HLA-B27 allele is present in 90% of White patients with ankylosing spondylitis, but it is also present in up to 10% of the general population depending on ethnicity. No laboratory test is diagnostic, but results can increase suspicion for the disorder or rule out other disorders that can simulate ankylosing spondylitis. If, after these tests, ankylosing spondylitis is still suspected, patients should undergo x-ray or MRI of the lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac joints; demonstration of sacroiliitis on x-ray strongly supports the diagnosis. Some patients should undergo pelvic MRI to look for sacroiliitis that is not seen on x-rays. In these patients, MRI shows osteitis or early erosions.\n【3】 They are useful in diagnosing patients earlier in the disease process, particularly those without spondyloarthritis on imaging. The ASAS criteria for axial spondyloarthritis are applied to patients who have had back pain for > 3 months and who are < 45 years of age at onset. Diagnosis can be done using ASAS imaging or clinical criteria. To fulfill the imaging criteria, patients must have radiographic or MRI evidence of sacroiliitis plus at least 1 spondyloarthritis feature. To fulfill the clinical criteria, patients must have HLA-B27 plus at least 2 separate spondyloarthritis features. ASAS spondyloarthritis features include the following: Dactylitis Enthesitis of the heel Family history of spondyloarthritis History of inflammatory back pain Arthritis Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales.\n【4】 However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well.\n【5】 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and other acute-phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein) are inconsistently elevated in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Tests for RF and antinuclear antibodies are negative. The HLA-B27 genetic marker is minimally helpful because positive and negative predictive values are low. The earliest x-ray abnormalities are pseudo-widening caused by subchondral erosions, followed by sclerosis or later narrowing and eventually fusion in the sacroiliac joints. Changes are symmetric. Early changes in the spine are upper lumbar vertebral squaring with sclerosis at the corners (shiny corner sign), spotty ligamentous calcification, and one or two evolving syndesmophytes. Late changes result in a “bamboo spine” appearance, resulting from prominent syndesmophytes, diffuse paraspinal ligamentous calcification, and osteoporosis; these changes develop in some patients on average over 10 years. Changes typical of ankylosing spondylitis may not become visible on plain x-rays for years. MRI shows changes earlier, but there is no consensus regarding its role in routine diagnosis given the lack of prospective, validated data in regard to its diagnostic utility. Pelvic MRI should be done if the index of suspicion of spondyloarthritis is high or if there is a need to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms. MRI shows early inflammatory changes, bone marrow edema on T2-weighted images with fatty changes, and subtle structural abnormalities. Lastly, routine monitoring of radiographic changes with serial spine x-rays is not recommended. Differential diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis Mechanical back pain: A herniated intervertebral disk can cause back pain and radiculopathy similar to ankylosing spondylitis, but the pain is limited to the spine and nerve roots, usually causes more sudden symptoms, and causes no systemic manifestations or laboratory test abnormalities. If necessary, CT or MRI can differentiate it from ankylosing spondylitis. Involvement of a single sacroiliac joint suggests a different spondyloarthropathy or possibly infection.\n【6】 Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): DISH occurs primarily in men > 50 years and may resemble ankylosing spondylitis clinically and on x-ray. Patients uncommonly have spinal pain, stiffness, and insidious loss of motion. X-ray findings in DISH include large ossifications anterior to spinal ligaments (the calcification appears as if someone poured candle wax in front and on the right side of the vertebrae), bridging several vertebrae (usually 4 vertebral bodies) and usually starting at the lower thoracic spine, eventually affecting the cervical and lumbar spine. There is often subperiosteal bone growth along the pelvic brim and at insertion of tendons (such as the Achilles tendon insertion). However, the anterior spinal ligament is intact and frequently bulging, and sacroiliac and spinal apophyseal joints are not eroded. Additional differentiating features of DISH are stiffness that is usually not markedly accentuated in the morning and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Osteitis condensans ilii: Generally, osteitis condensans ilii manifests as sclerotic triangles on the iliac side of lower third of the sacroiliac joint in young multiparous females without any bony erosions. This radiographic finding does not require treatment. In general, the HLA-B27 allele is not present in patients with osteitis condensans ilii.\n【7】 Prognosis for Ankylosing Spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by mild or moderate flares of active inflammation alternating with periods of little or no inflammation. Proper treatment in most patients results in minimal or no disability and in a full, productive life despite back stiffness. Occasionally, the course is severe and progressive, resulting in pronounced incapacitating deformities. Poor prognostic factors include persistently high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, hip involvement, poor response to NSAIDs, presence of anterior uveitis, or heart or pulmonary disease. Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists, or interleukin-17 (IL-17) antagonists (eg, secukinumab, ixekizumab) Exercises and supportive measures The goals of treatment of ankylosing spondylitis are relieving pain, maintaining joint range of motion, and preventing end-organ damage. Because the condition may cause lung fibrosis, cigarette smoking is discouraged.  NSAIDs Nonopioid Analgesics Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain.\n【8】 Most NSAIDs work in ankylosing spondylitis, and tolerance and toxicity dictate drug choice. The daily dose of NSAIDs should be as low as possible, but maximum doses may be needed with active disease. Drug withdrawal should be attempted only slowly, after systemic and joint signs of active disease have been suppressed for several months. Sulfasalazine may help reduce peripheral joint symptoms and laboratory markers of inflammation in some patients. Dosage should be started at 500 mg/day and increased by 500 mg/day at 1-week intervals to 1 to 1.5 g 2 times a day maintenance; because acute neutropenia can occur, cell counts must be monitored when initiating therapy or increasing drug dose. Peripheral joint symptoms may also abate with methotrexate, but spinal symptoms are usually not reduced. Clinical studies have provided inconsistent results regarding efficacy of these medications. TNF-alpha antagonists (eg, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) are often strikingly effective treatments for inflammatory back pain. Adalimumab or infliximab are preferred over etanercept for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in patients with recurrent uveitis. For patients who fail TNF-alpha antagonists, switching to an IL-17 antagonist is preferred to switching to another TNF-alpha antagonist. Secukinumab, an IL-17 antagonist, has also been effective in reducing inflammation and joint symptoms. Secukinumab can be given at a dosage of 150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. Without the loading (weekly) doses, secukinumab is 150 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Adverse effects include urticaria, upper respiratory infections, fungal infections due to Candida, diarrhea, herpes zoster, and worsening symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. Ixekizumab, another IL-17 inhibitor, can be given for active ankylosing spondylitis as an injection of 80 mg/mL for adult patients every 4 weeks after a loading dose of 160 mg (two 80-mg injections) at week 0, followed by 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. It can be administered as monotherapy or in combination with conventional DMARDs or NSAIDs. Discontinuation of biologics is not recommended due to the likelihood for symptom recurrence. Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and most disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have no proven benefit in axial spondyloarthritides and should generally not be used. For proper posture and joint motion, daily exercise and other supportive measures (eg, postural training, therapeutic exercise) are vital to strengthen muscle groups that oppose the direction of potential deformities (ie, the extensor rather than flexor muscles). Reading while lying prone and pushing up on the elbows or pillows and thus extending the back may help keep the back flexible. Because chest wall motion can be restricted, which impairs lung function, cigarette smoking, which also impairs lung function, is strongly discouraged. Intra-articular depot corticosteroids may be beneficial, particularly when one or two peripheral joints are more severely inflamed than others, thereby compromising exercise and rehabilitation. They may also help if systemic drugs are ineffective. Imaging-guided corticosteroid injections into the sacroiliac joints may occasionally help severe sacroiliitis. For acute uveitis Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well.\n【9】 If severe hip arthritis develops, total hip arthroplasty may lessen pain and improve flexibility dramatically. Key Points Ankylosing spondylitis is a systemic disorder that affects axial and peripheral joints and can cause constitutional symptoms, cardiac symptoms, and anterior uveitis. Initial manifestation is usually inflammatory back pain and stiffness sometimes along with peripheral joint symptoms and/or anterior uveitis. Diagnose based on the results of lumbosacral spine imaging, sacroiliac joint imaging, pelvic MRI, blood tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood count), and/or explicit clinical criteria. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to help reduce symptom severity and improve function. Use sulfasalazine, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists, or interleukin-17 (IL-17) antagonists to relieve joint symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-01 02:18:30"}

The condition results from impeded transport of liquids, solids, or both from the pharynx to the stomach. Dysphagia should not be confused with globus sensation Lump in Throat Lump in the throat is the sensation of a lump or mass in the throat, unrelated to swallowing, when no mass is present.\n【1】 The swallowing apparatus consists of the pharynx, upper esophageal (cricopharyngeal) sphincter, the body of the esophagus, and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The upper third of the esophagus and the structures proximal to it are composed of skeletal muscle; the distal esophagus and LES are composed of smooth muscle. These components work as an integrated system that transports material from the mouth to the stomach and prevents its reflux into the esophagus. Physical obstruction or disorders that interfere with motor function ,esophageal motility disorders Esophageal Motility Disorders Esophageal motility disorders involve dysfunction of the esophagus that causes symptoms such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain.\n【2】 Etiology of Dysphagia is classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal, depending on where it occurs. Oropharyngeal dysphagia Oropharyngeal dysphagia is difficulty emptying material from the oropharynx into the esophagus; it results from abnormal function proximal to the esophagus. Patients complain of difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and tracheal aspiration followed by coughing. Most often, oropharyngeal dysphagia occurs in patients with neurologic conditions or muscular disorders that affect skeletal muscles.  Some Causes of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Mechanism Examples Neurologic Stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.\n【3】 It results from either a motility disorder or a mechanical obstruction.  Some Causes of Esophageal Dysphagia Mechanism Examples Motility disorder Achalasia is a neurogenic esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired esophageal peristalsis and a lack of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation during swallowing.\n【4】 Aspiration can cause acute pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs.\n【5】 Prolonged dysphagia often leads to inadequate nutrition and weight loss. Esophageal dysphagia can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, tracheal aspiration of ingested material, and in severe cases food impaction. Food impaction puts patients at risk of spontaneous esophageal perforation, which can lead to sepsis and even death. Evaluation of Dysphagia History of present illness begins with duration of symptoms and acuity of onset. Patients should describe what substances cause difficulty and where they feel the disturbance is located. Specific concerns include whether patients have difficulty swallowing solids, liquids, or both; whether food comes out their nose; whether they drool or have food spill from their mouth; whether they have had food impaction; and whether they cough or choke while eating. Review of symptoms should focus on symptoms suggestive of neuromuscular, gastrointestinal (GI), and connective tissue disorders and on the presence of complications. Important neuromuscular symptoms include weakness and easy fatigability, gait or balance disturbance, tremor, and difficulty speaking. Important GI symptoms include heartburn or other chest discomfort suggestive of reflux. Symptoms of connective tissue disorders include muscle and joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon, and skin changes (eg, rash, swelling, thickening). Past medical history should ascertain known diseases that may cause dysphagia . Physical examination focuses on findings suggestive of neuromuscular, GI, and connective tissue disorders and on the presence of complications. General examination should evaluate nutritional status (including body weight). A complete neurologic examination is essential, with attention to any resting tremor, the cranial nerves (note the gag reflex may normally be absent; this absence is thus not a good marker of swallowing dysfunction), and muscle strength. Patients who describe easy fatigability should be observed performing a repetitive action (eg, blinking, counting aloud) for a rapid decrement in performance suggestive of myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors.\n【6】 The patient’s gait should be observed, and balance should be tested. Skin is examined for rash and thickening or texture changes, particularly on the fingertips. Muscles are inspected for wasting and fasciculations and are palpated for tenderness. The neck is evaluated for thyromegaly or other mass. Red flags Any dysphagia is of concern, but certain findings are more urgent: Symptoms of complete obstruction (eg, drooling, inability to swallow anything) Dysphagia resulting in weight loss New focal neurologic deficit, particularly any objective weakness Recurrent aspiration pneumonia Interpretation of findings Dysphagia that occurs in conjunction with an acute neurologic event is likely the result of that event; new dysphagia in a patient with a stable, long-standing neurologic disorder may have another etiology. Dysphagia for solids alone suggests mechanical obstruction; however, a problem with both solids and liquids is nonspecific. Drooling and spilling food from the mouth while eating or nasal regurgitation suggests an oropharyngeal disorder. Regurgitation of a small amount of food on lateral compression of the neck is virtually diagnostic of pharyngeal diverticulum. Patients who complain of difficulty getting food to leave the mouth or of food sticking in the lower esophagus are usually correct about the condition’s location; the sensation of dysphagia in the upper esophagus is less specific. Many findings suggest specific disorders  but are of varying sensitivity and specificity and thus do not rule in or out a given cause; however, they can guide testing.  Testing Upper endoscopy Barium swallow Patients with dysphagia should always have upper endoscopy, which is extremely important to rule out cancer. During endoscopy, esophageal biopsies should also be done to look for eosinophilic esophagitis. A barium swallow (with a solid bolus, usually a marshmallow or tablet) can be done if the patient is unable to undergo an upper endoscopy, or if upper endoscopy with biopsy does not identify a cause. If the barium swallow is negative and the upper endoscopy is normal, esophageal motility studies should be done. Other tests for specific causes are done as suggested by findings.\n【7】 This procedure allows measurements of esophageal distensibility and may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with dysphagia. Treatment of Dysphagia Treatment of dysphagia is directed at the specific cause. If complete obstruction occurs, emergent upper endoscopy is essential. If a stricture, ring, or web is found, careful endoscopic dilation is done. Pending resolution, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia may benefit from evaluation by a rehabilitation specialist. Sometimes patients benefit from changing head position while eating, retraining the swallowing muscles, doing exercises that improve the ability to accommodate a food bolus in the oral cavity, or doing strength and coordination exercises for the tongue. Patients with severe dysphagia and recurrent aspiration may require a gastrostomy tube. Geriatrics Essentials: Dysphagia Chewing, swallowing, tasting, and communicating require intact, coordinated neuromuscular function in the mouth, face, and neck. Oral motor function in particular declines measurably with aging, even in healthy people. Decline in function may have many manifestations: Reduction in masticatory muscle strength and coordination is common, especially among patients with partial or complete dentures, and may lead to a tendency to swallow larger food particles, which can increase the risk of choking or aspiration. Drooping of the lower face and lips caused by decreased circumoral muscle tone and, in edentulous people, reduced bone support, is an aesthetic concern and can lead to drooling, spilling of food and liquids, and difficulty closing the lips while eating, sleeping, or resting. Sialorrhea (saliva leakage) is often the first symptom. Swallowing difficulties increase. It takes longer to move food from mouth to oropharynx, which increases the likelihood of aspiration.\n【8】 Iatrogenic causes also contribute. Drugs (eg, anticholinergics, diuretics), radiation therapy to the head and neck, and chemotherapy can greatly impair saliva production. Hyposalivation is a major cause of delayed and impaired swallowing. Oral motor dysfunction is best managed with a multidisciplinary approach. Coordinated referrals to specialists in prosthetic dentistry, rehabilitative medicine, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and gastroenterology may be needed. Key Points All patients complaining of dysphagia should undergo upper endoscopy to rule out cancer. If the upper endoscopy does not reveal structural causes for symptoms, biopsies should be obtained to rule out eosinophilic esophagitis.

Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.\n【3】 Activities or jobs that require repetitive flexion and extension of the wrist may contribute, but rarely. Most cases are idiopathic. Symptoms and Signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain of the hand and wrist with tingling and numbness, classically distributed along the median nerve (the palmar side of the thumb, the index and middle fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger) but possibly involving the entire hand. Typically, the patient wakes at night with burning or aching pain and with numbness and tingling and shakes the hand to obtain relief and restore sensation. Thenar atrophy and weakness of thumb opposition and abduction may develop late. Diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Clinical evaluation Sometimes nerve conduction testing The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is strongly suggested by the Tinel sign, in which median nerve paresthesias are reproduced by tapping at the volar surface of the wrist over the site of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Reproduction of tingling with wrist flexion (Phalen sign) or with direct pressure on the nerve at the wrist in a neutral position (median nerve compression test) is also suggestive. The median nerve compression test is positive if symptoms develop within 30 seconds. The six-item carpal tunnel syndrome symptom scale (CTS-6) is a diagnostic aid that uses 6 clinical criteria. A score ≥ 12 correlates with a high probability of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, clinical differentiation from other types of peripheral neuropathy may sometimes be difficult. If symptoms are severe or the diagnosis is uncertain, nerve conduction testing Nerve conduction studies When determining whether weakness is due to a nerve, muscle, or neuromuscular junction disorder is clinically difficult, these studies can identify the affected nerves and muscles.\n【4】 Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Splinting Treatment of underlying disorders Sometimes corticosteroid/anesthetic injection Sometimes surgical decompression Changing the position of computer keyboards and making other ergonomic corrections may occasionally provide relief. Otherwise, treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome includes wearing a lightweight neutral wrist splint, especially at night, and taking mild analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Treating any underlying disorders ,eg, diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.\n【5】 Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.\n【6】 Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.\n【7】 If these measures do not control symptoms, a mixture of an anesthetic and a corticosteroid (eg, 1.5 mL of a 4-mg/mL dexamethasone solution mixed with 1.5 mL of 1% lidocaine) may be injected into the carpal tunnel at a site just ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon and proximal to the distal crease at the wrist. This is more often effective for milder or pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome. If bothersome symptoms persist or recur or if hand weakness and thenar wasting develop, the carpal tunnel can be surgically decompressed by using an open or endoscopic technique. Neutral wrist splint Key Points Although carpal tunnel syndrome has many risk factors, most cases are idiopathic. Typical symptoms include wrist and hand pain with tingling and numbness along the palmar side of the thumb, the index and middle fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger. Reproducing symptoms with wrist flexion or pressure over the median nerve can provide helpful diagnostic clues. Treat first with ergonomic corrections, then try splinting and analgesics, corticosteroid injection, and, for weakness, muscle wasting, and/or severe unresponsive symptoms, surgical decompression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 01:29:36", "update_time": "2024-04-02 00:12:24"}

Fulminant hepatitis with hepatitis A virus is rare but may be more likely in people with preexisting liver disorders. Occasionally, hepatitis E virus causes fulminant hepatitis, especially in pregnant women, potentially leading to fetal loss, liver failure, and death. The role of hepatitis C virus remains uncertain. Alcoholic hepatitis may cause fulminant liver failure, but most patients have a long history of heavy drinking and so probably have underlying chronic liver disease. Drugs ,especially acetaminophen Acute Acetaminophen Poisoning Acetaminophen poisoning can cause gastroenteritis within hours and hepatotoxicity 1 to 3 days after ingestion.\n【2】 Symptoms and Signs of Fulminant Hepatitis Symptoms of fulminant hepatitis develop and become severe very quickly. Patients rapidly deteriorate because portosystemic encephalopathy Portosystemic Encephalopathy Portosystemic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can develop in patients with liver disease.\n【3】 Coagulopathy commonly results from liver failure Acute Liver Failure Acute liver failure is caused most often by drugs and hepatitis viruses. Cardinal manifestations are jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. Diagnosis is clinical.\n【4】 Increasing prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR), portosystemic encephalopathy, and particularly renal failure are ominous. Diagnosis of Fulminant Hepatitis Clinical evaluation Liver tests PT/INR measurement Fulminant hepatitis should be suspected if Patients are acutely ill with new-onset jaundice, rapid changes in mental status, or unexplained bleeding. Patients with known liver disease rapidly deteriorate. Laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis include liver tests (eg, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase) and other tests to evaluate liver function (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio [PT/INR], bilirubin, albumin). Laboratory tests for acute hepatitis Diagnosis Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies.\n【5】 A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common.\n【6】 The serum acetaminophen level should be measured in all patients if acetaminophen toxicity Acetaminophen Poisoning Acetaminophen poisoning can cause gastroenteritis within hours and hepatotoxicity 1 to 3 days after ingestion.\n【7】 Treatment of Fulminant Hepatitis Oral nucleoside or nucleotide analogs Sometimes N-acetylcysteine Liver transplantation Meticulous medical care, usually in an intensive care unit, and aggressive treatment of complications improve the outcome of patients with fulminant hepatitis.
