Severe loss of vision can occur in the affected eye if amblyopia is not detected and treated early in childhood.  Diagnosis is based on detecting a difference in best corrected visual acuity between the two eyes that is not attributable to other pathology.  Treatment depends on the cause.  Amblyopia affects about 2 to 3%  of children and usually develops before age 2; however, any child under about age 8 can develop amblyopia.  The brain must simultaneously receive a clear, focused, properly aligned image from each eye for the visual system to develop properly.  This development takes place mainly in the first 3 years of life but is not complete until about 8 years of age.  Amblyopia results when there is persistent interference with the image from one eye but not the other.  The visual cortex suppresses the image from the affected eye.  If suppression persists long enough, vision loss can be permanent. \n【1】 Etiology of Amblyopia There are 3 causes: Strabismus Refractive errors Obstruction of the visual axis Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes, which causes deviation from the parallelism of normal gaze. \n【2】 When this misalignment occurs, a child's brain can pay attention to only one eye at a time, and the input from the other eye is suppressed.  Because the visual pathways are already fully developed in adults, presentation of 2 different images results in diplopia rather than suppression of one image.  Refractive errors (astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia) can cause amblyopia due to a blurring of the image or images reaching the brain.  Anisometropic amblyopia occurs in cases of an inequality of refraction between the two eyes, resulting in a different focus of the retinal images, with the image from the eye with the greater refractive error being less well focused.  Bilateral amblyopia may occur in cases of equally high refractive errors in both eyes, because the brain receives two blurred images.  Obstruction of the visual axis at some point between the surface of the eye and the retina ,eg, by a congenital cataract Congenital Cataract Congenital cataract is a lens opacity that is present at birth or shortly after birth.  Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes with imaging.  Treatment is surgical removal of the cataract.   interferes with or completely prevents formation of a retinal image in the affected eye.  This obstruction can cause amblyopia.  Symptoms and Signs of Amblyopia is often asymptomatic and is commonly uncovered only on routine vision screening.  Children rarely complain of unilateral vision loss, although they may squint or cover one eye.  Very young children do not notice or are unable to express awareness that their vision differs in one eye compared with the other.  Some older children may report impaired vision in the affected eye or exhibit poor depth perception.  When strabismus is the cause, deviation of gaze may be noticeable to others.  A complete cataract causing occlusion of the visual axis may cause leukocoria (a white reflex in the pupil, which may be seen in photos); however, a partial cataract may go unnoticed.  Diagnosis of Amblyopia Early and periodic vision screenings Photoscreening Additional testing (eg, cover test, cover-uncover test, refraction, ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp) Vision screening for amblyopia (and strabismus) begins immediately after birth with red reflex evaluation and is repeated at annual well-child checkups.  Vision screening is most effective when age-appropriate screenings are done periodically throughout childhood.  If a child is not able to do subjective vision testing with an eye chart by 3 or 4 years of age, referral to an eye care specialist is recommended .  Photoscreening is one approach for screening preverbal children and those who are unable to undergo subjective testing because of learning or developmental disorders.  Photoscreening involves use of a special camera that analyzes red reflexes during fixation on a visual target to identify risk factors for amblyopia.  Screening in older children consists of acuity testing with figures, which do not require knowing the alphabet (eg, tumbling E figures, Allen cards, HOTV figures or characters), or Snellen eye charts.  Identifying the underlying cause requires additional testing.  Strabismus can be confirmed with the alternate cover test or the cover-uncover test .  Ophthalmologists can confirm refractive error by doing a refraction on each eye.  Obstruction of the visual axis can be confirmed by ophthalmoscopy or slit-lamp examination. \n【3】 Prognosis for Amblyopia may result in permanent vision loss if not diagnosed and treated early in childhood, before the visual system has matured.  The earlier treatment is begun, the greater the likelihood of complete vision recovery.  In certain circumstances, older children with amblyopia can still have vision improvement with treatment.  The Amblyopia Treatment Studies have shown that amblyopia treatment may improve visual acuity if initiated even in early adolescence, up until 14 years of age .  Recurrence (recidivism) is possible in certain cases until the visual system matures.  Some patients have a small decrease in visual acuity even after visual maturity has occurred. \n【4】 Treatment of Amblyopia Eyeglasses or contact lenses Cataract removal Patching (occlusion therapy) Atropine drops Treatment of strabismus if present Treatment of amblyopia should be directed by an ophthalmologist experienced in managing eye disorders in children.  After correcting refraction (glasses or contact lenses) or clearing the visual axis (removal of a cataract), the mainstay of amblyopia treatment is occluding the better eye to force the brain to use the affected eye.  In cases of refractive amblyopia, full-time wearing of glasses or contact lenses with close monitoring may be sufficient treatment, especially in cases of bilateral amblyopia.  Once improvement of visual acuity has plateaued with glasses wearing, occlusion therapy is begun .  In the case of amblyopia caused by strabismus, occlusion therapy is done first, followed by treatment of the strabismus Treatment Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes, which causes deviation from the parallelism of normal gaze. \n【5】 Use of the amblyopic eye is then encouraged by patching the better eye or by administering atropine drops into the better eye to provide a visual advantage to the amblyopic eye.  Adherence to treatment is better with drop therapy.  Maintenance treatment for prevention of recurrences may be recommended for 1 to 2 years after improvement has stabilized. \n【6】 Key Points Amblyopia is visual loss in an eye caused by lack of clearly focused, properly aligned input to the visual cortex from each eye during early childhood prior to maturation of the visual pathways.  Diagnosis is mainly by screening tests, including photoscreening, and early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment are crucial to a successful outcome.  Treatment is directed at the cause (eg, correcting refractive error, removing cataracts, treating strabismus) in addition to patching or administering atropine drops into the better eye to provide a visual advantage to the amblyopic eye.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Mechanisms may involve decreased circulating volume, decreased cardiac output, and vasodilation, sometimes with shunting of blood to bypass capillary exchange beds.  Symptoms include altered mental status, tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria.  Diagnosis is clinical, including blood pressure measurement and sometimes measurement of markers of tissue hypoperfusion (eg, blood lactate, base deficit).  Treatment is with fluid resuscitation, including blood products if necessary, correction of the underlying disorder, and sometimes vasopressors.   Pathophysiology of Shock The fundamental defect in shock is reduced perfusion of vital tissues.  Once perfusion declines and oxygen delivery to cells is inadequate for aerobic metabolism, cells shift to anaerobic metabolism with increased production of carbon dioxide and elevated blood lactate levels.  Cellular function declines, and if shock persists, irreversible cell damage and death occur.  During shock, both the inflammatory and clotting cascades may be triggered in areas of hypoperfusion.  Hypoxic vascular endothelial cells activate white blood cells, which bind to the endothelium and release directly damaging substances (eg, reactive oxygen species, proteolytic enzymes) and inflammatory mediators (eg, cytokines, leukotrienes, tumor necrosis factor).  Some of these mediators bind to cell surface receptors and activate nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), which leads to production of additional cytokines and nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator.  Septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【1】 In septic shock, vasodilation of capacitance vessels leads to pooling of blood and hypotension because of “relative” hypovolemia (ie, too much volume to be filled by the existing amount of blood).  Localized vasodilation may shunt blood past the capillary exchange beds, causing focal hypoperfusion despite normal cardiac output and blood pressure.  Additionally, excess nitric oxide is converted to peroxynitrite, a free radical that damages mitochondria and decreases ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production.  Blood flow to microvessels, including capillaries, is reduced even though large-vessel blood flow is preserved in settings of septic shock.  Mechanical microvascular obstruction may, at least in part, account for such limiting of substrate delivery.  Leukocytes and platelets adhere to the endothelium, and the clotting system is activated with fibrin deposition.  Multiple mediators, along with endothelial cell dysfunction, markedly increase microvascular permeability, allowing fluid and sometimes plasma proteins to escape into the interstitial space .  In the gastrointestinal tract, increased permeability possibly allows translocation of the enteric bacteria from the lumen, potentially leading to sepsis or metastatic infection.  Neutrophil apoptosis may be inhibited, enhancing the release of inflammatory mediators.  In other cells, apoptosis may be augmented, increasing cell death and thus worsening organ function.  Blood pressure is not always low in the early stages of shock (although hypotension eventually occurs if shock is not reversed).  Similarly, not all patients with “low” blood pressure have shock.  The degree and consequences of hypotension vary with the adequacy of physiologic compensation and the patient’s underlying diseases.  Thus, a modest degree of hypotension that is well tolerated by a young, relatively healthy person might result in severe cerebral, cardiac, or renal dysfunction in an older person with significant arteriosclerosis.  Compensation for shock Initially, when oxygen delivery (DO2) is decreased, tissues compensate by extracting a greater percentage of delivered oxygen.  Low arterial pressure triggers an adrenergic response with sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction and often increased heart rate.  Initially, vasoconstriction is selective, shunting blood to the heart and brain and away from the splanchnic circulation.  Circulating beta-adrenergic amines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) also increase cardiac contractility and trigger release of Corticosteroids from the adrenal gland Renin from the kidneys Glucose from the liver Corticosteroids enhance the effects of catecholamines.  Renin stimulates volume retention and vasoconstriction.  Increased glucose increases pyruvate uptake in the mitochondria which increases lactate production when there is insufficient oxygen.  Reperfusion following shock Reperfusion of ischemic cells can cause further injury.  As substrate is reintroduced, neutrophil activity may increase, increasing production of damaging superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.  After blood flow is restored, locally concentrated inflammatory mediators may be circulated to other organs.  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) The combination of direct and reperfusion injury may cause MODS—the progressive dysfunction of ≥ 2 organs consequent to life-threatening illness or injury.  MODS can follow any type of shock but is most common when infection is involved; organ failure is one of the defining features of septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【2】 MODS also occurs in > 10% of patients with severe traumatic injury and is the primary cause of death in those surviving > 24 hours.  Pearls & Pitfalls Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the progressive dysfunction of ≥ 2 organs consequent to life-threatening illness or injury.  Any organ system can be affected, but the most frequent target organs are the lungs, in which increased membrane permeability leads to flooding of alveoli and further inflammation.  Progressive hypoxia may be increasingly resistant to supplemental oxygen therapy. \n【3】 The kidneys are injured when renal perfusion is critically reduced, leading to acute tubular necrosis Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is kidney injury characterized by acute tubular cell injury and dysfunction. \n【4】 In the heart, reduced coronary perfusion and increased inflammatory mediators (including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1) may depress contractility, worsen myocardial compliance, and down-regulate beta-receptors.  These factors decrease cardiac output, further worsening both myocardial and systemic perfusion and causing a vicious circle that often culminates in death.  Arrhythmias may occur.  In the gastrointestinal tract, ileus and submucosal hemorrhage can develop.  Liver hypoperfusion can cause focal or extensive hepatocellular necrosis, transaminase and bilirubin elevation, and decreased production of clotting factors.  Coagulation can be impaired, including the most severe manifestation, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) involves abnormal, excessive generation of thrombin and fibrin in the circulating blood. \n【5】 Etiology and Classification of Shock There are several mechanisms of organ hypoperfusion and shock.  Hypovolemic shock is caused by a critical decrease in intravascular volume.  Diminished venous return (preload) results in decreased ventricular filling and reduced stroke volume.  Unless compensated for by increased heart rate, cardiac output decreases.  A common cause is bleeding (hemorrhagic shock), typically due to trauma, surgical interventions, peptic ulcer, esophageal varices, or ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Bleeding may be overt (eg, hematemesis, melena) or concealed (eg, ruptured ectopic pregnancy).  Hypovolemic shock may also follow increased losses of body fluids other than blood .   Hypovolemic Shock Caused by Body Fluid Loss Site of Fluid Loss Mechanism of Loss Skin Thermal or chemical burn Burns are injuries of skin or other tissue caused by thermal, radiation, chemical, or electrical contact. \n【6】 Water may be unavailable, neurologic disability may impair the thirst mechanism, or physical disability may impair access.  In hospitalized patients, hypovolemia can be compounded if early signs of circulatory insufficiency are incorrectly ascribed to heart failure and fluids are withheld or diuretics are given.  Distributive shock results from a relative inadequacy of intravascular volume caused by arterial or venous vasodilation; circulating blood volume is normal.  In some cases, cardiac output (and DO2) is high, but increased blood flow through arteriovenous shunts bypasses capillary beds; this bypass plus uncoupled cellular oxygen transport cause cellular hypoperfusion (shown by decreased oxygen consumption).  In other situations, blood pools in venous capacitance beds and cardiac output falls.  Distributive shock may be caused by Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. \n【7】 Severe injury to the spinal cord, usually above T4 (neurogenic shock) Ingestion of certain drugs or poisons, such as nitrates, opioids, and adrenergic blockers Anaphylactic shock and septic shock often have a component of hypovolemia as well.  Cardiogenic and obstructive shock Cardiogenic shock Hypotension and Cardiogenic Shock Numerous complications can occur as a result of an acute coronary syndrome and increase morbidity and mortality. \n【8】 Obstructive shock is caused by mechanical factors that interfere with filling or emptying of the heart or great vessels.  Causes are listed in the table Mechanisms of Cardiogenic and Obstructive Shock .   Mechanisms of Cardiogenic and Obstructive Shock Type Mechanism Cause Obstructive Mechanical interference with ventricular filling Tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【9】 The hands and feet are pale, cool, clammy, and often cyanotic, as are the earlobes, nose, and nail beds.  Capillary filling time is prolonged, and, except in distributive shock, the skin appears grayish or dusky and moist.  Overt diaphoresis may occur.  Peripheral pulses are weak and typically rapid; often, only femoral or carotid pulses are palpable.  Tachypnea and hyperventilation may be present.  Blood pressure tends to be low (< 90 mm Hg systolic) or unobtainable; direct measurement by intra-arterial catheter Arterial Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. \n【10】 Urine output is low.  Distributive shock causes similar symptoms, except the skin may appear warm or flushed, especially during sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【11】 The pulse may be bounding rather than weak.  In septic shock, fever, possibly preceded by chills, is typically present.  Some patients with anaphylactic shock Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. \n【12】 Numerous other symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain) may be due to the underlying disease or secondary organ failure.  Diagnosis of Shock Clinical evaluation Test result trends Diagnosis is mostly clinical, based on evidence of insufficient tissue perfusion (depressed levels of consciousness, oliguria, peripheral cyanosis) and signs of compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis).  Specific criteria include Obtundation Heart rate > 100 beats/minute Respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) or a 30-mm Hg fall in baseline blood pressure Urine output < 0. 5 mL/kg/hour Laboratory findings that support the diagnosis include Lactate > 3 mmol/L (27 mg/dL) Base deficit < −4 mEq/L PaCO2 < 32 mm Hg (< 4. 26 kPa) However, none of these findings alone is diagnostic, and each is evaluated by its trend (ie, worsening or improving) and in the overall clinical context, including physical signs.  Recently, near-infrared spectroscopy has been introduced as a noninvasive and rapid technique that may measure the degree of shock; however, this technique has yet to be validated on a larger scale.  Diagnosis of cause Recognizing the cause of shock is more important than categorizing the type.  Often, the cause is obvious or can be recognized quickly based on the history and physical examination, aided by simple testing.  Chest pain Chest Pain Chest pain is a very common complaint. \n【13】 A systolic murmur may indicate ventricular septal rupture or mitral insufficiency due to acute MI.  A diastolic murmur may indicate aortic regurgitation due to aortic dissection involving the aortic root.  Cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. \n【14】 Pulmonary embolism severe enough to cause shock typically produces decreased oxygen saturation and occurs more often in special settings, including prolonged bed rest and after a surgical procedure.  Tests include electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac enzyme measurement, chest x-ray, arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement, lung scan, helical CT, and echocardiography.  Abdominal or back pain or a tender abdomen suggests pancreatitis Overview of Pancreatitis is classified as either acute or chronic.  Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both clinically and histologically. \n【15】 The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved. \n【16】 A pulsatile midline mass suggests ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.  A tender adnexal mass suggests ectopic pregnancy.  Testing typically includes abdominal CT (if the patient is unstable, bedside ultrasonography can be helpful), complete blood count (CBC), amylase, lipase, and, for women of childbearing age, urine pregnancy test.  Fever, chills, and focal signs of infection suggest septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【17】 Isolated fever, contingent on history and clinical settings, may point to heatstroke.  Tests include chest x-ray; urinalysis; CBC; and cultures of wounds, blood, urine, and other relevant body fluids.  In a few patients, the cause is occult.  Patients with no focal symptoms or signs indicative of cause should have ECG, cardiac enzyme measurement, chest x-ray, and ABGs.  If results of these tests are normal, the most likely causes include drug overdose, occult infection ,including toxic shock Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) Toxic shock syndrome is caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal exotoxins. anaphylaxis, and obstructive shock.  Ancillary testing If not already done, ECG, chest x-ray, CBC, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), liver function tests, and fibrinogen and fibrin split products are done to monitor patient status and serve as a baseline.  If the patient’s volume status is difficult to determine, monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) may be useful.  CVP < 5 mm Hg (< 7 cm water) or PAOP < 8 mm Hg may indicate hypovolemia, although CVP may be greater in hypovolemic patients with preexisting pulmonary hypertension.  Rapid bedside echocardiography (done by the treating physician) to assess adequacy of cardiac filling and function is being increasingly used to assess shock and overall cardiac performance . \n【18】 Prognosis for Shock Untreated shock is usually fatal.  Even with treatment, mortality from cardiogenic shock after MI (60 to 65%) and septic shock (30 to 40%) is high.  Prognosis depends on the cause, preexisting or complicating illness, time between onset and diagnosis, and promptness and adequacy of therapy.  Treatment of Shock Supportive care IV fluids Other management depending on type and cause of shock General management of shock First aid involves keeping the patient warm.  External hemorrhage is controlled, airway and ventilation are checked, and respiratory assistance is given if necessary.  Nothing is given by mouth, and the patient’s head is turned to one side to avoid aspiration if emesis occurs.  Treatment begins simultaneously with evaluation.  Supplemental oxygen by face mask is provided. \n【19】 Two large (14- to 16-gauge) IV catheters are inserted into separate peripheral veins.  A central venous line or an intraosseous needle Intraosseous Infusion A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access. \n【20】 Typically, a fluid challenge is given; 1 L (or 20 mL/kg in children) of 0. 9% saline is infused over 15 minutes.  In major hemorrhage, Ringer’s lactate is commonly used, although in major hemorrhage, use of crystalloid should be minimized in favor of transfusion of blood products Blood Products Whole blood can provide improved oxygen-carrying capacity, volume expansion, and replacement of clotting factors and was previously recommended for rapid massive blood loss. \n【21】 Unless clinical parameters return to normal, the infusion of fluid is repeated.  Smaller volumes (eg, 250 to 500 mL) are used for patients with signs of high right-sided pressure (eg, distention of neck veins) or acute myocardial infarction.  A fluid challenge should probably not be done in a patient with signs of pulmonary edema.  Further fluid therapy is based on the underlying condition and may require monitoring of CVP or PAOP.  Bedside cardiac ultrasonography to assess contractility and vena caval respiratory variability may help determine the need for additional fluid vs the need for inotropic support.  Patients in shock are critically ill and should be admitted to an intensive care unit.  Monitoring includes ECG Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, preferably by intra-arterial catheter Respiratory rate and depth Pulse oximetry Urine flow by indwelling bladder catheter Body temperature Clinical status, including sensorium (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale ), pulse volume, skin temperature, and color Measurement of CVP, PAOP, and thermodilution cardiac output using a balloon-tipped pulmonary arterial catheter Procedure Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness. \n【22】 Echocardiography (bedside or transesophageal) is a less invasive alternative.  Serial measurements of arterial blood gases, hematocrit, electrolytes, serum creatinine, and blood lactate are obtained.  Sublingual carbon dioxide measurement Monitoring and Testing the Critical Care Patient Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness. \n【23】 A well-designed flow sheet to monitor trends is helpful.  Because tissue hypoperfusion makes intramuscular absorption unreliable, all parenteral drugs are given IV.  Opioids generally are avoided because they may cause vasodilation, but severe pain may be treated with morphine 0. 1 mg/kg IV given over 2 minutes and repeated every 10 to 15 minutes if necessary.  Although cerebral hypoperfusion may cause anxiety, sedatives or tranquilizers are not routinely given unless the patient is intubated.  After initial resuscitation, specific treatment is directed at the underlying condition.  Additional supportive care is guided by the type of shock.  Treatment of hemorrhagic shock Surgical control of bleeding Early transfusion of blood products In hemorrhagic shock, surgical control of bleeding is the first priority.  Volume replacement Intravenous Fluid Resuscitation Almost all circulatory shock states require large-volume IV fluid replacement, as does severe intravascular volume depletion (eg, due to diarrhea or heatstroke). \n【24】 Failure to respond usually indicates insufficient volume administration or unrecognized ongoing hemorrhage.  Vasopressors may be tried in refractory hemorrhagic shock but only after adequate blood volume has been restored and hemorrhage controlled; giving vasopressors before that can worsen outcomes.  Treatment of distributive shock IV crystalloids Sometimes inotropic or vasopressor drugs Epinephrine for anaphylaxis Distributive shock with profound hypotension after initial fluid replacement with 0. 9% saline may be treated with inotropic or vasopressor agents \n【25】  Patients with septic shock also receive broad-spectrum antibiotics .  Patients with anaphylactic shock Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. \n【26】02 mcg/kg/minute.   Treatment of cardiogenic shock Treatment of cause In cardiogenic shock, structural disorders (eg, valvular dysfunction, septal rupture) are repaired surgically.  Coronary thrombosis is treated either by percutaneous interventions Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. \n【27】 Tachydysrhythmia (eg, rapid atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) is slowed by cardioversion Direct Current (DC) Cardioversion-Defibrillation The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.  Treatment is directed at causes. \n【28】 Treatment is directed at causes. \n【29】 Bradycardia is treated with a transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker Cardiac Pacemakers The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia. \n【30】 Isoproterenol (2 mg/500 mL 5% dextrose in water [D/W] at 1 to 4 mcg/minute [0. 25 to 1 mL/minute]) is occasionally useful if atropine is ineffective, but it is not advised in patients with myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery disease.  Shock after acute MI is treated with volume expansion if PAOP is low or normal; 15 to 18 mm Hg is considered optimal.  If a pulmonary artery catheter is not in place, cautious volume infusion (250- to 500-mL bolus of 0. 9% saline) may be tried while auscultating the chest frequently for signs of fluid overload.  Shock after right ventricular MI usually responds partially to volume expansion; however, vasopressor agents may be needed.  Bedside cardiac ultrasonography to assess contractility and vena caval respiratory variability can help determine the need for additional fluid vs vasopressors; inotropic support is a better approach for patients with normal or above-normal filling.  If hypotension is moderate (eg, mean arterial pressure [MAP] 70 to 90 mm Hg), dobutamine infusion may be used to improve cardiac output and reduce left ventricular filling pressure.  Tachycardia and arrhythmias occasionally occur during dobutamine administration, particularly at higher doses, necessitating dose reduction.  Vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin), which increase venous capacitance or lower systemic vascular resistance, reduce the workload on the damaged myocardium and may increase cardiac output in patients without severe hypotension.  Combination therapy (eg, dopamine or dobutamine with nitroprusside or nitroglycerin) may be particularly useful but requires close ECG and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic monitoring.  For more serious hypotension (MAP < 70 mm Hg), norepinephrine or dopamine may be given, with a target systolic pressure of 80 to 90 mm Hg (and not > 110 mm Hg).  Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is valuable for temporarily reversing shock in patients with acute MI.  This procedure should be considered as a bridge to permit cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography before possible surgical intervention in patients with acute MI complicated by ventricular septal rupture or severe acute mitral regurgitation who require vasopressor support for > 30 minutes.  In obstructive shock, nontraumatic cardiac tamponade requires immediate pericardiocentesis Treatment Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial space. \n【31】 Trauma-related cardiac tamponade requires surgical decompression and repair.  Tension pneumothorax should be immediately decompressed with a catheter inserted into the 2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line; a chest tube is then inserted.  Massive pulmonary embolism resulting in shock is treated with anticoagulation and thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in select cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "f6605167-2b5a-4eb7-ab95-40ae91efe338", "title": null, "text": "【0】Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.  It may cause fever, heart murmurs, petechiae, anemia, embolic phenomena, and endocardial vegetations.  Vegetations may result in valvular incompetence or obstruction, myocardial abscess, or mycotic aneurysm.  Diagnosis requires demonstration of microorganisms in blood and usually echocardiography.  Treatment consists of prolonged antimicrobial treatment and sometimes surgery.  Endocarditis usually refers to infection of the endocardium (ie, infective endocarditis). \n【1】 Noninfective endocarditis sometimes leads to infective endocarditis.  Both can result in embolization and impaired cardiac function.  The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is usually based on a constellation of clinical findings rather than a single definitive test result.  Infective endocarditis can occur at any age.  Men are affected about twice as often as women.  Incidence of infection and mortality increase with increasing age.  Patients who use illicit intravenous drugs, immunocompromised patients, patients with prosthetic heart valves and other intracardiac devices are at highest risk.  There is also an increased risk in patients with indwelling intravascular catheters.  Etiology of Infective Endocarditis The normal heart is relatively resistant to infection.  Bacteria and fungi do not easily adhere to the endocardial surface, and constant blood flow helps prevent them from settling on endocardial structures.  Thus, 2 factors are typically required for endocarditis: A predisposing abnormality of the endocardium Microorganisms in the bloodstream (bacteremia) Massive bacteremia or particularly virulent microorganisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) cause endocarditis on normal valves.  Endocardial factors Endocarditis usually involves the heart valves.  Major predisposing factors are congenital heart defects Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital anomaly, occurring in almost 1% of live births . \n【2】 Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality. \n【3】 The most common cause is idiopathic myxomatous degeneration. \n【4】 The nidus for infection is usually a sterile fibrin-platelet vegetation formed when damaged endothelial cells release tissue factor.  Infective endocarditis occurs most often on the left side (eg, mitral or aortic valve).  About 10 to 20% of cases are right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic valve).  Patients who use illicit intravenous drugs have a much higher incidence of right-sided endocarditis (about 30 to 70%).  Microorganisms that infect the endocardium may originate from distant infected sites (eg, cutaneous abscess, inflamed or infected gums, urinary tract infection) or have obvious portals of entry such as a central venous catheter or a drug injection site.  Almost any implanted foreign material (eg, ventricular or peritoneal shunt, prosthetic device) is at risk of bacterial colonization, thus becoming a source of bacteremia and hence endocarditis.  Endocarditis also may result from asymptomatic bacteremia, such as typically occurs during invasive dental, medical, or surgical procedures.  Even toothbrushing and chewing can cause bacteremia (usually due to viridans streptococci) in patients with gingivitis.  Causative microorganisms vary by site of infection, source of bacteremia, and host risk factors (eg, IV illicit drug use), but overall, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus cause 80 to 90% of cases. \n【5】 However, the incidence of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis has been increasing, and streptococcal endocarditis has been decreasing.  The disease develops in 3 stages: Bacteremia: Microorganisms are present in the blood Adhesion: The microorganism adheres to abnormal or damaged endothelium via surface adhesions Colonization: Proliferation of the organism together with inflammation, leading to a mature vegetation Many of the causative microorganisms produce polysaccharide biofilms that shield them from host immune defences and impede antibiotic penetration.  Pathophysiology of Infective Endocarditis has local and systemic consequences.  Local consequences of infective endocarditis include Myocardial abscesses with tissue destruction and sometimes conduction system abnormalities (usually with low septal abscesses) Sudden, severe valvular regurgitation, causing heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. \n【6】 Aortitis is rare, but potentially life threatening.  Its reported incidence is 1 to 3 per one million/year. \n【7】 Systemic consequences of endocarditis are primarily due to Embolization of infected material from the heart valve Immune-mediated phenomena (primarily in chronic infection) Right-sided lesions typically produce septic pulmonary emboli, which may result in pulmonary infarction, pneumonia, or empyema.  Left-sided lesions may embolize to any tissue, particularly the kidneys, spleen, and central nervous system.  Mycotic aneurysms can form in any major artery.  Cutaneous and retinal emboli are common.  Diffuse glomerulonephritis may result from immune complex deposition.  Classification of Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis may have an indolent, subacute course or a more acute, fulminant course with greater potential for rapid decompensation.  Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), although aggressive, usually develops insidiously and progresses slowly (ie, over weeks to months).  Often, no source of infection or portal of entry is evident.  SBE is caused most commonly by streptococci (especially viridans, microaerophilic, anaerobic, and nonenterococcal group D streptococci and enterococci) and less commonly by S.  aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Gemella morbillorum, Abiotrophia defectiva (formerly, Streptococcus defectivus), Granulicatella species, and fastidious Haemophilus species.  SBE often develops on abnormal valves after asymptomatic bacteremia due to periodontal, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary infections.  Acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) usually develops abruptly and progresses rapidly (ie, over days).  A source of infection or portal of entry is often evident.  When bacteria are virulent or bacterial exposure is massive, ABE can affect normal valves.  It is usually caused by S.  aureus, group A hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, or gonococci.  Prosthetic valvular endocarditis (PVE) develops in 2 to 3% of patients within 1 year after valve replacement and in 0. 5%/year thereafter.  It is more common after aortic than after mitral valve replacement and affects mechanical and bioprosthetic valves equally.  Early-onset infections (< 2 months after surgery) are caused mainly by contamination during surgery with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (eg, S.  epidermidis, diphtheroids, coliform bacilli) or by fungi (eg, Candida species, Aspergillus species).  Late-onset infections are caused mainly by contamination with low-virulence organisms during surgery or by transient asymptomatic bacteremias, most often with streptococci; S.  epidermidis; diphtheroids; and the fastidious gram-negative bacilli, Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Cardiobacterium hominis.  Symptoms and Signs of Infective Endocarditis Symptoms and signs vary based on the classification but are nonspecific.  Subacute bacterial endocarditis Initially, symptoms of subacute bacterial endocarditis are vague: low-grade fever (< 39° C), night sweats, fatigability, malaise, and weight loss.  Chills and arthralgias may occur.  Symptoms and signs of valvular insufficiency may be a first clue.  Initially, ≤ 15% of patients have fever or a murmur, but eventually almost all develop both.  Physical examination may be normal or include pallor, fever, change in a preexisting murmur or development of a new regurgitant murmur, and tachycardia.  Retinal emboli can cause round or oval hemorrhagic retinal lesions with small white centers (Roth spots).  Cutaneous manifestations include petechiae (on the upper trunk, conjunctivae, mucous membranes, and distal extremities), painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules on or near the tips of digits (Osler nodes), nontender hemorrhagic macules or papules on the palms or soles (Janeway lesions), and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. \n【8】 Renal emboli may cause flank pain and, rarely, gross hematuria.  Splenic emboli may cause left upper quadrant pain.  Prolonged infection may cause splenomegaly or clubbing of fingers and toes.  Cutaneous Manifestations of Infective Endocarditis (Osler Nodes) This patient with infective endocarditis has multiple Osler nodes (tender, erythematous nodules on the toes). \n【9】 The patient also has some Osler nodes (tender, erythematous nodules on the fingers). \n【10】 Thomas F. \n【11】 Fever is almost always present initially, and patients appear toxic; sometimes septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【12】 Heart murmur is present initially in about 50 to 80% and eventually in > 90%.  Rarely, purulent meningitis occurs.  Right-sided endocarditis Septic pulmonary emboli may cause cough, pleuritic chest pain, and sometimes hemoptysis.  A murmur of tricuspid regurgitation Tricuspid Regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficiency of the tricuspid valve causing blood flow from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systole. \n【13】 Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis Blood cultures Echocardiography and sometimes other imaging modalities Clinical criteria Because symptoms and signs are nonspecific, vary greatly, and may develop insidiously, diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.  Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with fever and no obvious source of infection, particularly if a heart murmur is present.  Suspicion of endocarditis should be very high if blood cultures are positive in patients who have a history of a heart valve disorder, who have had certain recent invasive procedures, or who use IV illicit drugs.  Patients with documented bacteremia should be examined thoroughly and repeatedly for new valvular murmurs and signs of emboli.  Other than positive blood cultures, there are no specific laboratory findings.  Established infections often cause a normocytic-normochromic anemia, elevated white blood cell count, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased immunoglobulin levels, and the presence of circulating immune complexes and rheumatoid factor, but these findings are not diagnostically helpful.  Urinalysis often shows microscopic hematuria and, occasionally, red blood cell casts, pyuria, or bacteriuria.  Identification of organisms Identification of the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibility is vital to guide treatment.  If endocarditis is suspected, 3 blood samples for culture (20-mL each) should be obtained, ideally > 6 hours apart (if presentation suggests acute bacterial endocarditis, 2 cultures within the first 1 to 2 hours).  Each set of cultures should be obtained from a separate, fresh venipuncture site (ie, not from preexisting vascular catheters).  Blood cultures do not need to be restricted to times during chills or fever because most patients have continuous bacteremia.  When endocarditis is present and no prior antibiotic therapy was given, all 3 blood cultures usually are positive because the bacteremia is continuous; at least one culture is positive in 99%.  Premature use of empiric antibiotic therapy should be avoided in patients with acquired or congenital valvular or shunt lesions to avoid culture-negative endocarditis.  If prior antimicrobial therapy was given, blood cultures should still be obtained, but results may be negative.  Blood cultures may require 3 to 4 weeks of incubation for certain organisms; however, some proprietary, automated culture monitoring systems can identify positive cultures within a week.  Other organisms (eg, Aspergillus) may not produce positive cultures.  Some organisms (eg, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella species, Chlamydia psittaci, Brucella species) require serodiagnosis; others (eg, Legionella pneumophila) require special culture media or polymerase chain reaction (eg, Tropheryma whippelii).  Negative blood culture results may indicate suppression due to prior antimicrobial therapy, infection with organisms that do not grow in standard culture media, or another diagnosis (eg, noninfective endocarditis, atrial myxoma with embolic phenomena, vasculitis). \n【14】 It has sensitivity of 50 to 90% and specificity > 90%.  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can reveal vegetations too small to be seen on TTE.  It has sensitivity of 90 to 100%.  Transesophageal echocardiography should be done when Patients have a prosthetic valve (where TTE sensitivity is limited) Transthoracic echocardiogram is nondiagnostic Diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been established clinically (done to detect perforations, abscesses, and fistulas) Serial TEE enables diagnosis of complications that evolve during treatment, such as increasing vegetation size or abscess formation.  CT is used as needed to fully define paravalvular abscesses and for detection of mycotic aneurysms.  Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning improves the sensitivity of the modified Duke criteria without compromising specificity .  It is especially useful for infection associated with implanted devices, where imaging is hampered by metallic shadowing and postoperative changes ,1 Diagnosis references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【15】 PET scanning also detects extracardiac infection, such as septic emboli, and is an emerging tool for the diagnosis of endocarditis originating in prosthetic and intracardiac devices.  CT and PET abnormalities are now included as major criteria in the European guidelines ,2 Diagnosis references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【16】 Routine brain imaging has been proposed because up to 60% of patients have clinically silent lesions.  It's utility for prognosis and management is yet to be defined.  Diagnostic criteria Infective endocarditis is definitively diagnosed when microorganisms are seen histologically in (or cultured from) endocardial vegetations obtained during cardiac surgery, embolectomy, or autopsy.  Because vegetations are not usually available for examination, there are various clinical criteria for establishing a diagnosis.  They include the modified Duke Criteria ,3 Diagnosis references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【17】 The ESC criteria are similar to the modified Duke criteria but include expanded imaging results as major criteria as follows: Vegetation, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, intracardiac fistula, valvular perforation or aneurysm, or new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve identified by echocardiography Abnormal activity around a prosthetic valve (implanted > 3 months earlier) detected by PET/CT or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT with radiolabeled leukocytes Paravalvular lesions identified by cardiac CT The ESC also differs from the modified Duke minor criteria by specifying that detecting silent vascular phenomena by imaging only is sufficient. \n【18】 Prognosis for Infective Endocarditis Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate for endocarditis is 15 to 20%, with a 1-year mortality rate approaching 40% ,1 Prognosis reference Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【19】 Untreated, infective endocarditis is always fatal.  Even with treatment, death is more likely and the prognosis is generally poorer for older people and people who have Infection with resistant organisms An underlying disorder A long delay in treatment Aortic valve or multiple valve involvement Large vegetations Polymicrobial bacteremia Prosthetic valve infections Mycotic aneurysms Valve ring abscess Major embolic events Septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【20】 The mortality rate for viridans streptococcal endocarditis without major complications is < 10% but is virtually 100% for Aspergillus endocarditis after prosthetic valve surgery.  The prognosis is better with right-sided than left-sided endocarditis because tricuspid valve dysfunction is tolerated better, systemic emboli are absent, and right-sided S.  aureus endocarditis responds better to antimicrobial therapy. \n【21】 Treatment of Infective Endocarditis IV antibiotics (based on the organism and its susceptibility) Sometimes valve debridement, repair, or replacement Dental evaluation and treatment (to minimize oral sources of bacteremia) Removal of potential source of bacteremia (eg, internal catheters, devices) Withholding anticoagulation in patients with cerebral embolism Treatment consists of a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy (1 Treatment references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【22】 Surgery may be needed for mechanical complications or resistant organisms.  Typically, antimicrobials are given IV.  Because they must be given for 2 to 8 weeks, home IV therapy is often used.  Any apparent source of bacteremia must be managed: necrotic tissue debrided, abscesses drained, and foreign material and infected devices removed.  People with infective endocarditis should be evaluated by a dentist and treated for oral diseases that could cause bacteremia and subsequent endocarditis.  Existing IV catheters (particularly central venous ones) should be changed.  If endocarditis persists in a patient with a newly inserted central venous catheter, that catheter should also be removed.  Organisms within biofilms adherent to catheters and other devices may not respond to antimicrobial therapy, leading to treatment failure or relapse.  If continuous infusions are used instead of intermittent boluses, infusions should not be interrupted for long periods.  Antibiotic regimens Drugs and dosages depend on the microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility.  \n【23】) Although most patients are stable enough to wait for culture results, empiric antibiotic therapy before organism identification may be necessary in seriously ill patients.  Antibiotics should not be given until adequate blood cultures (minimally, generally 2 or 3 samples from different sites over 1 hour) have been obtained.  Antibiotics should be broad spectrum to cover all likely organisms, typically including sensitive and resistant staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci.  Empiric antibiotic regimens should reflect local patterns of infection and antibiotic resistance; however, typical examples of broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage may include Native valves: Vancomycin 15 to 20 mg/kg IV every 8 to 12 hours (not to exceed 2 g per dose) Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin 15 to 20 mg/kg IV every 8 to 12 hours (not to exceed 2 g per dose) plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours plus either cefepime 2 g IV every 8 hours or imipenem 1 g IV every 6 to 8 hours (maximum dose 4 g per day) As soon as possible, the empiric drug regimen should be adjusted based on culture results.   Patients who use IV illicit drugs frequently do not adhere to treatment, use IV access lines inappropriately, and tend to leave the hospital too soon.  For such patients, short-course IV or (less preferably) oral therapy may be used.  For right-sided endocarditis caused by methicillin-sensitive S.  aureus, nafcillin 2 g IV every 4 hours plus gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 2 weeks is effective, as is a 4-week oral regimen of ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice a day plus rifampin 300 mg twice a day.  Left-sided endocarditis does not respond to 2-week courses.  For left-sided endocarditis, current guidelines recommend 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy.  However, a recent multicenter, randomized, non-blinded study of uncomplicated left-sided endocarditis found that switching to oral antibiotics (after a minimum of 10 days of parenteral therapy) to be non-inferior to continued parenteral therapy.  In addition, length of hospital stay was shortened in the patients switched to oral therapy.  This approach has the potential to reduce the psychologic stress and some of the risks inherent to prolonged inpatient parenteral therapy ,2 Treatment references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【24】 Cardiac valve surgery (debridement, valve repair, or valve replacement) is sometimes required for treatment of infectious endocarditis ,3 Treatment references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【25】 Surgery is typically indicated in Patients with heart failure (particularly those with prosthetic, aortic, or native mitral valve endocarditis and those with pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock) Patients with uncontrolled infection (those with persistent infection, infection with fungal or resistant organisms, recurrent prosthetic valve endocarditis, or endocarditis complicated by heart block, abscess, aneurysm, fistula, or enlarging vegetation) Patients at risk for embolism (particularly those with prosthetic, aortic or mitral native valve endocarditis, and large vegetations [defined in the United States as > 10 mm] or those with recurrent emboli).  Early surgery in these patients decreases the risk of embolic events.  Timing of surgery requires experienced clinical judgment.  If heart failure caused by a correctable lesion is worsening (particularly when the organism is S.  aureus, a gram-negative bacillus, or a fungus), surgery may be required after only 24 to 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy.  Endocarditis involving an implanted cardiac electronic device requires complete removal of the pacemaker or defibrillator, including all leads and the generator.  Right-sided endocarditis is usually managed medically.  If surgery is necessary (due to heart failure or lack of therapeutic response), then valve repair is preferred over replacement to avoid future prosthetic valve infection due to any continued IV drug use.  Surgery is usually delayed for a month after intracranial hemorrhage or major ischemic stroke.  Anticoagulation Patients taking anticoagulants are at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke and for bleeding resulting from urgent invasive procedures.  Anticoagulation should be withheld in patients with cerebral emboli, because it increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.  The decision to withhold anticoagulation in other patients should be based on the relative risks of hemorrhagic stroke and thromboembolism ,4 Treatment references Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【26】 Response to treatment After starting therapy, patients with penicillin-susceptible streptococcal endocarditis usually feel better, and fever is reduced within 3 to 7 days.  Fever may continue for reasons other than persistent infection (eg, drug allergy, phlebitis, infarction due to emboli).  Patients with staphylococcal endocarditis tend to respond more slowly.  Diminution of vegetation size can be followed by serial echocardiography.  Echocardiography should be done at the completion of therapy to establish a new baseline for valvular appearance (including sterile vegetations) and insufficiency.  Relapse usually occurs within 4 weeks.  Antibiotic retreatment may be effective, but surgery may also be required.  In patients without prosthetic valves, recrudescence of endocarditis after 6 weeks usually results from a new infection rather than a relapse.  Even after successful antimicrobial therapy, sterile emboli and valve rupture may occur up to 1 year later.  Risk of recurrence is significant, so ongoing life-long dental and cutaneous hygiene is advised.  Patients who require antibiotic therapy for any reason should have at least 3 sets of blood cultures drawn before antibiotics are started. \n【27】 Prevention of Infective Endocarditis Preventive dental examination and therapy before surgery to repair heart valves or congenital heart lesions is recommended.  Measures to reduce health care–acquired bacteremia aim to curb the rising incidence of iatrogenic bacteremia and subsequent endocarditis are also recommended.  Endocarditis prophylaxis during implantation of prosthetic devices is changing to accommodate the rise in endocarditis due to enterococci.  Prophylaxis often involves use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid instead of a cephalosporin.  Dental and cutaneous hygiene is recommended for the general population but particularly for patients at intermediate risk (those with native valve disease) and high-risk.  High-risk patients The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients at high risk of an adverse outcome as a result of infective endocarditis .  Such patients include those with Prosthetic heart valves, including transcatheter implanted prostheses Prosthetic material used for heart valve repair (eg, annuloplasty rings, chords) Previous infective endocarditis Certain congenital heart diseases (CHD): Unrepaired cyanotic CHD (including palliative shunts and conduits), completely repaired CHD during the first 6 mo after surgery if prosthetic material or device was used, repaired CHD that has residual defects at or adjacent to the site of repair Heart transplant recipients with valvulopathy European Society of Cardiology prophylaxis regimens are described in reference 1 Prevention reference Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【28】 Procedures requiring antibiotic prophylaxis Most procedures for which prophylaxis is required for high-risk patients High-risk patients Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi. \n【29】 Other procedures include those respiratory tract procedures in which mucosa is incised, vaginal delivery in some high-risk patients (patients with prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair and for patients with unrepaired and palliated cyanotic congenital heart disease), and gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or musculoskeletal procedures that involve an area with an established infection .  Guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis vary geographically.   Prophylactic antibiotic regimens For most patients and procedures, a single dose shortly before the procedure is effective.  For oral-dental and respiratory procedures, a drug effective against viridans group streptococci is used .  For vaginal delivery, give ampicillin 2 g IV or IM plus gentamicin 1. 5 mg/kg (maximum 120 mg) IV administered within 30 minutes before delivery, followed by ampicillin 1 g IV or IM (or amoxicillin 1 g [as the trihydrate] orally) 6 hours later.   Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures* Route Drug and Dosage in Adults (and Children) Drug and Dosage in Adults (and Children) Allergic to Penicillin Oral (given 1 hour before procedure) Amoxicillin 2 g (50 mg/kg) Clindamycin 600 mg (20 mg/kg) or Cephalexin or cefadroxil 2 g (50 mg/kg) or Azithromycin or clarithromycin 500 mg (15 mg/kg) Parenteral (given 30 minutes before procedure) Ampicillin 2 g (50 mg/kg) IM or IV Clindamycin 600 mg (20 mg/kg) IV or Cefazolin 1 g (25 mg/kg) IM or IV * For patients without active infection.  \n【30】 For gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal procedures on areas involving infected tissue, antibiotics should be selected based on the known organism and its sensitivities.  If infection is present but the infecting organism has not been identified, antibiotics for gastrointestinal and genitourinary prophylaxis should be effective against enterococci (eg, amoxicillin or ampicillin, or vancomycin for patients who are allergic to penicillin).  Antibiotics for skin and musculoskeletal prophylaxis should be effective against staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci (eg, a cephalosporin or vancomycin or clindamycin if infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococci is possible). \n【31】 Key Points Because the normal heart is relatively resistant to infection, endocarditis occurs mainly when there is a predisposing abnormality of the endocardium.  Predisposing cardiac abnormalities include congenital heart defects, rheumatic valvular disease, bicuspid or calcific aortic valves, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, prior endocarditis, and intracardiac devices.  Local cardiac consequences include myocardial abscess, conduction system abnormalities, and sudden, severe valvular regurgitation.  Systemic consequences include immune phenomena (eg, glomerulonephritis) and septic emboli, which may affect any organ put particularly the lungs (with right sided endocarditis), kidneys, spleen, central nervous system, skin, and retina (with left-sided endocarditis).  Do blood cultures and diagnose using modified Duke or European Society of Cardiology clinical criteria.  Treat with a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy; surgery may be needed for mechanical complications or resistant organisms.  Give antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients at high risk of an adverse outcome from infective endocarditis, including those with prosthetic heart valves or heart valve repair, previous infective endocarditis, certain congenital heart diseases, or who are heart transplant recipients with valvulopathy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Work-related back injuries are usually due to falls while standing, falls from heights, or direct blunt trauma to the back and are related to certain tasks.  To diagnose work-related back injuries, doctors ask detailed questions about the person's past and current jobs and do a thorough physical examination and sometimes imaging tests.  Employers can take measures to help prevent these injuries.  Employers can change the way work is done, reduce the length of shifts, limit the amount of overtime, and/or schedule more breaks.  Whether personal protective equipment (PPE), such as braces, wrist splints, and back belts, can help is unclear.  Work-related back injuries range from strains and sprains Overview of Sprains and Other Soft-Tissue Injuries Sprains are tears in ligaments (tissues that connect one bone to another). \n【1】 The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering. \n【2】 Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.  Fractures usually result from injuries or overuse. \n【3】 Work-related back injuries are usually due to falls while standing, falls from heights, or direct blunt trauma to the back and are related to certain tasks.  These tasks include Operating motor vehicles Heavy lifting Repetitive lifting (heavy and light items) Tasks that require reaching up with one or both arms (overhead work, such as drilling or finishing drywall) Tasks that vibrate the whole body (such as driving a construction vehicle over rough terrain) Other issues may contribute to work-related back pain.  People may feel dissatisfied with their job or think their workload is too heavy.  Their work may be tedious or monotonous or have demanding deadlines.  They may feel that they have no input to decision-making.  Smoking and obesity may contribute to back pain whether it is work-related or not. If people have had work-related back injury and pain, future back injury is more likely.  Employers may be concerned about malingering (conscious exaggeration of symptoms to obtain a benefit) in workers who claim compensation for work-related back injury and back pain.  Diagnosis of Work-Related Back Injuries A doctor's evaluation Sometimes imaging tests The diagnosis of work-related back injury is similar to that for any other back problem Evaluation Low back pain and neck pain are among the most common reasons for health care visits. \n【4】 Doctors focus on the person's work history, including past work-related injuries.  They ask about specific work tasks, including exactly what the person was doing when injured.  Doctors also do a thorough physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【5】 X-rays, computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done if the injury was caused by direct trauma (such as a direct, forceful blow to the back or a fall from a height) or if the examination detected possible problems, such as nerve damage or fractures.  Doctors often provide detailed notes about their findings when there are legal issues about compensation for a work-related back injury.  Prevention of Work-Related Back Injuries The following are examples of strategies employers can use to reduce the risk of work-related back injury: Employers can change the way materials and products are transported.  For example, they can provide mechanical assist devices for lifting or carrying heavy loads.  They can change to packages with handles or slotted hand holes or store packages in areas that are easier to reach.  Employers can reduce the length of shifts, limit the amount of overtime, and/or schedule more breaks.  Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as braces, wrist splints, and back belts, may help, but they may also make it harder for workers to do the task.  Employers can set up an ergonomic program to evaluate work spaces and reconfigure them to reduce the risk of injuries.  Such a program can reduce the risk of problems caused by overusing muscles, having bad posture, and doing repetitive tasks.  Ergonomics is also concerned with reducing vibration, controlling temperature, eliminating glare, and ensuring adequate lighting.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a long-term disease that causes swelling, scarring, and narrowing of the bile ducts.  Your bile ducts are tubes that carry bile from your liver to your intestines.

If you have primary sclerosing cholangitis, your bile ducts become blocked and eventually your liver stops working Primary sclerosing cholangitis is most common in people who have inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea. \n【1】 Ultrasonography or MRI/MRCP can usually detect a tumor in the bile ducts or gallbladder. \n【2】 .

Most are asymptomatic, but some cause hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant discomfort, or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  Most are detected incidentally on ultrasound or other scans . \n【1】 Diagnosis is usually possible with imaging tests but may require biopsy.  Treatment is needed only in a few specific circumstances.  Hepatocellular adenoma is the most important benign tumor to recognize.  It occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, particularly those taking oral contraceptives, possibly via estrogen’s effects .  Most adenomas are asymptomatic, but large ones may cause right upper quadrant discomfort.  Rarely, adenomas manifest as peritonitis and shock due to rupture and intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  Rarely, they become malignant.  Diagnosis is often suspected based on ultrasound or CT results, but biopsy is sometimes needed for confirmation.  Gadoxetate-enhanced MRI is more sensitive than CT and can differentiate subtypes of adenomas at increased risk of progressing to malignancy .  Recognition of the beta-catenin subtype is particularly important, because it has a 5 to 10% risk of malignant transformation and should be resected.  Adenomas due to contraceptive use may regress if the contraceptive is stopped.  If the adenoma does not regress or if it is subcapsular or > 5 cm, surgical resection is often recommended.  Focal nodular hyperplasia This localized hamartoma may resemble macronodular cirrhosis histologically.  Diagnosis is usually based on MRI or CT with contrast; the classic appearance is a lesion with a central scar.  But biopsy may be necessary for confirmation.  Treatment is rarely needed.  Hemangiomas are usually small and asymptomatic; they occur in 1 to 5% of adults.  Symptoms are more likely if they are > 4 cm; symptoms include discomfort, fullness, and, less often, anorexia, nausea, early satiety, and pain secondary to bleeding or thrombosis.  These tumors often have a characteristic highly vascular appearance.  Hemangiomas are found incidentally during ultrasonography, CT, or MRI.  CT typically shows a well-demarcated, hypodense mass; when contrast is used, there is early peripheral enhancement, followed by later centrifugal enhancement.  Treatment is usually not indicated.  Resection can be considered if symptoms are troublesome or if a hemangioma is rapidly enlarging.  In infants, hemangiomas often regress spontaneously by age 2 years.  However, large hemangiomas occasionally cause arteriovenous shunting sufficient to cause heart failure and sometimes consumption coagulopathy.  In these cases, treatment may include high-dose corticosteroids, sometimes diuretics and digoxin to improve heart function, interferon alfa (given subcutaneously), surgical removal, selective hepatic artery embolization, and, rarely, liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation. \n【2】 Other benign tumors Lipomas are soft, movable, subcutaneous nodules of adipocytes (fat cells); overlying skin appears normal. \n【3】 Benign bile duct adenomas are rare, inconsequential, and usually detected incidentally.

Many anomalies are asymptomatic and diagnosed via prenatal ultrasonography or part of a routine evaluation for other congenital anomalies.  Other anomalies are diagnosed during evaluation of urinary tract obstruction Obstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy). \n【1】  Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure. \n【2】 Symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are usually not present until adulthood.  Rarely, symptoms manifest in infancy in the more aggressive form.  Children may be diagnosed earlier when a cyst is found incidentally or via family history.  Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease affects the Kidneys Liver The kidneys are usually greatly enlarged and contain small cysts; renal failure is common in childhood.  The liver is enlarged and has periportal fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and scattered cysts; the remainder of the hepatic parenchyma is normal.  Fibrosis causes portal hypertension by age 5 to 10 years, but hepatic function is normal or minimally impaired.  Disease severity and progression vary.  Severe disease may manifest prenatally or soon after birth or in early childhood with renal-related symptoms; less severely affected patients present in late childhood or adolescence with hepatic-related symptoms.  Affected neonates have a protuberant abdomen with huge, firm, smooth, symmetric kidneys.  Severely affected neonates commonly have pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to the in utero effects of renal dysfunction and oligohydramnios.  In patients aged 5 to 10 years, signs of portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein.  It is caused most often by cirrhosis (in North America), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. \n【3】 If the patient presents in adolescence, nephromegaly is less marked, renal insufficiency may be mild to moderate, and the major symptoms are those related to portal hypertension.  Diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease may be difficult, especially without a family history.  Ultrasonography may show renal or hepatic cysts; definitive diagnosis may require biopsy.  Ultrasonography in late pregnancy usually allows presumptive in utero diagnosis.  If postnatal ultrasonography is not definitive, MRI or CT may be diagnostic.  If needed, molecular testing for PKHD1 can be done when clinical criteria is not met.  Many neonates die in the first few days or weeks of life from pulmonary insufficiency.  Most who survive develop progressive renal failure often requiring renal replacement therapy.  Experience with renal transplantation with or without hepatic transplantation is limited.  When transplantation is done, hypersplenism is cytopenia caused by splenomegaly.   Hypersplenism is a secondary process that can arise from splenomegaly of almost any cause , calyx, or ureteral orifice.  Duplex kidneys have a single renal unit with more than one collecting system.  This anomaly differs from fused kidneys, which involves fusion of two renal parenchymal units maintaining their respective individual collecting systems.  Some duplication anomalies have ureteral ectopy with or without ureterocele Ureteral anomalies frequently occur with renal anomalies but may occur independently. \n【4】 Management depends on the anatomy and function of each separately drained segment.  Surgery may be necessary to correct obstruction or VUR.  Fusion anomalies With fusion anomalies, the kidneys are joined, but the ureters enter the bladder on each side.  These anomalies increase the risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【5】 The ureters course medially and anteriorly over this isthmus and generally drain well.  Obstruction, if present, is usually secondary to insertion of the ureters high in the renal pelvis.  Pyeloplasty relieves the obstruction and can be done without resecting the isthmus.  Crossed fused renal ectopia is the second most common fusion anomaly.  The renal parenchyma (representing both kidneys) is on one side of the vertebral column.  One of the ureters crosses the midline and enters the bladder on the side opposite the fused kidneys.  When ureteropelvic junction obstruction is present, pyeloplasty is the treatment of choice.  Fused pelvic kidney (pancake kidney) is much less common.  A single pelvic kidney is served by two collecting systems and ureters.  If obstruction is present, reconstruction is needed.  Malrotation is usually of little clinical significance.  Ultrasonography often shows hydronephrosis.  Further evaluation with a magnetic resonance urogram or renal scan may be done when clinicians are concerned about possible obstruction.  Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) In this condition, there is a nonfunctioning renal unit consisting of noncommunicating cysts with intervening solid tissue composed of fibrosis, primitive tubules, and foci of cartilage.  Usually, ureteral atresia is also present.  The contralateral kidney is usually normal, but up to 10% of patients may have vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【6】 Frequently, the kidney progressively involutes and eventually is no longer visible on ultrasonography.  Development of tumors, infection, and/or hypertension is rare.  Most experts recommend observation to monitor for involution.  Nephrectomy may be considered for the presence of solid tissue, progressive enlargement, or rarely hypertension or a ruptured cyst that is causing pain.  Renal agenesis Bilateral renal agenesis as part of a syndrome of oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and extremity and facial anomalies (classic Potter syndrome) is fatal within minutes to hours because of the pulmonary hypoplasia and subsequent respiratory distress.  Fetal demise is common.  Unilateral renal agenesis accounts for about 5% of renal anomalies.  Many cases result from complete involution in utero of a multicystic dysplastic kidney.  It usually is accompanied by ureteral agenesis with absence of the ipsilateral trigone and ureteral orifice.  However, the ipsilateral adrenal gland is unaffected.  No treatment is necessary; compensatory hypertrophy of the solitary kidney maintains normal renal function.  Because the kidneys share a common embryologic origin with the vas deferens and uterus, boys may have agenesis of the vas deferens and girls may have uterine anomalies.  Renal dysplasia In renal dysplasia (a histologic diagnosis), the renal vasculature, tubules, collecting ducts, or drainage apparatus develops abnormally.  Diagnosis of renal dysplasia is by biopsy.  If dysplasia is segmental, treatment of renal dysplasia is often unnecessary.  If dysplasia is extensive, renal dysfunction may necessitate nephrologic care, including renal replacement therapy.  Renal ectopia (abnormal renal location) usually results when a kidney fails to ascend from its origin in the true pelvis; a rare exception occurs with a superiorly ascended (thoracic) kidney.  Pelvic ectopia increases the incidence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【7】 Obstruction and severe reflux may be corrected surgically when indicated (if causing hypertension, recurrent infections, or renal growth retardation).  Renal hypoplasia usually occurs because inadequate ureteral bud branching causes an underdeveloped, small kidney with histologically normal nephrons.  If hypoplasia is segmental, hypertension can occur, and ablative surgery may be needed.  Patients should be evaluated for vesicoureteral reflux Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "1223871f-cd49-4c46-9053-bcbeacd1e4bb", "title": null, "text": "【0】Dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing.  It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause.  Pathophysiology of Dyspnea Although dyspnea is a relatively common problem, the pathophysiology of the uncomfortable sensation of breathing is poorly understood.  Unlike those for other types of noxious stimuli, there are no specialized dyspnea receptors (although MRI studies have identified a few specific areas in the midbrain that may mediate perception of dyspnea).  The experience of dyspnea likely results from a complex interaction between chemoreceptor stimulation, mechanical abnormalities in breathing, and the perception of those abnormalities by the central nervous system.  Some authors have described the imbalance between neurologic stimulation and mechanical changes in the lungs and chest wall as neuromechanical uncoupling.  Etiology of Dyspnea has many pulmonary, cardiac, and other causes , which vary by acuity of onset .  The most common causes include Asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction. \n【1】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings. \n【2】Evaluation of Dyspnea History of present illness should cover the duration, temporal onset (eg, abrupt, insidious), and provoking or exacerbating factors (eg, allergen exposure, cold, exertion, supine position).  Severity can be determined by assessing the activity level required to cause dyspnea (eg, dyspnea at rest is more severe than dyspnea only when climbing stairs).  Physicians should note how much dyspnea has changed from the patient’s usual state. \n【3】; dependent edema, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. \n【4】; fever, chills, cough, and sputum production (pneumonia); black, tarry stools or heavy menses ,occult bleeding, possibly causing anemia Etiology of Anemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs), which leads to a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin content. \n【5】; and weight loss or night sweats (cancer or chronic lung infection).  Past medical history should cover disorders known to cause dyspnea, including asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstriction. \n【6】 Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.  Examination focuses on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems.  A full lung examination is done, particularly including adequacy of air entry and exit, symmetry of breath sounds, and presence of crackles, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing.  Signs of consolidation (eg, egophony, dullness to percussion) should be sought.  The cervical, supraclavicular, and inguinal areas should be inspected and palpated for lymphadenopathy.  Neck veins should be inspected for distention, and the legs and presacral area should be palpated for pitting edema (both suggesting heart failure).  Heart sounds should be auscultated with notation of any extra heart sounds, muffled heart sounds, or murmur.  Testing for pulsus paradoxus Pulsus paradoxus Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart. \n【7】 As the cuff is further deflated, the point at which the first Korotkoff sound is audible during both inspiration and expiration is recorded.  If the difference between the first and second measurement is > 12 mm Hg, then pulsus paradoxus is present.  Conjunctiva should be examined for pallor.  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Dyspnea at rest during examination Decreased level of consciousness or agitation or confusion Accessory muscle use and poor air excursion Chest pain Crackles Weight loss Night sweats Palpitations Interpretation of findings The history and physical examination often suggest a cause and guide further testing ,1 Evaluation reference Dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing. \n【8】 Several findings are of note: Wheezing is a relatively high-pitched whistling noise produced by movement of air through narrowed or compressed small airways.  It is a symptom as well as a physical finding. \n【9】 Stridor is a high-pitched, predominantly inspiratory sound. \n【10】 Crackles suggest left heart failure, interstitial lung disease, or, if accompanied by signs of consolidation, pneumonia.  However, the symptoms and signs of life-threatening conditions such as myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific.  Furthermore, the severity of symptoms is not always proportional to the severity of the cause (eg, pulmonary embolism in a fit, healthy person may cause only mild dyspnea).  Thus, a high degree of suspicion for these common conditions is prudent.  It is often appropriate to rule out these conditions before attributing dyspnea to a less serious etiology.  A clinical prediction rule can help estimate the risk of pulmonary embolism.  Note that normal oxygen saturation does not exclude pulmonary embolism.  Hyperventilation syndrome Hyperventilation Syndrome Hyperventilation syndrome is anxiety-related dyspnea and tachypnea often accompanied by systemic symptoms. \n【11】 Because hypoxia may cause tachypnea and agitation, it is unwise to assume every rapidly breathing, anxious young person merely has hyperventilation syndrome.  Testing Pulse oximetry should be done in all patients, and a chest x-ray should be done as well unless symptoms are clearly caused by a mild or moderate exacerbation of a known condition.  For example, patients with asthma or heart failure do not require an x-ray for each flare-up, unless clinical findings suggest another cause or an unusually severe attack.  Most adults should have an ECG to detect myocardial ischemia (and serum cardiac marker testing if suspicion is high) unless myocardial ischemia can be excluded clinically.  In patients with severe or deteriorating respiratory status, arterial blood gases (ABGs) should be measured to more precisely quantify hypoxemia, measure PaCO2, diagnose any acid-base disorders Acid-Base Disorders Acid-base disorders are pathologic changes in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2) or serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) that typically produce abnormal arterial pH values. \n【12】 Patients who have no clear diagnosis after chest x-ray and ECG and are at moderate or high risk of having pulmonary embolism (from a clinical prediction rule) should undergo CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion scanning.  Patients who are at low risk may have D-dimer testing (a normal D-dimer level effectively rules out pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient).  Chronic dyspnea may warrant additional tests, such as CT, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and bronchoscopy. \n【13】Treatment of Dyspnea Treatment is correction of the underlying disorder.  Hypoxemia (in the absence of compensatory hyperventilation) is treated with supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation > 88% or PaO2 > 55 mm Hg (> 7. 3 kPa) because levels above these thresholds provide adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.  Levels below these thresholds are on the steep portion of the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve, where even a small decline in arterial oxygen tension can result in a large decline in hemoglobin saturation.  Oxygen saturation should be maintained at > 93% if myocardial or cerebral ischemia is a concern, although data suggest that supplemental oxygen is not beneficial in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction unless the patient has hypoxia.  Morphine 0. 5 to 5 mg IV helps reduce anxiety and the discomfort of dyspnea in various conditions, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and the dyspnea that commonly accompanies terminal illness.  However, opioids can be deleterious in patients with acute airflow limitation (eg, asthma, COPD) because they suppress the ventilatory drive and can worsen respiratory acidemia.  Key Points Pulse oximetry is a key component of the examination.  Low oxygen saturation (< 90%) indicates a serious problem, but normal saturation does not rule one out.  Accessory muscle use, a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, or a decreased level of consciousness requires emergency evaluation and hospitalization.  Myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism are relatively common, but symptoms and signs can be nonspecific.  Exacerbation of known conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure) is common, but patients may also develop new problems.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "831c30f2-6a06-4114-9d85-d7a59cda9f23", "title": null, "text": "【0】More than 50% of pregnant women take prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs or use social drugs (such as tobacco and alcohol) or illicit drugs at some time during pregnancy, and use of drugs during pregnancy is increasing.  In general, drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless necessary because many can harm the fetus.  Less than 2 to 3% of all birth defects result from drugs that are taken to treat a disorder or symptom.  Sometimes drugs are essential for the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus.  In such cases, a woman should talk with her doctor or other health care practitioner about the risks and benefits of taking the drug.  Before taking any drug (including over-the-counter drugs) or dietary supplement (including medicinal herbs), a pregnant woman should consult her health care practitioner.  A health care practitioner may recommend that a woman take certain vitamins and minerals during pregnancy.  Drugs taken by a pregnant woman reach the fetus primarily by crossing the placenta, the same route taken by oxygen and nutrients, which are needed for the fetus's growth and development.  However, drugs that do not cross the placenta may still harm the fetus by affecting the uterus or the placenta.  Drugs that a pregnant woman takes during pregnancy can affect the fetus in several ways: They can act directly on the fetus, causing damage, abnormal development ,leading to birth defects Overview of Birth Defects Birth defects, also called congenital anomalies, are physical abnormalities that occur before a baby is born.  They are usually obvious within the first year of life. \n【1】 They can alter the function of the placenta, usually by causing blood vessels to narrow (constrict) and thus reducing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus from the mother.  Sometimes the result is a baby that is underweight and underdeveloped.  They can cause the muscles of the uterus to contract forcefully, indirectly injuring the fetus by reducing its blood supply or triggering preterm labor Preterm Labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy is considered preterm.  Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems.  The diagnosis of preterm labor is usually obvious. \n【2】 They can also affect the fetus indirectly.  For example, drugs that lower the mother's blood pressure may reduce blood flow to the placenta and thus reduce the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus.  How Drugs Cross the Placenta Some of the fetus's blood vessels are contained in tiny hairlike projections (villi) of the placenta that extend into the wall of the uterus.  The mother's blood passes through the space surrounding the villi (intervillous space).  Only a thin membrane (placental membrane) separates the mother's blood in the intervillous space from the fetus's blood in the villi.  Drugs in the mother's blood can cross this membrane into blood vessels in the villi and pass through the umbilical cord to the fetus.  How a drug affects a fetus depends on The fetus's stage of development The strength and dose of the drug The permeability of the placenta (how easily substances pass through it) The genetic make-up Genetic Makeup and Response to Drugs Differences in genetic (inherited) makeup among individuals affect what the body does to a drug and what the drug does to the body. \n【3】 Drugs were classified from those with the least risk to those that are highly toxic and should never be used by pregnant women because they cause severe birth defects.  One example of a highly toxic drug is thalidomide.  This drug causes extreme underdevelopment of arms and legs and defects of the intestine, heart, and blood vessels in the babies of women who take the drug during pregnancy.  The FDA's classification system was based largely on information from studies in animals, which often do not apply to people.  For example, some drugs (such as meclizine) cause birth defects in animals, but the same effects have not been seen in people.  Taking meclizine for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of having a baby with a birth defect.  The classification system was based much less often on well-designed studies in pregnant women because few such studies have been done.  Thus, applying the classification system in specific situations was difficult.  Because of this problem, the FDA eliminated the five risk categories.  Instead, the FDA now requires that the drug label include more information about the risk of taking every drug during pregnancy.  This information includes the following: The risks of taking the drug during pregnancy and breastfeeding The evidence that has identified these risks Information to help health care practitioners decide whether the drug should be used during pregnancy and to help them explain the risks and benefits of using the drug to the woman Typically, health care practitioners follow a general rule: They consider giving a pregnant woman a drug to treat a disorder only when the potential benefit outweighs known risks.  Often, a safer drug can be substituted for one that is likely to cause harm during pregnancy.  For prevention of blood clots, the anticoagulant heparin is preferred to warfarin.  Several safe antibiotics, such as penicillin, are available to treat infections.  Some drugs can have effects after they are stopped.  For example, isotretinoin, a drug used to treat skin disorders, is stored in fat beneath the skin and is released slowly.  Isotretinoin can cause birth defects if women become pregnant within 2 weeks after the drug is stopped.  Therefore, women are advised to wait at least 3 to 4 weeks after the drug is stopped before they become pregnant.  \n【4】 Vaccines During Pregnancy Immunization Overview of Immunization (vaccination) helps the body defend itself against diseases caused by certain bacteria or viruses. \n【5】 Vaccines Overview of Immunization (vaccination) helps the body defend itself against diseases caused by certain bacteria or viruses. \n【6】 Other vaccines ,such as those for cholera Vaccines Cholera is a serious infection of the intestine that is caused by the gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae and that causes severe diarrhea, which can be fatal without treatment. \n【7】 Typically, hepatitis A is less serious than hepatitis B. \n【8】 It typically causes a high fever and abdominal pain. \n【9】 However, all pregnant women who are in the 2nd or 3rd trimester during the influenza (flu) season should be given the influenza vaccine Influenza Vaccine The influenza virus vaccine helps protect against influenza.  Two types of influenza virus, type A and type B, regularly cause seasonal epidemics of influenza in the United States. \n【10】 The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination COVID-19 Vaccine Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines provide protection against COVID-19.  COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n【11】 Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing.  These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.   Drugs Used to Treat Heart and Blood Vessel Disorders During Pregnancy Drugs to lower high blood pressure ,antihypertensives Drug therapy High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【12】 Either type of high blood pressure increases the risk of problems for the woman ,such as preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new high blood pressure or worsening of existing high blood pressure that is accompanied by excess protein in the urine and that develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. \n【13】 However, antihypertensives can markedly reduce blood flow to the placenta if they lower blood pressure too rapidly in pregnant women.  So pregnant women who have to take these drugs are closely monitored.  Several types of antihypertensives, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and thiazide diuretics, are usually not given to pregnant women.  These drugs can cause serious problems in the fetus, such as kidney damage, inadequate growth before birth ,growth restriction Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) Newborns A newborn who weighs less than 90% of newborns of the same gestational age at birth (below the 10th percentile) is considered small for gestational age. \n【14】 Spironolactone is also not given to pregnant women.  This drug may cause the development of feminine characteristics (feminization) in a male fetus.  Digoxin, used to treat heart failure Heart Failure and some abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart. \n【15】 But at the usual doses, digoxin typically has little effect on the baby before or after birth.  Antidepressants During Pregnancy Antidepressants Drug therapy for depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【16】 Use is common because about 7 to 23% of pregnant women have depression.  For pregnant women, the benefits of treating depression usually outweigh the risks.  Paroxetine appears to increase the risk of heart birth defects.  So if a pregnant woman takes paroxetine, echocardiography should be done to evaluate the fetus's heart.  However, other SSRIs do not increase this risk.  If a pregnant woman takes antidepressants, the newborn may have withdrawal symptoms (such as irritability and shaking) after delivery.  To prevent these symptoms, doctors may gradually reduce the dose of the antidepressant during the 3rd trimester and stop the drug before the baby is born.  However, if the woman has significant signs of depression or if symptoms worsen as the dose is reduced, antidepressants should be continued.  Depression during pregnancy can lead to postpartum depression Postpartum Depression Postpartum depression is a feeling of extreme sadness and loss of interest in usual activities during the first few weeks or months after delivery. \n【17】 Antiviral Drugs During Pregnancy Some antiviral drugs (such as zidovudine and ritonavir for HIV infection) have been safely used during pregnancy for many years.  However, some antiviral drugs may cause problems in the fetus.  For example, some evidence suggests that when some HIV regimens with a combination of antiviral drugs are given during the 1st trimester, the risk of cleft lip and palate may be increased.  If a pregnant woman gets COVID-19, her treatment team and she should discuss the risks and benefits for her and then decide whether remdesivir should be used to treat COVID-19.  Generally, experts recommend that theoretical concerns about the safety of remdesivir during pregnancy should not prevent its use in pregnant women.  There are little data about the effects of remdesivir on the fetus.  If a pregnant woman gets influenza, she should seek treatment as soon as possible because treating influenza within 48 hours of when symptoms begin is most effective.  However, treatment at any point during the infection reduces the risk of severe complications.  No well-designed studies of zanamivir and oseltamivir have been done in pregnant women.  However, many studies based on observation indicate that treating pregnant women with zanamivir or oseltamivir does not increase the risk of harmful effects.  There is little or no information about the use of other influenza drugs during pregnancy.  Acyclovir, taken by mouth or applied to the skin, appears to be safe during pregnancy.  Social Drugs During Pregnancy Cigarette (tobacco) smoking during pregnancy Although cigarette smoking tobacco is harmful to almost every organ in the body.  Smoking increases the risk of heart attack, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other disorders. \n【18】 The most consistent effect of smoking on the fetus during pregnancy is A reduction in birth weight ,growth restriction Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) Newborns A newborn who weighs less than 90% of newborns of the same gestational age at birth (below the 10th percentile) is considered small for gestational age. \n【19】 The average birth weight of babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy is 6 ounces less than that of babies born to women who do not smoke.  Birth defects of the heart, brain, and face are more common among babies of smokers than among those of nonsmokers.  Also, the risk of the following may be increased: Sudden infant death syndrome Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Sudden infant death syndrome is the sudden, unexpected death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy infant between 1 month and 1 year of age. \n【20】 After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows. \n【21】 Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems. \n【22】 Bacteria can infect the uterus and surrounding areas soon after delivery. \n【23】 Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus. \n【24】 These effects are thought to be caused by carbon monoxide and nicotine.  Carbon monoxide may reduce the oxygen supply to the body's tissues.  Nicotine stimulates the release of hormones that constrict the vessels supplying blood to the uterus and placenta, so that less oxygen and fewer nutrients reach the fetus.  Because of the possible harmful effects of smoking during pregnancy, pregnant women should make every effort to not smoke during pregnancy, including discussing strategies with their doctor.  Pregnant women should avoid exposure to secondhand smoke because it may similarly harm the fetus.  Alcohol during pregnancy Drinking alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【25】 Because the amount of alcohol required to cause fetal alcohol syndrome is unknown, pregnant women are advised to abstain from drinking any alcohol regularly or on binges.  Avoiding alcohol altogether is even safer.  e leading known cause of birth defects is drinking alcohol during pregnancy.  The risk of miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n【26】 Often, the birth weight of babies born to women who drink regularly during pregnancy is substantially below normal.  The average birth weight is about 4 pounds for babies exposed to large amounts of alcohol, compared with 7 pounds for all babies.  Newborns of women who drank during pregnancy may not thrive and are more likely to die soon after birth.  Fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the most serious consequences of drinking during pregnancy.  Binge drinking as few as three drinks a day can cause this syndrome.  It occurs in about 2 of 1,000 live births.  This syndrome includes the following: Inadequate growth before birth Small-for-Gestational-Age (SGA) Newborns A newborn who weighs less than 90% of newborns of the same gestational age at birth (below the 10th percentile) is considered small for gestational age. \n【27】 \"Congenital\" means \"present at birth. \n【28】 Often the head is small because the brain is small and abnormally developed. \n【29】 Some are severe, but many are not. \n【30】 These problems can occur even when the baby has no obvious physical birth defects.  Caffeine during pregnancy Whether consuming caffeine during pregnancy harms the fetus is unclear.  Evidence seems to suggest that consuming caffeine in small amounts (for example, one cup of coffee a day) during pregnancy poses little or no risk to the fetus.  Caffeine, which is contained in coffee, tea, some sodas, chocolate, and some drugs, is a stimulant that readily crosses the placenta to the fetus.  Some evidence suggests that drinking more than seven cups of coffee a day may increase the risk of having a stillbirth is death of a fetus after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus. \n【31】 Some experts recommend limiting coffee consumption and drinking decaffeinated beverages when possible.  Aspartame during pregnancy Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, appears to be safe during pregnancy when it is consumed in small amounts, such as in amounts used in normal portions of artificially sweetened foods and beverages.  For example, pregnant women should consume no more than 1 liter of diet soda a day.  Pregnant women with phenylketonuria (PKU) Phenylketonuria is a disorder of amino acid metabolism that occurs in infants born without the ability to normally break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. \n【32】 Illicit Drugs During Pregnancy Use of illicit drugs (particularly opioids) during pregnancy can cause complications during pregnancy and serious problems in the developing fetus and the newborn.  For pregnant women, injecting illicit drugs increases the risk of infections that can affect or be transmitted to the fetus.  These infections include hepatitis Overview of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.   Hepatitis is common throughout the world. \n【33】 Also, when pregnant women take illicit drugs, growth of the fetus is more likely to be inadequate, and premature births are more common.  Amphetamines during pregnancy Use of amphetamines are stimulant drugs that are used to treat certain medical conditions but are also subject to abuse. \n【34】 Bath salts during pregnancy Bath salts refers to a group of designer drugs made from various substances that resemble amphetamine.  More and more pregnant women are using these drugs.  The drugs may cause the blood vessels in the fetus to narrow, reducing the amount oxygen the fetus gets.  Also, these drugs increase the risk of the following: Stillbirth is death of a fetus after 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n【35】 They are usually obvious within the first year of life. \n【36】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful. \n【37】 Then, less oxygen and fewer nutrients reach the fetus.  If pregnant women use cocaine regularly, risk of the following is increased: Miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n【38】 For example, the cause may be other risk factors that are common in women who use cocaine.  Such factors include cigarette smoking, use of other illicit drugs, deficient prenatal care, and poverty.  Hallucinogens during pregnancy Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that cause profound distortions in people's perceptions. \n【39】 Marijuana during pregnancy Whether use of marijuana (cannabis) is a drug made from the plants Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica that contain a psychoactive chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). \n【40】 The main component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, can cross the placenta and thus may affect the fetus.  However, use of a small amount of marijuana does not appear to increase the risk of birth defects or to slow the growth of the fetus.  Marijuana does not cause behavioral problems in the newborn unless it is used heavily during pregnancy.  Opioids during pregnancy Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【41】 Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【42】 Consequently, the fetus may become addicted to them and may have withdrawal symptoms Withdrawal symptoms Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【43】 However, use of opioids rarely results in birth defects.  Use of opioids during pregnancy increases the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as Miscarriage Abnormal presentation of the baby Abnormal Position and Presentation of the Fetus Position refers to whether the fetus is facing rearward (toward the woman’s back—that is, face down when the woman lies on her back) or forward (face up). \n【44】 For example, they can weaken the newborn's urge to breathe.  Therefore, if these drugs are needed during labor, they are given in the smallest effective doses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "b04a6010-0727-4804-82d1-cace92211fd1", "title": null, "text": "【0】Cystinuria is a rare hereditary kidney disorder that results in excretion of the amino acid cystine into the urine, often causing cystine stones to form in the urinary tract.  Cystinuria is caused by an inherited defect of the kidney tubules.  The defect causes people to excrete excessive amounts of the amino acid cystine into the urine (amino acids are the building blocks of proteins).  The excess cystine causes cystine kidney stones in the Urinary Tract Stones (calculi) are hard masses that form in the urinary tract and may cause pain, bleeding, or an infection or block of the flow of urine. \n【1】 There are two gene abnormalities that cause most cystinuria.  The genes are recessive Recessive disorders Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.  Recessive Disorders .  Because two genes are needed when a recessive gene is involved, the parents are carriers of the gene but do not have the syndrome.  However, siblings of children with the disorder might have it.  Sometimes, a person who has only one abnormal gene (a carrier), such as a parent of a person who has cystinuria, may excrete larger than normal amounts of cystine into the urine but seldom enough to form cystine stones.  Boys are generally affected more than girls.  Viewing the Urinary Tract Symptoms of Cystinuria Although symptoms of cystinuria may occur in infants, they usually start between the ages of 10 years and 30 years.  Often, the first symptom is intense pain caused by a spasm of the ureter where a stone becomes lodged.  The stone may also become a site where bacteria collect and cause a urinary tract infection Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【2】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【3】 Diagnosis of Cystinuria Analysis of kidney stones Urine tests A doctor tests for cystinuria when a person has recurring kidney stones.  Stones that have been collected are analyzed.  Cystine crystals may be seen during a microscopic examination of the urine ,urinalysis and Urine Culture Urinalysis, the testing of urine, may be necessary in the evaluation of kidney and urinary tract disorders and can also help evaluate bodywide disorders such as diabetes or liver problems. \n【4】 Treatment of Cystinuria Increasing fluid intake Medications to make the urine more alkaline Medications to dissolve cystine Decreasing salt and animal protein in the diet Treatment of cystinuria consists of preventing cystine stones from forming by keeping the concentration of cystine in the urine low.  To keep the cystine concentration low, a person must drink enough fluids to produce at least 6 to 8½ pints (3 to 4 liters) of urine each day.  During the night, however, when the person is not drinking, less urine is produced and stone formation is more likely.  This risk is reduced by drinking fluids before going to bed.  Another treatment approach involves taking potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate and sometimes acetazolamide to make the urine more alkaline (that is, less acidic) because cystine dissolves more easily in alkaline urine than in acidic urine.  Efforts to increase intake of water and make the urine more alkaline can lead to abdominal bloating, making the treatment difficult for some people to tolerate.  Consuming less salt and animal protein may help reduce the concentration of cystine in the urine.  If stones continue to form despite these measures, medications such as penicillamine, tiopronin, or captopril may be tried.  These drugs react with cystine to keep it dissolved.  Penicillamine is effective in keeping the concentration of cystine in the urine low but it can be toxic, so doctors give vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 Deficiency Vitamin B6 is in most foods, but people can have vitamin B6 deficiency if they do not absorb it properly.  Many foods contain vitamin B6, but extensive processing can remove the vitamin. \n【5】 Tiopronin can be used instead of penicillamine to treat some children because it has a lower frequency of side effects.  Captopril is slightly less effective than penicillamine but is less toxic.  Although the medications are usually effective, there is a fairly high risk that stones will continue to form.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "604c250e-5f75-46a6-8f85-3ef63250090c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Healthy people differ significantly in their overall personality, mood, and behavior.  Each person also varies from day to day, depending on the circumstances.  However, a sudden, major change in personality and/or behavior, particularly one that is not related to an obvious event (such as taking a drug or losing a loved one), often indicates a problem.   disorders involve disturbances in thinking, emotion, and/or behavior. \n【1】 Sudden changes in personality and behavior can be roughly categorized as involving one of the following types of symptoms: Confusion or delirium Delusions Disorganized speech or behavior Hallucinations Mood extremes (such as depression or mania) These categories are not disorders.  They are just one way doctors organize different types of abnormal thought, speech, and behavior.  These changes in personality and behavior can be caused by physical or mental health problems.  People may have more than one type of change.  For example, people with confusion due to a drug interaction sometimes have hallucinations, and people with mood extremes may have delusions.  Confusion and delirium Delirium is a sudden, fluctuating, and usually reversible disturbance of mental function. \n【2】 That is, people are less aware of their environment and, depending on the cause, may be excessively agitated and belligerent or drowsy and sluggish.  Some people alternate between being less alert and being overly alert.  Their thinking appears cloudy and slow or inappropriate.  They have trouble focusing on simple questions and are slow to respond.  Speech may be slurred.  Often, people do not know what day it is, and they may not be able to say where they are.  Some cannot give their name.  Delirium often results from a serious, newly developed physical problem or a reaction to a drug, especially in older people.  People who have delirium need immediate medical attention.  If the cause of delirium is identified and corrected quickly, delirium often resolves.  Delusions are fixed false beliefs that people hold despite evidence to the contrary.  Some delusions are based on a misinterpretation of actual perceptions and experiences.  For example, people may feel persecuted, thinking that a person behind them on the street is following them or that an ordinary accident is purposeful sabotage.  Other people think that song lyrics or newspaper articles contain messages that refer specifically to them (called a delusion of reference).  Some beliefs seem more plausible and can be difficult to identify as delusions because they could occur or have occurred in real life.  For example, people occasionally are followed by government investigators or have their work sabotaged by coworkers.  In such cases, a belief can be identified as a delusion by how strongly people hold the belief despite evidence to the contrary.  Other delusions are easier to identify.  For example, in religious or grandiose delusions, people may believe they are Jesus or the president of the country.  Some delusions are quite bizarre.  For example, people may think that their organs have all been replaced by machine parts or that their head contains a radio that receives messages from the government.  Disorganized speech refers to speech that does not contain the expected logical connections between thoughts or between questions and answers.  For example, people may jump from one topic to another without ever finishing a thought.  The topics may be slightly related or entirely unrelated.  In other cases, people respond to simple questions with long, rambling answers, full of irrelevant detail.  Answers may be illogical or completely incoherent.  This type of speech differs from the difficulty expressing or understanding language ,aphasia is partial or complete loss of the ability to express or understand spoken or written language.  It results from damage to the areas of the brain that control language. \n【3】 Occasionally misspeaking or intentionally being evasive, rude, or humorous is not considered disorganized speech.  Disorganized behavior refers to doing quite unusual things (such as undressing or masturbating in public or shouting and swearing for no apparent reason).  People with disorganized behavior typically have trouble doing normal daily activities (such as maintaining good personal hygiene or obtaining food).  Hallucinations Hallucination refers to hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, or feeling things that are not actually there.  That is, people perceive things, seemingly through their senses, that are not caused by an outside stimulus.  Any sense can be involved.  The most common hallucinations involve hearing things (auditory hallucinations), usually voices.  The voices often make derogatory comments about the person or command the person to do something.  Not all hallucinations are caused by a mental disorder.  Psychedelic drugs Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that cause profound distortions in people's perceptions. \n【4】 Some types of hallucinations are more likely to be caused by a neurologic disorder Introduction to Symptoms of Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerve Disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves are called neurologic disorders. \n【5】 For example, before a seizure occurs, people may smell something when there is no smell (an olfactory hallucination).  Mood extremes include outbursts of rage, periods of extreme elation ,mania In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania. \n【6】 Causes Although people sometimes assume that changes in personality, thinking, or behavior are all due to a mental disorder, there are many possible causes.  All causes ultimately involve the brain, but dividing them into four categories can be helpful: Mental disorders Drugs (including drug intoxication, withdrawal, and side effects) Disorders that affect mainly the brain Bodywide (systemic) disorders that also affect the brain Mental disorders include Anxiety disorders Overview of Anxiety Disorders Anxiety is a feeling of nervousness, worry, or unease that is a normal human experience. \n【7】 Obsessions are recurring, persistent, unwanted, anxiety-provoking, intrusive ideas, images, or urges. \n【8】 Specific disorders include acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. \n【9】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful. \n【10】 Ketamine is available in powder and liquid form. \n【11】 Because all drugs can harm as well as help, safety is relative. \n【12】 Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks. \n【13】 Disorders that mainly affect the brain These disorders can affect personality, mood, and behavior. \n【14】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【15】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver. \n【16】 Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes. \n【17】 It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health. \n【18】 Evaluation During the initial evaluation, doctors try to determine whether symptoms are due to a mental or physical disorder.  The following information can help people decide when a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs In people with changes in personality or behavior, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.  These warning signs include Symptoms that appear suddenly Attempts to harm themselves or others or threats to do so Confusion or delirium Fever Severe headache Symptoms that suggest malfunction of the brain, such as difficulty walking, balancing, or speaking or vision problems A recent head injury (within several weeks) When to see a doctor People who have warning signs should be seen by a health care practitioner as soon as possible.  Law enforcement may need to be called if people are violent.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【19】 What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a possible cause of the changes and the tests that may need to be done .  Questions include when symptoms began.  Many mental disorders begin in a person's teens or 20s.  If a mental disorder begins during middle age or later, especially if there is no obvious trigger (such as loss of a loved one), the cause is more likely to be a physical disorder.  A physical disorder is also more likely to be the cause when mental symptoms change significantly during middle age or later in people with a chronic mental disorder.  If changes began recently and suddenly in people of any age, doctors ask about conditions that can trigger such changes.  For example, they ask whether people have just started or stopped taking a prescription or recreational drug.  Doctors ask about other symptoms that may suggest a cause, such as Palpitations: Possibly an overactive thyroid gland or use or withdrawal of a drug Tremors: Parkinson disease or withdrawal of a drug Difficulty walking or speaking: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, stroke, or intoxication from an opioid or a sedative Headache: Brain infection, brain tumor, or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage) Numbness or tingling: A stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a vitamin deficiency People are also asked whether they have previously been diagnosed and treated for a mental or seizure disorder.  If they have been treated, doctors ask whether they have stopped taking their drugs or decreased the dose.  However, because people with mental disorders may also develop physical disorders, doctors do not automatically assume that any new abnormal behavior is caused by the mental disorder.  Doctors ask about physical disorders people have (such as diabetes) and about their lifestyle (such as their marital status, job situation, educational background, use of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, and living arrangements).  Doctors also ask whether family members have had any physical disorders that can cause mental symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis).  During the physical examination, doctors look for signs of physical disorders that can cause changes in mental status, particularly the following: Fever and/or a rapid heart rate (suggesting an infection, alcohol withdrawal, or use of amphetamines or cocaine in high doses) Confusion or delirium (suggesting drug intoxication or withdrawal) Abnormalities during the neurologic examination, such as difficulty forming words or understanding language (possibly suggesting a brain disorder) Confusion and delirium are more likely to result from a physical disorder.  People with mental disorders are rarely confused or delirious.  However, many physical disorders that cause changes in behavior do not cause confusion or delirium, but they often cause other symptoms that may appear to be a mental disorder.  Doctors bend the person's neck forward.  If doing so is difficult or painful, meningitis may be the cause.  Doctors check the legs and abdomen for swelling, which may result from kidney or liver failure.  If the skin or whites of the eyes look yellow, the cause may be liver failure.  Doctors may examine the interior of the eyes with a handheld device that looks like a small flashlight ,called an ophthalmoscope Ophthalmoscopy A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor. \n【20】 If doctors see swelling in part of the optic nerve ,papilledema is a condition in which increased pressure in or around the brain causes the part of the optic nerve inside the eye to swell. \n【21】  Testing Typically, tests include the following: Measurement of the oxygen level in the blood using a sensor clipped to the person's fingertip (called pulse oximetry) Blood tests to measure sugar (glucose) levels Blood tests to measure levels of alcohol and levels of any antiseizure drugs Antiseizure drugs In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction. \n【22】 For most other people, blood tests to check for HIV infection are usually done.  Other tests are done based mainly on the symptoms and examination results .  Tests may include Computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【23】 Whatever the cause, people who are a danger to themselves or others typically need to be hospitalized and treated whether they are willing or not.  Many states require that such decisions be made by someone appointed to make health care decisions for the mentally ill person ,called a surrogate decision maker Default Surrogate Decision Making If a person is unable to make decisions about personal health care, some other person or people must provide direction in decision making. \n【24】 If the person has not appointed a decision maker, doctors may contact the next of kin, or a court may appoint an emergency guardian.  People who are not dangerous to themselves or others can refuse evaluation and treatment, despite the difficulties their refusal may create for themselves and their family.  Key Points Not all changes in personality and behavior are due to mental disorders.  Other causes include drugs (including withdrawal and side effects), disorders that mainly affect the brain, and bodywide disorders that affect the brain.  Doctors are particularly concerned about people with symptoms that suggest brain malfunction, such confusion or delirium, fever, headache, people with a recent head injury and people who want to harm themselves or others.  Typically, doctors do blood tests to measure the levels of oxygen, sugar (glucose), and certain drugs (such as antiseizure drugs) the person is taking, and they may do other tests based on the symptoms and results of the examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Acute urate nephropathy This disorder is not a true form of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis but rather an intraluminal obstructive uropathy caused by uric acid crystal deposition within the lumen of renal tubules; acute oliguric or anuric kidney injury results.  The most common cause of acute urate nephropathy is Tumor lysis syndrome Tumor Lysis and Cytokine Release Syndromes Adverse effects are common in patients receiving any cancer therapy, particularly cytopenias, gastrointestinal effects, and tumor lysis and cytokine release syndromes. \n【2】 Disorders of urate overproduction and overexcretion are rare.  Typically, no symptoms are present.  Diagnosis is suspected when acute kidney injury occurs in patients with marked hyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL).  Urinalysis results may be normal or may show urate crystals.  Prognosis for complete recovery of renal function is excellent if treatment is initiated rapidly.  In patients with normal cardiac and renal function, treatment is usually with allopurinol plus aggressive IV hydration with normal saline.  Urate oxidase (rasburicase), which catalyzes urate to a much more soluble compound, is usually given in acute urate nephropathy.  Patients should be carefully monitored for adverse effects, including anaphylaxis and hemolysis. \n【3】 Alkalinization with a sodium bicarbonate infusion is no longer recommended because even though it increases solubility of urate, it risks tubular precipitation of calcium phosphate salts.  Prevention of acute urate nephropathy is indicated for patients at high risk (eg, those at risk of tumor lysis syndrome).  Prevention is by use of allopurinol 300 mg orally 2 to 3 times a day plus saline loading to maintain a urine output > 2. 5 L/day before chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  Urate oxidase is also indicated for the prevention of acute urate nephropathy secondary to tumor lysis syndrome in high-risk patients.  Chronic urate nephropathy This condition is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis Tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal function. \n【4】 Sequelae are chronic inflammation and fibrosis, with ensuing chronic renal insufficiency and renal failure.

They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【8】 Causes and prevention of hyperoxaluria Prevention are discussed elsewhere.  Hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. 4 mg/dL (> 2. 60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5. 2 mg/dL (> 1. 30 mmol/L). \n【9】 Severe (> 12 mg/dL) temporary hypercalcemia may cause reversible renal insufficiency by renal vasoconstriction and natriuresis-induced volume depletion.  Long-standing hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria lead to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with calcification and necrosis of tubular cells, interstitial fibrosis, and calcification (nephrocalcinosis).

{"seq_id": "9737b317-1e97-4723-9f3b-8683b3869fba", "title": null, "text": "【0】Spinal muscular atrophies include several types of hereditary disorders characterized by skeletal muscle wasting due to progressive degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and of motor nuclei in the brain stem.  Manifestations may begin in infancy or childhood.  They vary by the specific type and may include hypotonia; hyporeflexia; difficulty sucking, swallowing, and breathing; unmet developmental milestones; and, in more severe types, very early death.  Diagnosis is by genetic testing.  Treatment is supportive.  Spinal muscular atrophies usually result from autosomal recessive mutations that affect the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on the long arm of chromosome 5, most often causing a homozygous deletion of exon 7.  Spinal muscular atrophies may involve the central nervous system and thus are not purely peripheral nervous system disorders.  SMN2 is a modifier gene; it is 99% identical to the SMN1 gene and is located on 5q; if present in multiple copies, SMN2 may modify the severity of the disease and explain phenotypic differences between children with SMA.  Also, there are rare forms of SMA that are not due to 5q mutations.  There are five main types of spinal muscular atrophy.  In spinal muscular atrophy type 0, onset is prenatal; it manifests as decreased fetal movement in late pregnancy and severe weakness and hypotonia at birth.  Affected neonates have facial diplegia, areflexia, cardiac defects, and sometimes arthrogryposis.  Death due to respiratory failure occurs within the first 6 months.  Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (infantile spinal muscular atrophy, or Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) is also present in utero and becomes symptomatic by about age 6 months.  Affected infants have hypotonia (often notable at birth), hyporeflexia, tongue fasciculations, and pronounced difficulty sucking, swallowing, and eventually breathing.  Death, usually due to respiratory failure, occurs within the first year in 95% and by age 4 years in all.  In spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (intermediate form, or Dubowitz disease), symptoms usually manifest between 3 and 15 months of age; < 25% of affected children learn to sit, and none walk or crawl.  Children have flaccid muscle weakness and fasciculations, which may be hard to see in young children.  Deep tendon reflexes are absent.  Dysphagia may be present.  Most children are confined to a wheelchair by age 2 to 3 years.  The disorder is often fatal in early life, frequently resulting from respiratory complications.  However, progression can stop spontaneously, leaving children with permanent, nonprogressive weakness and a high risk of severe scoliosis and its complications.  Spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (juvenile form, or Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander disease) usually manifests between age 15 months and 19 years.  Findings are similar to those of type I, but progression is slower and life expectancy is longer; some patients have a normal life span.  Some familial cases are secondary to specific enzyme defects (eg, hexosaminidase deficiency).  Symmetric weakness and wasting progress from proximal to distal areas and are most evident in the legs, beginning in the quadriceps and hip flexors.  Later, arms are affected.  Life expectancy depends on whether respiratory complications develop.  Spinal muscular atrophy type 4 (late-onset) can be recessive, dominant, or X-linked, with adult onset (age 30 to 60 years) and slow progression of primarily proximal muscle weakness and wasting. \n【1】 Diagnosis of SMAs Electrodiagnostic testing Genetic testing A diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy should be suspected in patients with unexplained muscle wasting and flaccid weakness, particularly in infants and children.  Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies should be done; muscles innervated by cranial nerves should be included.  Conduction is normal, but affected muscles, which are often clinically unaffected, are denervated.  Definitive diagnosis is by genetic testing, which detects the causative mutation in about 95% of patients.  Muscle biopsy is done occasionally to exclude treatable causes and to determine whether the cause is fatal.  Serum enzymes (eg, creatine kinase, aldolase) may be slightly increased.  Amniocentesis, done if family history is positive, is often diagnostic.  Treatment of SMAs Supportive care Nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, or risdiplam There is no cure.  Treatment of spinal muscular atrophies is mainly supportive.  Physical therapy, braces, and special appliances can benefit patients with static or slowly progressive disease by preventing scoliosis and contractures.  Adaptive devices available through physical and occupational therapists may improve children’s independence and self-care by enabling them to feed themselves, write, or use a computer.  Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that modulates premessenger RNA splicing of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene; this drug may marginally improve motor function and delay disability and death.  Onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi can be used to treat children who are < 2 years old and who have bi-allelic mutations in SMN1.  This drug uses an adenovirus-derived vector to deliver a working SMN gene to motor neuron cells.  A one-time, single dose of the drug is given over 1 hour by IV infusion.  In a study involving 15 children, some achieved motor milestones, including sitting unassisted, feeding orally, rolling over, and walking independently .  Serious liver injury is a potential risk.  Risdiplam, a motor neuron 2 (SMN2)–splicing modifier, can be used to treat spinal muscular atrophy in patients ≥ 2 months old.  It is given as a liquid orally or through a feeding tube once a day .  Fever, diarrhea, and rash were the most common adverse effects. \n【2】 Key Points If infants and children have unexplained muscle wasting and flaccid weakness, evaluate them for spinal muscular atrophies.  EMG shows muscle denervation.  Use genetic testing to confirm the presence and type of spinal muscular atrophy.  Refer patients to physical and occupational therapists, who may help patients learn to function more independently.  Nusinersen, onasemnogene, or risdiplam may marginally improve motor function and delay disability and death.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Prevention is with verapamil, lithium, topiramate, divalproex, galcanezumab (a monoclonal antibody), or a combination. and interior of the head. \n【1】 Cluster headache affects primarily men, typically beginning at age 20 to 40; prevalence in the US is 0. 4%.  Usually, cluster headache is episodic; for 1 to 3 months, patients experience ≥ 1 attack/day, followed by remission for months to years.  Some patients have cluster headaches without remission.  Pathophysiology is unknown, but the periodicity suggests hypothalamic dysfunction.  Alcohol intake triggers cluster headache during the attack period but not during remission.  Symptoms and Signs of Cluster Headache Symptoms of cluster headache are distinctive.  Attacks, often multiple, frequently occur at the same time each day, often awakening patients from sleep.  When attacks occur, pain is always unilateral and occurs on the same side of the head in an orbitotemporal distribution.  It is excruciating, peaking within minutes; it usually subsides spontaneously within 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Patients are agitated, restlessly pacing the floor, unlike migraine patients who prefer to lie quietly in a darkened room.  The restlessness can be so severe that it leads to bizarre behavior (eg, banging the head on a wall).  Autonomic features, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, facial flushing, and Horner syndrome Horner Syndrome Horner syndrome is ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis due to dysfunction of cervical sympathetic output. \n【2】 Diagnosis of Cluster Headache Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of cluster headache is based on the distinctive symptom pattern and exclusion of intracranial abnormalities. \n【3】 Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania: Attacks are more frequent (> 5/day) and much briefer (usually just minutes) than in cluster headache.  Hemicrania continua: Moderately severe continuous unilateral head pain occurs with superimposed brief episodes of more intense pain.  Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua, unlike SUNCT and cluster headache , respond dramatically to indomethacin, but not to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Also, evidence suggests that acute attacks of episodic cluster headache can be treated with a handheld device that delivers noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation Vagus nerve stimulation A seizure is an abnormal, unregulated electrical discharge that occurs within the brain’s cortical gray matter and transiently interrupts normal brain function. \n【4】 All patients require preventive drugs because cluster headache is frequent, severe, and incapacitating.  Prednisone (eg, 60 mg orally once a day) or a greater occipital nerve block (with a local anesthetic and a corticosteroid) can provide prompt temporary prevention while preventive drugs with slower onset of action (eg, verapamil, lithium, topiramate, divalproex) are initiated.

The uterus is the organ where babies grow before they are born.  Fibroids aren't cancer, but they can be painful and cause bleeding and other symptoms.  Fibroids need treatment only if they are causing symptoms—most fibroids don’t need treatment Up to 7 in 10 women have one or more fibroids by age 45 Fibroids may be tiny or as big as a basketball Doctors check for fibroids with a physical exam and ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.  Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays). \n【1】 High levels of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone make fibroids grow.  Fibroids tend to get bigger when these hormone levels rise during pregnancy.  They tend to shrink when these hormone levels go down during menopause is when women stop having periods (stop menstruating) and can no longer get pregnant.  Menopause usually happens after age 40. \n【2】 What are the symptoms of fibroids? Many fibroids don’t cause any symptoms.  Your symptoms may depend on: The number of fibroids you have Where they are in your uterus The size (bigger fibroids are more likely to cause symptoms) Symptoms of fibroids can include: Heavier bleeding during your period or a longer period ,abnormal vaginal bleeding Vaginal Bleeding Vaginal bleeding is when you pass blood from your vagina (birth canal).  Sometimes yes and sometimes no.  Vaginal bleeding is normal during your monthly period. \n【3】 Anemia Overview of Anemia is not having enough red blood cells or hemoglobin.  Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all of your other organs. \n【4】 Most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. \n【5】 This makes them shrink and causes you pain.  How can doctors tell if I have fibroids? Doctors will do a pelvic exam and may suggest other tests.  During a pelvic exam, your doctor presses on your belly to feel the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries.  They also use tools to look inside your vagina and cervix (lower part of your uterus) to check for any problems.

{"seq_id": "d4310c74-4996-4203-badb-254673a2d2db", "title": null, "text": "【0】There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental.  Environmental exposure to many of these organisms is common, but most exposures do not cause infection and many infections do not cause disease.  Disease usually requires a defect in local or systemic host defenses.  People with chronic lung disease , frail older people, and immunocompromised people are at highest risk, but others with less obvious defects can have progressive disease.  New species and infections are reported regularly.  ,The mycobacterial infection tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【1】 Mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be human pathogens, and the incidence of infection appears to be increasing.  These organisms are commonly present in soil and water and are much less virulent for humans than M.  tuberculosis.  Infections caused by these organisms have been called atypical, environmental, and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections.  These organisms also cause a wider range of disease manifestations among people who have HIV infection or are otherwise immunocompromised, but those manifestations are not discussed here.  NTM infections are generally noncommunicable (ie, they are usually acquired from the environment rather than from infected people), so they are not reportable public health diseases and it is difficult to accurately determine the incidence of NTM infection.  Also, isolation of an NTM organism does not necessarily mean it is the cause of disease.  Nonetheless, the number of patients presenting with NTM infection that requires treatment appears to be increasing.  It is unclear how much of this apparent increase is due to greater awareness and improved diagnostic testing and how much is an actual increased incidence of infection.  Longer survival of patients with cystic fibrosis and patients with other predisposing lung diseases may be a factor.  Because NTM organisms are rather resistant to routine levels of chlorine in public water , greater exposure to aerosolized water sources through routine showering, water misters, decorative water displays could be playing a role.  Environmental climate change also may play a role because a warmer, wetter climate extends the areas that NTM can inhabit.  Worldwide, there is considerable geographic diversity in the prevalence of NTM in clinical specimens and environmental sources.  In the US, warmer, wet southern climates generally have more NTM isolates than do colder, drier northern climates.  Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)—the closely related species of M.  avium and M.  intracellulare—accounts for most NTM disease, but M.  abscessus is increasingly becoming common.  Other causative species are M.  kansasii, M.  xenopi, M.  marinum, M.  ulcerans, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonae (M.  chelonae are related to M.  abscessus).  Although person-to-person transmission of most NTM infections is generally not thought to occur, M.  abscessus may be transmitted among patients with cystic fibrosis.  The lungs Pulmonary disease There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental. \n【2】 xenopi, or M.  Occasional cases involve lymph nodes Lymphadenitis There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental. \n【3】 However, incidence of disseminated MAC disease Disseminated disease There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental. \n【4】 Diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections is typically made via acid-fast stain and culture of samples.  Although nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) exist for the most common NTM organisms, in the US speciation is increasingly done in state public health laboratories using molecular and other methods.  Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are best managed by a specialist with particular expertise in that area.  For updated diagnostic and therapeutic information on the diagnosis and management of these challenging infections, see the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and Infectious Diseases Society of America's 2020 practice guideline on the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease. \n【5】 Pulmonary disease The typical patient is a middle-aged or older woman with bronchiectasis, scoliosis, pectus excavatum, or mitral valve prolapse but without known underlying lung abnormalities.  Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) also causes pulmonary disease in middle-aged or older White men with previous lung problems such as chronic bronchitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) , emphysema Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) , healed TB, bronchiectasis is dilation and destruction of larger bronchi caused by chronic infection and inflammation. \n【6】 Whether MAC causes bronchiectasis or bronchiectasis leads to MAC is not always clear in any given patient; both phenomena occur.  In older, thin women with chronic nonproductive cough, this syndrome is often called Lady Windermere syndrome; it appears to be increasing in frequency for unknown reasons.  Another important population subject to NTM infection and disease is patients with cystic fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. \n【7】 With better management of CF, patients are living longer and therefore are more likely to develop complications such as NTM disease.  Cough and expectoration are common, often associated with fatigue, weight loss, and low-grade fever.  The course may be slowly progressive or stable for long periods.  Respiratory insufficiency and persistent hemoptysis may develop.  Fibronodular infiltrates on chest x-ray resemble those of pulmonary TB, but cavitation tends to be thin-walled, and pleural effusion is rare.  So-called tree-and-bud infiltrates, seen on chest CT, are also characteristic of MAC disease.  Sputum examination and culture are done to diagnosis MAC and to distinguish MAC infection from tuberculosis.  Determination of drug susceptibility may be helpful for certain organism/drug combinations but can be done only in highly specialized laboratories.  For MAC, susceptibility to clarithromycin is a predictor of therapeutic response.  For moderately symptomatic disease due to MAC with positive sputum smears and cultures, clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day or azithromycin 600 mg orally once/day, rifampin (RIF) 600 mg orally once/day, and ethambutol (EMB) 15 to 25 mg/kg orally once/day should be used for 12 to 18 months or until cultures are negative for 12 months.  For progressive cases unresponsive to standard drugs, combinations of 4 to 6 drugs that include clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day or azithromycin 600 mg orally once/day, rifabutin 300 mg orally once/day, ciprofloxacin 250 to 500 mg orally or IV 2 times a day, clofazimine 100 to 200 mg orally once/day, and amikacin 10 to 15 mg/kg IV once/day may be tried.  Resection surgery is recommended in exceptional cases involving well-localized disease in young, otherwise healthy patients.  M.  xenopi infections respond to isoniazid, rifabutin, and EMB, with or without streptomycin or clarithromycin, given for 18 to 24 months.  abscessus is a multidrug-resistant organism.  Its isolates have in vitro resistance to most oral antibiotics but generally are susceptible to a limited number of parenteral antibiotics, including tigecycline, imipenem, cefoxitin, and amikacin; treatment with at least 3 active drugs is recommended .  All nontuberculous mycobacteria are resistant to pyrazinamide.  Lymphadenitis In children 1 to 5 years of age, chronic submaxillary and submandibular cervical lymphadenitis is commonly due to MAC or Mycobacterium scrofulaceum.  It is presumably acquired by oral ingestion of soil organisms.  Diagnosis is usually by excisional biopsy.  Usually, excision is adequate treatment, and chemotherapy is not required.  Cutaneous disease Swimming pool granuloma is a protracted but self-limited superficial granulomatous ulcerating disease usually caused by Mycobacterium marinum contracted from swimming in contaminated pools or from cleaning a home aquarium.  kansasii are occasionally involved.  Lesions, reddish bumps, enlarging and turning purple, most frequently occur on the upper extremities or knees.  Healing may occur spontaneously, but minocycline or doxycycline 100 to 200 mg orally once/day, clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day, or RIF plus EMB for 3 to 6 months have been effective against M.  Buruli ulcer, caused by M.  ulcerans, occurs in rural areas of > 30 tropical and subtropical countries; most cases occur in West and Central Africa.  It starts as a painless subcutaneous nodule, a large painless area of induration, or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms, or face.  The infection progresses to cause extensive destruction of the skin and soft tissue; large ulcers may form on the legs or arms.  Healing may result in a severe contracture, scarring, and deformity.  For diagnosis, polymerase chain reaction should be used.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 8 weeks of once/day combination therapy with rifampin 10 mg/kg orally plus either streptomycin 15 mg/kg IM, clarithromycin 7. 5 mg/kg orally (preferred during pregnancy), or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally.  However, streptomycin is problematic because it is parenteral and toxic.  The WHO states that a recent study suggests the combination of rifampicin (10 mg/kg once/day) and clarithromycin (7. 5 mg/kg 2 times a day) is now the recommended treatment . \n【8】Wound and foreign body infections Nontuberculous mycobacteria form biofilms; they can survive in water systems in residential, office, and health care facilities.  They are difficult to eradicate with common decontamination practices (eg, using chlorine, organomercurials, or alkaline glutaraldehyde).  Rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, M.  abscessus complex) can cause nosocomial outbreaks of infections, usually due to injection of contaminated solutions, wound contamination with nonsterile water, use of contaminated instruments, or implantation of contaminated devices.  These infections may also develop after cosmetic procedures, acupuncture, or tattooing.  fortuitum complex has caused serious infections of penetrating wounds in the eyes and skin (especially feet), in tattoos, and in patients receiving contaminated materials (eg, porcine heart valves, breast implants, bone wax).  In the US, outbreaks of M.  abscessus infection occurred in Georgia (2015) and California (2016).  These outbreaks occurred in children when water contaminated with M.  abscessus biofilm was used to irrigate the tooth’s pulp chamber during a root canal; severe infection resulted.  Treatment usually requires extensive debridement and removal of the foreign material.  Useful drugs include Imipenem 1 g IV every 6 hours Levofloxacin 500 mg IV or orally once/day Clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 1 double-strength tablet orally 2 times a day Doxycycline 100 to 200 mg orally once/day Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 to 8 hours Amikacin 10 to 15 mg/kg IV once/day Combination therapy with at least 2 drugs that have in vitro activity is recommended.  Duration of therapy averages 24 months and may be longer if the infected foreign material remains in the body.  Amikacin is usually included for the first 3 to 6 months of therapy.  Infections caused by M.  abscessus and M.  chelonae are usually resistant to most antibiotics, have proved extremely difficult or impossible to cure, and should be referred to an experienced specialist.  Disseminated disease Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) causes disseminated disease commonly in patients with advanced AIDS and occasionally in those with other immunocompromised states, including organ transplantation and hairy cell leukemia.  In patients with AIDS, disseminated MAC usually develops late (unlike tuberculosis, which develops early), occurring simultaneously with other opportunistic infections.  Disseminated MAC disease causes fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain .  Diagnosis of disseminated MAC infection can be confirmed by cultures of blood or bone marrow or by biopsy (eg, percutaneous fine-needle biopsy of liver or necrotic lymph nodes).  Organisms may be identified in stool and respiratory specimens, but organisms from these specimens may represent colonization rather than true disease.  Combination therapy to clear bacteremia and alleviate symptoms usually requires 2 or 3 drugs; one combination is clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day or azithromycin 600 mg orally once/day, plus ethambutol (EMB) 15 to 25 mg/kg once/day.  Sometimes rifabutin 300 mg once/day is also given.  After successful treatment, chronic suppression with clarithromycin or azithromycin plus EMB is necessary to prevent relapse. \n【9】 Patients with HIV infection and a CD4 count < 100 cells/mcL (0. 01 × 109/L) require prophylaxis for disseminated MAC with azithromycin 1. 2 g orally once/week or clarithromycin 500 mg orally 2 times a day.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Symptoms are fever, a primary lesion, a macular rash, and lymphadenopathy.   and related diseases (anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Q fever, scrub typhus) are caused by a group of gram-negative, obligately intracellular coccobacilli. \n【1】 Scrub typhus is related to rickettsial diseases.  O.  tsutsugamushi is transmitted by trombiculid mite larvae (chiggers), which feed on forest and rural rodents, including rats, voles, and field mice.  Human infection also follows a chigger bite.  The mites are both the vector and the natural reservoir for O.  tsutsugamushi.  Scrub typhus is endemic in an area of Asia-Pacific bounded by Japan, Korea, China, India, and northern Australia.  Symptoms and Signs of Scrub Typhus After an incubation period of 6 to 21 days (mean 10 to 12 days), symptoms of scrub typhus start suddenly and include fever, chills, headache, and generalized lymphadenopathy.  At onset of fever, an eschar often develops at the site of the chigger bite.  The typical lesion of scrub typhus begins as a red, indurated lesion about 1 cm in diameter; it eventually vesiculates, ruptures, and becomes covered with a black scab.  The capacity of different strains of O.  tsutsugamushi to result in an eschar varies, and an eschar is easier to detect in light-skinned people.  Regional lymph nodes enlarge.  Fever rises during the 1st week, often to 40 to 40. 5° C.  Headache is severe and common, as is conjunctival injection.  A macular rash develops on the trunk during the 5th to 8th day of fever, often extending to the arms and legs.  It may disappear rapidly or become maculopapular and intensely colored.  Cough is present during the 1st week of fever, and pneumonitis may develop during the 2nd week.  In severe cases, pulse rate increases; blood pressure drops; and delirium, stupor, and muscular twitching develop.  Splenomegaly may be present, and interstitial myocarditis is more common than in other rickettsial diseases.  In untreated patients, high fever may persist ≥ 2 weeks, then falls gradually over several days.  With therapy, defervescence usually begins within 36 hours.  Recovery is prompt and uneventful.  Diagnosis of Scrub Typhus Clinical features Biopsy of rash with fluorescent antibody staining to detect organisms Acute and convalescent serologic testing (serologic testing not useful acutely) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Manifestations of scrub typhus are similar to those of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and epidemic typhus.  However, scrub typhus occurs in different geographic areas (Asia-Pacific area bounded by Japan, Korea, China, India, and northern Australia), and frequently, an eschar develops with satellite adenopathy. \n【2】 Treatment of Scrub Typhus Doxycycline Antibiotics are most effective if given soon after symptoms begin.  Primary treatment of scrub typhus is doxycycline 200 mg orally once followed by 100 mg twice a day in adults until the patient improves, has been afebrile for 48 hours, and has received treatment for at least 7 days.  Although some tetracyclines can cause tooth staining in children < 8 years of age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that a course of doxycycline 2. 2 mg/kg orally or IV twice a day is warranted ,1 Treatment references Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia tsutsugamushi). given for 5 days for mild illness and for 10 days for high-risk children.  Research indicates that short courses of doxycycline (5 to 10 days, as used for rickettsial disease) can be used in children without causing tooth staining or weakening of tooth enamel ,2 Treatment references Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia tsutsugamushi). \n【3】 Pregnant women may be given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 160 mg/800 mg twice a day throughout pregnancy, but not beyond 32 weeks gestation.  For pregnant women and patients with severe doxycycline allergy, azithromycin (500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for 2 to 4 more days or 1 g initially, followed by 500 mg once daily for 2 days) has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to doxycycline ,3 Treatment references Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia tsutsugamushi). \n【4】 Chloramphenicol 500 mg orally or IV 4 times a day for 7 days is an alternative treatment.  Oral chloramphenicol is not available in the US and its use can cause adverse hematologic effects, which requires monitoring of blood indices. \n【5】 Prevention of Scrub Typhus Eliminating or decreasing mite populations by clearing brush and spraying infested areas with residual insecticides helps to prevent scrub typhus.

It occurs in 20% to 70% of patients, 1 month to 1 year after spinal cord injury.  Cord injury is usually above the T6 level, with dysreflexia unlikely to occur after an injury below the T10 level.  Life-threatening hypertension is provoked by a noxious stimulus below the level of spinal cord injury; in about 85% of patients, the stimulus is a urologic disorder, such as bladder distention or urinary tract infection.  In up to 85% of cases, the cause is bladder distension, often due to a blocked bladder catheter.  Bowel distension and fecal impaction are the second most common precipitants; they account for 13 to 19% of cases.  Pathophysiology of Spinal Cord Autonomic Dysreflexia Visceral or cutaneous stimulation below the level of spinal cord injury provokes reflex sympathetic activity, resulting in diffuse vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure (BP).  Normally, the increase in BP would stimulate parasympathetic compensation with vasodilation and correction of BP.  However, if the spinal cord is injured, the parasympathetic response cannot travel below the spinal cord lesion, and continued vasoconstriction then leads to continued injurious hypertension.  With a lesion below T10, the splanchnic vascular bed innervation remains intact, allowing compensatory parasympathetic dilation in this region.  Provocative stimuli include distention of a hollow viscus (eg, bowel or bladder), pressure ulcers, urinary tract infection, fractures, medical or surgical procedures, and even sexual intercourse.  Symptoms and Signs of Spinal Cord Autonomic Dysreflexia Symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia are variable, intermittent.  and usually sudden in onset.  They include headache, nausea and vomiting, problems with vision, nasal congestion, and feelings of anxiety and doom.  Profuse sweating, flushing, and piloerection occur above the level of spinal cord injury; vasoconstriction with dry, pale skin occurs below the level of injury.  Hypertension may result in hypertensive crisis, with pulmonary edema, intracranial hemorrhage, seizures, retinal detachment, myocardial infarction, and death.  Diagnosis of Spinal Cord Autonomic Dysreflexia Clinical evaluation Autonomic dysreflexia should be suspected in a patient with a spinal cord injury above the level of T6, severe hypertension, and increased sympathetic activity, especially if provoked by distention of a hollow viscus.  Clinicians should suspect autonomic dysreflexia if patients have a T6 or higher spinal cord lesion and report headache.  In such patients, BP should be measured immediately and corrected as needed.  Any stimulus that causes pain or discomfort (eg, pressure sores, ingrown toenails) in a patient without spinal cord injury may result in autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injury.  A thorough medical evaluation may be required.  Treatment of Spinal Cord Autonomic Dysreflexia Management of provocative stimulus Control of blood pressure Treatment of autonomic dysreflexia requires close monitoring of vital signs.  Provocative stimuli should be corrected and/or removed. \n【1】 Pregnant women may require expert obstetric care.  Prevention of Spinal Cord Autonomic Dysreflexia Chemodenervation of the bladder using onabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to help prevent autonomic dysreflexia when used appropriately (ie, when all other measures to prevent it have been ineffective).  Intravesical lidocaine before changing a bladder catheter may reduce the frequency of episodes of bladder distention.  Key Points Autonomic dysreflexia occurs after a spinal cord injury and can result in life-threatening hypertension.

Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.  Treatment is with psychotherapy and possibly antidepressants.   In patients with dependent personality disorder, the need to be taken care of results in loss of their autonomy and interests.  Because they are intensely anxious about taking care of themselves, they become excessively dependent and submissive.  Fewer than 1% of the general US population are estimated to have dependent personality disorder.  It is diagnosed more often in women, but in some studies, prevalence in men and women was similar.  Comorbidities are common.  Patients often also have a depressive disorder ,major depressive disorder Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. an anxiety disorder Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety. \n【1】 Large amounts consumed rapidly can cause respiratory depression, coma, and death. \n【2】 Etiology of DPD Information about the causes of dependent personality disorder is limited.  Cultural factors, negative early experiences, and biologic vulnerabilities associated with anxiety are thought to contribute to the development of dependent personality disorder.  Familial traits such as submissiveness, insecurity, and self-effacing behavior may also contribute.  Symptoms and Signs of DPD Patients with dependent personality disorder do not think they can take care of themselves.  They use submissiveness to try to get other people to take care of them.  Patients with this disorder typically require much reassurance and advice when making ordinary decisions.  They often let others, often one person, take responsibility for many aspects of their life.  For example, they may depend on their spouse to tell them what to wear, what kind of job to look for, and with whom to associate.  These patients consider themselves inferior and tend to belittle their abilities; they take any criticism or disapproval as proof of their incompetence, further undermining their confidence.  It is difficult for them to express disagreement with others because they fear losing support or approval.  They may agree to something they know is wrong rather than risk losing the help of others.  Even when anger is appropriate, they do not get angry at friends and coworkers for fear of losing their support.  Because these patients are sure that they cannot do anything on their own, they have difficulty starting a new task and working independently, and they avoid tasks that require taking responsibility.  They present themselves as incompetent and needing constant help and reassurance.  When reassured that a competent person is supervising and approving of them, these patients tend to function adequately.  However, they do not want to appear too competent lest they be abandoned.  As a result, their career may be harmed.  They perpetuate their dependency because they tend not to learn skills of independent living.  These patients go to great lengths to obtain care and support (eg, doing unpleasant tasks, submitting to unreasonable demands, tolerating physical, sexual, or emotional abuse).  Being alone makes them feel extremely uncomfortable or afraid because they fear they cannot take care of themselves.  Patients with dependent personality disorder tend to interact socially with only the few people they depend on.  When a close relationship ends, patients with this disorder immediately try to find a replacement.  Because of their desperate need to be taken care of, they are not discriminating in choosing a replacement.  These patients fear abandonment by those they depend on, even when there is no reason to.  Diagnosis of DPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of dependent personality disorder, patients must have A persistent, excessive need to be taken of, resulting in submissiveness and clinging This persistent need is shown by the presence of ≥ 5 of the following: Difficulty making daily decisions without an inordinate amount of advice and reassurance from other people A need to have others be responsible for most important aspects of their life Difficulty expressing disagreement with others because they fear loss of support or approval Difficulty starting projects on their own because they are not confident in their judgment and/or abilities (not because they lack motivation or energy) Willingness to go to great lengths (eg, do unpleasant tasks) to obtain support from others Feelings of discomfort or helplessness when they are alone because they fear they cannot take care of themselves An urgent need to establish a new relationship with someone who will provide care and support when a close relationship ends Unrealistic preoccupation with fears of being left to take care of themselves Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.  Differential diagnosis Several other personality disorders are characterized by hypersensitivity to rejection. \n【3】 Patients with borderline personality disorder, unlike those with dependent personality disorder, vacillate between submissiveness and rageful hostility.  Avoidant personality disorder Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation. \n【4】 Patients with avoidant personality disorder withdraw until they are sure they will be accepted without criticism; in contrast, those with dependent personality disorder seek out and try to maintain relationships with others. \n【5】 They are more flamboyant and actively seek attention; those with dependent personality disorder are self-effacing and shy.

Hemolytic means that red blood cells break down, and uremic means that kidney injury causes urea (a waste product) to accumulate in the blood. \n【2】 The small blood clots that form in HUS block small blood vessels throughout the body, particularly those in the brain, heart, and kidneys.  The blood vessel blockage damages organs and can break apart red blood cells that pass through partially blocked vessels.  The blood clots also mean that an abnormally high number of platelets are being used up, which leads to a sharp decrease in the number of platelets in the bloodstream (thrombocytopenia).  Platelets are cells that are made in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream and help blood clot How Blood Clots Hemostasis is the body's way of stopping injured blood vessels from bleeding.  Hemostasis includes clotting of the blood. \n【3】 Platelets are sometimes called thrombocytes.

Although there are no blood tests that specifically diagnose HUS, doctors do a number of blood tests that, together with people's symptoms, help make the diagnosis.

{"seq_id": "f62b5209-463a-4fd4-ad1f-1bcfe69a8e06", "title": null, "text": "【0】Ventilatory failure is a rise in PaCO2 (hypercapnia) that occurs when the respiratory load can no longer be supported by the strength or activity of the system.  The most common causes are severe acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), overdoses of drugs that suppress ventilatory drive, and conditions that cause respiratory muscle weakness (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, botulism).  Findings include dyspnea, tachypnea, and confusion.  Death can result.  Diagnosis is by arterial blood gas measurement and patient observation; chest x-ray and clinical evaluation may help delineate cause.  Treatment varies by condition but often includes mechanical ventilation.   The 2 most common causes of ventilatory failure are Severe acute exacerbation of asthma (ie, status asthmaticus) Exacerbation of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Respiratory failure due to COPD is termed acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF).  Pathophysiology of Ventilatory Failure Hypercapnia occurs when alveolar ventilation either falls or fails to rise adequately in response to increased carbon dioxide production.  A fall in alveolar ventilation results from a decrease in minute ventilation or an increase in dead space ventilation without appropriate compensation by increasing minute ventilation.  Ventilatory failure can occur when there is excessive load on the respiratory system (eg, resistive loads or lung and chest wall elastic loads) versus neuromuscular competence for an effective inspiratory effort.  When the minute ventilation load increases (eg, as occurs in sepsis), a compromised respiratory system may not be able to meet this increased demand  and neuromuscular competence (drive, transmission, and muscle strength) determines the ability to sustain alveolar ventilation .  Physiologic dead space is the part of the respiratory tree that does not participate in gas exchange.  It includes Anatomic dead space (oropharynx, trachea, and airways) Alveolar dead space (ie, alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused) Physiologic dead space can also result from shunt or low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) if patients cannot increase their minute ventilation appropriately.  The physiologic dead space normally is about 30 to 40% of tidal volume but increases to 50% in intubated patients and to >70% in massive pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis. \n【1】 Thus, for any given minute ventilation, the greater the dead space, the poorer the carbon dioxide elimination.  Increased carbon dioxide production, as occurs with fever, sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【2】 Ventilatory failure associated with these problems results only when the ability to compensate is compromised. \n【3】 Severe acidemia (pH < 7. 2) contributes to pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction, systemic vascular dilation, reduced myocardial contractility, hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5. 5 mEq/L (> 5. 5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells. \n【4】 Acute hypercapnia also causes cerebral vasodilation and increased intracranial pressure, a major problem in patients with acute head injury.  Over time, tissue buffering and renal compensation can largely correct the acidemia.  However, sudden increases in PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) can occur faster than compensatory changes (PaCO2 rises 3 to 6 mm Hg/minute in a totally apneic patient).  The balance between load (resistive, elastic, and minute ventilation) and neuromuscular competence (drive, transmission, and muscle strength) determines the ability to sustain alveolar ventilation PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.  Symptoms and Signs of Ventilatory Failure The predominant symptom of ventilatory failure is dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing.  It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause. \n【5】 When ventilatory failure is due to increased load, signs include vigorous use of accessory ventilatory muscles, tachypnea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, anxiety, declining tidal volume, irregular or gasping breathing patterns, and paradoxical abdominal motion.  When it is due to impaired respiratory drive, signs include hypopnea and/or low respiratory rates will be evident.  Ventilatory failure results in hypercapnia, causing central nervous system manifestations ranging from subtle personality changes to marked confusion, obtundation, or coma.  Chronic hypercapnia is better tolerated than acute and has fewer symptoms.  Diagnosis of Ventilatory Failure Arterial blood gas (ABGs) measurement Chest x-ray Tests to determine etiology Ventilatory failure should be suspected in patients with respiratory distress, visible ventilatory fatigue or cyanosis, or changes in sensorium and in those with disorders causing neuromuscular weakness.  Tachypnea is also a concern; respiratory rates > 28 to 30/minute cannot be sustained for very long, particularly in older or weakened patients.  If ventilatory failure is suspected, ABG analysis, continuous pulse oximetry, and a chest x-ray should be done.  Respiratory acidosis revealed by the ABG measurement (eg, pH < 7. 35 and PCO2 > 50) confirms the diagnosis.  Patients with chronic ventilatory failure often have quite elevated PCO2 (eg, 60 to 90 mm Hg) at baseline, typically with a pH that is only slightly acidemic.  In such patients, the degree of acidemia rather than the PCO2 must serve as the primary marker for acute hypoventilation. \n【6】 Vital capacity < 10 to 15 mL/kg and an inability to generate a negative inspiratory force of 15 cm H2O suggest imminent ventilatory failure.  Once ventilatory failure is diagnosed, the cause must be identified.  Sometimes a known ongoing disorder ,eg, coma Overview of Coma and Impaired Consciousness Coma is unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused and in which the patient's eyes remain closed. \n【7】 Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.  Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. \n【8】 In other cases, history is suggestive; sudden onset of tachypnea and hypotension after surgery suggests pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvis. \n【9】 Neuromuscular competence may be assessed through measurement of inspiratory muscle strength (negative inspiratory force and positive expiratory force), neuromuscular transmission (nerve conduction tests and electromyography), and investigations into causes of diminished drive (toxicology screens, brain imaging, and thyroid function tests).  Treatment of Ventilatory Failure Treatment of cause Often positive pressure ventilation Treatment of ventilatory failure aims to correct the imbalance between the strength of the respiratory system and its load and varies with etiology.  Obvious precipitants (eg, bronchospasm, mucus plugging, foreign bodies) should be corrected if possible.  Status asthmaticus Patients with status asthmaticus should be treated in an intensive care unit by personnel skilled in airway management. \n【10】 The mask introduction must be done carefully to enhance comfort by perhaps starting with titration of expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) alone because one of the major functions of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is to increase tidal volume, and, in these patients, end-expiratory lung volume approaches total lung capacity .  After an explanation of its benefit, patients hold the mask against their face while modest amounts of pressure are applied (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] 3 to 5 cm H2O).  Once tolerated, the mask is strapped in place while pressures are increased to patient comfort and reduced work of breathing as assessed by respiratory rate and accessory muscle use.  Patients should be selected carefully, and settings should be adjusted on an individual basis. \n【11】 ABG values that reveal worsening hypercapnia are also an indication, although blood gas confirmation is not required and should not replace the physician’s judgment.  Oral intubation is preferred over nasal because a larger endotracheal tube, which decreases airway resistance and permits easier suctioning, can be used.  Hypotension and pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing partial or complete lung collapse.  Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or result from trauma or medical procedures. \n【12】 These complications and their corresponding mortality have declined significantly because of a ventilator strategy that emphasizes limiting dynamic hyperinflation over achieving eucapnia.  In status asthmaticus, ventilation sufficient to achieve a normal pH typically causes severe hyperinflation.  To avoid hyperinflation, initial ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 5 to 7 mL/kg and a respiratory rate of 10 to 18/minute.  Inspiratory flows may need to be quite high (eg, 70 to 120 L/minute) with a square wave pattern to facilitate maximum time in exhalation.  Dangerous dynamic hyperinflation is unlikely so long as the measured plateau pressure is < 30 to 35 cm H2O and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (intrinsic PEEP Respiratory Mechanics ) is < 15 cm H2O (although these pressures may be difficult to measure because of inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle activity).  Plateau pressure > 35 cm H2O is managed by reducing the tidal volume (assuming that clinical evaluation does not indicate that the high pressures are the result of decreased compliance of the chest wall or abdomen) or the respiratory rate.  Although it is possible to reduce peak airway pressure by reducing peak flow rate or by changing the flow waveform to a descending profile (ie, so that the flow rate is high at the beginning of the breath and decreased over time), such changes should not be made.  Although high flow rates require a high pressure to overcome the high airway resistance of status asthmaticus, this pressure is dissipated across robust, cartilage-containing airways.  Lower flow rates (eg, < 60 L/minute) reduce time available for exhalation, thereby increasing the end-expiratory volume (and the resultant intrinsic PEEP) and allowing a greater inspiratory volume during the next breath.  Occasionally, patients with high intrinsic PEEP may need to have PEEP increased on the ventilator to facilitate triggering and reduce inspiratory work of breathing.  Using low tidal volumes often results in hypercapnia, which is permitted for the greater good of reducing dynamic hyperinflation.  An arterial pH > 7. 15 is generally well tolerated physiologically but often requires large doses of sedatives and opioids.  Neuromuscular blockers should be avoided after the peri-intubation period because use of these agents in combination with corticosteroids can cause a severe and occasionally irreversible myopathy, particularly after 24 hours of combined use.  Patient agitation should be managed with sedation rather than paralysis, but ideally ventilation can be adjusted to patients’ needs so as to reduce the need for sedation.  Most patients with status asthmaticus improve to the point of liberation from mechanical ventilation within 2 to 5 days, although a minority experience protracted severe airflow obstruction. \n【13】 Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure In patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF) caused by COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke. \n【14】 This increased respiratory load occurs in the setting of barely adequate neuromuscular competence, so patients easily become too tired to maintain ventilation. \n【15】 To restore the balance between neuromuscular competence and load, clinicians reduce airflow obstruction and dynamic hyperinflation with bronchodilators and corticosteroids and treat infection with antibiotics.  Low serum levels of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium may exacerbate muscle weakness, frustrating recovery, and must be identified and treated. \n【16】 Perhaps 75% of patients managed with NIPPV do not require endotracheal intubation.  Advantages include the ease of application and removal; once initial stabilization has occurred, NIPPV may be stopped temporarily to allow oral intake in selected patients.  Trials of unassisted breathing are easily done, and NIPPV can be reapplied as indicated.  Settings should be adjusted to the work of breathing as assessed by patient report, respiratory rate and tidal volume, and accessory muscle use.  In many patients, EPAP alone may be sufficient, which is beneficial because one of the major functions of inspiratory positive airway pressure is to increase tidal volume, and, in these patients, end-expiratory lung volume approaches total lung capacity .  Deterioration (and need for endotracheal intubation) is best assessed clinically; ABG measurements may be misleading.  Although worsening hypercapnia typically indicates treatment failure, patients differ markedly in tolerance of hypercapnia.  Some patients with PaCO2> 100 mm Hg are alert and conversant on NIPPV, whereas others require intubation at much lower levels.  Conventional mechanical ventilation in ACRF aims to minimize dynamic hyperinflation and counter the adverse effects of intrinsic PEEP Respiratory Mechanics while resting the fatigued respiratory muscles.  Initial recommended settings are assist-control (A/C) with a tidal volume of 5 to 7 mL/kg and a respiratory rate of 20 to 24/minute, although some patients need lower initial rates to limit intrinsic PEEP.  This intrinsic PEEP represents an inspiratory threshold load that must be overcome by the patient to trigger the ventilator, further increasing the work of breathing and preventing full rest on the ventilator.  To counterbalance the effect of intrinsic PEEP, external PEEP should be applied to a level ≤ 85% of intrinsic PEEP (typical setting 5 to 10 cm H2O).  This application decreases the inspiratory work of breathing without increasing dynamic hyperinflation.  High inspiratory flow rates should be used to maximize the time for expiration.  These settings minimize the risk of alkalemia that follows overly vigorous initial ventilation.  Hypotension may also occur immediately after intubation .  Most patients require full ventilatory support for 24 to 48 hours before spontaneous breathing trials are considered.  It has not been determined whether this duration of treatment is needed to rest the respiratory muscles or to allow hyperinflation to diminish, thereby increasing respiratory muscle strength.  The patient often sleeps heavily during this time and, in contrast to patients with asthma, typically requires little sedation.  Adequate rest is often not achieved unless sufficient attention is paid to ongoing patient effort.  This effort may manifest as accessory muscle use, inappropriately low airway pressures at the onset or throughout inspiration, or frequent failures to trigger the ventilator, indicating high intrinsic PEEP, weakness, or both.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The worries must also be associated with ≥ 3 of the following: Restlessness or a keyed-up or on-edge feeling Easily fatigability Difficulty concentrating Irritability Muscle tension Disturbed sleep Also, the anxiety and worry cannot be accounted for by substance use or another medical disorder . \n【5】 Benzodiazepines (anxiolytics) in small to moderate doses may also be effective, although sustained use may lead to physical dependence.  One strategy involves starting with concomitant use of a benzodiazepine and an antidepressant.  Once the antidepressant becomes effective, the benzodiazepine is tapered.  Buspirone is also effective; the starting dose is 5 mg orally two or three times a day.  However, buspirone may require moderately high doses (ie, > 30 mg/day) and at least 2 weeks before it begins to help.  Psychotherapy, usually cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be both supportive and problem-focused.  Relaxation and biofeedback may be of some help, although few studies have documented their efficacy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "49da34f5-a236-48ed-b1c3-db179b75a8fa", "title": null, "text": "【0】Hyperparathyroidism occurs when one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive, causing elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone and leading to hypercalcemia.  Patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of varying severity, including chronic fatigue, body aches, difficulty sleeping, bone pain, memory loss, poor concentration, depression, and headaches.  Diagnosis is with serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone.  Surgery is done to remove the overactive gland(s).   or ionized serum calcium > 5. 2 mg/dL (> 1. 30 mmol/L). \n【1】 Etiology of Hyperparathyroidism The most common cause of hyperparathyroidism is Parathyroid adenoma Parathyroid adenomas are most often isolated solitary adenomas.  However, parathyroid adenoma Parathyroid adenoma Most parathyroid tumors are benign.  Parathyroid tumors secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH).  Elevated parathyroid hormone levels ( hyperparathyroidism) causes hypercalcemia. \n【2】 Another cause is hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands.  Pathophysiology of Hyperparathyroidism Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases serum calcium by Enhancing distal tubular calcium reabsorption Rapidly mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone (bone resorption) Increasing intestinal absorption of calcium by stimulating conversion of vitamin D to its most active form, calcitriol Hyperparathyroidism is characterized as Primary: Excessive secretion of PTH due to a disorder of the parathyroid glands Secondary: Hypocalcemia due to non-parathyroid disorders leads to chronic PTH hypersecretion Tertiary: Autonomous secretion of PTH unrelated to serum calcium concentration in patients with long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder resulting from excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone by one or more parathyroid glands.  It probably is the most common cause of hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. 4 mg/dL (> 2. 60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5. \n【3】 Incidence increases with age and is higher in postmenopausal women.  It also occurs in high frequency ≥ 3 decades after neck irradiation.  Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. \n【4】 Causes include alcohol use disorder, burns, starvation, and diuretic use. \n【5】 Patients most frequently present with asymptomatic hypercalcemia.  Nephrolithiasis Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.  They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【6】 Histologic examination of parathyroid tissue removed from patients thought to have primary hyperparathyroidism preoperatively shows a parathyroid adenoma in about 85% of patients, hyperplasia of ≥ 2 glands in about 15% of cases and parathyroid cancer Parathyroid cancer Most parathyroid tumors are benign. \n【7】 Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs most commonly in advanced chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.  Hyperphosphatemia that develops in response to chronic kidney disease also contributes.  Other less common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include Decreased calcium intake Poor calcium absorption in the intestine due to vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D Deficiency and Dependency Inadequate exposure to sunlight predisposes to vitamin D deficiency. \n【8】 The sensitivity of the parathyroid glands to calcium may be diminished because of pronounced glandular hyperplasia and elevation of the calcium set point (ie, the amount of calcium necessary to reduce secretion of PTH).  Tertiary hyperparathyroidism results when PTH secretion becomes autonomous of serum calcium concentration.  Tertiary hyperparathyroidism generally occurs in patients with long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, as in patients with end-stage renal disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【9】 Symptoms and Signs of Hyperparathyroidism is often asymptomatic.  In asymptomatic patients, the disorder is typically identified by an incidental elevated calcium level.  Symptoms, when they occur, are due to hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. \n【10】 Complications Hypercalcemia frequently causes hypercalciuria with resultant nephrolithiasis Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. \n【11】 Chronic hypercalcemia may also cause proximal weakness and muscle atrophy.  Excess parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoclastic activity, which over time can cause osteitis fibrosa cystica.  In osteitis fibrosa cystica, increased osteoclastic activity causes rarefaction of bone with fibrous degeneration and cyst and fibrous nodule formation.  Diagnosis of Hyperparathyroidism Serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH measurement The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism should be made based on blood and urine tests and clinical findings.  A diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is usually first suspected when elevated serum calcium is found on routine blood tests.  If calcium remains high on repeat testing, intact PTH should be checked and interpreted with the calcium level.  Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a high PTH concentration in the absence of hypocalcemia.  A minority of patients have a high-normal PTH concentration, which should be interpreted as inappropriate when the calcium concentration is elevated .  In hyperparathyroidism, the serum calcium is rarely > 12 mg/dL (> 3 mmol/L), but the ionized serum calcium is almost always elevated.  Low serum phosphate concentration suggests hyperparathyroidism, especially when coupled with elevated renal excretion of phosphate.  When hyperparathyroidism results in increased bone turnover, serum alkaline phosphatase is frequently increased.  Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high in hyperparathyroidism.  Low urinary calcium suggests another diagnosis such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. \n【12】 Chronic kidney disease suggests the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but primary hyperparathyroidism can also be present.  In patients with chronic kidney disease, high serum calcium and normal serum phosphate suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, whereas elevated phosphate suggests secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Imaging studies of the parathyroid(s) may be done preoperatively to localize an abnormal gland; it is not done to establish the diagnosis or determine whether surgery is needed.  However, parathyroidectomy done by experienced surgeons has a high cure rate, and this has not been improved with use of preoperative imaging.  Many imaging techniques have been used effectively, including the following: High-resolution CT with or without CT-guided biopsy and PTH immunoassay from thyroid venous drainage Contrast-enhanced four-dimensional (4D) CT MRI High-resolution ultrasonography Digital subtraction angiography Thallium-201–technetium-99 scanning Technetium-99 sestamibi, a radionuclide agent for parathyroid imaging, is more sensitive and specific than older agents and may be useful for identifying solitary adenomas.  For residual or recurrent hyperparathyroidism after initial parathyroid surgery, imaging is necessary and may reveal abnormally functioning parathyroid glands in unusual locations throughout the neck and mediastinum.  Technetium-99 sestamibi is probably the most sensitive imaging test for these glands.  Use of several imaging studies (MRI, CT, or high-resolution ultrasonography in addition to technetium-99 sestamibi) before repeat parathyroidectomy is sometimes necessary. \n【13】 Treatment of Hyperparathyroidism Sometimes medical management of hypercalcemia Often surgical parathyroidectomy Treatment for hyperparathyroidism depends on severity.  Medical management Conservative management with methods to ensure that serum calcium concentrations remain low may be used for patients with who are either asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism with no indications for surgery.  It may also be used for patients at high risk for surgery due to unrelated medical problems, but this is usually limited to patients with a shorter life expectancy because maintaining low serum calcium levels long-term may result in bone disease.  Patients should do the following: Remain active (ie, avoid immobilization that could exacerbate hypercalcemia) Follow a low-calcium diet Drink plenty of fluids to minimize the chance of nephrolithiasis Avoid drugs that can raise serum calcium (eg, thiazide diuretics) Serum calcium and renal function are monitored every 6 months.  Bone density is monitored every 12 months.  However, recurrent hypercalcemia, subclinical bone disease, and hypertension are concerns.  Patients with hypercalcemia alone can be managed with cinacalcet.  Osteoporosis is treated with bisphosphonates.  Surgery In patients with symptomatic or progressive hyperparathyroidism, surgery is indicated.  The indications for surgery in patients with asymptomatic, primary hyperparathyroidism are controversial.  Surgical parathyroidectomy increases bone density and may have modest effects on symptoms that impact quality of life, but most patients do not have progressive deterioration in biochemical abnormalities or bone density.  Many experts recommend surgery in the following circumstances : Serum calcium 1 mg/dL (0. 25 mmol/L) greater than the upper limits of normal Hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day [> 6. 25 mmol/day] in women or > 300 mg/day [>7. 5 mmol/day] in men) or the presence of nephrolithiasis Creatinine clearance < 60 mL/minute (< 1 mL/second) Vertebral bone fracture or bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or radius that is 2. 5 standard deviations below controls (T score = −2. 5) Age < 50 years The possibility of poor adherence with follow-up Surgery consists of removal of adenomatous gland(s).  Parathyroid hormone concentration can be measured before and after removal of the presumed abnormal gland using rapid assays.  A fall of ≥ 50% 10 minutes after removal of the adenoma indicates successful treatment.  In patients with disease of > 1 gland, several glands are removed, and often a small portion of a normal-appearing parathyroid gland is reimplanted in a more accessible location in the body such as the belly of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or subcutaneously in the forearm to prevent hypoparathyroidism.  Rarely, this residual gland is the source of recurrent secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can be managed with additional surgical removal.  Parathyroid tissue is also occasionally preserved using cryopreservation to allow for later autologous transplantation in case persistent hypoparathyroidism develops.  Serum calcium must be monitored several times a day in the immediate postoperative period.  When surgery is done for mild hyperparathyroidism, the serum calcium concentration drops to just below normal within 24 to 48 hours.  In patients with more severe or prolonged hyperparathyroidism, particularly secondary hyperparathyroidism with severe osteitis fibrosa cystica, prolonged, symptomatic hypocalcemia may occur postoperatively.  When symptomatic hypocalcemia is expected, loading with 10 to 20 g elemental calcium in the days before surgery may prevent a precipitous postoperative decline in calcium.  Even with preoperative calcium administration, large doses of calcium and vitamin D may be required in the postoperative period while bone calcium is repleted.  Pearls & Pitfalls Serum calcium must be monitored several times a day in the immediate postoperative period following parathyroidectomy In patients with severe hypercalcemia with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, medical treatment is indicated.  Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to extracellular calcium, may lower parathyroid hormone and calcium levels.  Hyperparathyroidism in renal failure Although primary hyperparathyroidism can occur, hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure is usually secondary.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure can result in a number of symptoms, including Osteitis fibrosa cystica with arthritis, bone pain, and pathologic fractures Spontaneous tendon rupture Proximal muscle weakness Extraskeletal calcifications, including soft tissue and vascular calcification Pruritis Secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute), but it is usually more advanced in patients who require long-term dialysis.  The interplay between phosphate retention, hypocalcemia, decreased active vitamin D concentration, and increased fibroblast growth factor-23 stimulates parathyroid secretion in patients with renal failure.  Hyperphosphatemia is a serum phosphate concentration > 4. 46 mmol/L.  Causes include chronic kidney disease, hypoparathyroidism, and metabolic or respiratory acidosis. \n【14】 Treatment combines dietary phosphate restriction and phosphate-binding agents, such as calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, lanthanum, or sevelamer.  Despite the use of phosphate binders, dietary restriction of phosphate is also needed.  Aluminum-containing compounds have been used to limit phosphate concentration in the past, but they should be avoided, especially in patients receiving long-term dialysis, to prevent aluminum accumulation in bone resulting in severe osteomalacia.  Vitamin D administration is potentially hazardous in patients with chronic kidney disease because it can increase phosphate as well as calcium concentrations and lead to accelerated vascular calcification; vitamin D administration requires frequent monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels.  Treatment is generally limited to patients with renal failure patients and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Although oral calcitriol is often given along with oral calcium to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism, the results are variable in patients with end-stage renal disease.  The parenteral form of calcitriol, or vitamin D analogs such as paricalcitol, may better prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism in such patients, because the higher attained serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D directly suppresses PTH release.  The oral calcimimetic, cinacalcet, modulates the set point of the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells and decreases PTH concentration in dialysis patients without increasing serum calcium.  Symptomatic hypocalcemia can develop with cinacalcet.  It should not be started in patients with hypocalcemia at baseline, and calcium should be monitored frequently when titrating cinacalcet dose.  Adherence can be limited by gastrointestinal intolerance.  Another calcimimetic, etelcalcetide, is a parenteral alternative.  Simple osteomalacia may respond to calcitriol 0. 25 to 0. 5 mcg orally once a day.  In patients with osteomalacia caused by having taken large amounts of aluminum-containing phosphate binders, removal of aluminum with deferoxamine is necessary before calcitriol administration can reduce bone lesions.  Treatment of severe hyperparathyroidism Progressive, severe elevation of parathyroid hormone level that cannot be lowered by medical means without causing significant hyperphosphatemia or hypercalcemia requires surgery to prevent or reverse symptoms.  A subtotal parathyroidectomy is done with reimplantation of a portion of the most normal appearing gland in the belly of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or subcutaneously in the forearm.  Postoperatively, calcium can fall precipitously in patients with severe or long standing osteitis fibrosa cystica and is managed with oral and parenteral calcium and cholecalciferol.  If the reimplanted parathyroid tissue does not produce parathyroid hormone and the PTH level remains very low or undetectable, the patient will be at risk of developing osteomalacia as well as symptomatic hypocalcemia.  Prolonged administration of as much as 2 mcg of calcitriol given orally once a day and ≥ 2 g of elemental calcium supplement per day is generally needed to support the calcium level.  If after subtotal parathyroidectomy, patients with end-stage renal disease remain symptomatic due to hypocalcemia, adjustment can be made to the dialysate concentration of calcium.  Treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when long-term stimulatory effects causing secondary hyperparathyroidism result in adenomatous transformation of parathyroid tissue.  Patients with hypercalcemia as well as severe elevation of PTH while not taking cholecalciferol or calcium-containing phosphate binders suggests the presence of tertiary hyperparathyroidism.  Adenomatous cells do not respond to medical treatment and require surgical intervention. \n【15】 Key Points Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia which is often asymptomatic.  Diagnosis is made by finding elevated PTH levels in a patient with hypercalcemia.  Primary hyperparathyroidism is most often due to solitary adenomas but these can be multiple in hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.  Treatment can be conservative in asymptomatic patients but usually requires surgical parathyroidectomy in patients with symptoms, severe hypercalcemia, or severe osteoporosis.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism is most often due to advanced renal disease and related to decreased vitamin D and calcium levels as well as persistent hyperphosphatemia.  Medical treatment is with continuous reduction in phosphate intake, phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics.  Surgery is reserved for patients with severe and uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "51320fe8-6198-4708-834b-0d279f615ba5", "title": null, "text": "【0】Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.  Breast cancer usually starts in the glands that produce milk (lobules) or the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the glands to the nipple.  Among women, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths.  Typically, the first symptom is a painless lump, usually noticed by the woman.  Breast cancer screening recommendations vary and include periodic mammography, breast examination by a doctor, and breast self-examination.  If a solid lump is detected, doctors use a hollow needle to remove a sample of tissue or make an incision and remove part or all of the lump and then examine the tissue under a microscope (biopsy).  Breast cancer almost always requires surgery, sometimes with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, other drugs, or a combination.  Outcome is hard to predict and depends partly on the characteristics and spread of the cancer.   or cancerous (malignant).  Most are noncancerous and not life threatening.  Often, they do not require treatment.  Breast disorders Overview of Breast Disorders Breast disorders may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). \n【1】 Most are noncancerous and not life threatening.  In contrast, breast cancer can mean loss of a breast or of life.  Thus, for many women, breast cancer is their worst fear.  However, potential problems can often be detected early when women do both of the following: Are examined regularly by their doctor Have mammograms as recommended Women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel, and men should also be aware of changes in or around their nipples.  If a woman notices a change, she may want to do a breast self-examination.  Women should report any changes to a health care practitioner right away.  Most medical organizations no longer recommend that people do monthly or weekly breast self-examinations Breast self-awareness Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【2】 Doing these examinations when there is no lump or other change does not help detect breast cancer early in women who get screening mammograms.  Early detection of breast cancer can be essential to successful treatment.  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and, of cancers, is the most common cause of death among Hispanic women and the second most common cause of death in women of other races (after lung cancer).  In 2021 in the United States, the following occurred in women: Invasive breast cancer Extent of spread was diagnosed in about 281,550 women.  Noninvasive (in situ) breast cancer Extent of spread was diagnosed in almost 49,290 women.  Almost 43,600 women died of breast cancer.  Breast cancers in men Breast cancer in men Breast disorders occur infrequently in men.  Breast disorders include Breast enlargement Breast cancer Breast enlargement in males is called either gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia. \n【3】 In 2021, 2,650 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 530 deaths from it occurred in men in the United States.  Many women fear breast cancer, partly because it is common.  However, some of the fear about breast cancer is based on misunderstanding.  For example, the statement, “One of every eight women will get breast cancer,” is misleading.  That figure is an estimate of the risk of developing breast cancer during a woman's life.  It means that theoretically, one of eight women will develop breast cancer during her life.  However, a 40-year-old woman has only about a 1 in 70 chance of developing it during the next decade.  But as she ages, her risk increases.  \n【4】 Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Several factors affect the risk of developing breast cancer.  Thus, for some women, the risk is much higher or lower than average.  Most factors that increase risk, such as age and certain abnormal genes, cannot be modified.  However, regular exercise, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood, may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.  Far more important than trying to modify risk factors is being vigilant about detecting breast cancer so that it can be diagnosed and treated early, when it is more likely to be cured.  Early detection is more likely when women have mammograms Mammography Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【5】 Regular breast self-examinations Breast self-awareness Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【6】 Age Increasing age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer.  Most breast cancers occur in women older than 50.  Risk is greatest after age 75.  Previous history of breast cancer Having had breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer.  After the diseased breast is removed, the risk of developing cancer in the remaining breast is about 0. 5 to 1. 0% each year.  Family history of breast cancer Breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) increases a woman’s risk by 2 to 3 times, but breast cancer in more distant relatives (grandmother, aunt, or cousin) increases the risk only slightly.  Breast cancer in two or more first-degree relatives increases a woman’s risk by 5 to 6 times.  Breast cancer gene mutation Mutations in two separate genes for breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2) have been identified.  Fewer than 1% of women have these gene mutations.  About 5 to 10% of women with breast cancer have one of these gene mutations.  If a woman has one of these mutations, her lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 50 to 85%.  The risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 is about 72% with a BRCA1 mutation and about 69% with a BRCA2 mutation.  However, if such a woman develops breast cancer, her chances of dying of breast cancer are not necessarily greater than those of any other woman with breast cancer.  These mutations are most common among Ashkenazi Jews.  Women likely to have one of these mutations are those who have at least two close, usually first-degree relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer.  For this reason, routine screening for these mutations does not appear necessary, except in women who have such a family history.  Having a BRCA mutation also increases the risk of ovarian cancer Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Peritoneal Cancer Ovarian cancer is cancer of the ovaries. \n【7】 During their life, women with BRCA1 gene mutations have about a 40% risk of developing ovarian cancer.  For women with BRCA2 gene mutations, risk is about 15%.  Men who have a BRCA gene mutation have a 1 to 2% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.  Women with one of these mutations need to be tested monitored more closely for breast cancer—for example, by more frequent testing or being screened with both mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Or they may need to try to prevent cancer from developing by taking tamoxifen or raloxifene Prevention (which is similar to tamoxifen) or sometimes by even having both breasts removed ,double mastectomy Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【8】 Certain benign changes in the breast Some changes in the breast seem to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer.  They include Changes in the breast that required a biopsy to rule out cancer Conditions that change the structure, increase the number of cells, or cause lumps or other abnormalities in breast tissue, such as complex fibroadenoma Fibroadenomas of the Breast Fibroadenomas of the breast are small, smooth, solid, rounded noncancerous lumps composed of fibrous and glandular tissue. \n【9】 Having dense breasts means that women have more fibroglandular tissue (composed of fibrous connective tissue and glands) and less fatty tissue in the breast.  For women with such changes, the risk of breast cancer is increased only slightly unless abnormal tissue structure is detected during a biopsy or they have a family history of breast cancer.  Age at first menstrual period, first pregnancy, and menopause The earlier menstruation begins (especially before age 12), the higher the risk of developing breast cancer.  The later the first pregnancy occurs and the later menopause occurs, the higher the risk.  Never having had a baby increases the risk of developing breast cancer.  However, women who have their first pregnancy after age 30 are at higher risk than those who never have a baby.  These factors probably increase risk because they involve longer exposure to estrogen, which stimulates the growth of certain cancers.  (Pregnancy, although it results in high estrogen levels, may reduce the risk of breast cancer. ) Oral contraceptives or hormonal therapy Some studies show that women taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer.  Once the pills are stopped, this risk seems to go back to normal within about 10 years.  After menopause, taking combination hormone therapy Hormone Therapy for Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【10】 Taking estrogen alone does not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer.  Diet and obesity Diet may contribute to the development or growth of breast cancers, but evidence about the effect of a particular diet (such as a high-fat diet) is lacking .  Risk of developing breast cancer is somewhat higher for women who are obese after menopause.  Fat cells produce estrogen, possibly contributing to the increased risk.  However, there is no proof that a high-fat diet contributes to the development of breast cancer or that changing the diet can decrease risk.  Some studies suggest that obese women who are still menstruating are less likely to develop breast cancer.  Research about the link between obesity and cancer is ongoing .  Lifestyle Smoking and regularly drinking alcoholic beverages may increase the risk of breast cancer.  Experts recommend that women limit themselves to one alcoholic drink a day.  One drink is about 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1. 5 ounces of more concentrated liquor, such as whiskey.  Radiation exposure (such as radiation therapy for cancer or significant exposure to x-rays) before age 30 increases risk.  Types of Breast Cancer Breast cancer is usually classified by the following: The kind of tissue in which the cancer starts The extent of the cancer's spread The type of tumor receptors on the cancer cells Kind of tissue There are many different kinds of tissue in the breast.  Cancer can develop in most of these tissues, including Milk ducts (called ductal carcinoma) Milk-producing glands, or lobules (called lobular carcinoma) Fatty or connection tissue (called sarcoma): This type is rare.  Ductal carcinoma accounts for about 90% of all breast cancers.  Paget disease of the nipple Paget Disease of the Nipple Paget disease of the nipple is a type of breast cancer that originates in milk ducts under the nipple but first appears on the skin. \n【11】 The first symptom is a crusty or scaly nipple sore or a discharge from the nipple.  About half of the women who have this cancer also have a lump in the breast that can be felt.  Women with Paget disease of the nipple may also have another breast cancer that is not felt but that can be seen using imaging tests—mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasonography—done to look for another cancer.  Because this disease usually causes little discomfort, women may ignore it for a year or more before seeing a doctor.  The prognosis depends on how invasive and how large the cancer is as well as whether it has spread to the lymph nodes.  Phyllodes breast tumors are relatively rare, accounting for fewer than 1% of breast cancers.  About 10 to 25% are cancerous.  They originate in breast tissue around milk ducts and milk-producing glands.  The tumor spreads to other parts of the body (metastasizes) in about 10 to 20% of women who have it.  It recurs in the breast in about 20 to 35% of women who have had it.  The prognosis is good unless the tumor has metastasized.  Extent of spread Breast cancer can remain within the breast or spread anywhere in the body through the lymphatic vessels Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system. \n【12】 Cancer cells tend to move into the lymphatic vessels in the breast.  Most lymphatic vessels in the breast drain into lymph nodes in the armpit (axillary lymph nodes).  One function of lymph nodes is to filter out and destroy abnormal or foreign cells, such as cancer cells.  If cancer cells get past these lymph nodes, the cancer can spread to other parts of the body.  Breast cancer tends to spread (metastasize) to the bones, brain, lungs, liver, and skin but can spread to any area.  Spread to the scalp is uncommon.  Breast cancer can appear in these areas years or even decades after it is first diagnosed and treated.  If the cancer has spread to one area, it probably has spread to other areas, even if it cannot be detected right away.  Breast cancer can be classified as Carcinoma in situ Invasive cancer Carcinoma in situ means cancer in place.  It is the earliest stage of breast cancer.  Carcinoma in situ may be large and may even affect a substantial area of the breast, but it has not invaded the surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body.  Ductal carcinoma in situ is confined to the milk ducts of the breast.  It does not invade surrounding breast tissue, but it can spread along the ducts and gradually affect a substantial area of the breast.  This type accounts for 85% of carcinoma in situ and at least half of breast cancers.  It is detected most often by mammography.  This type may become invasive.  Lobular carcinoma in situ develops within the milk-producing glands of the breast (lobules).  It often occurs in several areas of both breasts.  Women with lobular carcinoma in situ have a 1 to 2% chance each year of developing invasive breast cancer in the affected or the other breast.  Lobular carcinoma in situ accounts for 1 to 2% of breast cancers.  Usually, lobular carcinoma in situ cannot be seen on a mammogram and is detected only by biopsy.  There are two types of lobular carcinoma in situ: classic and pleomorphic.  The classic type is not invasive, but having it increases the risk of developing invasive cancer in either breast.  The pleomorphic type leads to invasive cancer and, when detected, is surgically removed.  Invasive cancer can be classified as follows: Localized: The cancer is confined to the breast.  Regional: The cancer has invaded tissues near the breasts, such as the chest wall or lymph nodes.  Distant (metastatic): The cancer has spread from the breast to other parts of the body (metastasized).  Invasive ductal carcinoma begins in the milk ducts but breaks through the wall of the ducts, invading the surrounding breast tissue.  It can also spread to other parts of the body.  It accounts for about 80% of invasive breast cancers.  Invasive lobular carcinoma begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast but invades surrounding breast tissue and spreads to other parts of the body.  It is more likely than other types of breast cancer to occur in both breasts.  It accounts for most of the rest of invasive breast cancers.  Rare types of invasive breast cancers include Medullary carcinoma Tubular carcinoma Metaplastic carcinoma Mucinous carcinoma tends to develop in older women and to be slow growing.  Women with most of these rare types of breast cancer have a much better prognosis than women with other types of invasive breast cancer.  However, the prognosis is significantly worse for women with metaplastic breast cancer than for those with other types of ductal breast cancer.  Tumor receptors All cells, including breast cancer cells, have molecules on their surfaces called receptors.  A receptor has a specific structure that allows only particular substances to fit into it and thus affect the cell’s activity.  Whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors affects how quickly the cancer spreads and how it should be treated.  Tumor receptors include the following: Estrogen and progesterone receptors: Some breast cancer cells have receptors for estrogen.  The resulting cancer, described as estrogen receptor–positive, grows or spreads when stimulated by estrogen.  This type of cancer is more common among postmenopausal women than among younger women.  About two thirds of postmenopausal women with cancer have estrogen receptor–positive cancer.  Some breast cancer cells have receptors for progesterone.  Breast cancers with estrogen receptors and possibly those with progesterone receptors grow more slowly than those that do not have these receptors, and the prognosis is better.  (Estrogen and progesterone Overview of the Female Reproductive System are female sex hormones. ) HER2 (HER2/neu) receptors: Normal breast cells have HER2 receptors, which help them grow.  (HER stands for human epithelial growth factor receptor, which is involved in multiplication, survival, and differentiation of cells. ) In about 20% of breast cancers, cancer cells have too many HER2 receptors.  Such cancers tend to be very fast growing.  Other characteristics Sometimes cancer is also classified based on other characteristics.  Inflammatory breast cancer is an example.  The name refers to the symptoms of the cancer rather than the affected tissue.  This type is fast growing, particularly aggressive, and often fatal.  Cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels in the skin of the breast, causing the breast to appear inflamed: swollen, red, and warm.  Usually, inflammatory breast cancer spreads to the lymph nodes in the armpit.  The lymph nodes can be felt as hard lumps.  However, often no lump may be felt in the breast itself because this cancer is dispersed throughout the breast.  Inflammatory breast cancer accounts for about 1% of breast cancers.  Symptoms of Breast Cancer At first, breast cancer causes no symptoms.  Most commonly, the first symptom of breast cancer is a lump, which usually feels distinctly different from the surrounding breast tissue.  In many breast cancer cases, women discover the lump themselves.  Such a lump may be cancer if it is a firm, distinctive thickening that appears in one breast but not the other.  Usually, scattered lumpy changes in the breast, especially the upper outer region, are not cancerous and indicate fibrocystic changes Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast Fibrocystic changes of the breast (formerly called fibrocystic breast disease) include breast pain, cysts, and lumpiness that are not due to cancer. \n【13】 In the early stages, the lump may move freely beneath the skin when it is pushed with the fingers.  In more advanced stages, the lump usually adheres to the chest wall or the skin over it.  In these cases, the lump cannot be moved at all or it cannot be moved separately from the skin over it.  Sometimes women can determine whether they have a cancer that even slightly adheres to the chest wall or skin by lifting their arms over their head while standing in front of a mirror.  If a breast contains cancer that adheres to the chest wall or skin, this maneuver may make the skin pucker or dimple or make one breast appear different from the other.  In very advanced cancer, swollen bumps or festering sores may develop on the skin.  Sometimes the skin over the lump is dimpled and leathery and looks like the skin of an orange (peau d’orange) except in color.  The lump may be painful, but pain is an unreliable sign.  Pain without a lump is rarely due to breast cancer.  If the cancer has spread, lymph nodes Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system. \n【14】 The lymph nodes may be stuck together or adhere to the skin or chest wall.  They are usually painless but may be slightly tender.  Occasionally, the first symptom occurs only when the cancer spreads to another organ.  For example, if it spreads to a bone, the bone may ache or become weak, resulting in a fracture.  If the cancer spreads to a lung, women may cough or have difficulty breathing.  In Paget disease of the nipple, the first symptom is a crusty or scaly nipple sore or a discharge from the nipple.  These changes may appear harmless, so women may not think they need to see a health care practitioner.  Many women who have this cancer also have a lump in the breast.  In inflammatory breast cancer, the breast is warm, red, and swollen, as if infected (but it is not).  The skin of the breast may become dimpled and leathery, like the skin of an orange, or may have ridges.  The nipple may turn inward (invert).  A discharge from the nipple is common.  Often, no lump can be felt in the breast, but the entire breast is enlarged.  Screening for Breast Cancer Because breast cancer rarely causes symptoms in its early stages and because early treatment is more likely to be successful, screening is important.  Screening is the hunt for a disorder before any symptoms occur.  Screening for breast cancer may include Yearly breast examination by a health care practitioner Mammography If women have an increased risk of breast cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Concerns about screening for breast cancer It can be challenging to keep up with the latest recommendations for breast cancer screening, such as when to start mammograms.  Also, medical organizations may change their recommendations over time, or different organizations may have different recommendations.  Some people think that more testing is better, but testing may also have disadvantages.  For example, screening tests for breast cancer sometimes indicate a cancer is present when no cancer is present (called a false-positive result).  When results of a breast screening test are positive, a breast biopsy Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【15】 Having a false-positive result means having a biopsy that is not needed and being exposed to unnecessary anxiety, pain, and expense.  Because of these potential issues, organizations recommend that some people do not need to have a screening test.  These people include those who are younger or older than a certain age .  Women should discuss current recommendations and their own risk and priorities with their health care practitioner and decide which type of screening, if any, is appropriate for them.  Mammography is one of the best ways to detect breast cancer early.  Mammography is designed to be sensitive enough to detect the possibility of cancer at an early stage, sometimes years before it can be felt.  Because mammography is so sensitive, it may indicate cancer when none is present (a false-positive result).  About 85 to 90% of abnormalities detected during screening (that is, in women with no symptoms or lumps) are not cancer.  Typically, when the result is positive, more specific follow-up procedures, usually a breast biopsy, are scheduled to confirm the result.  Mammography may miss up to 15% of breast cancers.  It is less accurate in women with dense breast tissue.  Thus, these women may require additional tests, such as breast ultrasonography, 3-dimensional mammography ,tomosynthesis Breast examination by a health care practitioner Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【16】 For mammography, x-rays are used to check for abnormal areas in the breast.  A technician positions the woman’s breast on top of an x-ray plate.  An adjustable plastic cover is lowered on top of the breast, firmly compressing the breast.  Thus, the breast is flattened so that the maximum amount of tissue can be imaged and examined.  X-rays are aimed downward through the breast, producing an image on the x-ray plate.  Two x-rays are taken of each breast in this position.  Then plates may be placed vertically on either side of the breast, and x-rays are aimed from the side.  This position produces a side view of the breast.  Mammography: Screening for Breast Cancer Breast tomosynthesis (3-dimensional mammography) may be used with mammography to produce a clear, highly focused 3-dimensional picture of the breast.  This technique makes it somewhat easier to detect cancer, especially in women with dense breast tissue.  However, this type of mammography exposes women to more radiation as traditional mammography.  Recommendations for routine screening with mammography vary.  Experts disagree about When it should start How often it should be done When (or if) it should be stopped Experts have different recommendations about when to start routine mammography Breast Cancer: When to Start Screening Mammography? .  Screening mammography is recommended for all women starting at age 50, but some experts recommend starting at age 40 or 45.  Some experts recommend starting at age 50 because screening mammography is more accurate in women 50 or older.  The reason is that as women age, fatty tissue replaces fibroglandular tissue in the breast.  Abnormalities next to fatty tissue are easier to detect with a mammogram.  The benefit of screening is not as clear in women aged 40 to 49.  Experts are also concerned about starting screening too soon or screening too often because exposure to radiation would be increased.  Women with risk factors for breast cancer Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【17】 They should discuss the risks and benefits of screening mammograms with their doctor.  Whenever it is started, mammography is then repeated every 1 or 2 years.  Routine mammography may be stopped at age 75, depending on the woman's life expectancy and her wish for continued screening.  ly about 10 to 15% of the abnormalities detected during routine screening with mammography turn out to be cancer.  The dose of radiation used in mammography is very low and is considered safe.  Mammography may cause some discomfort, but the discomfort lasts only a few seconds.  Mammography should be scheduled at a time during the menstrual period when the breasts are less likely to be tender.  Deodorants and powders should not be used on the day of the procedure because they can interfere with the image obtained.  The entire procedure takes about 15 minutes.  Breast Cancer: When to Start Screening Mammography? Experts sometimes disagree about when regular screening with mammography should be started.  Because screening identifies cancer and cancers can be fatal, people might think that screening should be started sooner (at age 40) rather than later (at age 50).  However, screening has some disadvantages, and the benefits for younger women are not as clear as those for older women.  The following are some reasons for the controversy: Screening, particularly in younger women, detects abnormalities that may not be cancers.  Finding an abnormality often results in a biopsy to determine what it is.  Thus, screening results in many more breast biopsies, sometimes causing women unnecessary anxiety and expense, as well as possibly resulting in scar tissue in the breast.  Some breast cancers, such as in situ breast cancers (cancers that have not spread), are not fatal.  Some breast cancers grow slowly and would not cause death in a woman's lifetime.  However, other breast cancers continue to grow and invade other tissues.  How many of the cancers detected by screening would eventually be fatal is unclear.  Nonetheless, all cancers are treated because currently, health care practitioners do not have enough evidence to determine which ones should be treated and which ones should not be treated.  Mammography is less accurate in younger women.  Thus, screening may miss cancers, possibly including those that could be fatal.  Mammography is more accurate in women over age 50 partly because, with aging, fibroglandular tissue (composed of fibrous connective tissue and glands) in the breasts tends to be replaced with fatty tissue.  Many women must be screened to save one life.  When women are older, fewer women need to be screened to save a life.  For women 50 and over, screening saves lives and is recommended.  Breast self-awareness Women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel, and men should also be aware of changes in or around their nipples.  In the past, most doctors recommended that women examine their breasts for lumps each month.  Breast examination by a health care practitioner A breast examination may be part of a routine physical examination.  However, as with breast self-examination, a doctor's examination may miss a cancer.  If women need or want screening, a more sensitive test, such as mammography, should be done, even if a doctor's examination did not detect any abnormalities.  Many doctors and medical organizations no longer require an annual breast examination by a doctor.  During the examination, a doctor inspects the breasts for irregularities, dimpling, tightened skin, lumps, and a discharge.  The doctor feels (palpates) each breast with a flat hand and checks for enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit—the area most breast cancers invade first—and above the collarbone.  Normal lymph nodes cannot be felt through the skin, so those that can be felt are considered enlarged.  However, noncancerous conditions can also cause lymph nodes to enlarge.  Lymph nodes that can be felt are checked to see if they are abnormal.  Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is usually used to screen women with a high risk of breast cancer, such as those with a BRCA mutation.  For these women, screening should also include mammography and breast examination by a health care practitioner.  MRI may be recommended for women with dense breast tissue as part of an overall assessment that includes evaluation of risk.  Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Mammography Breast examination Biopsy Sometimes ultrasonography If changes in the breast (such nipple discharge or a lump) are detected during a physical examination, ultrasonography is usually done.  If results are inconclusive, mammography is done.  Mammography can also help identify tissue that should be removed and examined under a microscope (biopsied).  If doctors suspect advanced cancer based on results of a physical examination, a biopsy is done first  is a thickening or bump that feels different from surrounding breast tissue.  A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor. Ultrasonography is sometimes used to help distinguish between a fluid-filled sac (cyst Breast Cysts Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop in the breast.   Breast cysts are common. \n【18】 This distinction is important because cysts are usually not cancerous.  Cysts may be monitored (with no treatment) or drained (aspirated) with a small needle and syringe.  The fluid from the cyst is examined to check for cancer cells only if any of the following occurs: The fluid is bloody or cloudy.  Little fluid is obtained.  The lump remains after it is drained.  Otherwise, the woman is checked again in a few weeks.  If the cyst can no longer be felt at this time, it is considered noncancerous.  If it has reappeared, it is drained again, and the fluid is examined under a microscope.  If the cyst reappears a third time or if it is still present after it was drained, a biopsy may be done.  Rarely, when cancer is suspected, cysts are surgically removed.  Breast biopsy All abnormalities that suggest cancer are biopsied.  Doctors may do one of several types of biopsy: Core needle biopsy: A wide, hollow needle with a special tip is used to remove a sample of breast tissue.  Open (surgical) biopsy: Doctors make a small cut in the skin and breast tissue and remove part or all of a lump.  This type of biopsy is done when a needle biopsy is not possible.  It may also be done after a needle biopsy that does not detect cancer to be sure that the needle biopsy did not miss a cancer.  Imaging is often done during a biopsy to help doctors determine where to place the biopsy needle.  Using imaging to guide the biopsy improves the accuracy of a core needle biopsy.  For example, for a mass (whether felt or seen on a mammogram), ultrasonography is used during the core needle biopsy to accurately target the abnormal tissue.  When imaging is used to guide placement of the needle, a clip to mark the spot is typically placed during the biopsy.  When an abnormality is seen only on an MRI scan, MRI is used to guide the placement of the biopsy needle.  A stereotactic core biopsy is useful when there are abnormal patterns of tiny calcium deposits (called microcalcifications) in the breast.  This type of biopsy helps doctors accurately locate and remove a sample of the abnormal tissue.  For a stereotactic biopsy, doctors take mammograms from two angles and send the two-dimensional images to a computer.  The computer compares them and calculates the precise location of the abnormality in three dimensions.  The breast tissue to be biopsied by stereotactic core biopsy is x-rayed to make sure doctors get a sample of the abnormal microcalcifications.  Most women do not need to be hospitalized for these procedures.  Usually, only a local anesthetic is needed.  A pathologist examines the biopsy samples under the microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present.  Generally, a biopsy confirms cancer in only a few women with an abnormality detected during mammography.  Evaluation after cancer diagnosis If cancer is diagnosed, women are seen by a cancer specialists (oncologists), which may include surgeons, medical oncologists (cancer drug treatment specialists), and radiation oncologists.  These doctors determine which tests should be done and plan treatment.  If cancer cells are detected, the biopsy sample is analyzed to determine the characteristics of the cancer cells, such as Whether the cancer cells have hormone (estrogen or progesterone) receptors How many HER2 receptors are present How quickly the cancer cells are dividing For some types of breast cancer, genetic testing of the cancer cells (multigene panels) This information helps doctors estimate how rapidly the cancer may spread and which treatments are more likely to be effective.  After breast cancer is diagnosed, tests may include A chest x-ray to determine whether the cancer has spread Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), liver tests, and measurement of calcium, also to determine whether the cancer has spread In women with risk factors for inherited genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (such as BRCA genes) Breast cancer gene mutation Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【19】 Staging of Breast Cancer When cancer is diagnosed, a stage Staging Cancer is suspected based on a person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, and sometimes the results of screening tests. \n【20】 The stage is a number from 0 to IV (sometimes with substages indicated by letters) that reflects how extensive and aggressive the cancer is: Stage 0 is assigned to in situ breast cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ.  In situ means cancer in place.  That is, the cancer has not invaded surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body.  Stages I through III are assigned to cancer that has spread to tissues within or near the breast (localized or regional breast cancer) Extent of spread .  Stage IV is assigned to metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread from the breast and lymph nodes in the armpit to other parts of the body).  Staging the cancer helps doctors determine the appropriate treatment and the prognosis.  Many factors go into determining the stage of breast cancer, such as the following: How large the cancer is Whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes Whether it has spread (metastasized) to other organs, such as the lungs or brain Other important staging factors include the following: Grade Grading Cancer is suspected based on a person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, and sometimes the results of screening tests. \n【21】 If the cancer cells do not look very different from normal cells, the cancer is considered well-differentiated.  If the cancer cells look very abnormal, they are considered undifferentiated or poorly differentiated.  Well-differentiated cancers tend to grow and spread more slowly than undifferentiated or poorly differentiated cancers.  Based on these and other differences in microscopic appearance, doctors assign a grade to most cancers.  The presence of hormone receptors and gene mutations in the cancer cells affect how the cancer responds to different treatments and what the prognosis is.  Prognosis for Breast Cancer Generally, a woman's prognosis depends on How large the cancer is What type of cancer it is Whether it has spread to the lymph nodes or other organs  Program. ) The number and location of lymph nodes that contain cancer cells is one of the main factors that determine whether the cancer can be cured and, if not, how long women will live.  The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer (the percentage of women who are alive 5 years after diagnosis) is 99% if the cancer remains at its original site (localized) 86% if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but no further (regional) 29% if the cancer has spread to distant sites (metastasized) 58% if a full evaluation has not been done and the cancer has not been staged Women with breast cancer tend to have a worse prognosis if they have any of the following: Diagnosis of breast cancer during their 20s and 30s Larger tumors Cancer that has rapidly dividing cells, such as tumors that do not have well-defined borders or cancer that is dispersed throughout the breast Tumors that do not have estrogen or progesterone receptors Tumors that have too many HER2 receptors A BRCA1 gene mutation In the United States, women who are Black and non-Hispanic have higher rates of death from breast cancer than women who are White and non-Hispanic.  Having the BRCA2 gene mutation probably does not make the current cancer result in a worse outcome.  However, having either BRCA gene mutation increases the risk of developing a second breast cancer.  Prevention of Breast Cancer Taking drugs that decrease the risk of breast cancer (chemoprevention) may be recommended for the following women: Those who are over age 35 and have had a previous lobular carcinoma in situ or abnormal tissue structure (atypical hyperplasia) in the milk ducts or milk-producing glands Those who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 or another high-risk gene mutation Those who are between the ages of 35 and 59 and have a high risk of developing breast cancer based on their current age, age when menstruation began (menarche), age at the first birth of a child, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and results of prior breast biopsies Drugs that block estrogen receptors in breast tissue may be used to prevent breast cancer.  They include Tamoxifen Raloxifene Women should ask their doctor about possible side effects before taking these drugs.  Risks of tamoxifen include Cancer of the uterus Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause. \n【22】 Raloxifene appears to be about as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and to have a lower risk of endometrial cancer, blood clots, and cataracts.  Both drugs may also increase bone density and thus benefit women who have osteoporosis.  Treatment of Breast Cancer Surgery Usually radiation therapy Hormone-blocking drugs (endocrine therapy), chemotherapy, or both Treatment for breast cancer begins after the woman’s condition has been thoroughly evaluated.  Treatment options depend on the stage and type of breast cancer and the receptors that the cancer has.  However, treatment is complex because the different types of breast cancer differ greatly in characteristics such as growth rate, tendency to spread (metastasize), and response to various treatments.  Also, much is still unknown about breast cancer.  Consequently, doctors may have different opinions about the most appropriate treatment for a particular woman.  The preferences of a woman and her doctor affect treatment decisions.  Women with breast cancer should ask for a clear explanation of what is known about the cancer and what is still unknown, as well as a complete description of treatment options.  Then, they can consider the advantages and disadvantages of the different treatments and accept or reject the options offered.  Doctors may ask women with breast cancer to participate in research studies investigating a new treatment.  New treatments aim to improve the chances of survival or quality of life.  Women should ask their doctor to explain the risks and possible benefits of participation, so that they can make a well-informed decision.  Treatment usually involves surgery and often includes radiation therapy and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.  Sometimes a woman can choose whether surgery will involve removing part or all of one or both breasts.  Women may be referred to a plastic or reconstruction surgeon, who can remove the cancer and reconstruct the breast in the same operation.  Surgery The cancerous tumor and varying amounts of the surrounding tissue are removed.  There are two main options for removing the tumor: Breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy Removal of the breast (mastectomy) For women with invasive cancer (stage I or higher), mastectomy is no more effective than breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy as long as the entire tumor can be removed during breast-conserving surgery.  In breast-conserving surgery, doctors remove the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue to reduce the risk that tissue that may contain cancer is left behind.  Before surgery, chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before removing it.  This approach sometimes enables some women to have breast-conserving surgery rather than mastectomy.  Breast-conserving surgery leaves as much of the breast intact as possible.  When considering the type of surgery, it is more important for doctors to be sure they remove the whole cancer than to risk leaving tissue that may contain cancer.  For breast-conserving surgery, doctors first determine how big the tumor is and how much tissue around it (called margins) needs to be removed.  The size of the margins is based on how big the tumor is in relation to the breast.  Then the tumor with its margins is surgically removed.  Tissue from the margins is examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells that have spread outside the tumor.  These findings help doctors decide on whether further treatment is needed.  Various terms (for example, lumpectomy, wide excision, quadrantectomy) are used to describe how much breast tissue is removed.  Breast-conserving surgery is usually followed by radiation therapy Radiation Therapy for Cancer Radiation is a form of intense energy generated by a radioactive substance, such as cobalt, or by specialized equipment, such as an atomic particle (linear) accelerator. \n【23】 The main advantages of breast-conserving surgery are the possibility of preserving breast tissue and how the breast appears after surgery.  When the tumor is large in relation to the breast, this type of surgery is less likely to be useful.  In such cases, removing the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue means removing most of the breast.  Breast-conserving surgery is usually more appropriate when tumors are small.  In about 15% of women who have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of tissue removed is so small that little difference can be seen between the treated and untreated breasts.  However, in most women, the treated breast shrinks somewhat and may change in contour.  If either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy is an option, a woman should consider each option.  Some women prefer breast-conserving surgery because they feel that losing a breast would be a very difficult emotional and physical experience and that breast-conserving surgery helps preserve body image.  Other women prefer mastectomy because they feel more comfortable having all the breast tissue removed or because if they have a mastectomy, they may not need radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy, given to shrink the tumor before removing it, may enable some women to have breast-conserving surgery rather than a mastectomy.  Mastectomy is the other main surgical option.  There are several types.  In all types, all breast tissue is removed, but which other tissues and how much of them are left in place or removed vary by type: Skin-sparing mastectomy leaves the muscle under the breast and enough skin to cover the wound.  Reconstruction of the breast is much easier if these tissues are left.  The lymph nodes in the armpit are not removed.  Nipple-sparing mastectomy is the same as skin-sparing mastectomy plus it leaves the nipple and the area of pigmented skin around the nipple (areola).  Simple mastectomy leaves the muscle under the breast (pectoral muscle) and the lymph nodes in the armpit.  Modified radical mastectomy consists of removing some lymph nodes in the armpit but leaves the muscle under the breast.  Radical mastectomy consists of removing the lymph nodes in the armpit and the muscle under the breast.  This procedure is rarely done now unless the cancer has invaded the muscle under the breast.  Lymph node assessment Doctors assess lymph nodes to determine whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit.  If cancer is detected in these lymph nodes, it is more likely to have spread to other parts of the body.  In such cases, different treatment may be needed.  A network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes ,lymphatic system Overview of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system is a vital part of the immune system. \n【24】 Lymph nodes trap foreign or abnormal cells (such as bacteria or cancer cells) that may be contained in this fluid.  Thus, breast cancer cells often end up in lymph nodes near the breast, such as those in the armpit.  Usually, foreign and abnormal cells are then destroyed.  However, the cancer cells sometimes continue to grow in the lymph nodes or pass through the nodes into the lymphatic vessels and spread to other parts of the body.  Doctors first feel the armpit to check for enlarged lymph nodes.  Depending on what doctors find, they may do one or more of the following: Ultrasonography to check for lymph nodes that may be enlarged A biopsy (by removing a lymph node or taking a sample of tissue with a needle using ultrasonography to guide placement of the needle) Axillary lymph node dissection: Removal of many (typically 10 to 20) lymph nodes in the armpit Sentinel lymph node dissection: Removal of only the lymph node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely to spread to If doctors feel an enlarged lymph node in the armpit or are uncertain whether lymph nodes are enlarged, ultrasonography is done.  If an enlarged lymph node is detected, a needle is inserted into it to remove a sample of tissue to be examined (fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy Testing ).  Ultrasonography is used to guide placement of the needle.  If the biopsy detects cancer, surgical removal of lymph nodes from the armpit (axillary lymph node dissection) may be needed.  Removing many lymph nodes in the armpit, even if they contain cancer, does not help cure the cancer.  However, it does help doctors decide what treatment to use.  Axillary lymph nodes are evaluated again after chemotherapy is given before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy).  If the biopsy after ultrasonography does not detect cancer, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is done because even if there are no cancer cells in a biopsy sample, cancer cells may be present in other parts of a lymph node.  A sentinel lymph node biopsy is usually done as part of the operation to remove the cancer, such as lumpectomy or mastectomy.  It enables doctors to identify and test the most important lymph node related to a breast cancer.  If that lymph node is not cancerous, a woman does not need a more extensive surgery to remove all axillary lymph nodes.  For a sentinel lymph node biopsy, doctors inject a blue dye and/or a radioactive substance into the breast.  These substances map the pathway from the breast to the first lymph node (or nodes) in the armpit.  Doctors then make a small incision in the armpit and look for a lymph node that looks blue and/or gives off a radioactive signal (detected by a handheld device).  This lymph node is the one that cancer cells are most likely to have spread to.  This node is called a sentinel lymph node because it is the first to warn that cancer has spread.  Doctors remove this node and send it to a laboratory to be checked for cancer.  More than one lymph node may look blue and/or give off a radioactive signal and thus be considered a sentinel lymph node.  If the sentinel lymph nodes do not contain cancer cells, no other lymph nodes are removed.  If the sentinel nodes contain cancer, axillary lymph node dissection may be done, depending on various factors, such as Whether a mastectomy is planned How many sentinel nodes are present and whether the cancer has spread outside the nodes Sometimes during surgery to remove the tumor, doctors discover that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and axillary lymph node dissection is required.  Before the surgery is done, women may be asked whether they are willing to let the surgeon do more extensive surgery if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.  Otherwise, a second surgical procedure, if needed, is done later.  Removal of lymph nodes often causes problems because it affects the drainage of fluids in tissues.  As a result, fluids may accumulate, causing persistent swelling (lymphedema) of the arm or hand.  After surgery, the risk of developing lymphedema continues throughout life.  Arm and shoulder movement may be limited, requiring physical therapy.  The more lymph nodes removed, the worse the lymphedema.  Sentinel lymph node biopsy causes less lymphedema than axillary lymph node dissection.  If lymphedema develops, it is treated by specially trained therapists.  They teach women how to massage the area, which may help the accumulated fluid drain, and how to apply a bandage, which helps keep fluid from reaccumulating.  The affected arm should be used as normally as possible, except that the unaffected arm should be used for heavy lifting.  Women should exercise the affected arm daily as instructed and bandage it overnight indefinitely.  If lymph nodes have been removed, women may be advised to ask health care practitioners not to insert catheters or needles in veins in the affected arm and not to measure blood pressure in that arm.  These procedures makes lymphedema more likely to develop or worsen.  Women are also advised to wear gloves whenever they are doing work that may scratch or injure the skin of the hand and arm on the side of the surgery.  Avoiding injuries and infections can help reduce the risk of developing lymphedema.  Other problems that may occur after lymph nodes are removed include temporary or persistent numbness, a persistent burning sensation, and infection.  What Is a Sentinel Lymph Node? A network of lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes drain fluid from the tissue in the breast.  The lymph nodes are designed to trap foreign or abnormal cells (such as bacteria or cancer cells) that may be contained in this fluid.  Sometimes cancer cells pass through the nodes into the lymphatic vessels and spread to other parts of the body.  Although fluid from breast tissue eventually drains to many lymph nodes, the fluid usually drains first through one or only a few nearby lymph nodes.  Such lymph nodes are called sentinel lymph nodes because they are the first to warn that cancer has spread.  Breast reconstruction surgery may be done at the same time as a mastectomy or later.  Women should consult with a plastic surgeon early during treatment to plan the breast reconstruction surgery.  When reconstruction is done depends not only on the woman's preference but also on the other treatments needed.  For example, if radiation therapy is done before reconstruction surgery, reconstruction options are limited.  Oncoplastic breast surgery, which combines cancer (oncologic) surgery and plastic surgery, is one option.  This type of surgery is designed to remove all cancer from the breast and preserve or restore the natural appearance of the breast.  Most often, the surgery is done by Inserting an implant (made of silicone or saline) Reconstructing the breast using tissue taken from other parts of the woman’s body Surgeons often obtain tissue for breast reconstruction from a muscle in the lower abdomen.  Alternatively, skin and fatty tissue (instead of muscle) from the lower abdomen can be used to reconstruct the breast.  Before inserting an implant, doctors use a tissue expander, which resembles a balloon, to stretch the remaining chest skin and muscle to make room for the breast implant.  The tissue expander is placed under the chest muscle during mastectomy.  The expander has a small valve that health care practitioners can access by inserting a needle through the skin.  Over the next several weeks, a salt solution (saline) is periodically injected through the valve to expand the expander a little at a time.  After expansion is complete, the expander is surgically removed, and the implant is inserted.  Alternatively, tissues taken from the woman's body (such as muscle and tissues under the skin) can be used for reconstruction.  These tissues are taken from the abdomen, back, or buttock and moved to the chest area to create the shape of a breast.  The nipple and surrounding skin are usually reconstructed in a separate operation done later.  Various techniques can be used.  They include using tissue from the woman's body and tattooing.  Surgery may also be done to modify (augment, reduce, or lift) the other breast to make both breasts match.  Rebuilding a Breast After a general surgeon removes a breast tumor and the surrounding breast tissue (mastectomy), a plastic surgeon may reconstruct the breast.  A silicone or saline implant may be used.  Or in a more complex operation, tissue may be taken from other parts of the woman’s body, such as the abdomen, buttock, or back.  Reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy—a choice that involves being under anesthesia for a longer time—or later—a choice that involves being under anesthesia a second time.  Reconstruction of the nipple and surrounding skin is done later, often in a doctor's office.  A general anesthetic is not required.  In many women, a reconstructed breast looks more natural than one that has been treated with radiation therapy, especially if the tumor was large.  If a silicone or saline implant is used and enough skin was left to cover it, the sensation in the skin over the implant is relatively normal.  However, neither type of implant feels like breast tissue to the touch.  If skin from other parts of the body is used to cover the breast, much of the sensation is lost.  However, tissue from other parts of the body feels more like breast tissue than does a silicone or saline implant.  Silicone occasionally leaks out of its sack.  As a result, an implant can become hard, cause discomfort, and appear less attractive.  Also, silicone sometimes enters the bloodstream.  Some women are concerned about whether the leaking silicone causes cancer in other parts of the body or rare diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).  There is almost no evidence suggesting that silicone leakage has these serious effects, but because it might, the use of silicone implants has decreased, especially among women who have not had breast cancer.  Removal of the Breast Without Cancer Certain women with breast cancer have a high risk of developing breast cancer in their other breast (the one without cancer).  Doctors may suggest that these women have the other breast removed before cancer develops in it.  This procedure is called contralateral (opposite side) prophylactic (preventive) mastectomy.  This preventive surgery may be appropriate for women with any of the following: An inherited genetic mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer (such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) At least two close, usually first-degree relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer Radiation therapy directed at the chest when women were under 30 years old Lobular carcinoma in situ (a noninvasive type) In women with lobular carcinoma in situ in one breast, invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast.  Thus, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for these women is to remove both breasts.  Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option.  Advantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include the following: Longer survival for women with breast cancer and a genetic mutation that increases risk and possibly for women who are under 50 years old when they are diagnosed with breast cancer Decreased need for cumbersome follow-up imaging tests after treatment For some women, decreased anxiety Disadvantages of this procedure include the following: Twice the risk of complications Instead of having a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, some women may choose to have their doctor monitor the breast closely for cancer—for example with imaging tests.  Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells at and near the site from which the tumor was removed, including nearby lymph nodes.  Radiation therapy after mastectomy is done if the following are present: The tumor is 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) or larger.  The cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes.  In such cases, radiation therapy after mastectomy reduces the incidence of cancer recurring on the chest wall and in nearby lymph nodes, and it improves the chances of survival.  Radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces the incidence of breast cancer recurring near the original tumor and in nearby lymph nodes, and it may improve overall survival.  However, if women are over 70 have a lumpectomy and the cancer has estrogen receptors, radiation therapy may not be necessary because it does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence or improve the chances of survival in these women.  Side effects of radiation therapy include swelling in the breast, reddening and blistering of the skin in the treated area, and fatigue.  These effects usually disappear within several months up to about 12 months.  Fewer than 5% of women treated with radiation therapy have rib fractures that cause minor discomfort.  In about 1% of women, the lungs become mildly inflamed 6 to 18 months after radiation therapy is completed.  Inflammation causes a dry cough and shortness of breath during physical activity that last for up to about 6 weeks.  Lymphedema may develop after radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy and Hormone-Blocking Drugs Chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs can suppress the growth of cancer cells throughout the body.  To decide whether to treat with chemotherapy, doctors evaluate a few factors about a woman and her breast cancer and discuss the risks and benefits with her.  Factors that doctors consider include Whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes Whether a woman is premenopausal or postmenopausal What the results of tests for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors are What the results of tests for the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) oncogene are Genetic testing of the cancer (such as the Oncotype DX test) For women with invasive breast cancer, chemotherapy and/or hormone-blocking drugs are usually begun soon after surgery.  These drugs are continued for months or years.  Some, such as tamoxifen, may be continued for 5 to 10 years.  If tumors are larger than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches), chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs may be started before surgery.  These drugs delay or prevent the recurrence of cancer in most women and prolong survival in some.  Analyzing the genetic material of the cancer (predictive genomic testing) may help predict which cancers are susceptible to chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.  If women have a breast cancer with estrogen and progesterone receptors but no HER2 receptors and the lymph nodes are not affected, they may not need chemotherapy.  Hormone-blocking therapy alone may be sufficient.  Chemotherapy is used to kill rapidly multiplying cells or slow their multiplication.  Chemotherapy alone cannot cure breast cancer.  It must be used with surgery or radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy drugs are usually given intravenously in cycles.  Sometimes they are given by mouth.  Typically, a day of treatment is followed by 2 or more weeks of recovery.  Using several chemotherapy drugs together is more effective than using a single drug.  The choice of drugs depends partly on whether cancer cells are detected in nearby lymph nodes.  Commonly used drugs include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, and paclitaxel .  Side effects (such as vomiting, nausea, hair loss, and fatigue) vary depending on which drugs are used.  Chemotherapy can cause infertility and early menopause by destroying the eggs in the ovaries.  Chemotherapy may also suppress the production of blood cells by the bone marrow and thus cause anemia or bleeding or increase the risk of infections.  So drugs, such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, may by used to stimulate the bone marrow to produce blood cells.  Hormone-blocking drugs interfere with the actions of estrogen or progesterone, which stimulate the growth of cancer cells that have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors.  Hormone-blocking drugs may be used when cancer cells have these receptors, sometimes instead of chemotherapy.  The benefits of hormone-blocking drugs are greatest when cancer cells have both estrogen and progesterone receptors and are almost as great when only estrogen receptors are present.  The benefit is minimal when only progesterone receptors are present.  Hormone-blocking drugs include Tamoxifen: Tamoxifen, given by mouth, is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator.  It binds with estrogen receptors and inhibits growth of breast tissue.  In women who have estrogen receptor–positive cancer, tamoxifen, taken for 5 years, increases the likelihood of survival by about 25%, and 10 years of treatment may be even more effective.  Tamoxifen, which is related to estrogen, has some of the benefits and risks of estrogen therapy Estrogens with or without a progestogen: Potential benefits and risks Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【25】 For example, it decreases the risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.  It may decrease the risk of osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely. \n【26】 However, it increases the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs.  It also increases the risk of developing cancer of the uterus Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer. \n【27】 Thus, if women taking tamoxifen have spotting or bleeding from the vagina, they should see their doctor.  However, the improvement in survival after breast cancer far outweighs the risk of endometrial cancer.  Tamoxifen, unlike estrogen therapy, may worsen the vaginal dryness or hot flashes that occur after menopause.  Aromatase inhibitors: These drugs (anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole) inhibit aromatase (an enzyme that converts some hormones to estrogen) and thus reduce the production of estrogen.  In postmenopausal women, these drugs may be more effective than tamoxifen.  Aromatase inhibitors may be given instead of tamoxifen or after tamoxifen treatment has been completed.  Aromatase inhibitors may increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.  Monoclonal antibodies are synthetic copies (or slightly modified versions) of natural substances that are part of the body’s immune system.  These drugs enhance the immune system’s ability to fight cancer. \n【28】 For ductal carcinoma in situ, treatment usually consists of one the following: A mastectomy Removal of the tumor and a large amount of surrounding normal tissue (wide excision) with or without radiation therapy Some women with ductal carcinoma in situ are also given hormone-blocking drugs as part of their treatment.  For lobular carcinoma in situ, treatment includes the following: Classic lobular carcinoma in situ: Surgical removal to check for cancer and, if no cancer is detected, close observation afterward and sometimes tamoxifen, raloxifene, or an aromatase inhibitor to reduce the risk of developing invasive cancer Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ: Surgery to remove the abnormal area and sometimes tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce the risk of developing invasive cancer Observation consists of a physical examination every 6 to 12 months for 5 years and once a year thereafter plus mammography once a year.  Although invasive breast cancer may develop, the invasive cancers that develop are usually not fast growing and can usually be treated effectively.  Furthermore, because invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for women with lobular carcinoma in situ is removal of both breasts ,bilateral mastectomy Diaphragms A contraceptive is something used for preventing pregnancy (birth control).  Barrier contraceptives are a type of birth control that works by keeping sperm from getting to an egg. \n【29】 Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option.  Women with lobular carcinoma in situ are often given tamoxifen, a hormone-blocking drug, for 5 years.  It reduces but does not eliminate the risk of developing invasive cancer.  Postmenopausal women may be given raloxifene or sometimes an aromatase inhibitor instead.  Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are a type of monoclonal antibody called anti-HER2 drugs.  They are used with chemotherapy to treat metastatic breast cancer only when the cancer cells have too many HER2 receptors.  These drugs bind with HER2 receptors and thus help prevent cancer cells from multiplying.  Sometimes both of these drugs are used.  Trastuzumab is usually taken for a year.  Both drugs can weaken the heart muscle.  So doctors monitor heart function during treatment.  Treatment of Early-Stage Invasive Cancer (Stages I and II) For breast cancers that are within the breast and may or may not have spread to nearby lymph nodes, treatment almost always includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.  One of the following may be done: Breast-conserving surgery, followed by radiation therapy Mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction The initial surgery may include axillary lymph node dissection Lymph node assessment Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably. \n【30】 Women may be given chemotherapy before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemotherapy).  If the tumor is attached to the chest wall, chemotherapy helps make removing the tumor possible.  Chemotherapy is also helpful if a breast cancer is large in relation to the rest of the breast.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the chances of having breast-conserving surgery.  Breast-conserving surgery is used only when the tumor is not too large because the entire tumor plus some of the surrounding normal tissue must be removed.  If the tumor is large, removing the tumor plus some surrounding normal tissue essentially results in removing most of the breast.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also considered for treatment of breast cancers that do not have receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 (called triple negative breast cancer) and cancers that have only HER2 receptors.  After surgery, women may be given chemotherapy, hormone-blocking drugs, anti-HER2 drugs, or a combination, depending on analysis of the tumor.  Treatment of Locally Advanced Cancer (Stage III) For breast cancers that have spread to more lymph nodes, the following may be done: Before surgery, drugs, usually chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy if the drug given before surgery makes removing the tumor possible After surgery, usually radiation therapy After surgery, chemotherapy, hormone-blocking drugs, or both Whether radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy or other drugs are used after surgery depends on many factors, such as the following: How large the tumor is Whether menopause has occurred Whether the tumor has receptors for hormones How many lymph nodes contain cancer cells Treatment of Cancer That Has Spread (Stage IV) Breast cancer that has spread beyond the lymph nodes is rarely cured, but most women who have it live at least 2 years, and a few live 10 to 20 years.  Treatment extends life only slightly but may relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.  However, some treatments have troublesome side effects.  Thus, deciding whether to be treated and, if so, which treatment to choose can be highly personal.  Choice of therapy depends on the following: Whether the cancer has estrogen and progesterone receptors How long the cancer had been in remission before it spread How many organs and how many parts of the body the cancer has spread to (where the metastases are) Whether the woman is postmenopausal or still menstruating If the cancer is causing symptoms (pain or other discomfort), women are usually treated with chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs.  Pain is usually treated with analgesics.  Other drugs may be given to relieve other symptoms.  Chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs are given to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.  Hormone-blocking drugs are preferred to chemotherapy when the cancer has the following characteristics: The cancer is estrogen receptor–positive.  Cancer has not recurred for more than 2 years after diagnosis and initial treatment.  Cancer is not immediately life threatening.  Different hormone-blocking drugs are used in different situations: Tamoxifen: For women who are still menstruating, tamoxifen is often the first hormone-blocking drug used.  Aromatase inhibitors: For postmenopausal women who have estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) may be more effective as a first treatment than tamoxifen.  Progestins: These drugs, such as medroxyprogesterone or megestrol, may be used after aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen when these drugs are no longer effective.  Fulvestrant: This drug may be used when tamoxifen is no longer effective.  It destroys the estrogen receptors in cancer cells.  Alternatively, for women who are still menstruating, surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation to destroy them, or drugs to inhibit their activity (such as buserelin, goserelin, or leuprolide) may be used to stop estrogen production.  These therapies may be used with tamoxifen.  Trastuzumab (a type of monoclonal antibody called an anti-HER2 drug) can be used to treat cancers that have too many HER2 receptors and that have spread throughout the body.  Trastuzumab can be used alone or with chemotherapy drugs (such as paclitaxel), with hormone-blocking drugs, or with pertuzumab (another anti-HER2 drug).  Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy plus pertuzumab slows the growth of breast cancers that have too many HER2 receptors and increases survival time more than trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.  Trastuzumab can also be used with hormone-blocking drugs to treat women who have estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer.  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as lapatinib and neratinib), another type of anti-HER drug, block the activity of HER2.  These drugs are being increasingly used in women with cancers that have too many HER2 receptors.  In some situations, radiation therapy may be used instead of or before drugs.  For example, if only one area of cancer is detected and that area is in a bone, radiation to that bone might be the only treatment used.  Radiation therapy is usually the most effective treatment for cancer that has spread to bone, sometimes keeping it in check for years.  It is also often the most effective treatment for cancer that has spread to the brain.  Surgery may be done to remove single tumors in other parts of the body (such as the brain) because such surgery can relieve symptoms.  Mastectomy (removing the breast) may be done to help relieve symptoms.  But it is unclear whether removing the breast helps prolong life when cancer has spread to other parts of the body and has been treated and controlled.  Bisphosphonates Drugs (used to treat osteoporosis), such as pamidronate or zoledronate, reduce bone pain and bone loss and may prevent or delay bone problems that can result when cancer spreads to bone.   Treatment of Specific Types of Breast Cancer For inflammatory breast cancer, treatment usually consists of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Mastectomy is usually done.  For Paget disease of the nipple, treatment is usually similar to that of other types of breast cancer.  It often involves simple mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus removal of the lymph nodes.  Less commonly, only the nipple with some surrounding normal tissue is removed.  If another breast cancer is also present, treatment is based on that type of breast cancer.  For phyllodes tumors, treatment usually consists of removing the tumor and a large amount of surrounding normal tissue (at least 1 centimeter (0. 4 inch) around the tumor)—called a wide margin.  If the tumor is large in relation to the breast, a simple mastectomy may be done to remove the tumor plus wide margins.  Whether phyllodes tumors recur depends on how wide the tumor-free margins are and whether the phyllodes tumor is noncancerous or cancerous.  Cancerous phyllodes tumors can metastasize to distant sites, such as the lungs, bone, or brain.  Recommendations for treatment of metastatic phyllodes tumors are evolving, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be useful.  Preservation of Fertility Women should not become pregnant while being treated for breast cancer.  If women wish to have children (preserve fertility) after being treated, they are referred to a reproductive endocrinologist before treatment is started.  These women can then find out about the effect of different chemotherapy drugs on fertility and about procedures that may enable them to have children after treatment.  Options to preserve fertility include assisted reproductive techniques Assisted Reproductive Technologies Assisted reproductive technologies involve working with sperm and eggs or embryos in a laboratory (in vitro) with the goal of producing a pregnancy. \n【31】 Choice of the procedure to be used to preserve fertility depends on the following: Type of breast cancer treatment that is planned The woman's preferences Assisted reproductive techniques involve use of hormonal drugs.  Doctors discuss the risks and benefits of having these treatments with women who have estrogen or progesterone receptor–positive cancer.  Follow-up Care After the first phases of treatment are completed, follow-up physical examinations, including examination of the breasts, chest, neck, and armpits, are usually done every year.  Regular mammograms and breast self-examinations are also important.  Women should promptly report certain symptoms to their doctor: Any lumps or other changes in their breasts Changes in nipples or a discharge Pain—for example in the arm or spine Swelling in the armpit Loss of appetite or weight Chest pain Chronic dry cough Bleeding from the vagina (if not associated with menstrual periods) Severe headaches Blurred vision Dizziness or balance problems Numbness or weakness Any symptoms that seem unusual or that persist Diagnostic procedures, such as chest x-rays, blood tests, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT), are not needed unless symptoms suggest the cancer has recurred.  The effects of treatment for breast cancer cause many changes in a woman’s life.  Support from family members and friends can help, as can support groups.  Counseling may be helpful.  End-of-Life Issues For women with metastatic breast cancer, quality of life may deteriorate, and the chances that further treatment will prolong life may be small.  Staying comfortable may eventually become more important than trying to prolong life.  Cancer pain Many fatal illnesses cause similar symptoms, including pain, shortness of breath, digestive problems, incontinence, skin breakdown, and fatigue. \n【32】 So if women are having pain, they should ask their doctor for treatment to relieve it.  Treatments can also relieve other troublesome symptoms, such as constipation, difficulty breathing, and nausea.  Psychologic and spiritual counseling may also help.  Women with metastatic breast cancer should prepare advance directives Advance Directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions. \n【33】 Also, making or updating a will is important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis requires specific clinical criteria and imaging of the affected organ.  Treatment is symptomatic or, if central nervous system tumors are growing, drug therapy with sirolimus or everolimus.  Patients must be monitored regularly to check for complications.  Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous syndrome that occurs in 1 of 6000 children; 85% of cases involve mutations in the TSC1 gene (9q34), which controls the production of hamartin, or the TSC2 gene (16p13. 3), which controls the production of tuberin.  These proteins act as growth suppressors.  If either parent has the disorder, children have a 50% risk of having it.  However, new mutations account for two thirds of cases.  Patients with TSC have tumors or abnormalities that manifest at different ages and in multiple organs, including the Brain Heart Eyes Kidneys Lungs Skin Central nervous system (CNS) tubers interrupt neural circuits, causing developmental delay and cognitive impairment and may cause seizures, including infantile spasms Infantile Spasms Infantile spasms are seizures characterized by sudden flexion of the arms, forward flexion of the trunk, extension of the legs, and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography. \n【1】 Sometimes the tubers grow and obstruct flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the lateral ventricles, causing unilateral hydrocephalus is accumulation of excessive amounts of CSF, causing cerebral ventricular enlargement and/or increased intracranial pressure. \n【2】 Sometimes tubers undergo malignant degeneration into gliomas are primary tumors that originate in brain parenchyma.  Symptoms are diverse and vary by location, manifesting as focal neurologic deficits, encephalopathy, or seizures. \n【3】 Diagnosis is based on MRI.  Treament is a combination of surgical resection and chemotherapy. \n【4】 Cardiac rhabdomyomas may develop prenatally, sometimes causing heart failure in neonates.  These rhabdomyomas tend to disappear over time and usually do not cause symptoms later in childhood or in adulthood.  Kidney tumors (angiolipomas) may develop in adults, and polycystic kidney disease Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure. \n【5】 Kidney disease may cause hypertension.  Pulmonary lesions, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an indolent, progressive growth of smooth muscle cells throughout the lungs, pulmonary blood vessels, lymphatics, and pleurae. \n【6】 Symptoms and Signs of TSC Manifestations vary greatly in severity.  Skin lesions are typically present.  Infants with CNS lesions may present with a type of seizure called infantile spasms Infantile Spasms Infantile spasms are seizures characterized by sudden flexion of the arms, forward flexion of the trunk, extension of the legs, and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography. \n【7】 Retinal achromic patches as well as retinal hamartomas are common and may be visible with funduscopy.  Pitting of enamel in permanent teeth is common.  Skin findings include Initially pale, ash leaf–shaped macules, which develop during infancy or early childhood Angiofibromas of the face (adenoma sebaceum), which develop during later childhood Congenital shagreen patches (raised lesions resembling an orange peel), usually on the back Subcutaneous nodules Café-au-lait spots Subungual fibromas, which can develop any time during childhood or early adulthood Skin Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Ash-Leaf Spots in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Ash-leaf spots are depigmented areas present in > 90% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.  The areas are 1 to 3 cm in length and may be more easily seen under ultraviolet light (Wood light).  \n【8】 Café-au-Lait Spot A café-au-lait spot is a hyperpigmented (brownish or coffee-colored) macule.   Koenen Tumors in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Koenen tumors are periungual and subungual fibromas (reddish to flesh-colored papules emerging from nail folds) in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. \n【9】 A definite diagnosis of TSC by these criteria requires either of the following: The identification of either a TSC1 or TSC2 pathogenic mutation by molecular genetic testing Two major features or 1 major feature with ≥ 2 minor features A possible diagnosis of TSC by these criteria requires the following: Either 1 major feature or ≥ 2 minor features  Physical examination is done to check for typical skin lesions.  Funduscopy should be done to check for retinal achromic patches.  TSC may be suspected when fetal ultrasonography detects cardiac rhabdomyomas or when infantile spasms occur.  Cardiac or cranial manifestations may be visible on routine prenatal ultrasonography.  MRI or ultrasonography of the affected organs is necessary for confirmation.  Specific genetic testing is available. \n【10】 Prognosis for TSC Prognosis depends on symptom severity.  Infants with mild symptoms generally do well and live long, productive lives; infants with severe symptoms may have serious disabilities.  Regardless of severity, most children show continued developmental progress.  Treatment of TSC Symptomatic treatment Sirolimus or everolimus Treatment of TSC is both symptomatic and specific: For seizures: Antiseizure drugs  or sometimes epilepsy surgery For skin lesions: Dermabrasion or laser techniques For neurobehavioral problems: Behavior management techniques or drugs For hypertension caused by renal problems: Antihypertensives or surgery to remove growing tumors For developmental delays: Special schooling or occupational therapy For malignant tumors and some of the benign tumors: Everolimus or sirolimus Although so far they are approved only for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are central nervous system tumors that develop from astrocytes.  Diagnosis is based on MRI. \n【11】 These drugs have been shown in some patients to shrink brain tubers, cardiac rhabdomyomas that are too large to be resected, and facial lesions and to lessen seizures.  Topical sirolimus may be helpful for facial angiofibromas ,1 Treatment reference Tuberous sclerosis complex is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder in which tumors (usually hamartomas) develop in multiple organs. \n【12】 Studies using these drugs for these and other complications of TSC are ongoing.  Genetic counseling is indicated for adolescents and adults of childbearing age.  Screening for complications All patients should be screened regularly to detect complications of TSC early.  Typically, the following is done: MRI of the head to check for intracranial complications (eg, SEGAs) at least every 3 years Renal ultrasonography or MRI of the abdomen to check for kidney tumors every 3 years in school-aged children and every 1 to 2 years for life in affected adults In girls ≥ 18 years, screening for exertional dyspnea and shortness of breath annually and high-resolution CT every 5 to 10 years to screen for lymphangioleiomyomatosis Neuropsychologic testing periodically and behavioral screening in children to help plan for support at school and behavioral interventions Echocardiography at least every 3 years for asymptomatic children and adolescents with cardiac rhabdomyomas Regular monitoring must be continued until cardiac rhabdomyomas have regressed.  Clinical monitoring is also important and sometimes prompts more frequent testing.

Sudden cardiac death may occur.  The ion channels affected include those responsible for the inward sodium or calcium currents and those responsible for the outward potassium current.  Either gain of function or loss of function in these ion channels, particularly when the abnormal channels are unevenly distributed, fosters abnormal electrophysiological environments.  The abnormal electrophysiology may be favorable to one or both of the following: Failure of impulse formation or conduction, which may lead to bradyarrhythmias Re-entry and mechanisms of abnormal automaticity, leading to tachyarrhythmias The most common genetic channelopathies are the Brugada syndrome (BrS) Brugada Syndrome Brugada syndrome is an inherited channelopathy causing an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) leading to syncope and sudden death.   Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. \n【1】 It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes. \n【2】 Together, these genetic channelopathies account for approximately 10% of sudden cardiac deaths.  Autoimmune disorders, including Sjogren syndrome Sjögren Syndrome Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【3】 Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies may produce a long QT interval syndrome by inhibiting the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) related outward potassium channel, and transplacental exposure to these antibodies in utero is responsible for congenital AV block.  Autoimmune antibody production and inflammatory cytokinins may also be responsible for temporal variability in arrhythmia propensities, such as the deleterious effects of fever in patients with Brugada syndrome.  Diagnostic evaluation for genetic channelopathies usually includes ECG, ambulatory cardiac monitoring, and sometimes exercise testing.  Genetic testing is frequently done but may not be recommended if its sensitivity for a particular disorder is low.  Patients diagnosed with a channelopathy should have regular follow-up with ECG and ambulatory cardiac monitoring to detect occult arrhythmias.  Family members are at risk of disease and should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia), ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and, sometimes, exercise testing to identify the presence of disease prior to its expression as sudden death.  Genetic testing of family members is done when the index case has a known mutation.  Typically, parents and siblings are tested first and then other relatives are tested based on results of parent testing and the mode of inheritance (cascade testing).  Family members also require ongoing clinical monitoring for development of arrhythmias unless the genetic mutation is absent.  Treatments depend on disease manifestations, but all patients should avoid known triggers (eg, exercise, certain drugs).  Patients with clinical or ECG findings of significant ventricular arrhythmias typically require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.

{"seq_id": "c13577aa-a7d0-48eb-b484-bfecd32e085a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Human African trypanosomiasis is infection with protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly.  Symptoms include characteristic skin lesions, intermittent fever, headache, rigors, transient edema, generalized lymphadenopathy, and often fatal meningoencephalitis.  Diagnosis is by identification of the organism in blood, lymph node aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid or sometimes by serologic tests.  Treatment is with fexinidazole, suramin, pentamidine, melarsoprol, or eflornithine, depending on the infecting subspecies, clinical stage, and drug availability.  Human African trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West and Central Africa and by T.  brucei rhodesiense in East Africa; both species are endemic in Uganda.  Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 98% of all cases of African trypanosomiasis, and T.  brucei rhodesiense accounts for 2%.  African trypanosomiasis has been targeted for eradication by the World Health Organization (WHO) and, as a result of control efforts, there has been a dramatic decrease (> 95%) in the number of reported cases worldwide.  In 2021, approximately 800 combined cases were reported to the WHO, with over 90% caused by T.  b.  gambiense .  On average, 1 case is diagnosed in the US each year, always in travelers returning to the US from endemic regions.  The organisms are transmitted by tsetse flies and can be transmitted prenatally from mother to fetus.  Rarely, the infection is transmitted through blood transfusions; theoretically, it could be transmitted through organ transplantation. \n【1】 Pathophysiology of African Trypanosomiasis Metacyclic trypomastigotes inoculated by tsetse flies transform into bloodstream trypomastigotes, which multiply by binary fission and spread through the lymphatics and bloodstream after inoculation.  Bloodstream trypomastigotes multiply until specific antibodies produced by the host sharply reduce parasite levels.  However, a subset of parasites escape immune destruction by a change in their variant surface glycoprotein and start a new multiplication cycle.  The cycle of multiplication and lysis repeats.  Late in the course of African trypanosomiasis, trypanosomes appear in the interstitial fluid of many organs, including the myocardium and eventually the central nervous system.  The cycle is continued when a tsetse fly bites an infected human or animal.  Humans are the main reservoir of T.  gambiense, but this species may also reside in animals.  Wild game animals are the main reservoir of T.  rhodesiense.  Symptoms and Signs of African Trypanosomiasis African trypanosomiasis has 3 stages: Cutaneous Hemolymphatic Central nervous system Cutaneous A papule may develop at the site of the tsetse fly bite within a few days to 2 weeks.  It evolves into a red, painful, indurated nodule that may ulcerate (trypanosomal chancre).  Hemolymphatic Over several months in T.  gambiense infection but a period of weeks with T.  rhodesiense, intermittent fever, headaches, rigors, muscle and joint pain, and transient facial swelling develop.  An evanescent, circinate erythematous rash may develop.  It is most readily visible in light-skinned patients.  Generalized lymphadenopathy often occurs.  Winterbottom sign (enlarged lymph nodes in the posterior cervical triangle) is characteristic with T.  gambiense sleeping sickness.  Central nervous system (CNS) In the Gambian form, CNS involvement occurs months to several years after onset of acute disease.  In the Rhodesian form, disease is more fulminant, and CNS invasion often occurs within a few weeks.  CNS involvement can result in persistent headache, inability to concentrate, personality changes (eg, progressive lassitude and indifference), daytime somnolence, tremor, ataxia, and terminal coma.  Without treatment, death occurs within months of disease onset with T.  rhodesiense and during the 2nd or 3rd year with T.  Untreated patients die in coma of undernutrition or secondary infections.  Diagnosis of African Trypanosomiasis Light microscopy of blood (thin or thick smears) or other fluid sample Diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis is made by identifying trypanosomes in fluid from a chancre, lymph node aspirate, blood, bone marrow aspirate, or, during the late stage of infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  Preferred sources are blood smears for T.  rhodesiense and fluid aspirated from an enlarged lymph node for T.  Wet preparations should be examined for motile trypanosomes, and smears should be fixed, stained with Giemsa (or Field) stain, and examined.  The concentration of trypanosomes in blood is often low, and concentration techniques (eg, centrifugation, miniature anion-exchange centrifugation, quantitative buffy coat technique) enhance sensitivity.  Antibody detection assays are not very useful clinically because seroconversion occurs after the onset of symptoms.  However, a card agglutination test for T.  gambiense is useful in mass screening programs to identify candidates for microscopic examination. \n【2】 When CSF is involved, opening pressure may be increased, and CSF has elevated levels of lymphocytes (≥ 6 cells/mcL), total protein, and nonspecific IgM.  In addition to trypanosomes, characteristic Mott cells (plasma cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles that contain immunoglobulin [Russell bodies]) may be present.  Other, nonspecific laboratory findings include anemia, monocytosis, and markedly elevated serum levels of polyclonal IgM.  Treatment of African Trypanosomiasis Treatment of African trypanosomiasis is guided by species and stage of disease.  Without CNS involvement, fexinidazole or, alternatively, pentamidine for T.  gambiense; suramin for T.  rhodesiense With CNS involvement, fexinidazole for nonsevere T.  gambiense; eflornithine (if available) alone or in combination with nifurtimox, or melarsoprol (if eflornithine is not available), for severe T.  gambiense; melarsoprol for T.  rhodesiense Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere T.  gambiense, with or without CNS involvement.   Fexinidazole is taken orally once a day for 10 days at the following doses: For patients ≥ 35 kg: 1800 mg/day in the loading phase (4 days), followed by 1200 mg/day in the maintenance phase (6 days) For patients 20 to 34 kg: 1200 mg/day in the loading phase (4 days), followed by 600 mg/day in the maintenance phase (6 days) Criteria for outpatient treatment with fexinidazole include reliable adherence to dosing, absence of psychiatric disorders, and body weight ≥ 35 kg.  Criteria for inpatient treatment includes any of the following characteristics: Body weight < 35 kg At risk for poor compliance History of psychiatric disorders (to monitor for neuropsychiatric reactions) Patients with signs and symptoms of severe disease should be evaluated by lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination.  Patients with severe disease (white blood cell count ≥ 100 cells/microL in CSF), where lumbar puncture is not feasible, or who cannot be treated with fexinidazole should be treated as outlined below.  Without central nervous system (CNS) involvement Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere T.  Pentamidine and suramin are effective against bloodstream stages of both T.  brucei subspecies but do not cross the blood-brain barrier and are not useful for CNS infection.  Pentamidine is used for T.  gambiense in patients not treated with fexinidazole.  Suramin is the only drug effective for the hemolymphatic stage of T.  Suramin is not used to treat T.  gambiense, because although potentially effective, it has been associated with adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia, hyperesthesias, peripheral neuropathy, nephrotoxicity, urticaria, and pruritus.  Also, serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur in patients co-infected with Onchocerca volvulus, which is endemic in many areas of West Africa where T.  The dosage of pentamidine is 4 mg/kg IM or IV once a day for 7 to 10 days.  An initial test dose of suramin (available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) 100 mg IV (to exclude hypersensitivity) is followed by 20 mg/kg (up to 1 g) IV on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21.  With central nervous system (CNS) involvement Fexinidazole is the first-choice treatment for nonsevere disease with CNS involvement due to T.  When available, eflornithine 100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 14 days is used for severe disease with CNS involvement due to T.  gambiense ,eflornithine is ineffective for T.  WHO recommends eflornithine 200 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for 7 days in combination with nifurtimox 5 mg/kg orally 3 times a day for 10 days .  Eflornithine (100 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 14 days) monotherapy may be given when nifurtimox is unavailable or contraindicated and when fexinidazole cannot be given.  Adverse effects of eflornithine include gastrointestinal symptoms, bone marrow suppression, and seizures.  Common adverse effects of nifurtimox are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, polyneuropathy, headache, dizziness, and vertigo.  Melarsoprol, an organic arsenical, is often used in African countries because of the limited availability of eflornithine, even though adverse effects can be severe and life threatening.  Melarsoprol dosage is as follows: For T. 2 mg/kg (maximum dose 180 mg) IV once a day for 10 days For T. 6 mg/kg IV once a day for 3 days; after 7 days, 3. 6 mg/kg once a day for 3 days, followed 7 days later by another 3-day course at this dose In the US, eflornithine, nifurtimox, and melarsoprol can be obtained from the CDC.  Alternative regimens have been proposed for debilitated patients with severe CNS involvement.  Serial follow-up examinations, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, are recommended every 6 months (sooner if symptoms return) for 2 years.  Serious adverse effects of melarsoprol include encephalopathic reactions, exfoliative dermatitis, cardiovascular toxicity (hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure), and the gastrointestinal and renal toxicity of arsenicals.  Corticosteroids have been used to decrease the risk of encephalopathic reactions.  There is no test of cure.  After treatment, patients should be monitored for relapse for 24 months.  Recurrence of symptoms necessitates re-examination of CSF for parasites. \n【3】Prevention of African Trypanosomiasis Prevention of African trypanosomiasis includes avoiding endemic areas and protecting against tsetse flies.  Visitors to game parks should wear substantial wrist- and ankle-length clothing (tsetse flies bite through thin clothes) in neutral colors that blend with the background and should use insect repellents, although efficacy of repellents against tsetse flies may be limited.  Pentamidine can help prevent T.  gambiense infection, but it may damage pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin release and hypoglycemia followed later by diabetes; thus, it is no longer used for prophylaxis.  Key Points African trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West and Central Africa and by T.  rhodesiense in East Africa; tsetse flies are the main vector.  There are 3 stages of disease: cutaneous, hemolymphatic, and CNS (sleeping sickness).  Diagnose using light microscopy of blood (thin or thick smears) or another fluid sample.  Treatment of African trypanosomiasis varies by species and stage of disease.  With CNS involvement, use fexinidazole for nonsevere T.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The extracellular matrix is overproduced, degraded deficiently, or both. \n【1】 Cirrhosis is characterized by regenerative nodules surrounded by dense fibrotic tissue.  Symptoms may not develop for years and are often nonspecific (eg, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss).  Late manifestations include portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein.  It is caused most often by cirrhosis (in North America), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. \n【2】 The most common cause is portal hypertension.

Diagnosis is clinical. \n【4】 Diagnosis is usually made using noninvasive imaging, although liver biopsy is required on rare occasions.  Management involves supportive care and treatment of the causative liver disease.  Cirrhosis is the 14th leading cause of death worldwide.  Etiology of Cirrhosis The causes of cirrhosis are the same as those of fibrosis .  In high-resource countries, most cases result from chronic alcohol abuse Alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant.  Large amounts consumed rapidly can cause respiratory depression, coma, and death. \n【5】 It is often asymptomatic until manifestations of chronic liver disease occur. \n【6】 In parts of Asia and Africa, cirrhosis often results from endemic chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B, Chronic Hepatitis B is a common cause of chronic hepatitis.  Patients may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific manifestations such as fatigue and malaise.  Diagnosis is by serologic testing. \n【7】 Cirrhosis of unknown etiology (cryptogenic cirrhosis) is becoming less common as many specific causes (eg, chronic hepatitis C, NASH) are identified. \n【8】 Pathophysiology of Cirrhosis There are 2 primary ingredients: Hepatic fibrosis Regenerating liver cells In response to injury and loss, growth regulators induce hepatocellular hyperplasia (producing regenerating nodules) and arterial growth (angiogenesis).  Among the growth regulators are cytokines and hepatic growth factors (eg, epithelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor).  Insulin, glucagon, and patterns of intrahepatic blood flow determine how and where nodules develop.  Angiogenesis produces new vessels within the fibrous sheath that surrounds nodules.  These vessels connect the hepatic artery and portal vein to hepatic venules, restoring the intrahepatic circulatory pathways.  Such interconnecting vessels provide relatively low-volume, high-pressure venous drainage that cannot accommodate as much blood volume as normal.  As a result, portal vein pressure increases.  Such distortions in blood flow contribute to portal hypertension, which increases because the regenerating nodules compress hepatic venules.  The progression rate from fibrosis to cirrhosis and the morphology of cirrhosis vary from person to person.  Presumably, the reason for such variation is the extent of exposure to the injurious stimulus and the individual’s response.  Complications Portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein. \n【9】 The manifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding. \n【10】 Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.  It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathic. \n【11】 Portopulmonary hypertension can manifest with symptoms of heart failure.  Complications of portal hypertension tend to cause significant morbidity and mortality.  Cirrhosis can cause other cardiovascular complications.  Vasodilation, intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting, and ventilation/perfusion mismatch can result in hypoxia (hepatopulmonary syndrome). \n【12】 Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by asterixis, confusion, or hepatic coma and is the result of the liver's inability to metabolize the toxins from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Elevated serum ammonia level may help the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, but the level does not correlate well with the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.  Hepatocytes secrete less bile, contributing to cholestasis and jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia. \n【13】 Less bile in the intestine causes malabsorption of dietary fat (triglycerides) and fat-soluble vitamins.  Malabsorption of vitamin D may contribute to osteoporosis.  Undernutrition and sarcopenia are common.  They may result from anorexia with reduced food intake or, in patients with alcoholic liver disease Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol consumption is high in most Western countries.  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), 8. \n【14】 Blood disorders are common.  Anemia usually results from hypersplenism, chronic GI bleeding, folate deficiency Folate Deficiency Folate deficiency is common.  It may result from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or use of various drugs. \n【15】 Cirrhosis results in decreased production of prothrombotic and antithrombotic factors.  Hypersplenism and altered expression of thrombopoietin contribute to thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia and decreased production of clotting factors can make clotting unpredictable, increasing risk of both bleeding and thromboembolic disease (even though international normalized ratio [INR] is usually increased).  Leukopenia Overview of Leukopenias Leukopenia is a reduction in the circulating white blood cell (WBC) count to < 4000/mcL (9/L). \n【16】  Hypersplenism is a secondary process that can arise from splenomegaly of almost any cause .  The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis from specific etiologies are listed below : Chronic hepatitis B Overview of Chronic Hepatitis Chronic hepatitis is hepatitis that lasts > 6 months. \n【17】5 to 1 mg/day from menses. \n【18】 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), 8.  Hepatic or neurologic symptoms develop. \n【19】 Incompletely formed liver nodules, nodules without fibrosis (nodular regenerative hyperplasia), and congenital hepatic fibrosis (ie, widespread fibrosis without regenerating nodules) are not true cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis can be micronodular or macronodular.  Micronodular cirrhosis is characterized by uniformly small nodules (< 3 mm in diameter) and thick regular bands of connective tissue.  Typically, nodules lack lobular organization; terminal (central) hepatic venules and portal triads are distorted.  With time, macronodular cirrhosis often develops.  The nodules vary in size (3 mm to 5 cm in diameter) and have some relatively normal lobular organization of portal triads and terminal hepatic venules.  Broad fibrous bands of varying thickness surround the large nodules.  Collapse of the normal hepatic architecture is suggested by the concentration of portal triads within the fibrous scars.  Mixed cirrhosis (incomplete septal cirrhosis) combines elements of micronodular and macronodular cirrhosis.  Differentiation between these morphologic types of cirrhosis has limited clinical value. \n【20】 Symptoms and Signs of Cirrhosis may be asymptomatic for years as long as it is compensated.  Often, the first symptoms are nonspecific; they include generalized fatigue (due to cytokine release), anorexia, malaise, and weight loss .  The liver is typically palpable and firm, with a blunt edge, but is sometimes small and difficult to palpate.  Nodules usually are not palpable.  Clinical signs that suggest a chronic liver disorder or chronic alcohol use but are not specific for cirrhosis include muscle wasting, palmar erythema, parotid gland enlargement, white nails, clubbing, Dupuytren contracture, spider angiomas, gynecomastia, axillary hair loss, testicular atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy.  Once any complication of cirrhosis develops, additional decompensation (characterized by gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy) is much more likely.   Diagnosis of Cirrhosis Liver blood tests, coagulation tests, complete blood count (CBC), and serologic tests for viral causes Conventional liver imaging tests: Ultrasonography, CT, MRI Noninvasive imaging assessment of fibrosis: Transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, two-dimensional shear wave elastography, magnetic resonance elastography +/- proton density fat fraction Identification of cause based on clinical evaluation, routine testing for common causes, and selective testing for less common causes Sometimes liver biopsy (eg, when clinical and noninvasive tests are inconclusive, or when biopsy results may change management) General approach Cirrhosis is suspected in patients with manifestations of any of its complications , particularly portal hypertension or ascites.  Ascites is free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.  The most common cause is portal hypertension. \n【21】 Testing seeks to detect cirrhosis and any complications and to determine its cause. \n【22】 Laboratory tests alone may increase suspicion for cirrhosis but cannot confirm or exclude it.  Test results may be normal or may indicate nonspecific abnormalities.  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels are often modestly elevated, but they can be normal.  Alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are often normal; elevated levels indicate cholestasis or biliary obstruction. \n【23】 Decreased serum albumin and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) directly reflect impaired hepatic synthesis—usually an end-stage event.  Albumin can also be low when nutrition is poor.  Anemia is common and usually normocytic with a high red blood cell distribution width (RDW).  Anemia is often multifactorial; contributing factors may include chronic gastrointestinal bleeding Overview of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can originate anywhere from the mouth to the anus and can be overt or occult.  The manifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding. folate deficiency Folate Deficiency Folate deficiency is common. \n【24】 Diagnostic imaging Conventional imaging tests are not highly sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of cirrhosis by themselves, but they can often detect its complications.  Noninvasive imaging studies (eg, transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, two-dimensional shear wave elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography) are useful in detection of early cirrhosis when conventional imaging findings are equivocal and portal hypertension is not evident.  In advanced cirrhosis, ultrasonography shows a small, nodular liver.  Ultrasonography also detects portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein. \n【25】 CT and MRI with and without contrast can detect a nodular texture, varices, portal/splenic vein thrombosis, and delineate a liver lesion suspect for hepatocellular carcinoma.  Radionuclide liver scans using technetium-99m sulfur colloid may show irregular liver uptake and increased spleen and bone marrow uptake, but it has limited use in contemporary practice.  Identification of the cause Determining the specific cause of cirrhosis requires key clinical information from the history and examination, as well as selective testing.  Alcohol is the likely cause in patients with a documented history of alcoholism and laboratory findings of AST higher than ALT (especially AST/ALT ratio > 2), elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and macrocytic anemia from B12 and folic acid deficiency Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias Megaloblastic anemias result most often from deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate.  Ineffective hematopoiesis affects all cell lines but particularly red blood cells. \n【26】 Fever, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice suggest the presence of acute alcoholic hepatitis Pathology .  Detecting serum antibody to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) and HCV-RNA indicates hepatitis C.  Detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBcAb) confirms chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B, Chronic Hepatitis B is a common cause of chronic hepatitis. \n【27】 Chronic hepatitis B with very low HBV viral load can occur in HBV/HDV co-infection.  Most clinicians also routinely test for the following: Autoimmune hepatitis: Suggested by a high antinuclear antibody titer (a low titer is nonspecific and does not always mandate further evaluation) and confirmed by hypergammaglobulinemia (IgG) and the presence of other autoantibodies (eg, anti–smooth muscle or anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies) Hemochromatosis Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron (Fe) accumulation that results in tissue damage.  Strictures and dilations of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, seen on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).  Decreased serum ceruloplasmin and characteristic copper test results suggest Wilson disease Wilson Disease Wilson disease results in accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs. \n【28】 The presence of obesity and a history of diabetes suggest nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes. \n【29】 Liver biopsy is invasive and is subject to sampling error, but it remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of cirrhosis.  Liver biopsy is required in the following situations: If clinical criteria and noninvasive testing are inconclusive for diagnosis of cirrhosis or its etiology (for example, if well-compensated cirrhosis is suspected clinically and imaging findings are inconclusive) To confirm certain causes of cirrhosis (eg, amyloidosis, PBC, or small duct PSC) To assess the severity and/or activity of some causes of cirrhosis (eg, autoimmune hepatitis) in order to direct the intensity of treatment.  To confirm cirrhosis for certain disorders for which noninvasive imaging for fibrosis assessment has not been validated (eg, pregnancy, congestive hepatopathy, and rare liver disorders) In obvious cases of cirrhosis with marked coagulopathy, portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein. \n【30】 In patients with ascites, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia, the transjugular approach to biopsy is safest.  When this approach is used, pressures can be measured and thus the trans-sinusoidal pressure gradient can be calculated.  Monitoring All patients with cirrhosis, regardless of cause, should be screened regularly for hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is common in areas where infection with hepatitis B and C viruses is prevalent. \n【31】 Currently, abdominal ultrasonography with or without serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended every 6 months, and if abnormalities suspect for HCC are detected, contrast-enhanced MRI or triple-phase CT of the abdomen (pre-contrast, arterial phase, and venous phase) should be done.  Certain features in contrast imaging (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System 5 criteria, including early arterial enhancement, washout in portal phase, enhancing capsule) can confirm HCC, sparing the patient a biopsy.  Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography appears promising as an alternative to CT or MRI but is still under study.  Upper endoscopy to check for gastroesophageal varices are dilated veins in the distal esophagus or proximal stomach caused by elevated pressure in the portal venous system, typically from cirrhosis. \n【32】 It is caused most often by cirrhosis (in North America), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. \n【33】 Positive findings may mandate treatment (nonselective beta blockade with carvedilol, nadolol, or propranolol, or endoscopic banding) or more frequent endoscopic monitoring.  Prognosis for Cirrhosis Prognosis is often unpredictable.  It depends on factors such as etiology, severity, presence of complications, comorbid conditions, host factors, and effectiveness of therapy.  Cirrhosis was considered irreversible, but more recent evidence suggests it is reversible.  Patients who continue to drink alcohol, even small amounts, have a very poor prognosis.  Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification for severity of liver disease The Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring system uses clinical and laboratory information to stratify disease severity, surgical risk, and overall prognosis .  The Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring system does, however, have limitations; for example, assessments of the severity of ascites is free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. \n【34】  Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) In contrast to the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score estimates the severity of end-stage liver disease, regardless of cause, based solely on objective results of laboratory tests: serum creatinine, serum total bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR).  The MELD score is used to determine allocation of available organs to liver transplant Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation. \n【35】 Variations of the MELD score are sometimes used for other purposes (eg, to estimate risk of 90-day mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, to predict risk of postoperative mortality in patients with cirrhosis).  A variation of the MELD score that incorporates serum sodium measurement (MELD-Na) more accurately predicts mortality in cirrhotic patients than the conventional MELD score, and is now used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) to prioritize patients on the liver transplant waiting list.   In 2019, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) implemented a major policy update on how the MELD exception (eg, HCC, hepatopulmonary syndrome) is handled.  Under the new policy, patients are awarded a fixed MELD-Na score based on the Median MELD at Transplant (MMaT) in their region (which has a radius of 250 nautical miles), regardless of their waiting time.  Pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score For patients < 12 years, the corresponding pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score is calculated.  Higher PELD scores predict higher risk.  Treatment of Cirrhosis Supportive care In general, treatment is supportive and includes stopping injurious drugs, providing nutrition (including supplemental vitamins), and treating the underlying disorders and complications.  Doses of drugs metabolized in the liver should be reduced.  All alcohol and hepatotoxic substances must be avoided.  Withdrawal symptoms during hospitalization should be anticipated in patients who have cirrhosis and have continued to abuse alcohol.  Patients should be vaccinated against viral hepatitis A and B Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. \n【36】 Patients with varices need therapy to prevent bleeding , schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. \n【37】 No evidence supports treating small esophageal varices.  Medium and large esophageal varices should be treated prophylactically with nonselective beta-blockers or endoscopic banding (ligation).  If gastric varices are not amenable to endoscopic banding and do not respond to nonselective beta-blockers, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration or endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection may be used.  Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting Treatment (TIPS) should be considered if patients have complications of portal hypertension that are refractory to standard treatments, including ascites and recurrent variceal bleeding.  TIPS is relatively contraindicated in patients with heart failure, moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension, or hepatic encephalopathy.  Patients with high MELD scores (> 18) have a higher risk of mortality after TIPS.  Liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation. \n【38】 Risk of death without liver transplantation begins to exceed risks of transplantation (eg, perioperative complications, chronic immunosuppression) when the MELD score is more than about 15.  Thus, if the score is ≥ 15, if patient's HCC meets the criteria for MELD exception point, or if cirrhosis has decompensated clinically, patients should be referred to a transplantation center.  Key Points Morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis usually result from its complications (eg, complications of portal hypertension, liver failure, hematologic problems).  Do liver biopsy if a clear diagnosis would lead to better management and outcome.  Evaluate all patients with cirrhosis for autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, as well as for the more common causes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcoholic and viral hepatitis.  Monitor all patients periodically for clinically significant portal hypertension/gastroesophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma, doing testing as clinically indicated.  Predict prognosis using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring systems, and refer patients with a MELD score ≥ 15 to be evaluated for a liver transplant.

Diagnosis is suggested by pain out of proportion to tissue injury, dysesthesia (eg, burning, tingling), and signs of nerve injury detected during neurologic examination.  Treatment is often with adjuvant drugs rather than analgesics (eg, antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, baclofen, topical drugs) or with nondrug treatments (eg, physical therapy, neuromodulation).   Pain can develop after injury to any level of the nervous system, peripheral or central; the sympathetic nervous system may be involved (causing sympathetically maintained pain).  Specific syndromes include Postherpetic neuralgia Herpes zoster is infection that results when varicella-zoster virus reactivates from its latent state in a posterior dorsal root ganglion. \n【1】 Peripheral nerve injury or dysfunction can result in neuropathic pain.  Examples are Mononeuropathies Single mononeuropathies are characterized by sensory disturbances and weakness in the distribution of the affected peripheral nerve. \n【2】 These changes reduce the threshold for activation and increase the response to noxious stimuli.  In chronic states, the peripheral nerve continuously triggers nociceptive ectopic signals to the CNS.  This bombardment of continuous peripheral nociceptive input leads to changes in receptive nociceptors (central sensitization); they are primed, interpret pain from minor stimuli (including nonpainful stimuli [allodynia]) as substantial pain, and interpret that pain as coming from a wider area than it is.  These changes can be reversed, at least for a time, if the peripheral nociceptive input can be interrupted.  Central neuropathic pain syndromes (pain caused by dysfunction of somatosensory pathways in the CNS) can result from any CNS lesion, but these syndromes most commonly occur after stroke, result from spinal cord injury, or are associated with a multiple sclerosis demyelinating plaque.  To be considered central neuropathic pain, the pain must occur in the area clinically affected by the CNS lesion; however, it does not need to involve the entire affected area.  Central neuropathic pain develops only if the spinothalamic tract (pinprick, temperature sensation) malfunctions.  If pinprick and temperature sensation are normal in the area of pain suspected to be central neuropathic pain, another pain source should be considered.  The cause of pain in neurologically impaired patients is more commonly musculoskeletal (eg.  shoulder pain related to arm paresis after a stroke or an upper extremity overuse syndrome in wheelchair-bound patients with a spinal cord injury).  Deafferentation pain is due to partial or complete interruption of peripheral or central afferent neural activity.  Examples are Postherpetic neuralgia Herpes zoster is infection that results when varicella-zoster virus reactivates from its latent state in a posterior dorsal root ganglion. \n【3】 Neuropathic pain syndromes are sometimes associated with overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic overactivity does not cause neuropathic pain, but it can contribute to its clinical features and severity.  The pain that results is called sympathetically maintained pain, which depends on efferent sympathetic activity. \n【4】 Other types of neuropathic pain may have a sympathetically maintained component.  What triggers sympathetic overactivity in some neuropathic pain states and not others is unknown.  Mechanisms probably involve abnormal sympathetic-somatic nerve connections (ephapses), local inflammatory changes, and changes in the spinal cord.  Symptoms and Signs of Neuropathic Pain Dysesthesias (spontaneous or evoked burning pain, often with a superimposed lancinating component) are typical, but pain may also be deep and aching.  Other sensations—eg, hyperesthesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia (pain due to a nonnoxious stimulus), and hyperpathia (particularly unpleasant, exaggerated pain response)—may also occur.  Patients may be reluctant to move the painful part of their body, resulting in muscle atrophy, joint ankylosis, bone loss, and limited movement.  Symptoms are long-lasting, typically persisting after resolution of the primary cause (if one was present) because the CNS has been sensitized and remodeled.  Diagnosis of Neuropathic Pain Clinical evaluation Neuropathic pain is suggested by its typical symptoms when nerve injury is known or suspected.  The cause (eg, amputation, diabetes, compression) may be readily apparent.  If not, the diagnosis is often assumed based on the description of the symptoms; however, those descriptors (eg, burning) are neither sensitive nor specific for neuropathic pain.  Thus, additional evaluation, including neurologic examination and electrophysiologic studies, are useful to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the injured nerve.  Pain that is ameliorated by sympathetic nerve block is sympathetically maintained pain.  Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Multimodal therapy (eg, physical methods, antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, psychotherapeutic methods, neuromodulation, sometimes surgery) Successful neuropathic pain management starts with confirming the correct diagnosis and managing treatable causes .  In addition to drugs, mobilization and physical therapy are needed to desensitize areas of allodynia and prevent trophic changes, disuse atrophy, and joint ankylosis.  Psychologic factors must be considered from the start of treatment.  Anxiety and depression must be treated appropriately.  If pain persists, neural blockade Neural Blockade Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【5】 When dysfunction does not respond to first-line treatments, patients may benefit from the comprehensive approach provided by a pain clinic.  Neuromodulation Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【6】 Several classes of drugs are effective , but complete relief is unlikely, and setting realistic expectations is important.  The goal of pharmacologic management is to lessen neuropathic pain so that it is less debilitating.   Opioid analgesics Opioid Analgesics Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【7】 Adjuvant analgesics, such as antidepressants and antiseizure drugs, are most commonly used to treat neuropathic pain, and their efficacy is supported by randomized trial data ,1 Treatment reference Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, rather than stimulation of pain receptors. \n【8】 Gabapentin is one of the most widely used drugs for such purposes.  For effective analgesia, the dose should usually be > 600 mg orally 3 times a day, and many patients need a higher dose.  Maximum dosage is usually considered to be 1200 mg orally 3 times a day.  Pregabalin is similar to gabapentin but has more stable pharmacokinetics; dosing 2 times a day is as efficacious as dosing 3 times a day and results in better compliance.  The dosing goal is at least 300 mg/day orally (eg, a starting dose of 75 mg 2 times a day, increased to 150 mg 2 times a day within 1 week).  Neuropathic pain syndromes may require up to 600 mg/day.  Some patients who do not respond well to or do not tolerate gabapentin do respond to or tolerate pregabalin and vice versa, even though the two drugs have a similar primary mechanism of action (binding to the alpha-2 delta ligand of the presynaptic calcium channel, which modulates nociceptive signaling).  For tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine), the primary mechanism of action is blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.  Analgesic doses (75 to 150 mg orally once a day) are usually insufficient to treat depression or anxiety.  Anticholinergic and adrenergic adverse effects often limit effective dosing.  Secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline and desipramine) have a more favorable adverse effect profile than tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline). and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.  Doses that are efficacious for depression and anxiety and for pain management are similar.  Venlafaxine's effects and mechanism of action are similar to those of duloxetine.  Topical drugs and a lidocaine-containing patch may be effective for peripheral syndromes.  Other potentially effective treatments include Spinal cord stimulation by an electrode placed epidurally for certain types of neuropathic pain (eg, chronic leg pain after spine surgery) Electrodes implanted along peripheral nerves and ganglia for certain chronic neuralgias (peripheral nerve stimulation) Sympathetic blockade, which is usually ineffective, except for some patients with complex regional pain syndrome Neural blockade or ablation (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, chemoneurolysis) Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation Electrical stimulation Treatment of pain and inflammation aims to facilitate movement and improve coordination of muscles and joints. \n【9】 Key Points Neuropathic pain may result from efferent activity (sympathetically maintained pain) or from interruption of afferent activity (deafferentation pain).  Consider neuropathic pain if patients have dysesthesia or if pain is out of proportion to tissue injury and nerve injury is suspected.

{"seq_id": "0ba83365-adf1-48f9-ba3e-7bc7ba2a0eec", "title": null, "text": "【0】Sudden hearing loss is moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss Pathophysiology Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss . \n【1】 It affects about 1/5000 to 1/10,000 people each year.  Initial hearing loss is typically unilateral (unless drug-induced) and may range in severity from mild to profound.  Many also have tinnitus is a noise in the ears.  It is experienced by 10 to 15% of the population. \n【2】 Sudden hearing loss has some causes that differ from chronic hearing loss and must be addressed urgently .   have hearing loss . \n【3】 Etiology of Sudden Hearing Loss The following are common characteristics of sudden hearing loss: Most cases are idiopathic .  Some occur in the course of an obvious explanatory event.  A few represent the initial manifestation of another, initially occult, but identifiable disorder.  Idiopathic There are numerous theories for which some evidence (although conflicting and incomplete) exists.  The most promising possibilities include viral infections ,particularly involving herpes simplex Overview of Herpesvirus Infections Eight types of herpesviruses infect humans . autoimmune attacks, and acute microvascular occlusion.  Obvious event Some causes of sudden hearing loss are readily apparent.  Blunt head trauma with temporal bone fracture or severe concussion involving the cochlea can cause sudden hearing loss.  Large ambient pressure changes Ear and Sinus Barotrauma is tissue injury caused by a pressure-related change in body compartment gas volume. \n【4】 Perilymphatic fistula can also be congenital; it can spontaneously cause a sudden loss or loss may occur after trauma or severe pressure changes.  Ototoxic drugs Drug-Induced Ototoxicity A wide variety of drugs can be ototoxic. \n【5】 There is a rare genetic mitochondrial-transmitted disorder that increases the susceptibility to aminoglycoside ototoxicity.  A number of infections cause sudden hearing loss during or immediately after acute illness.  Common causes include bacterial meningitis Acute Bacterial Meningitis Acute bacterial meningitis is rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the meninges and subarachnoid space.  Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity. \n【6】 The most common viral causes in the developed world are mumps is an acute, contagious, systemic viral disease, usually causing painful enlargement of the salivary glands, most commonly the parotids. \n【7】 Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children. \n【8】 Other disorders Sudden hearing loss rarely can be an isolated first manifestation of some disorders that usually have other initial symptoms.  For example, sudden hearing loss rarely may be the first manifestation of an acoustic neuroma Vestibular Schwannoma A vestibular schwannoma, also called an acoustic neuroma, is a Schwann cell–derived tumor of the 8th cranial nerve.  Symptoms include unilateral hearing loss. \n【9】 There is no reliable diagnostic test. \n【10】 Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum and is characterized by 3 sequential symptomatic stages separated by periods of asymptomatic latent infection. \n【11】 Cogan syndrome Cogan Syndrome Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease involving the eye and the inner ear.  Cogan syndrome affects young adults, with 80% of patients between 14 and 47 years. \n【12】 About 10 to 30% of patients also have a severe systemic vasculitis, which may include life-threatening aortitis.  Some vasculitic disorders can cause hearing loss, some of which is acute.  Hematologic disorders, such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia Macroglobulinemia is a malignant plasma cell disorder in which B cells produce excessive amounts of IgM M-proteins. \n【13】  Evaluation of Sudden Hearing Loss Evaluation consists of detecting and quantifying hearing loss and determining etiology (particularly reversible causes).  History of present illness should verify that loss is sudden and not chronic.  The history should also note whether loss is unilateral or bilateral and whether there is a current acute event ,eg, head injury, barotrauma Otic Barotrauma Otic barotrauma is ear pain or damage to the tympanic membrane caused by rapid changes in pressure. \n【14】 Important accompanying symptoms include other otologic symptoms (eg, tinnitus, ear discharge), vestibular symptoms (eg, disorientation in the dark, vertigo), and other neurologic symptoms (eg, headache, weakness or asymmetry of the face, abnormal sense of taste).  Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including transient, migratory neurologic deficits ,multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. \n【15】 Past medical history should ask about known HIV or syphilis infection and risk factors for them (eg, multiple sex partners, unprotected intercourse).  Family history should note close relatives with hearing loss (suggesting a congenital fistula).  Drug history should specifically query current or previous use of ototoxic drugs Drug-Induced Ototoxicity A wide variety of drugs can be ototoxic. \n【16】 Physical examination The examination focuses on the ears and hearing and on the neurologic examination.  The tympanic membrane is inspected for perforation, drainage, or other lesions.  During the neurologic examination, attention should be paid to the cranial nerves (particularly the 5th, 7th, and 8th) and to vestibular and cerebellar function because abnormalities in these areas often occur with tumors of the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle.  The Weber Physical examination and Rinne Physical examination tests require a tuning fork to differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss.  Additionally, the eyes are examined for redness and photophobia , and the skin is examined for rash .  Red flags Findings of particular concern are Abnormalities of cranial nerves (other than hearing loss) Significant asymmetry in speech understanding between the 2 ears Other neurologic symptoms and signs (eg, motor weakness, aphasia, Horner syndrome, sensory or temperature sensation abnormalities) Interpretation of findings Traumatic, ototoxic, and some infectious causes are usually apparent clinically.  A patient with perilymphatic fistula may hear an explosive sound in the affected ear when the fistula occurs and may also have sudden vertigo, nystagmus, and tinnitus.  Focal neurologic abnormalities are of particular concern.  The 5th cranial nerve, 7th cranial nerve, or both are often affected by tumors that involve the 8th cranial nerve, so loss of facial sensation and weak jaw clench (5th) and hemifacial weakness and taste abnormalities (7th) point to a lesion in that area.  Fluctuating unilateral hearing loss accompanied by aural fullness, tinnitus, and vertigo also suggests Meniere syndrome Meniere Disease Meniere disease is an inner ear disorder that causes vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus.  There is no reliable diagnostic test. \n【17】 Systemic symptoms suggesting inflammation (eg, fevers, rash, joint pains, mucosal lesions) should raise suspicion of an occult infection or autoimmune disorder.  Testing Audiometry Testing MRI and CT Patients should have an audiogram, and unless the diagnosis is clearly an acute infection or drug toxicity, most clinicians do gadolinium-enhanced MRI to diagnose inapparent causes, particularly for unilateral losses.  Patients with an acute traumatic cause also should have MRI.  A perilymphatic fistula is typically suspected from an inciting event (eg, excessive strain, barotrauma), and testing may be done by using positive pneumatic pressure to evoke eye movements (nystagmus).  CT of the temporal bones is usually done to show the bony characteristics of the inner ear and can help elucidate congenital abnormalities (eg, enlarged vestibular aqueduct), fractures of the temporal bone from trauma, or erosive processes (eg, cholesteatoma).  Patients who have risk factors for or symptoms that suggest causes should have appropriate tests based on clinical evaluation (eg, serologic tests for possible HIV infection or syphilis, complete blood count [CBC] and coagulation profile for hematologic disorders, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and antinuclear antibodies for vasculitis).  Treatment of Sudden Hearing Loss Treatment of sudden hearing loss focuses on the causative disorder when known.  Fistulas are explored and repaired surgically when bed rest fails to control symptoms.  In viral and idiopathic cases, hearing returns to normal in about 50% of patients and is partially recovered in others.  In patients who recover their hearing, improvement usually occurs within 10 to 14 days.  Recovery from an ototoxic drug varies greatly depending on the drug and its dosage.  With some drugs (eg, aspirin, diuretics), hearing loss resolves within 24 hours, whereas other drugs (eg, antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs) often cause permanent hearing loss if safe dosages have been exceeded.  For patients with idiopathic loss, many clinicians empirically give a course of glucocorticoids (typically prednisone 60 mg orally once a day for 7 to 14 days followed by a 5 day taper).  Glucocorticoids can be given orally and/or by transtympanic injection.  Direct transtympanic injection avoids the systemic side effects of oral glucocorticoids and appears equally effective except in profound (> 90 decibels) hearing loss.  There are data showing that using both oral and intratympanic steroids leads to better outcomes than either alone.  Although clinicians often give antiviral drugs effective against herpes simplex (eg, valacyclovir, famciclovir), data show that such drugs do not affect hearing outcomes.  There are some limited data suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial in idiopathic sudden hearing loss.  Key Points Most cases of sudden hearing loss are idiopathic.  A few cases have an obvious cause (eg, major trauma, acute infection, drugs).  A very few cases represent unusual manifestations of treatable disorders.  Evaluation includes audiometry, CT and MRI, and other tests for suspected causes.  Treatment focuses on known causes, and corticosteroids are given in cases of idiopathic sudden hearing loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Children who do not meet these criteria should have more frequent and intensive visits.  If children come under care for the first time late on the schedule or if any items are not done at the suggested age, children should be brought up to date as soon as possible.  The schedules are organized by age: Recommendations for preventive care during infancy Recommendations for Preventive Care During Infancy[a] Recommendations for preventive care during early and middle childhood Recommendations for Preventive Care During Early and Middle Childhood[a] Recommendations for preventive care during adolescence Recommendations for Preventive Care During Adolescence[a] Children who have developmental delay, psychosocial problems, or chronic disease may require more frequent counseling and treatment visits that are separate from preventive care visits.

Once teeth are present, fluoride varnish may be applied to all children every 3 to 6 months in the primary care setting or until a dental home is established.  Dentists typically begin seeing children at about age 3; after this time, clinicians may simply assess that children and adolescents are receiving appropriate dental care, including fluoride treatment if needed.

Spine and extremities Children old enough to stand should be screened for scoliosis Idiopathic Scoliosis Idiopathic scoliosis is lateral curvature of the spine.  Diagnosis is clinical and includes spinal x-rays.  Treatment depends on the severity of the curvature. \n【15】 At each visit before children start to walk, evaluation for developmental dysplasia of the hip Musculoskeletal system A thorough physical examination should be done within 24 hours. \n【16】 The Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers are used until about age 4 months.  After that, dysplasia may be suggested by unequal leg length, adductor tightness, or asymmetry of abduction or leg creases.  Toeing-in can result from adduction of the forefoot, tibial torsion Tibial Torsion The tibia may be twisted at birth.  Tibial torsion can be external (lateral) or internal (medial). \n【17】 Only pronounced cases require therapy and referral to an orthopedist.  Asymmetric toeing (toeing-in on one side and toeing-out on the other—windswept appearance) typically requires orthopedic evaluation. \n【18】 All sexually active patients should be screened for sexually transmitted infections Screening (along with physical examination) is an important part of preventive health care in infants, children, and adolescents. \n【19】 Testicular and inguinal evaluation should be done at every visit, specifically looking for undescended testes Diagnosis Cryptorchidism is failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum; in younger children, it is typically accompanied by inguinal hernia. \n【20】 Adolescent boys should be taught how to do testicular self-examination to check for masses, and adolescent girls should be taught how to do breast self-examination Breast symptoms (eg, masses, nipple discharge, pain) are common, accounting for > 15 million physician visits/year. \n【21】 Safety Recommendations for injury prevention vary by age.  Some examples follow.  For infants from birth to 6 months: Using a rear-facing car seat Reducing maximum home water temperature to < 49° C (< 120° F) Preventing falls Using sleeping precautions: Placing infants on their back, not sharing a bed, using a firm mattress, and not allowing stuffed animals, pillows, and blankets in the crib Avoiding foods and objects that children can aspirate For infants from 6 to 12 months: Continuing to use a rear-facing car seat Continuing to place infants on their back to sleep Not using baby walkers Using safety latches on cabinets Preventing falls from changing tables and around stairs Vigilantly supervising children when in bathtubs and while learning to walk For children aged 1 to 4 years: Using an age- and weight-appropriate car seat (infants and toddlers should use a rear-facing car seat until they exceed the rear-facing weight or height limits for their convertible child safety seat; most convertible car seats have limits that will allow children to ride rear-facing for ≥ 2 years) Reviewing automobile safety both as passenger and pedestrian Tying window cords Using safety caps and latches Installing outlet plug covers Preventing falls Removing handguns from the home For children ≥ 5 years: All of the recommendations for children aged 1 to 4 years Using a bicycle helmet and protective sports gear Instructing children about safe street crossing Closely supervising swimming and sometimes requiring the use of life jackets during swimming Nutrition Excessive caloric intake underlies the epidemic of obesity in children Obesity is excess body weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2. \n【22】 As children grow older, parents can allow them some discretion in food choices, while keeping the diet within healthy parameters.  Children should be guided away from frequent snacking and foods that are high in calories, salt, and sugar.  Soda and excessive fruit juice consumption have been implicated as major contributors to obesity.  Exercise Physical inactivity also underlies the epidemic of obesity in children, and the benefits of exercise in maintaining good physical and emotional health should induce parents to make sure their children develop good habits early in life.  During infancy and early childhood, children should be allowed to roam and explore in a safe environment under close supervision.  Outdoor play should be encouraged from infancy.  As children grow older, play becomes more complex, often evolving to formal school-based athletics.  Parents should set good examples and encourage both informal and formal play, always keeping safety issues in mind and promoting healthy attitudes about sportsmanship and competition.  Participation in sports and activities as a family provides children with exercise and has important psychologic and developmental benefits. \n【23】 Limits to television watching, which is linked directly to inactivity and obesity, should start at birth and be maintained throughout adolescence.

Bartholin gland cysts may become infected and form painful, pus-filled abscesses.  Cysts are usually painless, but if large, they can cause pressure or pain and interfere with sitting, walking, and sexual activity.  Cysts may become infected, forming a painful abscess.  Doctors can usually see or feel the cyst during a pelvic examination.  Doctors may create a permanent opening so that the cyst can drain fluid to the outside, or they may surgically remove the cyst.  Bartholin glands are very small, round glands that are located in the vulva (which consists of the labia and other tissues around the opening to the vagina).  They may develop on either side of the vulva.  Because they are located deep under the skin, they cannot normally be felt.  These glands may help provide fluids for lubrication during sexual activity.  If the duct to a Bartholin gland is blocked, the gland becomes filled with mucus and enlarges.  The result is a cyst.  These cysts develop in about 2% of women, usually those in their 20s.  Cysts may become infected, forming an abscess (a closed-off area filled with pus).  As women age, they are less likely to have cysts and abscesses.  Typically, the cause of the blockage is unknown. \n【1】 Very rarely, cancer Vulvar Cancer Vulvar cancer usually develops in the labia, the tissue that surrounds the opening of the vagina.  The cancer may appear to be a lump, an itchy area, or a sore that does not heal. \n【2】 What Is Bartholin Gland Cyst? The small glands on either side of the vaginal opening, called Bartholin glands, may become blocked.  Fluids then accumulate, and the gland swells, forming a cyst.  Cysts range from the size of a pea to that of a golf ball or larger.  Most often, they occur only on one side.  They may become infected, forming an abscess.  Symptoms of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Most Bartholin cysts do not cause any symptoms.  Women may notice a painless lump near the opening of the vagina, making the vulva look lopsided.  If cysts become large, they can cause irritation and pressure and/or pain.  They may interfere with sitting, walking, or sexual activity.  If the cyst becomes infected (forming an abscess), it causes severe pain and sometimes fever.  Abscesses are tender to the touch.  The skin over them appears red.  and The skin and the tissues under the skin over the abscess may become infected—an infection called cellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin and the tissues immediately beneath the skin.  This infection is most often caused by streptococci or staphylococci. \n【3】 If cellulitis develops, the affected area appears red and is tender, Women may have a vaginal discharge.  Diagnosis of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Examination of the vulva Sometimes a biopsy A woman should see a doctor in the following circumstances: The cyst continues to enlarge or persists after several days of immersing the area in hot water (in a tub or sitz bath).  The cyst is painful (often indicating an abscess).  A fever develops.  The cyst interferes with walking or sitting.  The woman is over 40.  A doctor examines the vulva to diagnose a Bartholin gland cyst. \n【4】 Doctors can usually tell whether it is infected by its appearance.  If a discharge is present, doctors may send a sample to be tested for other infections, including sexually transmitted infections.  If an abscess has developed, doctors also culture fluid from the abscess.  Although cancer very rarely develops in Bartholin glands, a doctor may remove a sample of the cyst to examine under a microscope (biopsy), especially if the woman is over 40.  Treatment of Bartholin Gland Cysts or Abscesses Soaking the area in warm water For abscesses, a procedure to drain them If a Bartholin gland cyst causes severe symptoms or occurs in women over 40, surgery Regardless of treatment, cysts sometimes recur.  If they do, the entire Bartholin gland may be removed.  Treatment of cysts in women under 40 If a Bartholin gland cyst causes little or no pain, women under 40 may be able to treat it themselves.  They can use a sitz bath or soak in a few inches of warm water in a tub.  Soaks should last 10 to 15 minutes and be done 2 times a day.  Sometimes cysts disappear after a few days of such treatment.  If the treatment is ineffective, women should see a doctor.  In women under 40, cysts require treatment only if they cause symptoms.  Draining a cyst is usually ineffective because cysts commonly recur.  Thus, surgery may be done to make a permanent opening from the gland’s duct to the surface of the vulva.  Then, if the cyst develops again, it can drain out.  After a local anesthetic is injected to numb the site, one of the following procedures can be done: Placement of a catheter: A small incision is made in the cyst so that a small balloon-tipped tube (catheter) can be inserted into the cyst.  Once in place, the balloon is inflated, and the catheter is left there for 4 to 6 weeks, so that a permanent opening can form.  The catheter is inserted and removed in the doctor’s office.  A woman can do her normal activities while the catheter is in place, although sexual activity may be uncomfortable.  Marsupialization: Doctors make a small cut in the cyst and stitch the inside edges of the cyst to the surface of the vulva.  Marsupialization creates a permanent opening in the cyst so that the cyst can drain as needed.  This procedure is done in an operating room.  Sometimes general anesthesia is needed.  After these procedures, women may have a discharge for a few weeks.  Usually, wearing panty liners is all that is needed.  Taking sitz baths several times a day may help relieve any discomfort and help speed healing.  If a cyst recurs, it may be surgically removed.  Treatment of cysts in women aged 40 or older In women aged 40 or older, all Bartholin gland cysts must be treated, except for those that have been present for years and have not changed in appearance.  Treatment involves Surgically removing the entire cyst Removing part of the cyst to test for cancer, then marsupializing the cyst Treatment of abscesses For an abscess, initial treatment involves making a small incision into the abscess and placing a catheter in it to drain it.  If the abscess refills after being drained, marsupialization, which creates a permanent opening, may be done to prevent the abscess from refilling.  Sometimes abscesses are also treated with antibiotics.

The blood gets its heat mainly from the energy given off by cells when they burn (metabolize) food—a process that requires a steady supply of food and oxygen.  A normal body temperature is necessary for proper functioning of all the cells and tissues in the body.  In a person with low body temperature, most organs, especially the heart and brain, become sluggish and eventually stop working.  Body temperature falls when the skin is exposed to colder surroundings.  In response to this fall in temperature, the body uses several protective mechanisms to generate additional heat.  For example, the muscles produce additional heat through shivering.  Also, the small blood vessels in the skin narrow (constrict), so that more blood is diverted to vital organs, such as the heart and brain.  However, as less warm blood reaches the skin, body parts such as the fingers, toes, ears, and nose cool more rapidly.  If body temperature falls much below about 88° F (about 31° C), these protective mechanisms stop working, and the body cannot warm itself.  If body temperature falls below 83° F (about 28° C), death may occur.  The risk of cold injuries increases in the following circumstances: When the flow of blood is too slow When food intake is inadequate When dehydration or exhaustion occurs When the environment is wet or when a body part contacts something wet When the person comes into contact with a metal surface When insufficient oxygen is available, as occurs at high altitude Cold injuries are less likely to occur, even in extremely cold weather, if the skin, fingers, toes, ears, and nose are well protected or are exposed only briefly.  Prevention of Cold Injuries Keeping warm in a cold environment requires several layers of clothing, preferably wool or synthetics such as polypropylene, because these materials insulate even when wet.  Because the body loses a large amount of heat from the head, a warm hat is essential.  Eating enough food and drinking enough fluids (particularly warm fluids) also help.  Food provides fuel to be burned, and warm fluids directly provide heat and prevent dehydration.  Alcoholic beverages should be avoided because alcohol widens (dilates) blood vessels in the skin, which makes the body temporarily feel warm but actually causes greater heat loss.  inking alcoholic beverages actually makes the body colder because the widening of blood vessels that makes a person feel warm allows more heat to escape from the body.

Diagnosis is by ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination.  Treatment is surgical removal and placement of an intraocular lens.  Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide.  In the US, almost 20% of people aged 65 to 74 have cataracts that interfere with vision.  Almost one in two people older than 75 has cataracts.  Lens opacity can develop in several locations: Central lens nucleus (nuclear cataract) Beneath the posterior lens capsule (posterior subcapsular cataract) On the side of the lens (cortical cataract)—these usually do not interfere with central vision ,For developmental or congenital cataracts, see Congenital Cataract Congenital cataract is a lens opacity that is present at birth or shortly after birth.  Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes with imaging.  Treatment is surgical removal of the cataract.   Etiology of Cataract Cataracts occur with aging. \n【1】 Dependence develops rapidly. \n【2】 Uveitis Overview of Uveitis is defined as inflammation of the uveal tract—the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.  However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well. \n【3】 ,Malnutrition also includes overnutrition. \n【4】 Some cataracts are congenital Cataract Congenital cataract is a lens opacity that is present at birth or shortly after birth. needing more light to see well, and problems distinguishing dark blue from black.  Painless blurring eventually occurs.  The degree of blurring depends on the location and extent of the opacity.  Monocular double vision or ghost images occur rarely.  With a nuclear cataract, distance vision worsens.  Near vision may improve in the early stages because of changes in the refractive index of the lens; presbyopic patients may be temporarily able to read without glasses (second sight).  A posterior subcapsular cataract disproportionately affects vision because the opacity is located at the crossing point of incoming light rays.  Such cataracts reduce visual acuity more when the pupil constricts (eg, in bright light, during reading).  They are also the type most likely to cause loss of contrast as well as glare (halos and starbursts around lights), especially from bright lights or from car headlights while driving at night. \n【5】 Diagnosis of Cataract Ophthalmoscopy followed by slit-lamp examination Diagnosis is best made with the pupil dilated.  Well-developed cataracts appear as gray, white, or yellow-brown opacities in the lens.  Examination of the red reflex through the dilated pupil with the ophthalmoscope Ophthalmoscopy The eye can be examined with routine equipment, including a standard ophthalmoscope; thorough examination requires special equipment and evaluation by an ophthalmologist. \n【6】 Small cataracts stand out as dark defects in the red reflex.  A large cataract may obliterate the red reflex.  Slit-lamp examination The eye can be examined with routine equipment, including a standard ophthalmoscope; thorough examination requires special equipment and evaluation by an ophthalmologist. \n【7】 Pearls & Pitfalls Examination of the red reflex through the dilated pupil with the ophthalmoscope held about 30 cm away can help identify early cataracts if a slit lamp is unavailable.  Treatment of Cataract Surgical removal of the cataract Placement of an intraocular lens Frequent refractions and corrective lens prescription changes may help maintain useful vision during cataract development.  Rarely, long-term pupillary dilation (with phenylephrine 2. 5% every 4 to 8 hours) is helpful for small centrally located cataracts.  Indirect lighting while reading minimizes pupillary constriction and may optimize vision for close tasks.  Usual indications for surgery include the following: Best vision obtained with glasses is worse than 20/40 (< 6/12), or vision is significantly decreased under glare conditions (eg, oblique lighting while trying to read a chart) in a patient with bothersome halos or starbursts.  Patients sense that vision is limiting (eg, by preventing activities of daily living such as driving, reading, hobbies, and occupational activities).  Vision could potentially be meaningfully improved if the cataract is removed (ie, a significant portion of the vision loss must be caused by the cataract). \n【8】 There is no advantage to removing a cataract early.  Cataract extraction and lens implant procedures Cataract extraction is usually done using a topical or local anesthetic and IV sedation.  There are 3 extraction techniques: In intracapsular cataract extraction, the cataract and lens capsule are removed in one piece; this technique is rarely used.  In extracapsular cataract extraction, the hard central nucleus is removed in one piece and then the soft cortex is removed in multiple small pieces.  In phacoemulsification (a type of extracapsular cataract extraction), the hard central nucleus is dissolved by ultrasound and then the soft cortex is removed in multiple small pieces.  Phacoemulsification uses the smallest incision, thus enabling the fastest healing, and is usually the preferred procedure.  Femtosecond lasers can be used in refractive laser-assisted cataract surgery to do certain parts of the cataract surgery prior to phacoemulsification.  In extracapsular extraction (including phacoemulsification), the lens capsule is not removed.  A plastic or silicone lens is almost always implanted intraocularly to replace the optical focusing power of the removed crystalline lens.  The lens implant is usually placed on or within the lens capsule (posterior chamber lens).  The lens can also be placed in front of the iris (anterior chamber lens) or attached to the iris and within the pupil (iris plane lens).  Iris plane lenses are rarely used in the US because many designs led to a high frequency of postoperative complications.  Multifocal intraocular lenses are newer and have different focusing zones that may reduce dependence on glasses after surgery.  Patients occasionally experience glare with these lenses, especially under low-light conditions, and also have problems with reduced contrast sensitivity.  Postsurgical care and complications In most cases, a tapering schedule of topical antibiotics and topical corticosteroids (eg, prednisolone acetate 1% one drop 4 times a day) along with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, ketorolac 0. 5% one drop 4 times a day) are used for up to 4 weeks postsurgery.  Antibiotics, as well as corticosteroid and NSAID drugs can also be injected into the eye (intracameral) at the conclusion of cataract surgery, with a reduced need for topical eyedrops postoperatively (a technique called \"dropless cataract surgery\").  Several large, controlled studies show that intracameral antibiotics decrease postoperative endophthalmitis .  Patients often wear an eye shield while sleeping and should avoid the Valsalva maneuver, heavy lifting, excessive forward bending, and eye rubbing for several weeks.  Major complications of cataract surgery are rare.  Complications include the following: Intraoperative: Bleeding beneath the retina, causing the intraocular contents to extrude through the incision (choroidal hemorrhage—very rare and could result in irreversible blindness), vitreous prolapsing out of the incision (vitreous loss), fragments of the cataract dislocating into the vitreous, incisional burn, and detachment of corneal endothelium and its basement membrane (Descemet membrane) Within the first week: Endophthalmitis is an acute panuveitis resulting most often from bacterial infection. \n【9】 Signs usually develop late in the disease. \n【10】 If an intraocular lens is not implanted, contact lenses or thick glasses are needed to correct the resulting hyperopia. \n【11】 Prevention of Cataract Many ophthalmologists recommend ultraviolet-coated eyeglasses or sunglasses as a preventive measure.  Reducing risk factors such as alcohol, tobacco, and corticosteroids and controlling blood glucose in diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. \n【12】 A diet high in vitamin C, vitamin A, and carotenoids (contained in vegetables such as spinach and kale) may protect against cataracts.  Key Points Modifiable risk factors for cataract include exposure to ultraviolet light; use of alcohol, tobacco, and systemic corticosteroids; and poor control of blood glucose.  Symptoms include loss of contrast, glare (halos and starbursts around lights), and eventually visual blurring.  Diagnosis is by examination with the eye dilated.  Surgical removal and placement of an intraocular lens are usually indicated if the cataract contributes to visual loss that interferes with activities of daily living, causes bothersome glare, or reaches certain degrees of severity (eg, best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Drugs to aid intubation Drugs to Aid Intubation Pulseless and apneic or severely obtunded patients can (and should) be intubated without pharmacologic assistance. \n【5】 Tube Selection and Preparation for Intubation Most adults can accept a tube with an internal diameter of ≥ 8 mm; these tubes are preferable to smaller ones because they Have lower airflow resistance (reducing the work of breathing) Facilitate suctioning of secretions Allow passage of a bronchoscope May aid in liberation from mechanical ventilation For infants and children ≥ 1 year, uncuffed tube size is calculated by (patient’s age + 16)/4; thus, a 4-year-old should have a (4 + 16)/4 = 5 mm endotracheal tube.  The tube size suggested by this formula should be reduced by 0. 5 (1 tube size) if a cuffed tube is to be used.  Reference charts  or devices such as the Broselow pediatric emergency tape or Pedi-Wheel can rapidly identify appropriate-sized laryngoscope blades and endotracheal tubes for infants and children.  For adults (and sometimes for children), a rigid stylet should be placed in the tube, taking care to stop the stylet 1 to 2 cm before the distal end of the endotracheal tube, so that the tube tip remains soft.  The stylet should then be used to make the tube straight to the beginning of the distal cuff; from that point, the tube is bent upward about 35° to form a hockey stick shape.  This straight-to-cuff shape improves tube delivery and avoids blocking the operator’s view of the vocal cords during tube passage.  Routinely filling the distal endotracheal tube cuff with air to check the balloon is not required; if this technique is used, care must be taken to remove all the air before tube insertion.  Insertion Technique for Intubation Successful intubation on the first attempt is important.  Repeated laryngoscopy (≥ 3 attempts) is associated with much higher rates of significant hypoxemia, aspiration, and cardiac arrest Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow. \n【6】 In addition to correct positioning, several other general principles are critical for success: Visualizing the epiglottis Visualizing the posterior laryngeal structures (ideally, the vocal cords) Not passing the tube unless tracheal insertion is ensured The conventional laryngoscope is designed to be held in the left hand, and the blade is inserted into the mouth and used as a retractor to displace the mandible and tongue up and away from the laryngoscopist, revealing the posterior pharynx.  Avoiding contact with the incisors and not placing undue pressure on laryngeal structures are important.  The importance of identifying the epiglottis cannot be overstated.  Identifying the epiglottis allows the operator to recognize critical airway landmarks and correctly position the laryngoscope blade.  The epiglottis may rest against the posterior pharyngeal wall, where it blends in with the other pink mucus membranes or gets lost in the pool of secretions that invariably exists in the cardiac arrest patient’s airway.  Once the epiglottis is found, the operator may use one of 2 techniques to lift it: Typical straight blade approach: The operator picks up the epiglottis with the tip of the laryngoscope blade Typical curved blade approach: The operator indirectly lifts the epiglottis and moves it out of the line of site by advancing the blade into the vallecula and pressing against the hyoepiglottic ligament Success with the curved blade depends on the proper positioning of the blade tip in the vallecula and the direction of the lifting force .  Lifting the epiglottis by either technique reveals the posterior laryngeal structures (arytenoid cartilages, interarytenoid notch), glottis, and vocal cords.  If the tip of the blade is too deep, laryngeal landmarks may be entirely bypassed, and the dark, round hole of the esophagus may be mistaken for the glottis opening.  If identifying structures is difficult, manipulating the larynx with the right hand placed on the anterior neck (while continuing to hold the laryngoscope in the left hand ) may optimize the laryngeal view .  Another technique involves lifting the head higher (lifting at the occiput, not atlanto-occipital extension), which distracts the jaw and improves the line of sight.  Head elevation is inadvisable in patients with potential cervical spine injury and is difficult in the morbidly obese (who must be placed in a ramped or head-elevated position beforehand).  In an optimal view, the vocal cords are clearly seen.  If the vocal cords are not seen, at a minimum, the posterior laryngeal landmarks must be viewed and the tip of the tube must be seen passing above the interarytenoid notch and posterior cartilages.  Operators must clearly identify laryngeal landmarks to avoid potentially fatal esophageal intubation.  If operators are not confident that the tube is going into the trachea, the tube should not be inserted.  Once an optimal view has been achieved, the right hand inserts the tube through the larynx into the trachea (if operators have been applying anterior laryngeal pressure with the right hand, an assistant should continue applying this pressure).  If the tube does not pass easily, a 90° clockwise twist of the tube may help it pass more smoothly over the anterior tracheal rings.  Before withdrawing the laryngoscope, operators should confirm that the tube is passing between the cords.  Appropriate tube depth is usually 21 to 23 cm in adults and 3 times the endotracheal tube size in children (for a 4. 0-mm endotracheal tube, 12 cm; for a 5. 5-mm endotracheal tube, 16. 5 cm).  In adults, the tube, if inadvertently advanced, typically migrates into the right mainstem bronchus.  Intubation is unsuccessful in 10 to 30% of critically ill patients, so contingency plans should be established. \n【7】 Bimanual laryngoscopy Pressure is applied on the neck opposite the direction of lift of the laryngoscope.  Arrows show the direction for lift of the laryngoscope and for anterior neck pressure. \n【8】 Alternative Intubation Devices A number of devices and techniques are increasingly used for intubation after failed laryngoscopy or as a primary means of intubation.  Devices include Video laryngoscopes How To Do Orotracheal Intubation Using Video Laryngoscopy Endotracheal (ET) tubes are flexible tubes with a standard flange for attaching an oxygen source at the proximal end and a beveled tip and inflatable balloon cuff at the distal end. \n【9】 Video and mirror laryngoscopes enable practitioners to look around the curvature of the tongue and usually provide excellent laryngeal views.  However, the tube requires an exaggerated bend angle to go around the tongue and thus may be more difficult to manipulate and insert.  Some laryngeal mask airways have a passage to allow endotracheal intubation. \n【10】 Flexible fiberoptic scopes and optical stylets are very maneuverable and can be used in patients with abnormal anatomy.  However, practice is required to recognize laryngeal landmarks from a fiberoptic perspective.  Compared with video and mirror laryngoscopes, fiberoptic scopes are more difficult to master and are more susceptible to problems with blood and secretions; also, they do not separate and divide tissue but instead must be moved through open channels.  Tube introducers (commonly called gum elastic bougies) are semirigid stylets that can be used when laryngeal visualization is suboptimal (eg, the epiglottis is visible, but the laryngeal opening is not).  In such cases, the introducer is passed along the undersurface of the epiglottis; from this point, it is likely to enter the trachea.  Tracheal entry is suggested by the tactile feedback, noted as the tip bounces over the tracheal rings.  An endotracheal tube is then advanced over the introducer.  During passage over a tube introducer or bronchoscope, the tube tip sometimes catches the right aryepiglottic fold.  Rotating the tube 90° counterclockwise often frees the endotracheal tube tip and allows it to pass smoothly.  Confirming Tube Placement The stylet is removed and the balloon cuff is inflated with air using a 10-mL syringe; a manometer is used to verify that balloon pressure is < 30 cm water.  The size of the endotracheal tube and cuff size affect the volume of air necessary for the correct pressure.  After balloon inflation, tube placement should be checked using a variety of methods, including Inspection and auscultation Carbon dioxide detection Esophageal detector devices Sometimes chest x-ray When a tube is correctly placed, manual ventilation should produce symmetric chest rise, good breath sounds over both lungs, and no gurgling over the upper abdomen.  Exhaled air should contain carbon dioxide and gastric air should not; detecting carbon dioxide with a colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide device or waveform capnography confirms tracheal placement.  However, in prolonged cardiac arrest Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow. \n【11】 In such cases, an esophageal detector device may be used.  These devices use an inflatable bulb or a large syringe to apply negative pressure to the endotracheal tube.  The flexible esophagus collapses, and little or no air flows into the device; in contrast, the rigid trachea does not collapse, and the resultant airflow confirms tracheal placement.  In the absence of cardiac arrest, tube placement is typically also confirmed with a chest x-ray.  After correct placement is confirmed, the tube should be secured using a commercially available device or adhesive tape. \n【12】 Endotracheal tubes can be displaced, particularly in chaotic resuscitation situations, so tube position should be rechecked frequently.  If breath sounds are absent on the left, right mainstem bronchus intubation is probably more likely than a left-sided tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【13】 Nasotracheal Intubation If patients are spontaneously breathing, nasotracheal intubation can be used in certain emergency situations—eg, when patients have severe oral or cervical disorders (eg, injuries, edema, limitation of motion) that make laryngoscopy difficult.  Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midface fractures or known or suspected basal skull fractures.  Historically, nasal intubation was also used when muscle relaxants were unavailable or forbidden (eg, prehospital settings, certain emergency departments) and when patients with tachypnea, hyperpnea, and upright positioning ,eg, those with heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. improved access to and training in pharmacologic adjuncts to intubation, and newer airway devices have markedly decreased the use of nasal intubation.  Additional considerations are problems with nasal intubation, including sinusitis (universal after 3 days), and the fact that tubes large enough to permit bronchoscopy (eg, ≥ 8 mm) can rarely be inserted nasotracheally.  When nasotracheal intubation is done, a vasoconstrictor (eg, phenylephrine) and topical anesthetic (eg, benzocaine, lidocaine) must be applied to the nasal mucosa and the larynx to prevent bleeding and to blunt protective reflexes.  Some patients may also require IV sedatives, opioids, or dissociative drugs.  After the nasal mucosa is prepared, a soft nasopharyngeal airway should be inserted to ensure adequate patency of the selected nasal passage and to serve as a conduit for topical drugs to the pharynx and larynx.  The nasopharyngeal airway may be placed using a plain or anesthetic (eg, lidocaine) lubricant.  The nasopharyngeal airway is removed after the pharyngeal mucosa has been sprayed.  The nasotracheal tube is then inserted to about 14 cm depth (just above the laryngeal inlet in most adults); at this point, air movement should be audible.  As the patient breathes in, opening the vocal cords, the tube is promptly passed into the trachea.  A failed initial insertion attempt often prompts the patient to cough.  Practitioners should anticipate this event, which allows a second opportunity to pass the tube through a wide open glottis.  More flexible endotracheal tubes with a controllable tip improve likelihood of success.  Some practitioners soften tubes by placing them in warm water to lessen the risk of bleeding and make insertion easier.  A small commercially available whistle can also be attached to the proximal tube connector to accentuate the noise of air movement when the tube is in the correct position above the larynx and in the trachea.  Complications of Tracheal Intubation Complications include Direct trauma Esophageal intubation Tracheal erosion or stenosis Laryngoscopy can damage lips, teeth, tongue, and supraglottic and subglottic areas.  Tube placement in the esophagus, if unrecognized, causes failure to ventilate and potentially death or hypoxic injury.  Insufflating a tube in the esophagus causes regurgitation, which can result in aspiration, compromise subsequent bag mask valve ventilation, and obscure visualization in subsequent intubation attempts.  Any translaryngeal tube injures the vocal cords somewhat; sometimes ulceration, ischemia, and prolonged cord paralysis occur.  Subglottic stenosis can occur later (usually 3 to 4 weeks).  Erosion of the trachea is uncommon.  It results more commonly from excessively high cuff pressure.  Rarely, hemorrhage from major vessels (eg, innominate artery), fistulas (especially tracheoesophageal), and tracheal stenosis occur.  Using high-volume, low-pressure cuffs with tubes of appropriate size and measuring cuff pressure frequently (every 8 hours) to maintain it at < 30 cm water decrease the risk of ischemic pressure necrosis, but patients in shock, with low cardiac output, or with sepsis remain especially vulnerable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Headaches are one of the most common reasons people visit a doctor.  Headaches interfere with the ability to work and do daily tasks.  Some people have frequent headaches.  Other people hardly ever have them.  Causes of Headache Although headaches can be painful and distressing, they are rarely due to a serious condition.  Headaches can be divided into two types: Primary headaches: Not caused by another disorder Secondary headaches: Caused by another disorder Primary headache disorders include Migraine Migraines A migraine headache is typically a pulsating or throbbing pain that ranges from moderate to severe.  It can affect one or both sides of the head. \n【1】 Secondary headaches may result from disorders of the brain, eyes, nose, throat, sinuses, teeth, jaws, ears, or neck or from a bodywide (systemic) disorder.  Common causes The two most common causes of headache are primary headaches: Tension-type Tension-Type Headaches A tension-type headache is usually mild to moderate pain that feels like a band tightening around the head. \n【2】 It can affect one or both sides of the head. \n【3】 Some secondary headache disorders are serious, particularly those that involve the brain, such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). \n【4】 Intracerebral hemorrhage usually results from chronic high blood pressure.  The first symptom is often a severe headache. \n【5】 Fever can cause headaches, as can many infections that do not specifically involve the brain.  Such infections include Lyme disease Lyme Disease Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted infection caused by Borrelia species, primarily by Borrelia burgdorferi and sometimes by Borrelia mayonii in the United States. \n【6】 It causes a rash, headache, and high fever. \n【7】 Headaches also commonly occur when people stop consuming caffeine or stop taking pain relievers (analgesics) after using them for a long time ,called medication overuse headache Medication Overuse Headache A medication overuse (rebound) headache occurs when people who take too many headache drugs have a headache for more than 15 days a month for more than 3 months. \n【8】 Contrary to what most people think, eye strain and high blood pressure (except for extremely high blood pressure) do not typically cause headaches.  Evaluation of Headache Doctors focus on the following: Determining whether the headache has another cause (that is, whether it is a secondary headache) Checking for symptoms suggesting that the headache is caused by a serious disorder If no cause is identified, they focus on identifying which type of primary headache is present.  Warning signs In people with headaches, certain characteristics are cause for concern: Changes in sensation or vision, sudden weakness, loss of coordination, seizures, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, or changes in levels of consciousness such as drowsiness or confusion (suggesting a brain disorder) A fever and a stiff neck that makes lowering the chin to the chest painful and sometimes impossible A very sudden, severe headache (thunderclap headache) Tenderness at the temple (as when combing hair) or jaw pain when chewing The presence of cancer or a disorder that weakens the immune system (immunodeficiency disorder Disorders That Can Cause Immunodeficiency ), such as AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【9】 The presence of a warning sign may suggest that the headaches may be caused by a serious disorder, as for the following: A severe headache with a fever and a stiff neck: Meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). \n【10】 Depending on their other symptoms, the doctor may ask them to come for an evaluation.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the pain and tests that may need to be done .  Doctors ask about the characteristics of the headache: How often it occurs How long it lasts Where the pain is How severe is it What the pain is like (for example, whether it is throbbing, dull, or like a knife) Whether any symptoms accompany it How long a sudden headache takes to reach its maximum intensity What triggers the headache, what makes it worse, and what relieves it Other questions may include Whether people have had headaches before Whether the headaches recur and, if so, when did they start and how often do they occur Whether the current headache is the same or different from previous headaches Doctors also ask about risk factors for headache.  They include Whether people take or have stopped taking certain drugs Whether they have a disorder that may account for the headache Whether they have family members with severe headaches Whether they have had a recent head injury Whether they have had a spinal tap recently People can think about how to answer the above questions and write the answers down before they go to the doctor.  Sometimes doctors ask people to fill out a headache questionnaire that covers most of the relevant questions.  People may complete the questionnaire before their visit and bring the results with them.  Having this information written down can save time and help guide the evaluation.  A general physical examination is done.  It focuses on the head and neck and on brain, spinal cord, and nerve function ,neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【11】 An eye examination The Eye Examination A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor. \n【12】 Testing Most people do not need testing.  However, if doctors suspect a serious disorder, tests are done.  For some suspected disorders, tests are done as soon as possible.  In other cases, testing can be done within one or more days.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or magnetic resonance angiography (which provides detailed images of blood vessels) or, if MRI is not available or contraindicated, computed tomography (CT) is done as soon as possible if people have A thunderclap headache Changes in levels of consciousness, such as drowsiness or confusion A fever and a stiff neck that makes lowering the chin to the chest painful and sometimes impossible Swelling of the optic nerve ,papilledema is a condition in which increased pressure in or around the brain causes the part of the optic nerve inside the eye to swell. \n【13】 MRI is done within a day or so if people have conditions such as the following: Cancer A weakened immune system (due to a disorder such as AIDS or a drug) MRI or CT (if MRI is not available or is contraindicated) is done within a few days if people have certain other characteristics, such as the following: Headaches that begin after age 50 Weight loss Double vision A new headache that is worse when the person awakens in the morning or that awakens the person from sleep An increase in the frequency, duration, or intensity of chronic headaches A spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【14】 People have a weakened immune system.  The headache is worsening and doctors suspect idiopathic intracranial hypertension Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure).  What triggers the disorder is unknown. \n【15】 A spinal tap can be dangerous if pressure within the skull is increased.  When spinal fluid is removed and pressure within the skull is increased, parts of the brain may suddenly shift downward.  If these parts are pressed through the small openings in the tissues that separate the brain into compartments, a life-threatening disorder called brain herniation: The Brain Under Pressure results.  Other tests are done within hours or days, depending on the examination results and the causes that are suspected.   Treatment of Headache Treatment of headache depends on the cause.  If the headache is a tension headache or if it accompanies a minor viral infection, people can take acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.  Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks. \n【16】 Essentials for Older People If headaches begin after age 50, doctors usually assume they result from another disorder until proved otherwise.  Many disorders that cause headaches, such as giant cell arteritis, brain tumors, and subdural hematomas (which may result from falls), are more common among older people.  Treatment of headaches may be limited in older people.  Older people are more likely to have disorders that prevent them from taking some of the drugs used to treat migraines and cluster headaches \n【17】  These disorders include angina, coronary artery disease, and uncontrolled high blood pressure.  If older people need to take drugs to treat headaches that can make them feel drowsy, they must be monitored closely.  Key Points Most headaches do not have a serious cause, particularly if the headaches began at a young age, if they have not changed over time, and if results of the examination are normal.  If headaches occur frequently or if warning signs Warning signs A headache is pain in any part of the head, including the scalp, upper neck, face, and interior of the head. \n【18】 Most headaches do not require testing.  Doctors can usually determine the type or cause of headaches based on the medical history, symptoms, and results of a physical examination.  If doctors suspect that the cause is a serious disorder (such as a hemorrhage or an infection), MRI is usually done, often immediately.  If doctors suspect meningitis, encephalitis, or a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a spinal tap is done, usually after CT or MRI done to exclude abnormalities that increase pressure within the skull.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Treatment is usually unnecessary.  Pityriasis rosea most commonly occurs between ages 10 and 35.  It affects women more often.  The cause of pityriasis rosea may be viral infection (some research has implicated human herpesviruses 6, 7, and 8).  Drugs may cause a pityriasis rosea–like reaction.  Symptoms and Signs of Pityriasis Rosea The condition classically begins with a single, primary, 2- to 10-cm herald patch that appears on the trunk or proximal limbs.  A general centripetal eruption of 0. 5- to 2-cm rose- or fawn-colored oval papules and plaques follows within 7 to 14 days.  The lesions have a scaly, slightly raised border (collarette) and resemble ringworm ,tinea corporis Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm) Tinea corporis is a dermatophyte infection of the face, trunk, and extremities.  Diagnosis is by clinical appearance and by examination of skin scrapings on potassium hydroxide wet mount. \n【1】 Most patients itch, occasionally severely.  Papules may dominate with little or no scaling in children and pregnant women.  The rose or fawn color is not as evident in patients with darker skin; children more commonly have inverse pityriasis rosea (lesions in the axillae or groin that spread centrifugally).  Manifestations of Pityriasis Rosea (Herald Patch) Initially, most people develop one large scaly patch (herald patch; arrow), and within 1 to 2 weeks, smaller pink patches can occur on the trunk, arms, and legs. \n【2】 Pityriasis Rosea Pityriasis rosea is characterized by an initial 2- to 10-cm herald patch followed by centripetal eruption of oval papules and plaques with a slightly raised border, typically appearing along skin lines.  \n【3】 Patches that appear more pink in patients with lighter skin appear violaceous and/or hyperpigmented in patients with darker skin. \n【4】 Laurie Tolman, MD.  Classically, lesions orient along skin lines, giving pityriasis rosea a Christmas tree–like distribution when multiple lesions appear on the back.

Differential diagnosis includes Tinea corporis Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm) Tinea corporis is a dermatophyte infection of the face, trunk, and extremities. \n【5】 Treatment may include a combination of various topical and oral drugs and phototherapy. \n【6】 Treatment of Pityriasis Rosea Antipruritic therapy No specific treatment is necessary because the eruption usually remits within 5 weeks and recurrence is rare.  Artificial or natural sunlight may hasten resolution.  Antipruritic therapy such as topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or topical measures may be used as needed.  Some data suggest that acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times a day for 7 days may be helpful in patients who present early and have widespread disease, or present with flu-like symptoms.  Of note, pityriasis rosea during pregnancy (especially during the first 15 weeks of gestation) is associated with premature birth or fetal demise.  Pregnant women should be offered acyclovir; however, antiviral therapy has not proved to reduce obstetric complications.

There are numerous causes, but autoimmune disorders are most common.  Most patients present with dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and new alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging.  Diagnostic tests are directed at the suspected cause.  Treatment is with immunosuppressants for patients with autoimmune causes and respiratory support if needed.  Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is not a specific disorder, but a syndrome that has a specific differential diagnosis and a specific sequence of testing.  Some disorders that cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are associated with glomerulonephritis Overview of Glomerular Disorders The hallmark of glomerular disorders is proteinuria, which is often in the nephrotic range (≥ 3 g/day). \n【1】 Cause is almost always an autoimmune disorder. \n【2】 Pathophysiology of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage results from widespread damage to the pulmonary small vessels, leading to blood collecting within the alveoli.  If enough alveoli are affected, gas exchange is disrupted.  The specific pathophysiology and manifestations vary depending on cause.  For example, isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis is a small-vessel vasculitis Overview of Vasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels, often with ischemia, necrosis, and organ inflammation. \n【3】 Venous or arterial thrombi may occur. \n【4】 Hemoptysis is common but may be absent in up to one third of patients.

When patients are stable, pulmonary function tests Overview of Tests of Pulmonary Function Pulmonary function tests provide measures of airflow, lung volumes, gas exchange, response to bronchodilators, and respiratory muscle function. \n【7】 They may show increased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to increased uptake of carbon monoxide by intra-alveolar hemoglobin; however, this finding, which is consistent with hemorrhage, does not assist with establishing a diagnosis. \n【8】 Lung biopsy or, if the urinalysis is abnormal, kidney biopsy is frequently needed when a cause remains unclear or the progression of disease is too rapid to await the results of serologic testing. \n【9】 Recurrent alveolar hemorrhage causes pulmonary hemosiderosis and fibrosis, both of which develop when ferritin aggregates within alveoli and exerts toxic effects.  COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smoke. \n【10】 Treatment of Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Corticosteroids Sometimes cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or plasma exchange Supportive measures Treatment involves correcting the cause. \n【11】 Rituximab has been studied primarily in ANCA-associated vasculitis and has been shown to be noninferior to cyclophosphamide for induction treatment  and superior to azathioprine for remission treatment .  Rituximab has also been used to treat alveolar hemorrhage related to systemic lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture syndrome, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  Plasma exchange Apheresis refers to the process of separating the cellular and soluble components of blood using a machine. \n【12】 Several studies have reported successful use of recombinant activated human factor VII in treating severe unresponsive alveolar hemorrhage, but such therapy is controversial because of possible thrombotic complications. \n【13】 Key Points Although diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can have various causes (eg, infection, toxins, drugs, hematologic or cardiac disorders), autoimmune disorders are the most common causes.  Symptoms, signs, and chest-x-ray findings are not specific.  Confirm diffuse alveolar hemorrhage by doing bronchoalveolar lavage to show persistent hemorrhage with sequential lavage samples.  Test for the cause by doing routine laboratory tests, autoantibody testing, and sometimes other tests.

Sometimes a blow to the anterior chest wall causes cardiac arrest without any structural lesion (commotio cordis).   Manifestations vary with the injury.  Myocardial contusion may be minor and asymptomatic, although tachycardia may be present.  Some patients develop conduction abnormalities and/or arrhythmias.  Ventricular rupture is usually rapidly fatal, but patients with smaller, particularly right-sided, lesions may survive to present with cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. \n【1】 Tamponade due to atrial rupture may manifest more gradually.  Valve disruption may occur, causing a heart murmur and sometimes manifestations of heart failure (eg, dyspnea, pulmonary crackles, sometimes hypotension), which may develop rapidly.  Septal rupture may not cause symptoms initially, but patients may present later with heart failure.  Commotio cordis is sudden cardiac arrest that follows a blow to the anterior chest wall in patients who do not have preexisting or traumatic structural heart disease.  Typically this blow involves a fast, hard projectile (eg, baseball, hockey puck) with relatively low kinetic energy.  Pathophysiology is unclear, but the timing of the blow in relation to the cardiac cycle may be important.  Initial rhythm is usually ventricular fibrillation.  Diagnosis of Blunt Cardiac Injury ECG Echocardiography Cardiac enzymes Cardiac injury should be suspected in patients with significant chest trauma and any palpitations, arrhythmia, new cardiac murmur, or unexplained tachycardia or hypotension.  Most patients with significant blunt chest trauma should have 12-lead ECG.  With myocardial contusion, ECG may reveal ST segment changes that mimic cardiac ischemia or infarction.  The most common conduction abnormalities include atrial fibrillation, bundle branch block (usually right), unexplained sinus tachycardia, and single or multiple premature ventricular contractions. \n【2】 Patients suspected of having blunt cardiac injury because of clinical, ECG, or E-FAST findings should have formal echocardiography to evaluate function and anatomic abnormalities.  Cardiac markers (eg, troponin, creatine phosphokinase muscle band isoenzyme [CPK-MB]) are most useful to screen for and thus help exclude blunt cardiac injury.  If cardiac markers and ECG are normal and there are no arrhythmias, blunt cardiac injury can be safely excluded.  Treatment of Blunt Cardiac Injury Supportive care Patients with myocardial contusion causing conduction abnormalities require cardiac monitoring for 24 hours because they are at risk for sudden arrhythmias during this time.  Treatment is mainly supportive (eg, treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias or heart failure) and interventions are seldom needed.  Surgical repair is indicated for rare cases of myocardial or valvular rupture.  Patients with commotio cordis are treated for their arrhythmia (eg, resuscitation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] and defibrillation followed by in-hospital observation).  Key Points Blunt cardiac injury should be suspected in patients with significant chest trauma and any palpitations, arrhythmia, new cardiac murmur, or unexplained tachycardia or hypotension.

The blockage may occur anywhere from the small and large veins that carry blood from the liver (hepatic veins) to the inferior vena cava.  Some people have no symptoms, but others experience fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and jaundice.  Fluid may accumulate in the abdomen, the spleen may enlarge, and sometimes severe bleeding occurs in the esophagus.  Doppler ultrasonography can detect narrowed or blocked veins.  Drugs may be used to dissolve or decrease the size of the clot, or a connection may be made between veins to allow blood to bypass the liver.   Budd-Chiari syndrome usually occurs when a clot narrows or blocks the hepatic veins, which carry blood out of the liver.  Because blood flow out of the liver is impeded, blood backs up in the liver, causing it to enlarge.  The spleen may also enlarge.  This backup of blood (congestion) causes blood pressure in the portal vein (which carries blood to the liver from the intestines) to increase.  This increased pressure, called portal hypertension Portal Hypertension Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver) and its branches. \n【1】 Portal hypertension, plus the engorged and damaged liver, leads to fluid accumulating in the abdomen ,called ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen. \n【2】 The kidneys contribute to ascites by causing salt and water to be retained.  The clot may extend to also block the inferior vena cava (the large vein that carries blood from the lower parts of the body, including the liver, to the heart).  Varicose veins in the abdomen near the skin’s surface may develop and become visible.  Eventually, severe scarring of the liver ,cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【3】TooltipReadMore Excess red blood cells ,polycythemia Vera Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative neoplasm of the blood-producing cells of the bone marrow that results in overproduction of all types of blood cells. \n【4】 During pregnancy, the blood normally clots more readily.  In some women, a blood clotting disorder may first become apparent during pregnancy.  Other causes include disorders that develop near the hepatic veins, such as parasitic infections and liver tumors Overview of Liver Tumors Liver tumors may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). \n【5】 Almost all kidney cancer is renal cell carcinoma. \n【6】 In Asia and South Africa, the cause is commonly a membrane (web) that blocks the inferior vena cava.  These webs are often present at birth.  Often, the cause is unknown.  Symptoms of Budd-Chiari Syndrome Symptoms vary somewhat depending on whether the blockage develops slowly or occurs suddenly.  Usually, the blockage and symptoms develop gradually over months.  Fatigue is common.  The enlarged liver becomes tender, and people have abdominal pain.  Fluid may accumulate in the legs, causing swelling is due to excess fluid in the tissues.  The fluid is predominantly water.  Swelling may be widespread or confined to a single limb or part of a limb. \n【7】 Varicose veins may develop in the esophagus.  They may rupture and bleed, sometimes profusely  tract, from the mouth to the anus. \n【8】 Such bleeding is a medical emergency.  If cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【9】 Liver failure Liver Failure Liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function.  Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver. \n【10】 Blockages occur suddenly in about 20% of people.  Blockages that occur during pregnancy tend to occur suddenly.  Some of the symptoms are the same as those of gradually developing blockages: fatigue, an enlarged and tender liver, and abdominal pain in the upper abdomen.  Additional symptoms include vomiting and a yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes ,jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.  Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. Severe liver failure is rare. \n【11】 If surgery or a procedure to widen a blood vessel or to reroute blood flow is planned, venography is necessary.  For venography, x-rays of the veins are taken after a radiopaque contrast agent Radiopaque Contrast Agents During imaging tests, contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail. \n【12】 A liver biopsy of the Liver Doctors can obtain a sample of liver tissue during exploratory surgery, but more often they obtain a sample by inserting a hollow needle through the person's skin and into the liver. \n【13】 Prognosis of Budd-Chiari Syndrome When the vein remains completely blocked, most people, if untreated, die of liver failure Liver Failure Liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function. \n【14】 When the blockage is incomplete, life expectancy is longer but varies.  Treatment of Budd-Chiari Syndrome Drugs (to dissolve or prevent blood clots) Procedures to improve blood flow Liver transplantation (in people with liver failure) Treatment depends on how rapidly the disorder developed and how severe it is.  When symptoms begin suddenly and the cause is a clot, fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) drugs, which dissolve clots, help.  For long-term treatment, anticoagulant drugs (such as warfarin) are often needed to prevent clots from enlarging or recurring.  If a vein is blocked by a web or is narrowed, angioplasty may be done to clear or widen it.  For this procedure (called percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), a catheter with a deflated balloon at its tip is inserted through the skin into a blood vessel (such as a vein in the neck) and threaded to the blocked vein.  The balloon is inflated, widening the vein.  A wire mesh tube (stent) can also be inserted and left in place to keep the vein open.  Another solution is to create an alternate route for blood flow, bypassing the liver.  This procedure, called transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunting Portosystemic shunting Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver) and its branches. \n【15】 For the procedure, a local anesthetic is used to numb the neck, and a catheter with a cutting needle is inserted into a vein in the neck (jugular vein).  The catheter is threaded through the vena cava to the hepatic vein.  The needle is used to create a connection (called a shunt) between a branch of the hepatic vein and the portal vein, so that blood can bypass the liver.  Then, a stent is threaded to and placed in the shunt to keep it open.  The shunt enables blood to bypass the liver, flowing from the portal vein (which normally brings blood to the liver) directly to the hepatic veins (which drain blood away from the liver).  The blood returns to the heart through the inferior vena cava. \n【16】 Also, shunts occasionally become blocked, especially in people who have a tendency to form blood clots.  Liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. \n【17】 Problems resulting from the disorder are also treated: Bleeding from varicose veins (also called varices) in the esophagus Control of bleeding Portal hypertension is abnormally high blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood from the intestine to the liver) and its branches. \n【18】 Usually, rubber bands are inserted through a flexible viewing tube (endoscope), which is passed through the mouth into the esophagus.  The bands are used to tie off the varicose veins (termed ligation).  Fluid accumulation in the abdomen (also called ascites) Treatment Ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen. \n【19】 Most people need to take anticoagulants indefinitely to prevent new blockages from developing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

If clinicians suspect an Achilles tendon tear, 3 main tests can be done to help confirm the diagnosis.  For the Thompson test (calf squeeze test), the patient is prone, and the calf is squeezed to elicit plantar flexion.  Results include the following: If the tear is complete, ankle plantar flexion is absent or decreased.  If the tear is partial, results are sometimes normal, so these tears are often missed.

The patient is prone with the knee bent at 90° to shorten the gastrocnemius.  The patient's feet are compared.  Results include the following: If the Achilles tendon is intact, plantar flexion of the ankle to 20 to 30° occurs.  If the Achilles tendon is torn, the foot falls to a neutral position.  The Matles test is 88% sensitive and 85% specific for tears.  For palpation of the tendon gap, the patient is asked to stand on the affected leg (if possible).  Then the clinician gently palpates the course of Achilles tendon and feels for a gap; a gap indicates that the tendon is torn.

{"seq_id": "c5c57b60-0c7a-41cd-b4ef-500c1dedb8cb", "title": null, "text": "【0】Normal body temperature varies from person to person and throughout the day.  Normal body temperature is highest in children who are preschool aged.  Several studies have documented that peak temperature tends to be in the afternoon and is highest at about 18 to 24 months of age when many normal healthy children have a temperature as high as 38. 3° C (101° F).  However, fever usually is defined as a core body (rectal) temperature ≥ 38. 0° C (100. 4° F).  Significance of fever depends on clinical context rather than peak temperature; some minor illnesses cause high fever, whereas some serious illnesses cause only a mild temperature elevation.  Although parental assessment is frequently clouded by fear of fever, the history of a temperature taken at home should be considered equivalent to a temperature taken in the office.   resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. \n【1】 Pathophysiology of Fever in Infants and Children Fever occurs in response to the release of endogenous pyrogenic mediators called cytokines (in particular interleukin-1 [IL-1]).  Cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins by the hypothalamus; prostaglandins readjust and elevate the temperature set point.  Fever plays an integral role in fighting infection and, although it may be uncomfortable, does not necessitate treatment in an otherwise healthy child.  Some studies even indicate that lowering the temperature can prolong some illnesses.  However, fever increases the metabolic rate and the demands on the cardiopulmonary system.  Therefore, fever can be detrimental to children with pulmonary or cardiac compromise or neurologic impairment.  Response to antipyretics and height of the temperature have no direct relationship to the etiology.  Acute fever Most acute fevers in infants and young children are caused by infection.  The most common are Viral respiratory or gastrointestinal infections (most common causes overall) Certain bacterial infections (otitis media, pneumonia, urinary tract infections) However, potential infectious causes of acute fever vary with the child’s age.  Neonates (infants < 28 days) are considered functionally immunocompromised because they often fail to contain infection locally and, as a result, are at higher risk of serious invasive bacterial infections most commonly caused by organisms acquired during the perinatal period.  The most common perinatal pathogens in neonates are group B streptococci, Escherichia coli (and other gram-negative enteric organisms), Listeria monocytogenes Neonatal Listeriosis Neonatal listeriosis is acquired transplacentally or during or after delivery.  Symptoms are those of sepsis. \n【2】 A typical sign is vesicular eruption, which may be accompanied by or progress to disseminated disease. \n【3】 These organisms can cause bacteremia (viremia with herpes simplex), pneumonia Neonatal Pneumonia Neonatal pneumonia is lung infection in a neonate.  Onset may be within hours of birth and part of a generalized sepsis syndrome or after 7 days and confined to the lungs. \n【4】 Most febrile children 1 month to 2 years of age without an obvious focus of infection on examination ,fever without source Occult Bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. \n【5】 However, a small number (perhaps < 1% in the postconjugate vaccine era) of such patients are early in the course of a serious infection (eg, bacterial meningitis).  Thus, the main concern in a patient with FWS is whether occult bacteremia Occult Bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. \n【6】 The most common causative organisms of occult bacteremia are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b.  The widespread use of vaccinations against both of these organisms has made occult bacteremia much less common.  Noninfectious causes of acute fevers include Kawasaki disease Kawasaki Disease Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years. \n【7】 Some vaccinations can cause fever either in the first 24 to 48 hours after the vaccine is given  or 1 to 2 weeks after the vaccine is given ,eg, with measles vaccination Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine effectively protects against all 3 infections. \n【8】 These fevers typically last from a few hours to a day.  If the child is otherwise well, no evaluation is necessary.  Teething does not cause significant or prolonged fevers.  Acute recurrent or periodic fever is episodes of fever alternating with periods of normal temperature .  Chronic fever that occurs daily for ≥ 2 weeks and for which initial cultures and other investigations fail to yield a diagnosis is considered fever of unknown origin Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is body temperature ≥ 38. \n【9】 Potential categories of causes  include localized or generalized infection, connective tissue disease, and cancer. \n【10】 Pseudo FUO is likely much more common than true FUO because frequent, minor viral illness may be overinterpreted.  In children, despite the numerous possible causes, true FUO is more likely to be an uncommon manifestation of a common disease rather than an uncommon disease; respiratory infections account for almost one half of cases of infection-associated FUO.   Evaluation of Fever in Infants and Children History of present illness should note degree and duration of fever, method of measurement, and the dose and frequency of antipyretics (if any).  Important associated symptoms that suggest serious illness include poor appetite, irritability, lethargy, and change in crying (eg, duration, character).  Associated symptoms that may suggest the cause include vomiting, diarrhea (including presence of blood or mucus), cough, difficulty breathing, favoring of an extremity or joint, and strong or foul-smelling urine.  Drug history should be reviewed for indications of drug-induced fever.  Factors that predispose to infection are identified.  In neonates, these factors include prematurity, prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, and positive prenatal tests (usually for group B streptococcal infections, cytomegalovirus infections, or sexually transmitted diseases).  For all children, predisposing factors include recent exposures to infection (including family, caregiver, and school or daycare infection), indwelling medical devices (eg, catheters, ventriculoperitoneal shunts), recent surgery, travel and environmental exposures (eg, to endemic areas, to ticks, mosquitoes, cats, farm animals, or reptiles), and known or suspected immune deficiencies.  Review of systems should note symptoms suggesting possible causes, including runny nose and congestion (viral upper respiratory infection), headache (sinusitis, Lyme disease, meningitis), ear pain or waking in the night with signs of discomfort (otitis media), cough or wheezing (pneumonia, bronchiolitis), abdominal pain (pneumonia, strep pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, abdominal abscess), back pain (pyelonephritis), and any history of joint swelling or redness (Lyme disease, osteomyelitis).  A history of repeated infections (immunodeficiency) or symptoms that suggest a chronic illness, such as poor weight gain or weight loss (tuberculosis, cancer), is identified.  Certain symptoms can help direct the evaluation toward noninfectious causes; they include heart palpitations, sweating, and heat intolerance (hyperthyroidism) and recurrent or cyclic symptoms (a rheumatoid, inflammatory, or hereditary disorder).  Past medical history should note previous fevers or infections and known conditions predisposing to infection (eg, congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer, immunodeficiency).  A family history of an autoimmune disorder or other hereditary conditions (eg, familial dysautonomia, familial Mediterranean fever) is sought.  Vaccination history is reviewed to identify patients at risk of infections that can be prevented by a vaccine.  Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed, noting abnormalities in temperature and respiratory rate.  In ill-appearing children, blood pressure should also be measured.  Temperature should be measured rectally in infants for accuracy.  Any child with cough, tachypnea, or labored breathing requires pulse oximetry.  The child’s overall appearance and response to the examination are important.  A febrile child who is overly compliant or listless is of more concern than one who is uncooperative.  However, an irritable infant or child who is inconsolable is also of concern.  The febrile child who looks quite ill, especially when the temperature has come down, is of great concern and requires in-depth evaluation and continued observation.  However, children who appear more comfortable after antipyretic therapy do not always have a benign disorder.  The remainder of the physical examination seeks signs of causative disorders .   Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Age < 1 month Lethargy, listlessness, or toxic appearance Respiratory distress Petechiae or purpura Inconsolability Interpretation of findings Although serious illness does not always cause high fever and many high fevers result from self-limited viral infections, a temperature of ≥ 39° C in children < 36 months indicates higher risk of serious bacterial infection.  Other vital signs also are significant.  Hypotension should raise concern about hypovolemia, sepsis, or myocardial dysfunction.  Tachycardia in the absence of hypotension may be caused by fever (10 to 20 beats/minute increase for each degree above normal) or hypovolemia.  An increased respiratory rate may be a response to fever, indicate a pulmonary source of the illness, or be respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Acute fever is infectious in most cases, and, of these, most are viral.  History and examination are adequate to make a diagnosis in children > 36 months who are otherwise well and not toxic-appearing.  Typically, they have a viral respiratory illness (recent ill contact, runny nose, wheeze, or cough) or gastrointestinal illness (ill contact, diarrhea, and vomiting).  Other findings also suggest specific causes .  In infants and children < 36 months, the possibility of occult bacteremia Occult Bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. \n【11】 Evaluation varies by age group.  Accepted categories are neonates (≤ 28 days), young infants (1 to 3 months), and older infants and children (3 to 36 months).  Regardless of clinical findings, a neonate with fever requires immediate hospitalization and testing to rule out a dangerous infection.  Young infants may require hospitalization depending on screening laboratory results and the likelihood that they will be brought in for follow-up.  Acute recurrent or periodic fever and chronic fever ,FUO Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is body temperature ≥ 38. \n【12】; intermittent headaches with runny nose or congestion ; weight loss, high-risk exposure, and night sweats (tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【13】; weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, heart palpitations, and sweating (hyperthyroidism in Infants and Children Hyperthyroidism is excessive thyroid hormone production.  Diagnosis is by thyroid function testing (eg, free serum thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone). \n【14】; and weight loss, anorexia, and night sweats .  Testing depends on age, appearance of the child, and whether the fever is acute Testing for Acute Fever Normal body temperature varies from person to person and throughout the day. \n【15】 Normal body temperature is highest in children who are preschool aged. \n【16】 Testing for Acute Fever For acute fever, testing for infectious causes is directed by the age of the child.  Typically, children < 36 months, even those who do not appear very ill and those who have an apparent source of infection (eg, otitis media), require a thorough search to rule out serious bacterial infections (eg, meningitis, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary tract infection).  In this age group, early follow-up (by phone and/or outpatient visit) is important for all those managed at home.  Febrile children < 1 month of age All febrile children < 1 month of age require a white blood cell (WBC) count with a manual differential, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation with culture and appropriate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (eg, for herpes simplex, enterovirus) as indicated by historical risk factors.  Inflammatory marker levels (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or both) may be measured to assist with risk assessment.  Chest x-ray is done in neonates with respiratory manifestations.  Stool is sent for culture or enteric PCR stool test in neonates with diarrhea.  Neonates are hospitalized and given empiric IV antibiotic coverage for the most common neonatal pathogens (eg, using ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin and cefotaxime); antibiotics are continued until a serious bacterial infection is ruled out by negative blood, urine, and CSF cultures or a specific diagnosis is made.  Acyclovir also should be given if neonates are ill-appearing, have mucocutaneous vesicles, have a maternal history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, or have seizures, hypothermia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT); acyclovir is stopped if CSF HSV PCR testing and mucocutaneous vesicle HSV culture (if done) results are negative.  Febrile children between 1 month and 3 months of age Febrile children between 1 month and 3 months of age require a different approach, which has evolved over the last few decades because the number of children in this age group who turn out to have a potentially serious bacterial infection has been markedly reduced by routine immunization against H.  influenzae type b and S.  pneumoniae.  Clinicians must nonetheless maintain vigilance because, although serious bacterial infections have been reduced, they have not been eliminated.  Therefore, clinicians who choose to observe without treatment or send home under parental observation need to have a greater certainty regarding that child's low-risk status than that of a child who is tested, admitted, and treated.  Infants in this 1- to 3-month age group are differentiated based on Temperature Clinical appearance (ill- or well-appearing, as below) Laboratory results Ill-appearing febrile infants Febrile infants between 1 month and 3 months of age who are ill-appearing (eg, abnormal cry, lethargy, rectal temperature > 38. 5° C) or who have risk factors for serious bacterial infection (eg, significant congenital anomalies, prematurity, technology dependence, unvaccinated) should be admitted to the hospital and have a WBC count with a manual differential, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag), and lumbar puncture with CSF evaluation, including culture and, if available, PCR panel.  Chest x-ray and a respiratory PCR panel should be done in those with respiratory manifestations, and stool is sent for stool culture or enteric PCR stool test in those with diarrhea.  These infants should be given age-specific empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy (eg, ceftriaxone) until serious bacterial infection is ruled out by negative cultures or a specific diagnosis is made.  Well-appearing febrile infants between 29 days and 60 days of age with all of the following are at low risk of serious bacterial infections: Rectal temperature < 38. 5° C Normal WBC count (5,000 to 15,000/mcL [5 to 15 × 109/L] and an absolute neutrophil count < 4000/mcL (≤ 4 × 109/L)) Normal inflammatory marker levels (procalcitonin < 0. 5 ng/mL [< 0. 5 mg/L] and/or CRP < 2 mg/dL [< 20 mg/L]) Normal urinalysis (and CSF analysis and chest x-ray, if done) Blood and urine cultures should be obtained.  Some experts defer lumbar puncture in these infants who meet the above criteria, but guidelines regarding minimum necessary testing in this age group continue to evolve based on changing bacteriology and advances in testing (eg, inflammatory markers, pathogen identification with rapid PCR testing) .  In addition, well-appearing febrile infants in this age group with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, or other viral infection documented by PCR testing during a period of high seasonal prevalence and who have a normal urinalysis seem to have a markedly reduced risk of serious bacterial infection, which some experts believe permits modifications to the above recommendations, meaning the infants might not necessarily require blood or CSF studies.  These infants can be managed as outpatients if reliable follow-up is arranged within 24 to 36 hours either by telephone or by return visit, at which time preliminary culture results are reviewed.  If the family's social situation suggests that follow-up within 24 to 36 hours is problematic, infants should be admitted to the hospital and observed.  If infants are sent home, any deterioration in clinical status or worsening of fever, a positive blood culture not thought to be a contaminant, or a positive urine culture in an infant who remains febrile warrants immediate hospitalization with repeat cultures and age-specific empiric antibiotic therapy (eg, ceftriaxone) until serious bacterial infection is ruled out by repeat culture results or a specific diagnosis is made.  In well-appearing febrile infants between 61 days and 90 days of age without risk factors for serious bacterial infection, many experts defer blood and CSF studies pending urinalysis results.  When testing is done in well-appearing infants between 1 month and 3 months of age, infants who have any of the following should be admitted to the hospital for treatment with age-specific empiric parenteral antibiotics as described above: CSF pleocytosis An abnormal urinalysis or chest x-ray A peripheral WBC count ≤ 5,000/mcL (≤ 5 × 109/L) or ≥ 15,000/mcL (≥ 15 × 109/L) An absolute neutrophil count ≥ 4000/mcL (≤ 4 × 109/L) Abnormal inflammatory marker levels (procalcitonin > 0. 5 mg/L] and/or CRP > 2 mg/dL [> 20 mg/L]) If empiric antibiotics are to be given, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis should be strongly considered if not previously done, especially in infants 29 to 60 days of age.  Some experts believe that well-appearing infants between 1 month and 3 months of age with an abnormal urinalysis but otherwise reassuring examination and laboratory results can be safely managed with antibiotics at home if close follow-up is assured within 24 hours .  Febrile children between 3 months and 36 months of age Febrile children between 3 months and 36 months of age who have an apparent source of fever on examination and who do not appear ill or toxic can be managed based on the clinical diagnosis.  Children in this age group who are ill-appearing should be fully evaluated for serious bacterial infection with WBC count and cultures of blood, urine, and, when meningitis is suspected, CSF.  Those with tachypnea or a WBC count > 20,000/mcL (> 20 × 109/L) should have a chest x-ray.  These children should be given parenteral antibiotic therapy (usually using ceftriaxone) targeting the likely pathogens in this age group (S.  pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, H.  influenzae type b) and be admitted to the hospital pending culture results.  Well-appearing children in this age group who have a temperature > 39° C and no identifiable source on examination (fever without source) and who are not fully immunized have a risk of occult bacteremia as high as 5% (equal to the risk before the pneumococcal and H.  influenzae conjugate vaccines came into use).  These children should have a complete blood count with differential, blood culture, and urinalysis and urine culture.  A chest x-ray should be done if the WBC count is ≥ 20,000/mcL (≥ 20 × 109/L) .  Children who have a WBC count ≥ 15,000/mcL (≥ 15 × 109/L) should be given parenteral antibiotics pending blood and urine culture results.  Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg IM) is preferred because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum and prolonged duration of action.  Children who received parenteral antibiotics should have follow-up within 24 hours by telephone or by return visit, at which time preliminary culture results are reviewed.  If the social situation suggests that follow-up within 24 hours is problematic, children should be admitted to the hospital.  Children who are not treated with antibiotics should be brought for reevaluation if they are still febrile (≥ 38° C) after 48 hours or earlier if they become sicker or if new symptoms or signs develop.  Well-appearing children in this age group who have a temperature > 39° C and fever without identifiable source and who are completely immunized have a risk of bacteremia < 0. 5%.  At this low-risk level, most laboratory testing and empiric antibiotic therapy are neither indicated nor cost-effective.  However, because urinary tract infection (UTI) can be an occult source of infection in fully immunized children in this age group, girls < 24 months, circumcised boys < 6 months, and uncircumcised boys < 12 months should have a urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag) and be appropriately treated if UTI is detected.  For other completely immunized children, urine testing is done only when they have symptoms or signs of UTI, they have a prior history of UTI or urogenital anomalies, or fever has lasted > 48 hours.  For all children, caregivers are instructed to return immediately if fever becomes higher, the child looks sicker, or new symptoms or signs develop.  Febrile children > 36 months of age For febrile children > 36 months of age, testing is directed by history and examination.  In this age group, a child's response to serious illnesses is sufficiently developed to be recognized clinically (eg, nuchal rigidity is a reliable finding of meningeal irritation), so empiric testing (eg, screening WBC counts, urine and blood cultures) is not indicated.  Acute recurrent or periodic fever For acute recurrent or periodic fever, laboratory tests and imaging should be directed toward likely causes based on findings from the history and physical examination. \n【17】 Between episodes and even during the episodes, the children appear healthy.  Diagnosis requires 6 months of stereotypic episodes, negative throat cultures during episodes, and exclusion of other causes (eg, specific viral infections).  In patients with attacks of fever, arthralgia, skin lesions, mouth ulcers, and diarrhea, IgD levels should be measured to look for hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS).  Laboratory features of HIDS include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and markedly elevated IgD (and often IgA).  Genetic testing is available for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and HIDS. \n【18】 Testing for Chronic Fever For chronic fever (fever of unknown origin [FUO]), laboratory tests and imaging should be directed toward likely causes of fever based on the patient's age and findings from the history and physical examination.  Indiscriminate ordering of laboratory tests is unlikely to be helpful and can be harmful (ie, because of adverse effects of unnecessary confirmatory testing of false positives).  The pace of the evaluation is dictated by the appearance of the child.  The pace should be rapid if the child is ill-appearing, but can be more deliberate if the child appears well.  All children with FUO should have Complete blood count with manual differential Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) Blood cultures Urinalysis and urine culture Chest x-ray Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, and hepatic enzymes HIV serology Tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay The results of these studies in conjunction with findings from the history and physical examination can focus further diagnostic tests.  Anemia may be a clue to malaria, infective endocarditis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or tuberculosis (TB).  Thrombocytosis is a nonspecific acute-phase reactant.  The total WBC count and the differential generally are less helpful, although children with an absolute neutrophil count > 10,000/mcL (> 10 × 109/L) have a higher risk of serious bacterial infection.  If atypical lymphocytes are present, a viral infection is likely.  Immature WBCs should prompt further evaluation for leukemia Diagnosis Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer; it also strikes adults of all ages. \n【19】 Eosinophilia may be a clue to parasitic, fungal, neoplastic, allergic, or immunodeficiency disorders.  The ESR and CRP are nonspecific acute-phase reactants that are general indicators of inflammation; an elevated ESR or CRP makes factitious fever less likely.  A normal ESR or CRP can slow the pace of the evaluation.  However, ESR or CRP may be normal in noninflammatory causes of FUO  Some Causes of Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) ).  Blood cultures should be done in all patients with FUO at least once and more often if suspicion of serious bacterial infection is high.  Three blood cultures should be done over 24 hours in patients who have any manifestations of infective endocarditis.  A positive blood culture, particularly for S.  aureus, should raise suspicion for occult skeletal or visceral infection or endocarditis and lead to performance of a bone scan and/or echocardiography.  Urinalysis and urine culture are important because UTI is among the most frequent causes of FUO in children.  Patients with FUO should have a chest x-ray to check for infiltrates and lymphadenopathy even if lung examination is normal.  Serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and hepatic enzymes are measured to check for renal or hepatic involvement.  HIV serologic tests HIV-specific tests Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【20】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【21】 Other tests are done selectively based on findings: Stool testing Bone marrow examination Serologic testing for specific infections Testing for connective tissue and immunodeficiency disorders Imaging Stool cultures or examination for ova and parasites may be warranted in patients with loose stools or recent travel.  Salmonella enteritis can infrequently manifest as FUO without diarrhea.  Bone marrow examination in children is most useful in diagnosing cancer (especially leukemia) or other hematologic disorders (eg, hemophagocytic disease) and may be warranted in children with otherwise unexplained hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or cytopenias.  Serologic testing that may be warranted, depending on the case, includes but is not limited to Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, bartonellosis (cat-scratch disease), syphilis, and certain fungal or parasitic infections.  An antinuclear antibody (ANA) test should be done in children > 5 years with a strong family history of rheumatologic disease.  A positive ANA test suggests an underlying connective tissue disorder, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus.  Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be measured in children with a negative initial evaluation.  Low levels may indicate an immunodeficiency.  Elevated levels can occur in chronic infection or an autoimmune disorder.  Imaging of the nasal sinuses, mastoids, and gastrointestinal tract should be done initially only when children have symptoms or signs related to those areas but may be warranted in children in whom FUO remains undiagnosed after initial testing.  Children with elevated ESR or CRP, anorexia, and weight loss should have studies to exclude inflammatory bowel disease Diagnosis Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. \n【22】 However, imaging of the gastrointestinal tract should be done eventually in children whose fevers persist without other explanation and may be caused by disorders such as psoas abscess or cat-scratch disease.  Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI can be useful in evaluating the abdomen and can detect abscesses, tumors, and lymphadenopathy.  Imaging of the central nervous system is generally not helpful in the evaluation of children with FUO.  However, lumbar puncture may be warranted in children with persistent headache, neurologic signs, or an indwelling ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  Other imaging techniques, including bone scan or tagged WBC scan, can be helpful in selected children whose fevers persist without other explanation when suspicion for a source that could be detected by these tests exists.  Ophthalmologic examination by slit lamp is useful in some patients with FUO to look for uveitis (eg, as occurs in juvenile idiopathic arthritis) or leukemic infiltration.  Biopsy (eg, of lymph nodes or liver) should be reserved for children with evidence of involvement of specific organs.  Empiric treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics should not be used as a diagnostic measure except when juvenile idiopathic arthritis is suspected; in such cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) is the recommended first-line therapy.  Response to anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics does not help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes.  Also, antibiotics can cause false-negative cultures and mask or delay the diagnosis of important infections (eg, meningitis, parameningeal infection, endocarditis, osteomyelitis).  Treatment of Fever in Infants and Children Treatment is directed at the underlying disorder.  Fever in an otherwise healthy child does not necessarily require treatment.  Although antipyretics can provide comfort, they do not change the course of an infection.  In fact, fever is an integral part of the inflammatory response to infection and can help the child fight the infection.  However, most clinicians use antipyretics to help alleviate discomfort and to reduce physiologic stresses in children who have cardiopulmonary disorders, neurologic disorders, or a history of febrile seizures.  Antipyretic drugs that are typically used include Acetaminophen Ibuprofen Acetaminophen tends to be preferred because ibuprofen decreases the protective effect of prostaglandins in the stomach and, if used chronically, can lead to gastritis.  Epidemiologic studies have suggested a possible association between the development of asthma and maternal and infant use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen.  A randomized drug trial comparing the two showed that these drugs in usual doses do not lead to worsening of existing asthma .  However, the question remains whether the use of these drugs during pregnancy or early childhood increases the risk of developing asthma.  If used, the dosage of acetaminophen is 10 to 15 mg/kg orally, IV, or rectally every 4 to 6 hours.  The dosage of ibuprofen is 10 mg/kg orally every 6 hours.  Use of one antipyretic at a time is preferred.  Some clinicians alternate the 2 drugs to treat high fever (eg, acetaminophen at 6 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM and ibuprofen at 9 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM), but this approach is not encouraged because caregivers may become confused and inadvertently exceed the recommended daily dose. \n【23】 Nondrug approaches to fever include putting the child in a warm or tepid bath, using cool compresses, and undressing the child.  Caregivers should be cautioned not to use a cold water bath, which is uncomfortable and which, by inducing shivering, may paradoxically elevate body temperature.  As long as the temperature of the water is slightly cooler than the temperature of the child, a bath provides temporary relief.  Things to avoid Wiping the body down with isopropyl alcohol should be strongly discouraged because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and cause toxicity.  Numerous folk remedies exist, ranging from the harmless (eg, putting onions or potatoes in socks) to the uncomfortable ,eg, coining, cupping (a manipulative and body-based practice) is used in traditional Chinese medicine. \n【24】 Key Points Most acute fever is caused by viral infections.  Causes and evaluation of acute fever differ depending on the age of the child; in young infants, fever may indicate a serious, life-threatening disease and requires careful evaluation.  A small but real number of children < 36 months of age with fever without localizing signs (primarily those who are incompletely immunized) can have pathogenic bacteria in their bloodstream (occult bacteremia) and be early in the course of a potentially life-threatening infection.  Antipyretics do not alter the outcome but may make children feel better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Inspection includes observation for erythema, deformity, or skin lesions, including surgical scars, and for asymmetry compared to the unaffected shoulder (suggesting muscle wasting).  Because pain can be referred from other areas to areas around the shoulder, shoulder palpation should include the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints, the coracoid process, clavicle, acromion process, subacromial bursa, biceps tendon, and greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus  Shoulder anatomy (anterior view) , as well as the scapula and the neck.  The neck is examined as part of any shoulder evaluation because pain can be referred to the shoulder from the cervical spine (particularly with C5 radiculopathy).  Glenohumeral joint effusions may cause a bulge between the coracoid process and the humeral head.  Possible causes include rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.  Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【1】  Calcium Pyrophosphate Arthritis Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis (CPP arthritis) involves intra-articular and/or extra-articular deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. \n【2】 Limited range of motion, weakness, pain, and other disturbances of mobility caused by rotator cuff impairment Rotator Cuff Injury/Subacromial Bursitis Rotator cuff injury includes tendinitis and partial or complete tears; subacromial bursitis may result from tendinitis.  Symptoms are shoulder area pain and, with severe tears, weakness. \n【3】 Specific maneuvers against resistance can help determine which tendons are affected.  Strength and sensation should be assessed: The infraspinatus and teres minor are assessed by having the patient resist external rotation pressure with the arms held at the sides with elbows flexed to 90°; this position isolates rotator cuff muscle function from that of other muscles such as the deltoid.  Weakness during this test suggests significant rotator cuff dysfunction (eg, a complete tear).  The supraspinatus is assessed by having the patient resist downward pressure on the arms held in flexion (forward) with the thumbs pointing downward and the elbow extended (empty can, or Jobe test).  The subscapularis is assessed by having the patient place the hand behind the back with the back of the hand resting on the lower back.  The examiner lifts the hand off the lower back.  The patient should be able to keep the hand off the skin of the back (Gerber lift-off test).  The Apley scratch test assesses combined shoulder range of motion by having the patient attempt to touch the opposite scapula: Reaching overhead, behind the neck, and to the opposite scapula with the tips of the fingers tests abduction and external rotation; reaching under, behind the back, and across to the opposite scapula with the back of the hand tests adduction and internal rotation.  Impingement tests are considered if pain is elicited.  They include the following: The Neer test is done to check for impingement of the rotator cuff tendons under the coracoacromial arch.  It is done by placing the arm in forced forward flexion, lifted overhead, and fully pronated.  The Hawkins test is done also to check for impingement.  It is done by flexing the arm (forward) to 90°, placing the pronated elbow in 90° of flexion, and then forcibly rotating the shoulder internally (moving the hand downward).  Disorders of the shoulder Rotator cuff tendinitis Diagnosis Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, often developing after degeneration (tendinopathy).  Tenosynovitis is tendinitis with inflammation of the tendon sheath lining. \n【4】 The supraspinatus tendon is most frequently involved and the subscapularis is second.  Active abduction in an arc of 40 to 120° and internal rotation cause pain .  Passive abduction causes less pain, but abduction against resistance can increase pain.  Bicipital tendinitis causes pain in the biceps tendon that is aggravated by shoulder flexion or resisted supination of the forearm.  Examiners can elicit palpable tenderness proximally over the bicipital groove of the humerus by rolling (flipping) the bicipital tendon under their thumb.  Also, the Speed test may be done.  In this test, the arm is extended behind the body plane while the elbow is straight and the forearm is supinated.  Acromioclavicular joint injury is tested for using the cross-body adduction test.  In this test, the examiner stabilizes the shoulder with one hand, flexes the shoulder forward to 90° with the elbow pronated, and brings the arm straight across the front of the body, toward the opposite side.  Elicitation of pain is a positive test.  Anterior glenohumeral joint instability is tested by stabilizing the joint by holding it from behind and then pulling back on the arm with the shoulder abducted to 90° and the elbow flexed to 90° (increasing abduction and external rotation).  A positive result is apprehension of joint instability (not pain).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3f2d4b4f-e7ba-4510-bc6e-3b9df729baec", "title": null, "text": "【0】Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, often developing after degeneration (tendinopathy).  Tenosynovitis is tendinitis with inflammation of the tendon sheath lining.  Symptoms usually include pain with motion and tenderness with palpation.  Chronic deterioration or inflammation of the tendon or tendon sheath can cause scars that restrict motion.  Diagnosis is clinical, sometimes supplemented with imaging.  Treatment includes rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and sometimes corticosteroid injections.  Tendinopathy usually results from repeated small tears or degenerative changes (sometimes with calcium deposits) that occur over years in the tendon. \n【1】 Etiology of Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis The cause of tendinitis is often unknown.  It usually occurs in people who are middle-aged or older as the vascularity of tendons decreases; repetitive microtrauma may contribute.  Repeated or extreme trauma (short of rupture), strain, and excessive or unaccustomed exercise probably also contribute.  Some fluoroquinolone antibiotics may increase the risk of tendinopathy and tendon rupture.  Risk of tendinitis may be increased by certain systemic disorders—most commonly rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.  Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【2】 In younger adults, particularly women, disseminated gonococcal infection Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. \n【3】 Symptoms and Signs of Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis Affected tendons are usually painful when actively moved or when natural motion is resisted.  For example, because the posterior tibial tendon helps invert the foot, passive eversion plus active, resisted inversion causes pain in patients with posterior tibial tendinitis.  Occasionally, tendon sheaths become swollen and fluid accumulates, usually when patients have infection, rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【4】 Swelling may be visible or only palpable.  Along the tendon, palpation elicits localized tenderness of varying severity. \n【5】 Diagnosis of Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis Clinical evaluation Sometimes imaging Usually, the diagnosis can be based on symptoms and physical examination, including palpation or specific maneuvers to assess pain.  MRI or ultrasonography may be done to confirm the diagnosis, rule out other disorders, and detect tendon tears and inflammation.  Rotator cuff tendinitis is the most common cause of shoulder pain.  The rotator cuff is composed of four tendons, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor.  The supraspinatus tendon is most frequently involved and the subscapularis is second.  Active abduction in an arc of 40 to 120° and internal rotation cause pain .  Passive abduction causes less pain, but abduction against resistance can increase pain.  Calcium deposits in the tendon just below the acromion are sometimes visible on x-ray.  Ultrasonography or MRI may help with further evaluation (eg, if the diagnosis is otherwise unclear) and with treatment decisions (eg, presence of significant tears that might require surgical interventions).  Bicipital tendinitis Pain in the biceps tendon is aggravated by shoulder flexion or resisted supination of the forearm.  Examiners can elicit tenderness proximally over the bicipital groove of the humerus by rolling (flipping) the bicipital tendon under their thumb.  Volar flexor tenosynovitis (digital flexor tendinitis) Volar flexor tenosynovitis ,digital flexor tendinitis Digital Flexor Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis (Trigger Finger) Digital flexor tendinitis and tenosynovitis are inflammation, sometimes with subsequent fibrosis, of tendons and tendon sheaths of the digits.   is a common musculoskeletal disorder that is often overlooked.  Pain occurs in the palm on the volar aspect of the thumb or other digits and may radiate distally.  Palpation of the tendon and sheath elicits tenderness; swelling and sometimes a nodule are present.  The affected digit may rest in a flexed position, and passive extension elicits pain.  In later stages, the digit may lock when it is flexed, and forceful extension may cause a sudden release with a snap (trigger finger).  Gluteus medius tendinitis Patients with trochanteric bursitis almost always have gluteus medius tendinitis.  In patients with trochanteric bursitis, palpation over the lateral prominence of the greater trochanter elicits tenderness.  Patients often have a history of chronic pressure on the joint, trauma, a change in gait ,eg, due to osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation). or inflammation at this site ,eg, in rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【6】 Treatment of Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis Rest or immobilization, heat or cold, followed by exercise High-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Sometimes corticosteroid injection Symptoms are relieved by rest or immobilization (eg, splint or sling) of the tendon, application of heat (usually for chronic inflammation) or cold (usually for acute inflammation), and high-dose NSAIDs  for 7 to 10 days.  Indomethacin or colchicine may be helpful if gout Treatment Gout is a disorder caused by hyperuricemia ,serum urate > 6. 8 mg/dL ,> 0. \n【7】 After inflammation is controlled, exercises that gradually increase range of motion should be done several times a day, especially for the shoulder, which can develop contractures rapidly.  Injecting a sustained-release corticosteroid (eg, betamethasone 6 mg/mL, triamcinolone 40 mg/mL, methylprednisolone 20 to 40 mg/mL) in the tendon sheath may help; injection is usually indicated if pain is severe or if the problem has been chronic.  Injection volume may range from 0. 3 mL to 1 mL, depending on the site.  An injection through the same needle of an equal or double volume of local anesthetic (eg, 1 to 2% lidocaine) confirms the diagnosis if pain is relieved immediately.  Clinicians should be careful not to inject the tendon (which can be recognized by marked resistance to injection); doing so may weaken it, increasing risk of rupture.  Patients are advised to rest the adjacent joint to reduce the slight risk of tendon rupture.  Infrequently, symptoms can worsen for up to 24 hours after the injection.  Pearls & Pitfalls Do not inject corticosteroids into a tendon; doing so will weaken it, increasing risk of rupture.  Repeat injections and symptomatic treatment may be required.  Rarely, for persistent cases, particularly rotator cuff tendinitis, surgical exploration with removal of calcium deposits or tendon repair, followed by graded physical therapy, is needed.  Occasionally, patients require surgery to release scars that limit function, remove part of a bone causing repetitive friction, or do tenosynovectomy to relieve chronic inflammation.  Key Points Tendinitis and tenosynovitis, unlike tendinopathy (tendon degeneration), involve inflammation.  Pain, tenderness, and swelling tend to be maximal along the tendon's course.  Diagnose most cases by examination, including tendon-specific maneuvers, sometimes confirming the diagnosis with MRI or ultrasonography.  Treat with rest, heat or cold, high-dose NSAIDs, and sometimes corticosteroid injection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Your heart should always have a regular, rhythmic beat, like the ticking of a clock.  What is an abnormal heart rhythm? Abnormal heart rhythms are heartbeats that are: Irregular Too fast (tachycardia) Too slow (bradycardia) Abnormal heart rhythms are also called arrhythmias.  Most common arrhythmias do not cause symptoms, are harmless, and do not need treatment Heart disorders are the most common cause of an abnormal heart rhythm You may feel fine, but sometimes you can feel your abnormal heart rhythm  Some abnormal heart rhythms make you feel weak or dizzy Doctors do an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity.  It's quick, painless, and harmless.  The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram.  Pacemaker cells send out regular electrical signals to your heart muscle to make it contract The pacemaker cells have their own natural rhythm of 60 to 100 signals per minute.  However, nerves from your brain can send messages to the cells telling them to speed up or slow down.  Your heart's conduction system has tiny strips of tissue sort of like electrical wires.  The conduction system carries the pacemaker signals to the rest of your heart The conduction system includes a gateway called the AV node (atrioventricular node).  The AV node controls how signals pass from the upper chambers of your heart (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles).  When the conduction system is working properly, the signals get to each of your heart muscle cells at just the right time so your heart gives a good, strong beat that pumps blood properly.  Hormones, such as thyroid hormone What are thyroid hormones? Your thyroid is a gland below the Adam’s apple in the front of your neck.  Glands make and release hormones.  Hormones stimulate other cells or tissues into action. \n【1】 Many drugs, medicines, and chemicals also affect your heart rhythm.  You also need the right balance of minerals ,electrolytes Overview of Electrolytes are minerals that circulate in your blood.  These minerals are also in your stomach juices, in your stool (poop), in your urine, and inside your body's tissues. \n【2】 What causes abnormal heart rhythms? Your heart rhythm can become abnormal if there's a problem with: Your pacemaker cells Your heart's conducting system Chemicals and drugs in your blood The most common cause of a heart rhythm problem is a heart disorder, such as: Coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) The heart is a muscle that pumps blood.  Like all muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of blood to work.  Blood that pumps through the heart doesn't feed the heart muscle. \n【3】 Your heart has four chambers.  The atria are the two upper chambers in your heart—the right atrium and the left atrium. \n【4】 Four heart valves control how blood flows in and out of your heart. \n【5】 Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. \n【6】 This can damage the pacemaker cells or the conducting system.  Other causes of abnormal heart rhythms include: Medicines Heart abnormalities you were born with Sometimes doctors can't tell what's causing your abnormal heart rhythm.  What are the symptoms of an abnormal heart rhythm? Your symptoms depend mainly on whether your heart is: Pumping enough blood Not pumping enough blood If your heart is pumping enough blood, you may feel normal.  Or you may feel like your heart is skipping beats (called palpitations).  Some people say strong palpitations may feel like a fish flopping around in their chest.  If your heart is not pumping enough blood, you also may have: Weakness Problems exercising Shortness of breath Feeling light-headed or dizzy Chest pain Fainting Go to the doctor if you have any of these symptoms.  How can doctors tell if I have an abnormal heart rhythm? Doctors feel your pulse and do: An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. \n【7】 Doctors then may have you: Wear a small device under your clothes that records your heart's electrical activity for a day or more ,event monitor Continuous Ambulatory Electrocardiography A standard electrocardiograph (ECG) records the heart's electrical activity for only a few seconds. \n【8】 If doctors think you have a dangerous heart problem, they'll admit you to the hospital.  You'll be in a unit where your heart rate and rhythm can be recorded and seen by the nurses and doctors.  If doctors need more information about your abnormal heart rhythm, they may do: Electrophysiologic testing Electrophysiologic Testing Electrophysiologic testing is used to evaluate serious abnormalities in heart rhythm or electrical conduction . \n【9】 The doctor puts a thin plastic tube (catheter) through an artery and into your heart. \n【10】 Doctors insert a thin flexible tube (catheter) into a large blood vessel (for example, one in your leg) and thread it up into your heart.  The catheter has electrodes on its tip that record your heart's electrical activity from the inside.  The catheter can also stimulate your heart electrically to see how it responds.  How do doctors treat abnormal heart rhythms? Some abnormal heart rhythms are harmless and don’t need treatment.  Sometimes, lifestyle changes help, such as: Changing or stopping one of your medicines Not drinking alcohol or caffeine Not smoking Not doing heavy exercise (if an abnormal heart rhythm happens during exercise) Different abnormal rhythms require different treatment.  Doctors may use: Medicines An artificial pacemaker (a small electrical device that doctors put in your chest or belly to signal your heart when to beat) An electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm (called cardioversion, defibrillation, or electroversion) A treatment called ablation to destroy the abnormal heart tissue Artificial pacemakers sometimes include a defibrillator so the same device can trigger a normal heart beat or stop an abnormal rhythm with a shock.  This combination device is called an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator).  Doctors do ablation if they find that one small bit of heart tissue is causing the abnormal rhythm.  Getting rid of the tissue often gets rid of the rhythm problem.  Often they do ablation during electrophysiologic testing.  They use a catheter to deliver a high-frequency electrical current that destroys a small area of the heart.  You may need to stop driving for a while until doctors know whether the treatment is working.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Treatment depends on cause.  Cholestasis occurs in 1/2500 full-term infants.  It is defined as direct bilirubin > 1 mg/dL (> 17. 1 micromole/L).  Cholestasis is never normal and warrants evaluation. \n【2】 Extrahepatic causes of cholestasis The most common extrahepatic disorder is Biliary atresia  Biliary atresia Biliary Atresia Biliary atresia is obstruction of the biliary tree due to progressive sclerosis of the extrahepatic bile duct. \n【3】 In most cases, biliary atresia manifests several weeks after birth, probably after inflammation and scarring of the extrahepatic (and sometimes intrahepatic) bile ducts.  It is rarely present in premature infants or in neonates at birth.  The cause of the inflammatory response is unknown, but several infectious organisms have been implicated, including reovirus type 3 and cytomegalovirus Congenital and Perinatal Cytomegalovirus Infection (CMV) Cytomegalovirus infection may be acquired prenatally or perinatally and is the most common congenital viral infection. \n【4】 Biliary cysts rarely manifest as neonatal cholestasis; these cysts are more common among patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure. \n【5】 Inspissated bile duct syndrome can also be a cause of extrahepatic neonatal cholestasis and is more common among infants with cystic fibrosis Gastrointestinal Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems.  Intrahepatic causes of cholestasis Intrahepatic causes can be infectious, alloimmune, metabolic/genetic, or toxic.  Infections can cause cholestasis.  Infections may be viral ,eg, herpes simplex virus Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection is usually transmitted during delivery.  A typical sign is vesicular eruption, which may be accompanied by or progress to disseminated disease. \n【6】 Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death. bacterial ,eg, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia Occult Bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. or parasitic .  Sepsis Neonatal sepsis is invasive infection, usually bacterial, occurring during the neonatal period. \n【7】 Gestational alloimmune liver disease involves transplacental passage of maternal IgG that induces a complement-mediated membrane attack complex that injures the fetal liver. \n【8】 \n【9】 Additional genetic defects include Alagille syndrome, cystic fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. \n【10】 There are also a number of gene mutations that interfere with normal bile production and excretion and cause cholestasis; the resultant disorders are termed progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.  Toxic causes are due mainly to the use of prolonged parenteral nutrition in extremely preterm neonates or infants with short bowel syndrome Short Bowel Syndrome Short bowel syndrome is malabsorption resulting from extensive resection of the small bowel (usually more than two thirds the length of the small intestine). \n【11】 Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis syndrome (giant cell hepatitis) is an inflammatory condition of the neonatal liver.  Its incidence has decreased, and it is becoming rare as improved diagnostic studies allow identification of specific causes of cholestasis. \n【12】 Pathophysiology of Neonatal Cholestasis In cholestasis, the primary failure is of bilirubin excretion, resulting in excess conjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream and decreased bile salts in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  As a result of inadequate bile in the GI tract, there is malabsorption Overview of Malabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport. \n【13】 Symptoms and Signs of Neonatal Cholestasis typically is noted in the first 2 weeks of life.  Infants are jaundiced and often have dark urine (containing conjugated bilirubin), acholic stools, and hepatomegaly.  If cholestasis persists, chronic pruritus is common, as are symptoms and signs of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency; progression on growth charts may show a decline.  If the underlying disorder causes hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, portal hypertension with subsequent abdominal distention resulting from ascites, dilated abdominal veins, and upper GI bleeding resulting from esophageal varices may develop.  Diagnosis of Neonatal Cholestasis Total and direct bilirubin Liver tests for metabolic, infectious, and genetic causes Liver ultrasonography Hepatobiliary scan Occasionally biopsy of liver, operative cholangiography, or genetic testing  Any infant who is jaundiced after age 2 weeks should be evaluated for cholestasis including with total and direct bilirubin levels.  Some experts advocate that breastfed infants who have jaundice do not need to be evaluated until age 3 weeks.  The initial approach should be directed at diagnosing treatable conditions ,eg, extrahepatic biliary atresia Diagnosis Biliary atresia is obstruction of the biliary tree due to progressive sclerosis of the extrahepatic bile duct. \n【14】 Cholestasis is identified by an elevation in both total and direct bilirubin.  Tests that are needed to further evaluate the liver include albumin, fractionated serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT), and ammonia level .  Once cholestasis is confirmed, testing is required to determine etiology  and evidence of malabsorption Overview of Malabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport. \n【15】  Abdominal ultrasonography is often the first test; it is noninvasive and can assess liver size and certain abnormalities of the gallbladder and common bile duct.  However, it is nonspecific.  A hepatobiliary scan using hydroxy iminodiacetic acid ,HIDA scan Cholescintigraphy Imaging is essential for accurately diagnosing biliary tract disorders and is important for detecting focal liver lesions (eg, abscess, tumor). \n【16】 Infants with cholestasis are frequently given phenobarbital for 5 days prior to a HIDA scan in an attempt to enhance the excretion.  When no diagnosis has been made, a liver biopsy is generally done relatively early on, sometimes with operative cholangiography.  Patients with biliary atresia typically have enlarged portal triads, bile duct proliferation, and increased fibrosis.  Neonatal hepatitis is characterized by lobular disarray with multinucleated giant cells.  Alloimmune liver disease is characterized by elevated hepatic iron stores.  Prognosis for Neonatal Cholestasis Biliary atresia is progressive and, if untreated, results in liver failure, cirrhosis with portal hypertension by several months of age, and death by 1 year of age.  Prognosis of cholestasis due to specific disorders (eg, metabolic disease) is variable, ranging from a completely benign course to a progressive disease resulting in cirrhosis.  Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis syndrome usually resolves slowly, but permanent liver damage may result and lead to liver failure and death.  Gestational alloimmune liver disease has a poor prognosis without early intervention.  Treatment of Neonatal Cholestasis Specific cause treated Vitamin A, D, E, and K supplements Medium-chain triglycerides Sometimes ursodeoxycholic acid  Specific treatment is directed at the cause.  If there is no specific therapy, treatment is supportive and consists primarily of nutritional therapy, including supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K.  For formula-fed infants, a formula that is high in medium-chain triglycerides should be used because it is absorbed better in the presence of bile salt deficiency.  Adequate calories are required; infants may need > 130 calories/kg/day.  In infants with some bile flow, ursodeoxycholic acid 10 to 15 mg/kg once or twice a day may relieve itching.  Infants with presumed biliary atresia require surgical exploration with an intraoperative cholangiogram.  If biliary atresia is confirmed, a portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) should be done.  Ideally, this procedure should be done in the first 1 to 2 months of life.  After this period, the short-term prognosis significantly worsens.  Postoperatively, many patients have significant chronic problems, including persistent cholestasis, recurrent ascending cholangitis, and failure to thrive.  Prophylactic antibiotics (eg, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) are frequently prescribed for a year postoperatively in an attempt to prevent ascending cholangitis.  Even with optimal therapy, most infants develop cirrhosis and require liver transplantation.  Because gestational alloimmune liver disease has no definitive marker and/or test, treatment with IV immune globulin (IVIG) or exchange transfusion needs to be considered early to reverse the ongoing liver injury if no definite diagnosis has been made . \n【17】 Key Points There are numerous inherited and acquired causes of neonatal cholestasis, resulting in failure of bilirubin excretion and thus excess conjugated bilirubin.  Neonatal cholestasis typically is noted in the first 2 weeks of life; infants are jaundiced and often have dark urine, acholic stools, and hepatomegaly.  Begin with laboratory testing of the liver, ultrasonography, and hepatobiliary scan and do tests for causes, sometimes including liver biopsy.  Treat specific cause and give supportive care, including supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins and a formula that is high in medium-chain triglycerides and contains sufficient calories", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9b700121-ac76-47ba-a7d6-e6f4983d6144", "title": null, "text": "【0】Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn disease Crohn Disease Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. \n【1】 Inflammation results from a cell-mediated immune response in the gastrointestinal mucosa.  The precise etiology of inflammatory bowel disease unknown, but evidence suggests that the normal intestinal flora inappropriately trigger an immune reaction in patients with a multifactorial genetic predisposition (perhaps involving abnormal epithelial barriers and mucosal immune defenses).  No specific environmental, dietary, or infectious causes have been identified.  The immune reaction involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor.  Although Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are similar, they can be distinguished in most cases .  About 10% of colitis cases are not initially distinguishable and are termed unclassified; if a surgical pathologic specimen cannot be classified, it is termed indeterminate colitis.  The term colitis applies only to inflammatory disease of the colon (eg, ulcerative, granulomatous, ischemic, radiation-induced, infectious). \n【2】  Differentiating Crohn Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Crohn Disease Ulcerative Colitis Small bowel is involved in 80% of cases.  Disease is confined to the colon.  Rectum is often spared; colonic involvement is usually right-sided.  Rectum is invariably involved; colonic involvement is usually left-sided.  Gross rectal bleeding is rare, except in 75‒85% of cases of Crohn colitis.  Gross rectal bleeding is always present.  Fistula, mass, and abscess development is common.  Fistulas do not occur.  Perianal lesions are significant in 25‒35% of cases.  Significant perianal lesions never occur.  On x-ray, bowel wall is affected asymmetrically and segmentally, with skip areas between diseased segments.  Bowel wall is affected symmetrically and uninterruptedly from rectum proximally.  Endoscopic appearance is patchy, with discrete ulcerations separated by segments of normal-appearing mucosa.  Inflammation is uniform and diffuse.  Microscopic inflammation and fissuring extend transmurally; lesions are often highly focal in distribution.  Inflammation is confined to mucosa except in severe cases.  Epithelioid (sarcoid-like) granulomas are detected in bowel wall or lymph nodes in 25‒50% of cases (pathognomonic).  Typical epithelioid granulomas do not occur. \n【3】 Epidemiology Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects people of all ages but usually begins before age 30, with peak incidence from 14 to 24.  IBD may have a second smaller peak between ages 50 and 70; however, this later peak may include some cases of ischemic colitis.  IBD is most common among people of Northern European and Anglo-Saxon origin and is 2 to 4 times more common among Ashkenazi Jews than non-Jewish White people from the same geographic location.  The incidence is lower in central and southern Europe and lower still in South America, Asia, and Africa.  However, the incidence is increasing among Black and Latin American people living in North America.  Both sexes are equally affected.  First-degree relatives of patients with IBD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk; their absolute risk may be as high as 7%.  Familial tendency is much higher in Crohn disease than in ulcerative colitis.  Several gene mutations conferring a higher risk of Crohn disease (and some possibly related to ulcerative colitis) have been identified.  Cigarette smoking seems to contribute to development or exacerbation of Crohn disease but decreases risk of ulcerative colitis.  Appendectomy done to treat appendicitis also appears to lower the risk of ulcerative colitis.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate IBD.  Oral contraceptives may increase the risk of Crohn disease.  Some data suggest that perinatal illness and the use of antibiotics in childhood may be associated with an increased risk of IBD.  For unclear reasons, people who have a higher socioeconomic status may have an increased risk of Crohn disease.  Pearls & Pitfalls Cigarette smoking decreases the risk of ulcerative colitis.  Extraintestinal Manifestations Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis both affect organs other than the intestines.  Most extraintestinal manifestations are more common in ulcerative colitis and Crohn colitis than in Crohn disease limited to the small bowel.  Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are categorized in 3 ways: 1.  Disorders that usually parallel (ie, wax and wane with) IBD flare-ups: These disorders include peripheral arthritis, episcleritis is self-limiting, recurring, usually idiopathic inflammation of the episcleral tissue that does not threaten vision. \n【4】 Etiology is unclear.  Diagnosis is clinical. \n【5】 Arthritis tends to involve large joints and be migratory and transient.  One or more of these parallel disorders develops in more than one third of patients hospitalized with IBD.  2. \n【6】 However, the retina and fluid within the anterior chamber and vitreous are often involved as well. \n【7】 Diagnosis is clinical. \n【8】 Ankylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in IBD patients with human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27).  Most patients with spinal or sacroiliac involvement have evidence of uveitis and vice versa.  Primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is a risk factor for cancer of the biliary tract, is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn colitis.  Cholangitis may appear before or concurrently with the bowel disease or even 20 years after colectomy.  Liver disease (eg, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis, pericholangitis, cirrhosis) occurs in 3 to 5% of patients, although minor abnormalities in liver tests are more common.  Some of these conditions (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis) may precede IBD by many years and, when diagnosed, should prompt an evaluation for IBD.  3.  Disorders that are consequences of disrupted bowel physiology: These disorders occur mainly in severe Crohn disease of the small bowel.  Malabsorption Overview of Malabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or transport. \n【9】 In children, malabsorption retards growth and development.  Other disorders include kidney stones resulting from excessive dietary oxalate absorption, hydroureter and hydronephrosis resulting from ureteral compression by the intestinal inflammatory process, gallstones resulting from impaired ileal reabsorption of bile salts, and amyloidosis secondary to long-standing inflammatory and suppurative disease.  Thromboembolic disease may occur as a result of multiple factors in all 3 categories.  Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Supportive care 5-Aminosalicylic acid 5-Aminosalicylic Acid (5-ASA, Mesalamine) Several classes of drugs are helpful for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Details of their selection and use are discussed under each disorder .  Details of their selection and use are discussed under each disorder  Small-molecule agents Several classes of drugs are helpful for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \n【10】 Those < 50 years of age who have IBD may receive the vaccine, and clinicians should engage in a shared decision-making discussion with patients to determine whether they should be vaccinated .  This vaccine should be given before starting immunosuppressive therapy when possible.  Routine vaccinations such as tetanus-diphtheria Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccine A vaccine for tetanus alone is available, but the tetanus vaccine is typically combined with those for diphtheria and/or pertussis. \n【11】 HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPV. \n【12】 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology recommend patients with IBD, including those on immunosuppressive therapy, receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n【13】 Screening tests Female patients who are not receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be screened for cervical cancer with a Papanicolaou (Pap) test Diagnosis Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma.  The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. \n【14】 Patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy should have a Pap test yearly.  All patients who are taking or plan to take immunomodulating drugs or biologic agents should be evaluated for skin cancer Overview of Skin Cancer Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer and commonly develops in sun-exposed areas of skin. \n【15】 Patients at risk of osteoporosis Risk Factors Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "173caed1-bd6e-49b7-92c6-6102c281f70c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Guillain-Barré syndrome is a form of polyneuropathy causing muscle weakness, which usually worsens over a few days to weeks, then slowly improves or returns to normal on its own.  With treatment, people may improve more quickly.  Guillain-Barré syndrome is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction.  Usually, weakness begins in both legs and moves up the body.  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help confirm the diagnosis.  People with Guillain-Barré syndrome are hospitalized immediately because symptoms can worsen rapidly.  Immune globulin given intravenously or plasma exchange speeds recovery.   Guillain-Barré syndrome affects many peripheral nerves Overview of the Peripheral Nervous System The peripheral nervous system refers to the parts of the nervous system that are outside the central nervous system, that is, those outside the brain and spinal cord. \n【1】 The presumed cause of Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune reaction Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues.  What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known.  In about two thirds of people with Guillain-Barré syndrome, symptoms begin about 5 days to 3 weeks after a mild infection ,such as a Campylobacter infection Campylobacter Infections Several species of the gram-negative bacteria Campylobacter (most commonly Campylobacter jejuni) can infect the digestive tract, often causing diarrhea. \n【2】 The virus is spread through kissing. \n【3】 Symptoms of COVID-19 vary significantly. \n【4】 Insulating a Nerve Fiber Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.  These layers form the myelin sheath.  Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, the myelin sheath enables nerve signals (electrical impulses) to be conducted along the nerve fiber with speed and accuracy.  When the myelin sheath is damaged (called demyelination), nerves do not conduct electrical impulses normally.  Weakness caused by Guillain-Barré syndrome usually worsens over 3 or 4 weeks, then remains the same or starts to return to normal. \n【5】 Symptoms of GBS Symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome usually begin in both legs, then progress upward to the arms.  Occasionally, symptoms begin in the arms or head and progress downward.  Symptoms include weakness and a pins-and-needles sensation or loss of sensation.  Weakness is more prominent than abnormal sensation.  Reflexes are decreased or absent.  In 90% of people who have Guillain-Barré syndrome, weakness is most severe 3 to 4 weeks after symptoms start.  In 5 to 10%, the muscles that control breathing become so weak that a mechanical ventilator is needed.  When the disorder is severe, the facial and swallowing muscles become weak in more than half of affected people.  When these muscles are weak, people may choke when they are eating or become dehydrated and malnourished.  If the disorder is very severe, internal functions controlled by the autonomic nervous system Overview of the Autonomic Nervous System The autonomic nervous system regulates certain body processes, such as blood pressure and the rate of breathing. \n【6】 For example, blood pressure may fluctuate widely, heart rhythm may become abnormal, people may retain urine, and severe constipation may develop.  In a variant called Miller-Fisher syndrome, only a few symptoms develop: Eye movements become paralyzed, walking becomes unsteady, and normal reflexes disappear.  Diagnosis of GBS A doctor's evaluation Electromyography and nerve conduction studies, magnetic resonance imaging, blood tests, and a spinal tap Doctors can usually diagnose Guillain-Barré syndrome based on the pattern of symptoms.  However, tests are done to confirm the diagnosis.  If doctors suspect Guillain-Barré syndrome, people are admitted to the hospital to have the tests because the syndrome can worsen rapidly and impair the muscles involved in breathing.  Breathing is evaluated frequently.  Tests may include the following: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds the brain and spinal cord) obtained by a spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【7】 For example, MRI can help exclude spinal cord damage due to compression of the Spinal Cord Injuries and disorders can put pressure on the spinal cord, causing back or neck pain, tingling, muscle weakness, and other symptoms. \n【8】 A combination of high protein levels and few or no white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and characteristic results from electromyography strongly suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Prognosis of GBS Damage stops progressing within 8 weeks.  Without treatment, most people with Guillain-Barré syndrome improve slowly over several months.  However, with early treatment, people can improve very quickly—in days or weeks.  About 30% of adults and even more children with the disorder have residual weakness 3 years after the syndrome began.  On average, fewer than 2% of people die. \n【9】 Treatment of GBS Hospitalization and supportive care If needed, use of a ventilator to help with breathing Immune globulin or plasma exchange Guillain-Barré syndrome can worsen rapidly and is a medical emergency.  People who develop this syndrome should be hospitalized immediately.  The sooner appropriate treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.  If symptoms strongly suggest Guillain-Barré syndrome, treatment is usually started without waiting for test results.  Supportive care In the hospital, people are closely monitored so that breathing can be assisted with a ventilator if necessary.  People with weak facial and neck muscles may need to be fed through a catheter inserted in a vein ,intravenous feeding Intravenous Feeding Intravenous feeding is used when the digestive tract cannot adequately absorb nutrients, as occurs in severe malabsorption disorders. \n【10】 Fluids may be given intravenously.  Being unable to move because muscles are weak can cause many problems, such as pressure sores Pressure Sores Pressure sores are areas of skin damage resulting from a lack of blood flow due to prolonged pressure. \n【11】 So nurses take precautions to prevent pressure sores and injuries by providing soft mattresses and by turning the people with severe weakness every 2 hours.  Physical therapy is started to help prevent contractures and preserve joint and muscle function and the ability to walk.  Heat therapy may be used to make physical therapy more comfortable.  Physical therapy may begin with the therapist moving the limbs for people (passive exercise).  As the weakness subsides, people should move their own limbs (active exercise).  Immune globulin or plasma exchange Immune globulin (a solution containing many different antibodies collected from a group of donors), given early and by vein (intravenously) for 5 days, is the treatment of choice for Guillain-Barré syndrome.  If immune globulin is ineffective, plasma exchange Plateletpheresis (platelet donation) In addition to normal blood donation and transfusion, special procedures are sometimes used.  In plateletpheresis, a donor gives only platelets rather than whole blood. \n【12】 These treatments shorten the hospital stay, speed recovery, and reduce the risk of death and permanent disability.  Plasma exchange is usually done as soon as possible if people are worsening quickly.  However, removing and replacing a lot of blood through a tube (catheter) inserted in a vein can cause low blood pressure and increase the risk of infection.  Because plasma exchange removes immune globulin from the blood, plasma exchange is not used at the same time as immune globulin.  Plasma exchange is delayed for at least 2 to 3 days after immune globulin is given.  Other treatments Corticosteroids do not help and may worsen Guillain-Barré syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis is by endoscopy. \n【3】 Diagnosis is by ultrasonography. \n【4】 Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【5】 Also, the rates of other common cancers (eg, lung, head and neck, and cervical carcinomas; hepatomas) are several times higher in patients infected with HIV than in the general population.  This finding may reflect, at least in part, greater exposure to the viruses or toxins that cause these cancers: hepatitis B and C for hepatoma, human papillomavirus for cervical, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal carcinoma, and alcohol and tobacco for lung and head and neck carcinomas. \n【6】 Most cases are B-cell, aggressive, high-grade histologic subtype lymphomas.  At diagnosis, extranodal sites are usually involved; they include bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and other sites that are unusual in non–HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma, such as the central nervous system and body cavities (eg, pleural, pericardial, peritoneal).  Common presentations include rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or extranodal masses and systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, fevers).  Diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by biopsy with histopathologic and immunochemical analysis of tumor cells.  Abnormal circulating lymphocytes or unexpected cytopenias suggest involvement of the bone marrow, mandating bone marrow biopsy.  Tumor staging may require cerebrospinal fluid examination and CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and other areas where tumors are suspected.  Poor prognosis is predicted by the following: CD4 count of < 100/mcL Age > 35 years Poor functional status Bone marrow involvement History of opportunistic infections High-grade histologic subtype Treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is with various regimens of systemic, multidrug chemotherapy that includes cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide.  These drugs are combined with IV rituximab and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and supplemented with antiretroviral therapy (ART), prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals, and hematologic growth factors.  Therapy may be limited by severe myelosuppression, particularly when combinations of myelosuppressive antitumor or antiretroviral drugs are used.  Radiation therapy may debulk large tumors and control pain or bleeding.  Primary central nervous system lymphoma Incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma Primary Brain Lymphomas Primary brain lymphomas, a type of primary central nervous system lymphoma, originate in neural tissue and are usually B-cell tumors. \n【7】 Primary central nervous system lymphomas consist of intermediate- or high-grade malignant B cells, originating in central nervous system tissue.  These lymphomas do not spread systemically, but the prognosis is poor; median survival is < 6 months.  Presenting symptoms include headache, seizures, neurologic deficits (eg, cranial nerve palsies), and mental status changes.  Acute treatment of primary central nervous system lymphomas requires control of cerebral edema using corticosteroids.  Although whole-brain radiation therapy and antitumor chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate alone or combined with other chemotherapy drugs or rituximab are commonly used, none of these regimens has been rigorously evaluated.  In observational studies of ART and in a single clinical trial of rituximab, survival appeared improved.  Cervical cancer In women infected with HIV, prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells. \n【8】 However, cervical cancers, if they occur, are more extensive, are more difficult to cure, and have higher recurrence rates after treatment.  Confirmed risk factors for cervical cancer in women infected with HIV include the following: Infection with HPV subtype 16 or 18 CD4 count of < 200/mcL Age > 34 years Management methods for CIN or cervical cancer is not changed by HIV infection.  Frequent Papanicolaou tests are important to monitor for progression of CIN.  ART may result in resolution of HPV infection and regression of CIN but has no clear effects on cancer.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus or vulva Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus Anal Cancer Anal cancer accounts for an estimated 8590 cases and about 1350 deaths in the US annually .

Anorectal fistulas are common among people who have an anorectal abscess, Crohn disease, or tuberculosis.  Anorectal fistulas can cause pain and produce pus.  The diagnosis is based on an examination and other viewing techniques.  Treatment may involve surgery, but some less invasive alternatives exist.  The rectum is the section of the digestive tract above the anus where stool is held before it passes out of the body through the anus.  The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body.   Most fistulas begin in a deep gland in the wall of the anus or rectum.  Sometimes fistulas occur after drainage of an anorectal abscess Anorectal Abscess An anorectal abscess is a pus-filled cavity caused by bacteria invading a mucus-secreting gland in the anus and rectum. \n【1】 It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved. \n【2】 They also occur in people with diverticulitis is inflammation of one or more balloon-like sacs (diverticula).

Cause is usually unknown, although secondary causes include drugs, infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.  Manifestations include insidious onset of edema and heavy proteinuria with benign urinary sediment, normal renal function, and normal or elevated blood pressure.  Diagnosis is by renal biopsy.  Spontaneous remission is common.  Treatment of patients at high risk of progression is usually with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil.   The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in the glomerular podocyte has been identified as the major target antigen in deposited immune-complexes.  Membranous nephropathy mostly affects adults, in whom it is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome Overview of Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is urinary excretion of > 3 g of protein/day due to a glomerular disorder plus edema and hypoalbuminemia. \n【1】 Symptoms include blood in the stool and change in bowel habits.  Screening using one of several methods is recommended for appropriate populations. \n【2】 Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography. \n【3】 Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). \n【4】 Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【5】 Membranous nephropathy is rare in children and, when it occurs, is usually due to hepatitis B virus infection or SLE.  Renal vein thrombosis Renal Vein Thrombosis Renal vein thrombosis is thrombotic occlusion of one or both main renal veins, resulting in acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. \n【6】 It may progress to pulmonary embolism.  Symptoms and Signs Patients typically present with edema and nephrotic-range proteinuria and occasionally with microscopic hematuria and hypertension.  Symptoms and signs of a disorder causing membranous nephropathy (eg, a cancer) may be present initially.  Diagnosis Renal biopsy Evaluation for secondary causes Diagnosis is suggested by development of nephrotic syndrome, particularly in patients who have potential causes of membranous nephropathy.  The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【7】 Proteinuria is in the nephrotic range in 80%.  Laboratory testing is done as indicated for nephrotic syndrome Overview of Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is urinary excretion of > 3 g of protein/day due to a glomerular disorder plus edema and hypoalbuminemia. \n【8】 The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), if measured, is normal or decreased.  Immune complexes are seen as dense deposits on electron microscopy .  Subepithelial dense deposits occur with early disease, with spikes of lamina densa between the deposits.  Later, deposits appear within the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and marked thickening occurs.  A diffuse, granular pattern of IgG deposition occurs along the GBM without cellular proliferation, exudation, or necrosis.  Identifying presence or absence of PLA2R antibody and the subclass of IgG deposits may help to differentiate idiopathic from secondary membranous nephropathy.  For example, the deposits in idiopathic membranous nephropathy are PLA2R antibody positive and predominantly IgG 4, whereas PLA2R antibody is typically negative and IgG 1 and 2 predominate in malignancy-associated membranous nephropathy ,1 Diagnosis reference Membranous nephropathy is deposition of immune complexes on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) with GBM thickening. \n【9】 Electron microscopic features in immunologic glomerular disorders Membranous Nephropathy (Dense Deposits) Medium-sized subepithelial dense deposits are seen on transmission electron microscopy in late stage I disease (×10,200). \n【10】 Membranous Nephropathy (Basement Membrane Spikes) Spikes of basement membrane silver-staining material protrude from the basement membrane (high-power oil-immersion view, Jones silver stain, original magnification ×1000). \n【11】 Membranous Nephropathy (IgG Deposition) Diffuse coarsely granular IgG deposition along glomerular capillary walls (immunofluorescence with anti-IgG, original magnification ×100). \n【12】 Diagnosis of cause Evaluation of patients diagnosed with membranous nephropathy usually includes the following: A search for occult cancer, particularly in a patient who has lost weight, has unexplained anemia or heme-positive stools, or is older Consideration of drug-induced membranous nephropathy Hepatitis B and C serologic testing Serology Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. \n【13】 Prognosis About 25% of patients undergo spontaneous remission, 25% develop persistent, non-nephrotic–range proteinuria, 25% develop persistent nephrotic syndrome, and 25% progress to end-stage renal disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【14】 Women, children, and young adults with non-nephrotic–range proteinuria and patients with persistently normal renal function 3 years after diagnosis tend to have little disease progression.  More than 50% of patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria who are asymptomatic or who have edema that can be controlled with diuretics will have a partial or complete remission within 3 to 4 years.  Risk of progression to renal failure is highest among patients with Persistent proteinuria ≥ 8 g/day, particularly men age > 50 years An elevated serum creatinine level at presentation or diagnosis Biopsy evidence of substantial interstitial inflammation Treatment of secondary causes and of nephrotic syndrome as indicated Immunosuppressive therapy for patients at high risk of progression Kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease Primary treatment is that of the causes.  Among patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, asymptomatic patients with non-nephrotic–range proteinuria do not require treatment; renal function should be monitored periodically (eg, twice yearly when apparently stable).  Patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria who are asymptomatic or who have edema that can be controlled with diuretics should be treated for nephrotic syndrome.  Patients with hypertension should be given an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB); these drugs may also benefit patients without hypertension by reducing proteinuria.  Immunosuppressive therapy Immunosuppressants should be considered only for patients with symptomatic idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and for those most at risk of progressive disease.  However, there is no strong evidence that adults with nephrotic syndrome benefit long-term from immunosuppressive therapy.  Older and chronically ill patients are at greater risk of infectious complications due to immunosuppressants.  No consensus protocol exists, but historically, a common regimen included corticosteroids, followed by chlorambucil.  However, this regimen is not often used currently .  There is no strong evidence that adults with nephrotic syndrome have a long-term benefit from treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.  Most experts favor use of combinations of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids because of their better safety profile.  More recent evidence has suggested a benefit in using rituximab ,1 Treatment reference Membranous nephropathy is deposition of immune complexes on the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) with GBM thickening. \n【15】 Therapies of unproven long-term value include IV immune globulin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Initial manifestations are typically those of nephrotic syndrome (eg, edema, nephrotic-range proteinuria, occasionally microscopic hematuria and hypertension).  Confirm the diagnosis with renal biopsy and consider associated disorders and causes.  Treat nephrotic syndrome and treat hypertension initially with angiotensin inhibition.

Some congenital GI malformations, such as malrotation of the Bowel Malrotation of the bowel is failure of the bowel to assume its normal place in the abdomen during intrauterine development.  Diagnosis is by abdominal x-ray.  Treatment is surgical repair. A common type of anomaly is atresia, in which a segment of the GI tract fails to form or develop normally, or it forms and then is destroyed by an intrauterine event (vascular disruption).  The most common type is esophageal atresia Esophageal Atresia Esophageal atresia is incomplete formation of the esophagus, frequently associated with tracheoesophageal fistula. \n【1】 Diagnosis is by abdominal x-ray. \n【2】 Immediate management includes bowel decompression (by continuous nasogastric suction to prevent emesis, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia or further abdominal distention with respiratory compromise) and referral to a center for neonatal surgery.  Also vital are maintenance of body temperature, prevention of hypoglycemia with IV 10% dextrose and electrolytes, and prevention or treatment of acidosis and infections so that the infant is in optimal condition for surgery.

This virus Overview of Viral Infections A virus is composed of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat.  It requires a living cell in which to multiply. \n【1】 Most people have no symptoms, but some feel ill and have a fever, and people with a weakened immune system can have serious symptoms, including blindness.  Cytomegalovirus can cause serious illness in infants who are infected before birth.  Doctors may detect the infection by culturing a sample of infected body fluid, such as urine.  Often, no treatment is required, but if the infection is severe, antiviral drugs may be used.  Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is very common.  CMV is a type of herpesvirus Overview of Herpesvirus Infections Some common viral infections are caused by herpesviruses. \n【2】 Blood tests show that 60 to 90% of adults have had a CMV infection at some time.  CMV may cause symptoms soon after infection.  Also, it remains dormant (inactive) in various tissues for life.  Various stimuli can reactivate the dormant CMV, resulting in virus growth which can sometimes cause disease.  The lungs, gastrointestinal tract, brain, spinal cord, or eyes may be infected.  Usually, CMV infection causes no symptoms.  Serious infections typically develop only in infants infected before birth Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection in Newborns Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that usually causes few or no problems but can cause serious illness in infants who are infected before birth or around the time of birth. \n【3】 In people with a weakened immune system, disease often results from reactivation of the dormant virus.  Transmission of CMV Infected people may shed cytomegalovirus in their urine or saliva intermittently.  The virus is also excreted in mucus in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus), semen, stool, and breast milk.  Thus, the virus is spread through sexual and nonsexual contact.  If a pregnant woman is infected, the fetus may acquire the infection during the pregnancy, or the baby may acquire the infection during delivery.  CMV infection may develop in people who receive a transfusion of infected blood or an infected organ transplant.  People who have received an organ transplant Overview of Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body. \n【4】 Symptoms of CMV Infection Most people infected with cytomegalovirus have no symptoms.  A few infected people feel ill and have a fever.  Infection with CMV, like that with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a type 4 herpesvirus), can cause a type of infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Epstein-Barr virus causes a number of diseases, including infectious mononucleosis.  The virus is spread through kissing. \n【5】 Both CMV and EBV mononucleosis cause fever and fatigue.  But EBV also causes a severe sore throat.  CMV does not.  An uninfected person who receives a transfusion of blood containing CMV and becomes infected can have a fever, and sometimes liver inflammation develops 2 to 4 weeks later.  In people with a weakened immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders. \n【6】 In people with AIDS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【7】 The virus can infect the retina of the eye.  This infection (CMV retinitis) can cause blindness.  Infection of the brain ,encephalitis is inflammation of the brain that occurs when a virus directly infects the brain or when a virus, vaccine, or something else triggers inflammation. \n【8】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【9】 If a pregnant woman transmits CMV to the fetus, the following may result: Miscarriage A miscarriage is the loss of a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n【10】 Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus. \n【11】 Newborns who survive may have hearing loss and intellectual disability.  Diagnosis of CMV Infection In newborns, urine culture Blood tests In people with a weakened immune system, often biopsy Cytomegalovirus infection may not be recognized immediately.  Diagnosis of CMV infection is often unnecessary in healthy adults and children because treatment is unnecessary.  However, doctors consider the possibility of CMV infection in the following people: Otherwise healthy people who have fever and fatigue People who have a weakened immune system Overview of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders. \n【12】 In newborns, the diagnosis is usually made by sending a sample of urine to a laboratory to grow (culture) and identify the virus.  Blood tests that detect antibodies to CMV can confirm a new infection. \n【13】 But these tests cannot confirm whether disease is present.  For instance, disease can be caused by reactivation of the virus, as in people with a weakened immune system.  In these people, a biopsy of affected tissues is often necessary to confirm CMV disease.  Blood tests to estimate how many viruses are present may also be done.  CMV retinitis can be identified by an ophthalmologist, who examines internal eye structures to check for characteristic abnormalities using an ophthalmoscope Ophthalmoscopy A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor. \n【14】 Treatment of CMV Infection For CMV retinitis, antiviral drugs For people with HIV/AIDS, drugs used to treat HIV infections Mild cytomegalovirus infection is usually not treated.  It subsides on its own.  When the infection threatens life or eyesight, an antiviral drug Antiviral drugs A virus is composed of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat. \n【15】 These drugs may be given by mouth or by vein.  When CMV retinitis is very severe, the drugs may also be injected directly into the eye.  These drugs have serious side effects  and do not cure the infection.  However, treatment slows the disease's progression and may preserve sight.  Antiviral drugs are used to treat other severe symptoms due to CMV but are less reliably effective than when used to treat retinitis.  If CMV infection occurs in people whose immune system is temporarily weakened or suppressed (by a disorder or drug), the infection usually subsides when the immune system recovers or the drug is stopped.

Most cancers that affect the fallopian tubes have spread from other parts of the body.  At first, women may have vague symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort or bloating, or no symptoms.  Computed tomography is done to check for abnormalities, and surgery is done to confirm the diagnosis.  Usually, the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, adjacent lymph nodes, and surrounding tissues are removed, followed by chemotherapy.   In the United States, fewer than 1% of gynecologic cancers are fallopian tube cancers.  Cancer that starts in the fallopian tubes is rare.  Locating the Internal Female Reproductive Organs Women are usually postmenopausal when fallopian tube cancer is diagnosed.  Risk factors for fallopian tube cancer include the following: Older age Long-term (chronic) inflammation of the fallopian tubes (chronic salpingitis) Infertility More than 95% of fallopian tube cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from gland cells.  A few are sarcomas, which develop from connective tissue.  Fallopian tube cancer spreads in much the same way as ovarian cancer: Usually directly to the surrounding area Through the shedding of cancer cells into the abdominal cavity Through the lymphatic system to other parts of the pelvis and abdomen and eventually to distant parts of the body Symptoms of Fallopian Tube Cancer Symptoms of fallopian cancer include vague abdominal discomfort, bloating, and pain in the pelvic area or abdomen.  Some women have a watery discharge from the vagina.  When cancer is advanced, the abdominal cavity may fill with fluid (a condition called ascites), and women may feel a large lump (mass) in the pelvis.  Diagnosis of Fallopian Tube Cancer Computed tomography Surgery to confirm the diagnosis Fallopian tube cancer is seldom diagnosed early.  Occasionally, it is diagnosed early when a mass or other abnormality is detected during a routine pelvic examination or an imaging test done for another reason.  Usually, the cancer is not diagnosed until it is advanced, when it is obvious because a large mass or severe ascites is present.  If fallopian tube cancer is suspected, computed tomography (CT) is usually done.  If the results suggest cancer, surgery is done to confirm the diagnosis, determine the extent of the spread (staging), and remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Doctors consider recommending genetic testing for any woman who is diagnosed with fallopian tube (or ovarian) cancer.  Doctors also ask about any cancers family members have had.  This information helps doctors identify women who are more likely to have a hereditary form of cancer, such as that caused by mutations in BRCA genes.  Staging Doctors stage the cancer based on how far it has spread: Stage I: The cancer occurs only in one or both fallopian tubes.  Stage II: The cancer has spread to nearby tissues but is still within the pelvis (which contains the internal reproductive organs, bladder, and rectum).  Stage III: The cancer has spread outside the pelvis to lymph nodes and/or to abdominal organs (such as the surface of the liver).  Stage IV: The cancer has spread to distant organs.  Staging of fallopian tube cancer requires surgery to biopsy the abnormal areas and to remove and check nearby lymph nodes.  Prognosis of Fallopian Tube Cancer The prognosis for women who have fallopian tube cancer is similar to that for women who have ovarian cancer.  Prognosis depends on the stage of the cancer and the woman's age.  The percentages of women who are alive 5 years after diagnosis and treatment (the 5-year survival rate) are Stage I: About 90 to 95% Stage II: About 70 to 80% Stage III: About 50 to 60% Stage IV: About 20% Treatment of Fallopian Tube Cancer Usually, removal of the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, adjacent lymph nodes, and surrounding tissues Sometimes removal of all tissue that appears affected (cytoreductive surgery) Chemotherapy Treatment of fallopian tube cancer almost always consists of removal of the uterus , hysterectomy Cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is thus also called endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause. \n【1】 These procedures are usually done when surgery to stage the cancer is done.  Sometimes surgery to stage and treat fallopian cancer can be done using a laparoscope Laparoscopy is an examination of the abdominal cavity using a fiberoptic instrument inserted through the abdominal wall.  This is a surgical procedure done in an operating room. \n【2】 For more advanced cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, doctors usually remove as much of the cancer as possible to prolong survival.  This type of surgery is called cytoreductive surgery.  Depending on where the cancer has spread, women may be treated with chemotherapy instead of or before and/or after surgery.  Chemotherapy  is usually necessary after surgery.  Chemotherapy may be used to destroy any small areas of cancer that may remain.  The most commonly used chemotherapy drugs are carboplatin plus paclitaxel.  Radiation therapy is rarely useful.  For cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, removing as much of the cancer as possible improves the prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Delivery Labor is the first stage of childbirth. \n【1】 You'll usually go into labor anywhere from 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after your due date Pregnancy Tests and Due Dates Pregnancy begins with fertilization (when a sperm enters an egg) and ends with delivery (when the baby is born).  Pregnancy lasts about 9 months. \n【2】 Menstrual cramps are pains in your lower belly that happen a few days before, during, or after your period. \n【3】 Serious problems are relatively rare, and most can be anticipated and treated effectively. \n【4】 The cervix has a small opening that stays tightly closed while you're pregnant.  During labor, your contractions gradually pull the cervix open until it's wide enough for your baby to come out.  Labor has 2 parts: Early labor Active labor During early labor: Your cervix begins to thin and opens up about 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 centimeters) Contractions come and go and get stronger and more evenly spaced The pain isn't too bad During active labor: Your cervix opens fully, about 4 inches (10 centimeters) and thins out completely Your baby drops (moves lower into your pelvis and gets ready to enter the birth canal) You start to feel like you need to push the baby out Pain is more intense Your water breaking is when the amniotic sac breaks and amniotic fluid comes out of your vagina.  This may happen before labor starts or during labor.  You can't deliver your baby Delivery Labor is the first stage of childbirth. \n【5】 How will I know when labor starts? The main signs of labor are: Contractions, which may feel like menstrual cramps that come and go at regular intervals Back pain Before contractions or back pain, early signs that labor is about to start include: Bloody show (a small amount of blood and mucus that comes out of your vagina at the start of labor) Your \"water breaking\" If your water breaks, you should call your doctor or midwife right away.  Usually, labor starts within 24 hours.  However, if it doesn’t start within several hours, your doctor or midwife may start your labor with medicines.  If your water breaks more than 6 weeks before your due date, your doctor may give you medicine to stop labor.  This lets the baby grow a little more before being born.  When should I go to my hospital or birthing center? You should go to your hospital or birthing center when one of the following happens: Your water breaks Your contractions last 30 seconds or more and are less than 6 minutes apart A doctor or midwife will check to see whether you're actually in labor.  Near their due date, some women have cramps that feel like labor but aren't.  If you’re not in labor yet, you'll be sent home.  If you're in labor, your doctor will: Check your vagina to see if your water has broken and, if it has, check the color of the fluid Touch your cervix to see how far it's open Feel your belly to see what position the baby is in Put an IV into an arm vein to help give you medicines and fluids during labor If you've delivered a baby before and it was fast (took less than 6 hours), you should let your doctor know as soon as you think labor has started.  You'll likely deliver quickly because each labor is usually shorter than the one before.  How do doctors check the baby during labor? During labor, the main thing that tells doctors how the baby's doing is: The baby's heart rate Doctors may check the baby’s heartbeat using: A stethoscope An ultrasound device placed on your belly An electronic fetal heart monitor placed inside your vagina to continuously record your baby’s heartbeat If your baby’s heartbeat is too fast or too slow, your baby may be having complications Introduction to Complications of Labor and Delivery Usually, labor and delivery occur without any problems.  Serious problems are relatively rare, and most can be anticipated and treated effectively. \n【6】 Your doctors may do an ultrasound of the baby.  How do doctors treat labor pain? The amount of pain during labor varies.  Some women need more pain relief than others during labor.  Taking childbirth classes during pregnancy and having a support person with you can help you feel more comfortable during labor and may lower your need for pain medicine.  During pregnancy, you'll talk with your doctor or midwife about what kind of pain relief you want.  Pain medicines during labor include: IV opioid pain medicines, such as morphine or fentanyl, which make you more comfortable but may cause your baby to breathe too slowly if you get the medicine too close to when the baby is delivered An epidural block, which is an injection of numbing medicine (local anesthetic) or pain medicine into your lower back to numb nerves around your spinal cord A nerve block, in which doctors inject numbing medicine inside your vagina to block pain signals from major nerves Local anesthesia, shots of numbing medicine around the outside of your vagina just before the baby comes out Natural childbirth uses relaxation and breathing techniques instead of medicine to control labor pains and lower your need for pain medicine.  Some women doing natural childbirth don't use any pain medicine.  To prepare, you and a support person usually take childbirth classes over several weeks to learn about labor and how to breathe and relax through it.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

The pelvic cavity also contains the intestines, bladder, and lower ureters.  A pelvic mass may originate from any of these structures.  A pelvic mass may be detected during routine gynecologic examination or an imaging test.  A pelvic mass may be noncancerous or cancerous Introduction to Gynecologic Tumors Gynecologic cancers often involve the uterus, ovaries, cervix, vulva, vagina, fallopian tubes, or the peritoneum. \n【1】 Etiology of Pelvic Mass Pelvic masses may originate from the upper female reproductive tract (cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries) or from other pelvic structures (intestines, bladder, ureters).  Type of mass in the female reproductive tract tends to vary by age group: In infants, in utero maternal hormones may stimulate development of follicular ovarian cysts in a fetus or during the first few months of life.  This effect is rare.  In children, prepubertalmasses are uncommon.  Ovarian masses may be follicular ovarian cysts or, rarely, benign or malignant tumors.  In women of reproductive age, the most common cause of symmetric uterine enlargement is pregnancy.  Another common uterine mass is a uterine fibroid Uterine Fibroids Uterine fibroids are benign uterine tumors of smooth muscle origin. \n【2】 Adnexal masses are often related to the menstrual cycle; they include follicular ovarian cysts Functional ovarian cysts Benign ovarian masses include functional cysts (eg, corpus luteum cysts) and neoplasms (eg, benign teratomas).  Most are asymptomatic; some cause pelvic pain. \n【3】 These cysts often resolve spontaneously within a few months. \n【4】 Most are asymptomatic; some cause pelvic pain. endometriosis In endometriosis, functioning endometrial cells are implanted in the pelvis outside the uterine cavity.  Symptoms depend on location of the implants. \n【5】 In postmenopausal women, a new or growing pelvic mass is more likely to be cancerous.  Many benign ovarian or uterine masses (eg, endometriomas, adenomas, fibroids) depend on ovarian hormone secretion and thus do not develop or enlarge after menopause.  Metastatic cancer of the breast, colon, or stomach may first manifest as an adnexal mass.  Evaluation of Pelvic Mass History General medical and complete obstetric and gynecologic histories are obtained. \n【6】 Symptoms depend on location of the implants. \n【7】 If malignancy is suspected, evaluation for groin or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is indicated.  A complete gynecologic examination is done.  Distinguishing uterine from adnexal masses may be difficult.  If ectopic pregnancy is suspected, excess pressure during examination is avoided to prevent rupture.  Advanced endometriosis can manifest as nonmobile cul-de-sac masses.  Cervical motion tenderness occurs in pelvic infection (and appendicitis).  Nonmobile masses may be inflammatory (eg, due to endometrioma, hydrosalpinx, or tubo-ovarian abscess) or malignant.  Hydrosalpinges are usually fluctuant, tender, nonmobile, and sometimes bilateral.  In early pregnancy or in young girls, pelvic organ masses may be palpable in the abdomen because the space in the pelvis is too small to contain a large mass.  Testing If women of reproductive age have a pelvic mass, a pregnancy test should be done regardless of menstrual or sexual history. \n【8】 If a suspected mass is not detected during examination or the cause cannot be determined, an imaging test is done.  Usually, pelvic ultrasonography is done first. \n【9】 The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group developed the Simple Rules to preoperatively assess risk of cancer in women who have ovarian or other adnexal tumors that are thought to require surgery.  Classification is based on the presence or absence of 10 ultrasound features and has a higher sensitivity and specificity than other classification scores. \n【10】 If ultrasonography does not clearly delineate size, location, and consistency of the mass, another imaging test may do so.  MRI is typically used for further evaluation of the mass; CT is useful for evaluating suspected metastases.  Radiographic characteristics that suggest cancer include a solid component (particularly those with a blood supply), thick septations, surface excrescences, ascites, and additional intraabdominal masses.  Suspected adnexal masses are evaluated with surgical exploration because biopsy may spread malignant cells.  Tumor markers may help in the diagnosis of specific tumors Tumor Immunodiagnosis Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can help diagnose various tumors and sometimes determine the response to therapy or recurrence. \n【11】 Suspected uterine masses may be evaluated with endometrial biopsy and/or surgical exploration. \n【12】 Key Points Type of mass in the female reproductive tract tends to vary by age group.  In postmenopausal women, masses are more likely to be cancerous.  In women of reproductive age, do a pregnancy test.

People have a painless bulge in the groin or scrotum.  Computed tomography or ultrasonography can be used for diagnosis.  Surgery is done if hernias are in women, cause symptoms, or become strangulated or incarcerated.   What Is an Inguinal Hernia? In an inguinal hernia, a loop of intestine or another abdominal organ pushes through an opening in the abdominal wall into the inguinal canal.  The inguinal canal contains the spermatic cord, which consists of the vas deferens, blood vessels, nerves, and other structures.  Before birth, the testes, which are formed in the abdomen, pass through the inguinal canal as they descend into the scrotum.  An inguinal hernia extends into the groin and can extend into the scrotum.  They are more common among men.  There are two types, direct and indirect, depending on exactly where the hernia occurs.  Other types of hernias ,such as umbilical hernias Abdominal wall hernias An abdominal wall hernia is an opening or area of weakness in the abdominal wall through which abdominal contents can protrude. \n【1】 With an inguinal hernia, the opening in the abdominal wall can be present from birth . \n【2】 Symptoms of Inguinal Hernia Inguinal hernias usually cause a painless bulge in the groin or scrotum.  The bulge may enlarge when men stand and shrink when they lie down because the intestine slides back and forth with gravity.  Sometimes a portion of the intestine is trapped in the scrotum (incarceration).  If the intestine becomes trapped, the intestine’s blood supply can be cut off (strangulation).  Strangulated intestine may die (become gangrenous) within hours.  Diagnosis of Inguinal Hernia A doctor's examination Sometimes imaging tests The doctor bases the diagnosis of inguinal hernia on an examination.  While the person is standing, the doctor examines the groin and asks the person to cough.  Coughing increases pressure in the abdominal cavity.  If the person has an inguinal hernia, coughing will cause the hernia to bulge outward, making it easier for the doctor to detect.  In addition, in men, the doctor places a finger into a fold on the upper part of the scrotum and pushes upward toward the abdominal cavity to detect a hernia.  Sometimes the doctor does ultrasonography Ultrasound Scanning (Ultrasonography) of the Abdomen Ultrasound scanning uses sound waves to produce pictures of internal organs . \n【3】 Treatment of Inguinal Hernia Surgical repair Inguinal hernias in women and those that cause symptoms in men should be surgically repaired.  In men who have an inguinal hernia that does not cause any symptoms, surgery does not need to be done unless symptoms develop.  Surgery can be done at a time that is convenient for the person.

Symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, in heavy infections, anemia and undernutrition.  Diagnosis is by finding eggs in stool.  Treatment is with mebendazole, albendazole, or ivermectin.  Trichuriasis is the 3rd most common soil-transmitted roundworm infection.  An estimated 604 to 795 million people are infected worldwide.  Trichuris trichiura occurs principally in developing tropical or subtropical areas where human feces is used as fertilizer or where people defecate onto soil.  Children are the most heavily infected.  In the United States, most cases of trichuriasis are in immigrants or travelers returning from endemic areas with poor sanitation and hygiene, but there are locally acquired cases in some southern areas.  Infection is spread via the fecal-oral route.  Ingested eggs hatch and enter the crypts of the small bowel as larvae.  After maturing for 1 to 3 months, the worms migrate to the cecum and ascending colon, where they attach to the superficial epithelium, mate, and lay eggs.  Adult worms are estimated to live 1 to 2 years, although some may live longer.  Symptoms and Signs of Trichuriasis Light Trichuris infections are often asymptomatic.  Patients with heavy infections may have abdominal pain, anorexia, and diarrhea; weight loss, anemia, and rectal prolapse may result, particularly in children.  Diagnosis of Trichuriasis Microscopic examination of stool Diagnosis of trichuriasis is made by microscopic examination of stool; the characteristic lemon-shaped eggs with clear opercula at both ends are readily apparent.  When anoscopy, proctoscopy, or colonoscopy is done for other indications, wiggling adult worms may be seen protruding into the bowel lumen.  Complete blood count (CBC) is done to check for anemia.  Treatment of Trichuriasis Mebendazole Albendazole Ivermectin Mebendazole 100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days is effective for patients with trichuriasis.  A single dose of mebendazole 500 mg has been used in mass treatment programs.  Also effective for individual patients is albendazole 400 mg orally once a day for 3 days or ivermectin 200 mcg/kg orally once a day for 3 days.  These drugs should usually not be used during pregnancy.

Usually, the main symptoms of normal-pressure hydrocephalus are general unsteadiness and loss of balance, and the feet may seem to stick to the floor.  Dementia may not develop until late in the disorder.  Doctors usually do magnetic resonance imaging to check for excess fluid around the brain and do a spinal tap or place a temporary drain into the spinal cord to remove any excess fluid.  Placing a piece of plastic tubing (a shunt) in the brain to drain the excess fluid may significantly lessen some symptoms, but it may benefit mental function less.   dysfunction—the inability to acquire, retain, and use knowledge normally. \n【1】 Normally, the fluid that surrounds the brain and protects it from injury (cerebrospinal fluid) is continuously produced in the spaces within the brain (ventricles), circulates in and around the brain, and is reabsorbed.  Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is thought to occur when this fluid is not reabsorbed normally, causing it to accumulate.  The amount of fluid in the ventricles increases and the brain is then pushed outward. \n【2】 People typically have an abnormally slow, unsteady, wide-legged walk.  The feet may seem to stick to the floor (called a magnetic gait).  People also have urinary incontinence and a tendency to fall.  Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. \n【3】 Often, the first signs of dementia are difficulty planning, organizing, putting ideas or doing actions for a task in the right order (sequencing), thinking abstractly, and paying attention.  Memory tends to be lost later.  Diagnosis of Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus A doctor's evaluation Brain imaging, usually magnetic resonance imaging Lessening of symptoms after removal of cerebrospinal fluid Doctors may suspect normal-pressure hydrocephalus when people have the three typical symptoms: Difficulty walking Urinary incontinence Dementia However, the diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus cannot be based on symptoms alone, particularly in older people.  Other dementias can cause similar symptoms, and in older people, many conditions can make walking difficult or cause urinary incontinence.  Diagnosis of dementia Doctors base a diagnosis of dementia on the following: Symptoms, which are identified by asking the person and family members or other caregivers questions Results of a physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【4】 Neuropsychologic testing, which is more detailed is sometimes needed.  This testing covers all the main areas of mental function, including mood, and usually takes 1 to 3 hours.  This testing helps doctors distinguish dementia from other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as age-associated memory impairment Dementia , mild cognitive impairment Dementia , and depression Dementia .  Information from the above sources can usually help doctors rule out delirium as the cause of symptoms .  Doing so is essential because delirium, unlike dementia, can often be reversed if promptly treated.  Differences between the two include the following: Dementia affects mainly memory, and delirium affects mainly attention.  Dementia typically begins gradually and has no definite beginning point.  Delirium begins suddenly and often has a definite beginning point.  Diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus Brain imaging, usually magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done to check for excess cerebrospinal fluid.  Finding excess fluid and other characteristic changes in the brain supports the diagnosis of normal-pressure hydrocephalus but does not confirm it.  To help with the diagnosis, doctors do a spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【5】 If these procedures relieve symptoms, usually by improving gait, normal-pressure hydrocephalus is more likely, and treatment is more likely to be effective.  Treatment of Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus A shunt in the ventricles of the brain Treatment of normal-pressure hydrocephalus consists of placing a piece of plastic tubing (a shunt) in the ventricles of the brain and running it under the skin, usually to the abdomen (ventriculoperitoneal shunting).  Cerebrospinal fluid is then drained away from the brain.  The effects of this treatment may not be evident for several hours.  This procedure may significantly improve the ability to walk and function and may lessen incontinence.  However, mental function improves less and in fewer people.  Thus, early diagnosis is important, so that people can be treated before dementia develops.  Safety and supportive measures Creating a safe and supportive environment Creating a Beneficial Environment for People With Dementia can be very helpful.  Generally, the environment should be bright, cheerful, safe, stable, and designed to help with orientation.  Some stimulation, such as a radio or television, is helpful, but excessive stimulation should be avoided.  Structure and routine help people with dementia stay oriented and give them a sense of security and stability.  Any change in surroundings, routines, or caregivers should be explained to people clearly and simply.  Following a daily routine for tasks such as bathing, eating, and sleeping helps people with dementia remember.  Following a regular routine at bedtime may help them sleep better.  Activities scheduled on a regular basis can help people feel independent and needed by focusing their attention on pleasurable or useful tasks.  Such activities should include physical and mental activities.  Activities should be broken down in small parts or simplified as the dementia worsens.  Care for caregivers Caring for people with dementia is stressful and demanding, and caregivers may become depressed and exhausted, often neglecting their own mental and physical health.  The following measures can help caregivers : Learning about how to effectively meet the needs of people with dementia and what to expect from them: Caregivers can get this information from nurses, social workers, organizations, and published and online materials.  Seeking help when it is needed: Caregivers can talk to social workers (including those in the local community hospital) about appropriate sources of help, such as day-care programs, visits by home nurses, part-time or full-time housekeeping assistance, and live-in assistance.  Counseling and support groups can also help.  Caring for self: Caregivers need to remember to take care of themselves.

Disorders of neuromuscular transmission may involve Postsynaptic receptors  Presynaptic release of acetylcholine  Breakdown of acetylcholine within the synapse (eg, due to drugs or neurotoxic chemicals) The most common disorder that affects neuromuscular transmission is myasthenia gravis.  Some disorders that affect other areas of the body primarily ,eg, stiff-person syndrome Stiff-Person Syndrome Stiff-person syndrome is a CNS disorder that causes progressive muscle stiffness and spasms. \n【1】 Eaton-Lambert syndrome Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes is due to impaired acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve terminals.  Repetitive nerve testing at rapid rates (20 to 50 hertz [Hz]) or a single supramaximal stimulation before and after 10 seconds of maximal isometric exercise shows an incremental response of up to 400%.  Increases of > 100% are considered diagnostic of a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission, but an increment of ≥ 60% or greater is highly suggestive.  Botulism Also due to impaired release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals, botulism is poisoning that is due to Clostridium botulinum toxin and that affects the peripheral nerves. \n【2】 The result is severe weakness, sometimes with respiratory compromise and difficulty swallowing.  Other systemic symptoms may include mydriasis, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and tachycardia due to unopposed sympathetic nervous system activity (anticholinergic syndrome).  These systemic findings are absent in myasthenia gravis.  In botulism, electromyography (EMG) detects a mild decremental response to low-frequency (2- to 3-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation but a pronounced incremental response after 10 seconds of exercise or with rapid (50-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation. \n【3】 Miosis, bronchorrhea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and myasthenic-like weakness (cholinergic syndrome) result.  Aminoglycoside and polypeptide antibiotics decrease presynaptic acetylcholine release and sensitivity of the postsynaptic membrane to acetylcholine.  At high serum levels, these antibiotics may increase neuromuscular block in patients with latent myasthenia gravis.  Long-term penicillamine treatment may cause a reversible syndrome that clinically and electromyographically resembles myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors. \n【4】 Excessive magnesium orally or IV (with blood levels approaching 8 to 9 mg/dL [4 to 4. 5 mmol/L]) can also induce severe weakness resembling a myasthenic syndrome.

The epidemiology and clinical manifestations vary greatly depending on the subtype.  When needed, organism-specific diagnosis can be made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.  Treatment is typically supportive.  E.  coli normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract; however, some strains have acquired genes that enable them to cause intestinal infection.  When ingested, the following strains can cause diarrhea: Enterohemorrhagic E.  coli is the most clinically significant subtype in the US.  It produces Shiga toxin, which causes bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis).  Thus, this subtype is sometimes termed Shiga toxin–producing E.  coli (STEC).  coli O157:H7 Infection by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Other Enterohemorrhagic E.  coli (EHEC) The gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other enterohemorrhagic E. \n【1】 Undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk and juice, and contaminated water are possible sources.  Person-to-person transmission is common in the day care setting.  Outbreaks associated with exposure to water in recreational settings (eg, pools, lakes, water parks) have also been reported.  Hemolytic-uremic syndrome Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is an acute, fulminant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. \n【2】 Enterotoxigenic E.  coli produces two toxins (one similar to cholera toxin) that cause watery diarrhea.  This subtype is the most common cause of traveler’s diarrhea Traveler’s Diarrhea Traveler’s diarrhea is gastroenteritis that is usually caused by bacteria endemic to local water.  Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.  Diagnosis is mainly clinical.  coli causes watery diarrhea.  Once a common cause of diarrhea outbreaks in nurseries, this subtype is now rare.  Enteroinvasive E.  coli causes bloody or nonbloody diarrhea, primarily in low- and middle-income countries.  It is rare in the US.  Enteroaggregative E.  coli causes diarrhea of lesser severity but longer duration than the other subtypes.  As with some of the other subtypes, it is more common in low- and middle-income countries and can be a cause of traveler's diarrhea.  Other strains of E.  coli are capable of causing extraintestinal infection .   Symptoms and Signs of E.  coli Gastroenteritis Symptoms of hemorrhagic E.  coli are severe abdominal cramps which begin suddenly along with watery diarrhea, which may become bloody within 24 hours.  The diarrhea usually lasts 1 to 8 days.  Fever is usually absent or mild but occasionally can exceed 102° F (39° C).  Diagnosis of E.  coli Gastroenteritis Clinical evaluation Sometimes stool testing Stool studies are not needed in most cases of acute diarrhea because they have a viral cause and are self-limited.  Stool studies for a bacterial cause are indicated in patients with bloody or heme-positive stool, fever, moderate to severe diarrhea, or diarrhea lasting more than 7 days, in those 70 years old or older, or in those with inflammatory bowel disease or immunocompromising disorders such as HIV/AIDS.  Stool studies are also indicated for those at high risk of spreading disease to others (eg, health care, day care, or food service workers), and during known or suspected outbreaks.  Each of the E.  coli subtypes can be detected in stool by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, typically using a multiplex PCR panel.  Sometimes more than one organism is detected simultaneously, the clinical significance of which is unclear.  A rapid stool assay for Shiga toxin or, when available, a test for the gene that encodes the toxin may be helpful.  Treatment of E.  coli Gastroenteritis Oral or IV rehydration Sometimes antibiotics Supportive care including rehydration with fluids and electrolytes is the mainstay of treatment and is all that is needed for most adults.  Oral glucose-electrolyte solutions, broth, or bouillon may prevent dehydration or treat mild dehydration.  Children may become dehydrated more quickly and should be given an appropriate rehydration solution .  Isotonic IV fluids such as Ringer’s lactate and normal saline solution should be given when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration therapy or ileus .  In severe dehydration, IV rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize.  Antidiarrheal agents (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea .  Antidiarrheals are generally safe for adult patients with watery diarrhea (as shown by heme-negative stool).  However, antidiarrheals may cause deterioration of patients with Clostridioides difficile or E.  coli O157:H7 infection and thus should not be given to any patients with recent antibiotic use, bloody diarrhea, heme-positive stool, or diarrhea with fever, pending specific diagnosis.  The use of probiotics is not recommended for suspected E.  coli gastroenteritis .  Antibiotics given empirically are generally not recommended except when suspicion of Shigella or Campylobacter infection is high (eg, contact with a known case).  Otherwise, antibiotics should not be given until stool culture results are known because antibiotics increase the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is an acute, fulminant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. \n【3】 Stool culture results are particularly important in children, who have a higher rate of infection with E.  coli O157:H7.  Key Points Different strains of E.  coli can cause diarrhea by various mechanisms.  Enterohemorrhagic E.  coli produces Shiga toxin, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and sometimes hemolytic-uremic syndrome; E. \n【4】 Stool testing is not needed routinely, but if an enterohemorrhagic strain is suspected, a rapid stool assay for Shiga toxin or gene-based testing should be done.  Antibiotics are generally not needed and can increase the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome when Shiga toxin–producing strains are involved.  Antidiarrheals are safe for adults with watery diarrhea but should be avoided in children < 18 years of age and in any patient with recent antibiotic use, bloody diarrhea, heme-positive stool, or diarrhea with fever.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Newborns with sepsis appear generally ill—they are listless, do not feed well, often have a gray color, and may have a fever or a low body temperature.  The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and the presence of bacteria Overview of Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms.  They are among the earliest known life forms on earth. \n【1】 It requires a living cell in which to multiply. \n【2】 They were once thought to be plants but are now classified as their own kingdom.  Some fungi cause infections in people. \n【3】 Treatment involves antibiotics and supportive treatments such as intravenous fluids, blood and plasma transfusions, assistance with breathing (sometimes with a mechanical ventilator), and drugs to support blood pressure.  Infection in the bloodstream may spread to the tissues covering the brain and the brain itself (meningitis).   Sepsis is more likely to occur in Infants who have a low birth weight Infants who have a low APGAR score Apgar Score Infants whose mother has certain risk factors ,such as a low socioeconomic status or prelabor rupture of the membranes Prelabor Rupture of the Membranes (PROM) Prelabor rupture of the membranes is the leaking of amniotic fluid from around the fetus at any time before labor starts.  After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows. \n【4】 Males Other risk factors for and causes of sepsis differ depending on when sepsis develops.  The start (onset) is categorized as Early-onset sepsis: Before 3 days of life Late-onset sepsis: After 3 days or more of life Certain viral infections, such as widespread herpes simplex Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals. \n【5】 Enterovirus infections are caused by many different viruses. \n【6】 Preterm infants Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation. \n【7】 Preterm newborns lack certain protective antibodies against specific bacteria because they were born before they could receive them from their mother.  Early-onset sepsis Newborns can develop early-onset sepsis if they are exposed to certain kinds of bacteria during birth.  Risk factors for early-onset sepsis include the following: Prelabor prolonged rupture of the fluid-filled membranes Prelabor Rupture of the Membranes (PROM) Prelabor rupture of the membranes is the leaking of amniotic fluid from around the fetus at any time before labor starts. \n【8】 Presence of group B streptococcus Streptococcal Infections Streptococcal infections are caused by any one of several species of Streptococcus. \n【9】 The most common types of bacteria causing sepsis in the newborn around the time of birth are Escherichia coli and GBS, which are usually acquired during passage through the birth canal.  Sepsis caused by GBS was the leading cause of early-onset sepsis until about a decade ago when screening of all expectant mothers for GBS became a routine part of prenatal care.  If screening reveals GBS or if the mother previously gave birth to a newborn who had a GBS infection, the mother is given antibiotics when she goes into labor.  Although the newborn may require additional monitoring in the hospital and possibly blood tests to check for infection, newborns are given antibiotics only if they have symptoms or signs of infection.  Late-onset sepsis Newborns can develop late-onset sepsis if they are exposed to certain kinds of bacteria in the hospital.  Important risk factors for late-onset sepsis include the following: Preterm birth Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.ventilator Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.  Some people with respiratory failure need a mechanical ventilator  to help support breathing Prolonged hospitalization Sepsis that occurs later is more likely to be acquired from organisms in the newborn's environment, including through or around catheters (a tube doctors use to get fluids or medications into the newborn's bloodstream, such as an IV, or a tube used to drain urine from the newborn's bladder) and other medical equipment, rather than organisms acquired from the birth canal.  The use of certain antibiotics can allow certain organisms such as the fungus Candida to cause infections in the newborn.  Symptoms of Sepsis in Newborns with sepsis are usually listless, do not feed well, and often have an unstable body temperature.  A fever that lasts for more than an hour is uncommon, but, when present, typically indicates the newborn has an infection.  Other symptoms may include trouble breathing (respiratory distress), pauses in breathing (apnea), pale color, and poor skin circulation, with cool extremities, abdominal swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, jitteriness, and jaundice in the Newborn Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream. \n【10】 Group B streptococcus infection may cause pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.  Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【11】 Other symptoms occur depending on which organism is causing the infection.  Complications of sepsis One of the most serious complications of sepsis is infection of the membranes surrounding the brain (meningitis).  Newborns with meningitis Bacterial Meningitis in Newborns Bacterial meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meninges) caused by bacteria. \n【12】 Diagnosis of Sepsis in Newborns Cultures of blood and sometimes urine Spinal tap with culture of the spinal fluid Doctors diagnose sepsis based on the newborn’s symptoms and the results of tests.  Doctors do several tests, including blood tests, to try to determine the specific bacterium, virus, or fungus that is causing the infection.  A blood culture, sometimes a urine culture, and a spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【13】 For cultures, doctors take samples of blood, spinal fluid, and urine and try to grow (culture) the bacteria in the samples in the laboratory and identify it.  Newborns with breathing problems undergo a chest x-ray.  Prognosis for Sepsis in Newborns Sepsis is the major cause of death in preterm newborns after the first week.  Low-birth-weight infants have an increased risk of death.  Extremely low-birth-weight infants who have sepsis caused by the fungus Candida or bacteria are at much greater risk of death.  Newborns who recover from sepsis generally do not have long-term problems.  However, newborns who survive meningitis may have developmental delay, cerebral palsy Cerebral Palsy (CP) Cerebral palsy refers to a group of symptoms that involve difficulty moving and muscle stiffness (spasticity). \n【14】 Treatment of Sepsis in Newborns Antibiotics by vein (intravenously) Sometimes a ventilator or other treatments While awaiting blood culture results, doctors give strong antibiotics intravenously to newborns with suspected sepsis.  Once they identify the specific organism, they may adjust the type of antibiotic.  In addition to antibiotic therapy, other treatments may be needed, such as use of a machine that helps with breathing ,mechanical ventilator Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.

Many disorders can cause pulmonary hypertension. \n【1】 Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (the pulmonary arteries) is abnormally high.  Lung disorders can cause pulmonary hypertension in several ways.  When oxygen levels are low for a long time, pulmonary arteries constrict and their walls become thickened.  This constriction and thickening increase the pressure in the pulmonary arteries.  Lung disorders that damage or decrease the amount of lung tissue (for example, emphysema) also decrease the number of blood vessels in the lungs.  The decreased number of blood vessels increases pressure in the remaining vessels.  The most common cause of cor pulmonale is Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders. \n【2】 The increased effort causes the heart muscle to become enlarged and thickened.  If pulmonary hypertension continues long enough, the right side of the heart can no longer compensate by enlarging and thickening, and right-sided heart failure Heart Failure (HF) develops. \n【3】 If clots form in the pooled blood, they may eventually travel to and lodge in the lungs, with dangerous consequences.  Symptoms of Cor Pulmonale There may be few symptoms of cor pulmonale until the disorder is quite advanced.  When symptoms do occur, people describe Shortness of breath during exertion Light-headedness (particularly with exertion) Fatigue Symptoms of heart failure, such as swelling ,edema Swelling is due to excess fluid in the tissues.  The fluid is predominantly water.  Swelling may be widespread or confined to a single limb or part of a limb. \n【4】 Diagnosis of Cor Pulmonale Echocardiography A number of tests are available to help doctors diagnose cor pulmonale, but the diagnosis is often suspected on the basis of the physical examination.  For example, by listening through a stethoscope, doctors can hear certain characteristic heart sounds that occur when the right ventricle becomes strained.  The legs also become swollen, and veins in the neck enlarge.  Chest x-rays can show the enlarged right ventricle and pulmonary arteries.  Doctors evaluate the function of the left and right ventricles with echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.  It uses no x-rays. \n【5】 Treatment of Cor Pulmonale Treatment of the disorder causing cor pulmonale Sometimes, anticoagulants and drugs that relax the lung arteries Treatment of cor pulmonale is usually directed at the underlying lung disorder.

{"seq_id": "299acb48-d29f-4737-a2c6-03aeb5e6cd2e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Leishmaniasis is caused by species of Leishmania.  Manifestations include cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral syndromes.  Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes painless chronic skin lesions ranging from nodules to large ulcers that can persist for months to years but eventually heal.  Mucosal leishmaniasis affects nasopharyngeal tissues and can cause gross mutilation of the nose and palate.  Visceral leishmaniasis causes irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with high mortality in untreated patients.  Diagnosis is by demonstrating parasites in smears or cultures and increasingly by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based assays at reference centers.  Serologic testing can be helpful in diagnosing visceral but not cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Treatment of visceral leishmaniasis is with liposomal amphotericin B or miltefosine, depending on the infecting Leishmania species and the geographic area of acquisition.  Alternatives include amphotericin B deoxycholate and pentavalent antimony compounds (sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate) if disease was acquired in areas where Leishmania species are likely to be susceptible.  A variety of topical and systemic treatments are available for cutaneous leishmaniasis depending on the causative species and clinical manifestations.  Leishmaniasis is present in scattered areas worldwide.  Human infection is caused by 20 Leishmania species that are morphologically indistinguishable but can be differentiated by laboratory analysis.  Etiology of Leishmaniasis Leishmania promastigotes are transmitted by sand flies (Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia) to vertebrate hosts.  Vector sand flies are infected by biting infected humans or animals.  Animal reservoirs vary with the Leishmania species and geographic location and include dogs, other canines, rodents, and other animals.  In the Indian subcontinent, humans are the reservoir for L.  donovani.  Rarely, infection is spread by blood transfusion, shared needles, congenitally, or sexually.  Pathophysiology of Leishmaniasis After inoculation by a sand fly, extracellular promastigotes are phagocytized by host macrophages; inside these cells, they transform into amastigotes.  The parasites may remain localized in the skin or spread to the mucosa of the nasopharynx or disseminate to bone marrow, the spleen, the liver, and occasionally other organs, resulting in 3 major clinical forms of leishmaniasis: Cutaneous Mucosal Visceral Cutaneous leishmaniasis is also known as oriental or tropical sore, Delhi or Aleppo boil, uta or chiclero ulcer, or forest yaws.  The major causative species are L.  major and L.  tropica in southern Europe, Asia, and Africa L.  mexicana and related species in Mexico and Central and South America L.  braziliensis and related species in Central and South America Cases have occurred among US military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and among travelers to endemic areas in Central and South America, Israel, and elsewhere.  Uncommonly, L.  braziliensis spreads widely in the skin causing disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Mucosal leishmaniasis (espundia) is caused mainly by L.  braziliensis but occasionally by other Leishmania species.  The parasites are thought to spread from the initial skin lesion through the lymphatics and blood to nasopharyngeal tissues.  Symptoms and signs of mucosal leishmaniasis typically develop months to years after the appearance of the skin lesion.  Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar, Dumdum fever) is typically caused by L.  infantum (previously called L.  chagasi in Latin America) and occurs in India, Africa (particularly the Sudan), Central Asia, the Mediterranean basin, South and Central America, and infrequently China.  Most cases occur in northeastern India.  Parasites disseminate from the site of the sand fly bite in the skin to regional lymph nodes, the spleen, the liver, and bone marrow and cause systemic symptoms.  Subclinical infections are common; only a minority of infected patients develop progressive visceral disease.  Symptomatic infection with L.  infantum is more common among children than adults.  Visceral leishmaniasis is an opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions.  Symptoms and Signs of Leishmaniasis In cutaneous leishmaniasis, a well-demarcated skin lesion develops at the site of a sand fly bite, usually within several weeks to months.  Multiple lesions may occur after multiple infective bites or with metastatic spread.  Their appearance varies.  The initial lesion is often a papule that slowly enlarges, ulcerates centrally, and develops a raised, erythematous border where intracellular parasites are concentrated.  Ulcers are typically painless and cause no systemic symptoms unless secondarily infected.  Lesions heal spontaneously after several months but may persist for years.  They leave a depressed, burn-like scar.  The course depends on the infecting Leishmania species and the host’s immune status.  Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, a rare syndrome, results in widespread nodular skin lesions resembling those of lepromatous leprosy is a chronic infection usually caused by the acid-fast bacilli Mycobacterium leprae or the closely related organism M.  lepromatosis. \n【1】 It results from cell-mediated anergy to the organism.  Mucosal leishmaniasis due to L.  braziliensis and related organisms typically starts with one or more primary cutaneous ulcers.  Spread to the mucosa via lymphatics and the bloodstream probably occurs early in infection.  The skin lesions heal spontaneously; but progressive mucosal lesions may not become apparent for months to years.  Typically, patients have nasal stuffiness, discharge, and pain.  Over time, the infection may progress, resulting in gross mutilation of the nose, palate, oral pharynx, or face.  In visceral leishmaniasis, the clinical manifestations usually develop gradually over weeks to months after inoculation of the parasite but can be acute.  Irregular fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with a reversed albumin:globulin ratio occur.  In some patients, there are twice-daily temperature spikes.  Cutaneous skin lesions rarely occur.  Emaciation and death occur within months to years in patients with progressive infections.  Those with asymptomatic, self-resolving infections and survivors (after successful treatment) are resistant to further attacks unless cell-mediated immunity is impaired (eg, by AIDS).  Relapse may occur years after initial infection.  Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in patients in the Sudan and India.  It is characterized by flat or nodular cutaneous lesions that contain many parasites.  In patients in the Sudan, these lesions develop at the end of or within 6 months of therapy and spontaneously resolve a few months to a year later.  In patients in India and adjacent countries, skin lesions typically develop 1 to 2 years after therapy ends and can last for many years.  PKDL lesions are thought to be a reservoir for the spread of infection in these areas.  Diagnosis of Leishmaniasis Light microscopy of Wright-Giemsa or Giemsa-stained tissue samples, touch preparations, or aspirates Antibody titers for visceral leishmaniasis, but not for cutaneous or mucosal leishmaniasis Culture (special media required) Polymerase chain reaction–based assays Parasites are usually difficult to find or isolate in culture from biopsies of mucosal lesions.  Organisms causing simple cutaneous leishmaniasis can be differentiated from those capable of causing mucosal leishmaniasis based on the geographic area of acquisition, specific DNA probes, or analysis of cultured parasites.  Serologic tests can help diagnose visceral leishmaniasis; high titers of antibodies to a recombinant leishmanial antigen (rk39) are present in most immunocompetent patients with visceral leishmaniasis.  But antibodies may be absent in patients with AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions.  Serologic tests for antileishmanial antibodies are not helpful in the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based assays of aspirates from bone marrow, the spleen, or lymph nodes in patients with visceral leishmaniasis or of biopsy, aspirates, or touch preparations from a skin lesion help diagnose leishmaniasis.  The leishmanin skin test that detects a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to leishmanial antigens is not available in the US.  It is typically positive in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis but negative in those with active visceral leishmaniasis.  Treatment of Leishmaniasis Drug therapy depends on the clinical syndrome and other factors For cutaneous infection, topical treatment, sodium stibogluconate injection or topical paromomycin outside the US or heat therapy or cryotherapy For systemic treatment of cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral leishmaniasis, liposomal amphotericin IV or miltefosine orally Alternatively, amphotericin B deoxycholate IV or pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate, meglumine antimoniate) IV or IM if the infecting Leishmania species is likely to be susceptible Treatment of leishmaniasis is complicated.  The therapeutic approach depends on the following: Clinical syndrome Infecting Leishmania species Geographic location of acquisition Organism's likelihood of susceptibility to antileishmanial drugs Immune status of the host Detailed recommendations for treatment are available .  Sodium stibogluconate is no longer available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .  Cutaneous leishmaniasis Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis may be topical or systemic, depending on the lesion and organism.  If a lesion is small, spontaneously healing, and not caused by a Leishmania species associated with mucosal leishmaniasis, it can be closely followed, rather than treated.  Topical treatment is an option for small, uncomplicated lesions.  Intralesional injection of sodium stibogluconate has been used for many years for simple cutaneous leishmaniasis in Europe and Asia; it is not currently available in the US for intralesional use.  Other topical options include heat therapy, which requires a specialized system for administration, and cryotherapy; both can be painful and are practical only when used to treat small lesions.  In addition, topical paromomycin is used outside the US as an ointment that contains 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin.  Systemic therapy is used in patients who have the following: Infection by L.  braziliensis or related organisms associated with mucosal leishmaniasis Complex cutaneous leishmaniasis with multiple, large, widespread, or disfiguring lesions Compromised cell-mediated immunity In the US, systemic options include liposomal amphotericin B, miltefosine, and amphotericin B deoxycholate.  Sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate may be used if infection was acquired in areas where antimony-resistance is not prevalent.  Liposomal amphotericin B and amphotericin B deoxycholate are typically given in the regimens used for visceral leishmaniasis Visceral leishmaniasis Leishmaniasis is caused by species of Leishmania. \n【2】 Miltefosine, which has the advantage of oral administration, can be effective for cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly when caused by Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania guyanensis, and Leishmania panamensis.  Miltefosine is dosed by body weight: patients 30 to 44 kg, 50 mg orally twice a day for 28 days; ≥ 45 kg, 50 mg orally 3 times a day for 28 days.  Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, transient elevations in aminotransferases, and dizziness.  Miltefosine is contraindicated during pregnancy; women of childbearing age who are taking this drug must use effective birth control measures.  Pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate) should be used only if the infecting Leishmania species is likely to be susceptible.  Meglumine antimoniate (a pentavalent antimonial) is used in Latin America.  Doses of both are based on their pentavalent antimony content—20 mg/kg IV (slow infusion required) or IM once a day for 20 days.  Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, malaise, elevated amylase and/or liver enzymes, and cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias, myocardial depression, heart failure, ECG changes, cardiac arrest).  The incidence of adverse effects increases with age.  The drug is stopped if patients develop cardiotoxicity.  Alternatives include azoles (eg, fluconazole).  Fluconazole 200 mg orally once a day for 6 weeks is commonly ineffective, but success has been reported with higher daily doses in some areas.  Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis is relatively resistant to treatment.  Mucosal leishmaniasis The optimal treatment is uncertain.  Recent studies suggest that liposomal amphotericin B with a cumulative dose ranging from 20 to 60 mg/kg or miltefosine dosed by body weight: patients 30 to 44 kg, 50 mg orally twice a day for 28 days; ≥ 45 kg, 50 mg orally 3 times a day for 28 days are often effective, but data are limited.  Adverse effects of miltefosine include nausea, vomiting, transient elevations in aminotransferases, and dizziness; the drug is contraindicated during pregnancy so women of childbearing age who are taking this drug must use effective birth control measures.  Historically, pentavalent antimonials have been used in Latin America.  Another alternative is amphotericin B deoxycholate 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/kg IV once a day or every other day for a total dose of 20 to 45 mg/kg.  Reconstructive surgery may be required if mucosal leishmaniasis grossly distorts the nose or palate, but surgery should be delayed for 12 months after successful chemotherapy to avoid losing grafts because of relapses.  Visceral leishmaniasis Liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis; other lipid-associated amphotericin preparations may be effective but have been less well studied.  Dosage of liposomal amphotericin B is For immunocompetent patients: 3 mg/kg IV once a day for 5 days and then once a day on days 14 and 21 (total dose of 21 mg/kg) For patients with AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions: 4 mg/kg IV once a day on days 1 to 5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (total dose of 40 mg/kg) Miltefosine orally, dosed by body weight: patients 30 to 44 kg, 50 mg twice a day for 28 days or for patients ≥ 45 kg, 50 mg 3 times a day for 28 days can be used to treat immunocompetent patients who acquired L.  donovani in India or adjacent areas of South Asia, who are > 12 years of age, who weigh > 30 kg, and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding.  Pentavalent antimonials can be used to treat visceral leishmaniasis acquired in Latin America or other areas of the world where the infection is not resistant to these drugs.  Dosage is 20 mg/kg (based on the antimony content) IV or IM once a day for 28 days.  An alternative is amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg IV once a day for 15 to 20 days or every other day for up to 8 weeks.  Relapses are common among patients with AIDS or other immunocompromising conditions.  Antiretroviral drugs can help restore immune function in those with AIDS, reducing the likelihood of relapse.  Secondary prophylaxis with an antileishmanial drug may help prevent relapses in AIDS patients with CD4 counts < 200/mcL.  Supportive measures (eg, adequate nutrition, transfusions, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection) are often necessary for patients with visceral leishmaniasis. \n【3】 2.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Resources for Health Professionals: Treatment.  Prevention of Leishmaniasis For prevention of leishmaniasis, the following may help: Treatment of leishmaniasis in a geographic area where humans are the reservoir Reduction of the vector population by spraying residual insecticide (one that has prolonged duration of action) in sites of domestic transmission Personal protective measures including insect repellants on exposed skin and protective clothing Control of nonhuman reservoirs Travelers to endemic areas should use insect repellents containing DEET (diethyltoluamide) on exposed skin.  Insect screens, bed nets, and clothing are more effective if treated with permethrin because the small sand flies can penetrate mechanical barriers.  Vaccines are not currently available.  Key Points Leishmaniasis is present in scattered areas worldwide and is transmitted by bites of sand flies.  The parasites may remain localized in the skin (cutaneous leishmaniasis), spread to the mucosa (mucosal leishmaniasis), or disseminate to the liver, the spleen, and bone marrow (visceral leishmaniasis).

Postpartum depression occurs in 10 to 15% of women after delivery.  Although every woman is at risk, women with the following are at higher risk: Baby blues (eg, rapid mood swings, irritability, anxiety, decreased concentration, insomnia, crying spells) Prior episode of postpartum depression Prior diagnosis of depression Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【1】 Transient depressive symptoms (baby blues) is very common during the first week after delivery.  Baby blues differs from postpartum depression because baby blues typically lasts 2 to 3 days (up to 2 weeks) and is relatively mild; in contrast, postpartum depression lasts > 2 weeks and is disabling, interfering with activities of daily living.  Symptoms and Signs of Postpartum Depression Symptoms of postpartum depression are similar to those of major depression Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【2】uilt about her feelings Suicidal ideation Anxiety or panic attacks Typically, symptoms develop insidiously over 3 months, but onset can be more sudden.  Postpartum depression interferes with women’s ability to care for themselves and the baby.  Women may not bond with their infant, resulting in emotional, social, and cognitive problems in the child later.  Partners may also be at increased risk of depression, and depression in either parent may result in relationship stress.  Without treatment, postpartum depression can resolve spontaneously or become chronic depression.  Risk of recurrence is about 1 in 3 to 4.  Postpartum psychosis rarely develops; untreated postpartum depression and psychosis increase the risk of suicide and infanticide, which are the most severe complications.  Diagnosis of Postpartum Depression Clinical evaluation Criteria for major depression Early diagnosis and treatment of postpartum depression substantially improve outcomes for women and their infant.  Postpartum depression (or other serious mental disorders) is diagnosed if women have ≥ 5 symptoms for > 2 weeks; symptoms include depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure and Significant weight loss, loss of appetite, or weight gain Insomnia or hypersomnia Psychomotor agitation or retardation Feeling of worthlessness or guilt Diminished ability to concentrate Suicidal or homicidal thoughts (women should be asked specifically about such thoughts) Because of cultural and social factors, women may not volunteer symptoms of depression, so health care providers should ask women about such symptoms before and after delivery.  Also, women should be taught to recognize symptoms of depression, which they may mistake for the normal effects of new motherhood (eg, fatigue, difficulty concentrating).  All women should be screened at the postpartum visit for postpartum depression using a validated screening tool.  Such tools include the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale .  Patients with hallucinations, delusions, or psychotic behavior should be evaluated for postpartum psychosis. \n【3】 If a woman has significant anxiety, she may be treated with anxiolytics.  Women who have postpartum psychosis may need to be hospitalized, preferably in a supervised unit that allows the infant to remain with them.  Antipsychotic drugs Treatment may be needed as well as antidepressants.  Key Points Baby blues is very common during the first week after delivery, typically lasts 2 to 3 days (up to 2 weeks), and is relatively mild.  Postpartum depression occurs in 10 to 15% of women, lasts > 2 weeks, and is disabling (in contrast to baby blues).  Symptoms are be similar to those of major depression and can also include anxiety.  Postpartum depression may result in adverse effects on the child or in relationship stress.

{"seq_id": "aca8d029-bbad-4133-8735-eb3329d2445d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Nausea is an unpleasant feeling of needing to vomit.  People also may feel dizziness, vague discomfort in the abdomen, and an unwillingness to eat.  Vomiting is a forceful contraction of the stomach that propels its contents up the esophagus and out the mouth.   Vomiting empties the stomach and often makes people with nausea feel considerably better, at least temporarily.  Vomiting is quite uncomfortable and can be violent.  Severe vomiting can project stomach contents many feet (projectile vomiting).  Vomiting is not the same as regurgitation and Rumination Regurgitation is the spitting up of food from the esophagus or stomach without nausea or forceful contractions of the abdominal muscles. \n【1】 Vomitus—the material that is vomited up—usually reflects what was recently eaten.  Sometimes it contains chunks of food.  When blood is vomited, the vomitus is usually red ,hematemesis Gastrointestinal Bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal [GI]) tract, from the mouth to the anus. \n【2】 When bile is present, the vomitus is bitter and yellow-green.  Complications In addition to being uncomfortable, vomiting can cause complications: Inhaled vomitus (aspiration) Torn esophagus ,Mallory-Weiss tear Esophageal Laceration (Mallory-Weiss Syndrome) An esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) is a tear that does not penetrate the wall of the esophagus.  The tear can be caused by forceful vomiting.  Symptoms include blood in vomit. \n【3】 The acid in the vomitus can severely irritate the lungs.  Vomiting greatly increases pressure within the esophagus, and severe vomiting can tear the lining of the esophagus  An esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss syndrome) is a tear that does not penetrate the wall of the esophagus. \n【4】 A small tear causes pain and sometimes bleeding, but a large tear can be fatal.  Because people lose water and minerals (electrolytes) in vomitus, severe vomiting can cause dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body.  Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration. \n【5】 Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments. \n【6】 Newborns and infants are particularly susceptible to these complications.  Chronic vomiting can cause undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients. \n【7】 Causes of Nausea and Vomiting Nausea and vomiting result when the vomiting center in the brain is activated.  Causes typically involve disorders of the digestive tract or the brain, or ingested substances.  Common causes The most common causes of nausea and vomiting are Gastroenteritis (infection of the digestive tract) Drugs Toxins Nausea and vomiting commonly occur with any dysfunction of the digestive tract but are particularly common with gastroenteritis .  A less common digestive tract disorder is obstruction of the intestine Intestinal Obstruction An obstruction of the intestine is a blockage that completely stops or seriously impairs the passage of food, fluid, digestive secretions, and gas through the intestines. \n【8】 Many other abdominal disorders that cause vomiting also cause significant abdominal pain Acute Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain is common and often minor.  Severe abdominal pain that comes on quickly, however, almost always indicates a significant problem. \n【9】 In such disorders ,for example, appendicitis is inflammation and infection of the appendix.  Often a blockage inside the appendix causes the appendix to become inflamed and infected. \n【10】 The pancreas is a leaf-shaped organ about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) long. \n【11】 Many drugs, including alcohol, opioid analgesics (such as morphine), cannabis (marijuana), and chemotherapy drugs, can cause nausea and vomiting.  Toxins, such as lead or those found in some foods and plants, can cause severe nausea and vomiting.  Less common causes of nausea and vomiting include Brain or central nervous system disorders Motion sickness Metabolic changes or bodywide (systemic) illness Psychologic disorders Cyclic vomiting syndrome The vomiting center also can be activated by certain brain or central nervous system disorders, including infections ,such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). \n【12】 It can affect one or both sides of the head. \n【13】 Disorders that increase intracranial pressure include brain tumors Overview of Brain Tumors A brain tumor can be a noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant) growth in the brain. \n【14】 Intracerebral hemorrhage usually results from chronic high blood pressure.  The first symptom is often a severe headache. \n【15】 The balance organs of the inner ear (vestibular apparatus) are connected to the vomiting center.  This connection is why some people become nauseated by the movement of a boat, car, or airplane and by certain disorders of the inner ear ,such as labyrinthitis Purulent Labyrinthitis Purulent (suppurative) labyrinthitis is a bacterial infection of the inner ear that often causes deafness and loss of balance.  The labyrinth is the bony cavity that contains the inner ear. \n【16】 Nausea and vomiting may also occur when there are metabolic changes in the body, such as during early pregnancy, or when people have diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【17】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver. \n【18】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【19】 Chronic nausea and vomiting syndrome is a functional disorder.  That is, the nausea and vomiting are not caused by a physical or specific psychologic disorder but rather may be a problem with the way the brain and gastrointestinal system communicate.  In this syndrome, people have bothersome nausea, vomiting, or both that occur at least once a week for at least 6 months including the last 3 months and that have no identifiable cause after testing has been done.  Psychologic problems also can cause nausea and vomiting.  Such vomiting may be intentional.  For instance, people who have bulimia make themselves vomit to lose weight.  Or it may be unintentional.  For instance, children who are afraid of going to school vomit as a response to their psychologic distress.  Cyclic vomiting syndrome is an uncommon disorder in which people have severe attacks of vomiting (or sometimes only nausea) at varying intervals.  People feel normal between attacks.  Although it usually starts in childhood, it sometimes lasts until adulthood.  Cyclic vomiting that begins in adulthood is often due to chronic marijuana use.  The vomiting can be relieved by a hot bath and goes away after people stop using marijuana.  Evaluation of Nausea and Vomiting Not every episode of nausea and vomiting requires immediate evaluation by a doctor.  The following information can help people decide whether a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs Certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.  They include Signs of dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. \n【20】 People who have nausea and vomiting but no warning signs should see a doctor if vomiting continues for more than 24 to 48 hours or if they are unable to tolerate more than a few sips of liquid.  People who have a few episodes of vomiting (with or without diarrhea) but are able to tolerate at least some liquids should call their doctor.  Depending on their age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions (such as cancer or diabetes), the doctor may suggest that people be seen for an evaluation or stay home and try simple remedies.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the vomiting and the tests that may need to be done , Home. During the history, doctors ask whether the person is pregnant or has diabetes, migraines, liver or kidney disease, or cancer (including the timing of any chemotherapy or radiation therapy).  All recently ingested drugs and substances are noted because certain substances may not be toxic until several days after ingestion (such as acetaminophen and some mushrooms).  During the physical examination, doctors look for the following: Signs of dehydration Symptoms Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. \n【21】 Although people with previously known disorders that cause vomiting (such as migraine) may simply be having a recurrence of that disorder, doctors thoroughly look for signs of a new, different problem.   Testing The need for tests depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination, particularly whether warning signs are present and whether findings suggest a particular disorder , Home. Possible tests include Pregnancy test Blood and urine tests Girls and women of childbearing age typically should have a pregnancy test.  Otherwise healthy adults and older children who have only a few episodes of vomiting (with or without diarrhea) and no other symptoms typically do not require any testing.  People whose vomiting is severe or has lasted more than 1 day or who have signs of dehydration need laboratory tests of blood (particularly electrolyte levels and sometimes liver tests) and urine.  Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting Specific conditions are treated.  If there is no serious underlying disorder and the person is not dehydrated, small amounts of clear liquids may be given 30 minutes or so after the last bout of vomiting.  Typically an ounce (30 milliliters) or two are given at first.  Plain water is an appropriate liquid, but broth or weak, sweetened tea may be given.  Sports drinks have no particular advantage but are not harmful.  If these liquids are tolerated, the amounts are increased gradually.  When these increases are tolerated, the person may resume eating normal foods.  Carbonated beverages and alcohol should be avoided.  Even when people are slightly dehydrated, doctors usually recommend oral rehydration solutions Treatment Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. \n【22】 People with significant dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities, people who are actively vomiting, and people who cannot tolerate any liquids by mouth usually require fluids and/or drugs given by vein (intravenously).  For some adults and adolescents, doctors give drugs to relieve nausea (antiemetics) depending on the cause and the severity of the vomiting: For vomiting caused by motion sickness: Antihistamines (such as dimenhydrinate), scopolamine patches, or both For mild to moderate symptoms: Prochlorperazine, promethazine, or metoclopramide For severe vomiting (including vomiting caused by chemotherapy): Dolasetron, ondansetron, or granisetron, or sometimes aprepitant Key Points People whose nausea and vomiting have an obvious cause and who have a normal examination only need treatment of their symptoms.  People with significant dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities usually require intravenous fluids.  Doctors look for signs of severe, sudden changes to the abdomen or disorders within the skull.  Girls and women of childbearing age are tested for pregnancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

{"seq_id": "2bbf2f6e-638a-4a01-b6e0-61d0c031a83b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive degenerative disorder of specific areas of the brain.  It is characterized by tremor when muscles are at rest (resting tremor), increased muscle tone (stiffness, or rigidity), slowness of voluntary movements, and difficulty maintaining balance (postural instability).  In many people, thinking becomes impaired, or dementia develops.  Parkinson disease results from degeneration in the part of the brain that helps coordinate movements.  Often, the most obvious symptom is a tremor that occurs when muscles are relaxed.  Muscles become stiff, movements become slow and uncoordinated, and balance is easily lost.  Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms.  General measures (such as simplifying daily tasks), drugs (such as levodopa plus carbidopa), and sometimes surgery can help, but the disease is progressive, eventually causing severe disability and immobility. nerves, and muscles.  Parkinson disease is the second most common degenerative disorder of the central nervous system after Alzheimer disease.  It affects About 1 of 250 people older than 40 About 1 of 100 people age 65 or older About 1 of 10 people age 80 or older Parkinson disease commonly begins between the ages of 50 and 79.  Rarely, it occurs in children or adolescents.  Parkinsonism refers to symptoms of Parkinson disease (such as slow movements and tremors) that are caused by another condition. \n【1】 Changes inside the brain In Parkinson disease, nerve cells in part of the basal ganglia (called the substantia nigra) degenerate.  The basal ganglia are collections of nerve cells located deep within the brain.  They help do the following: Initiate and smooth out intended (voluntary) muscle movements Suppress involuntary movements Coordinate changes in posture When the brain initiates an impulse to move a muscle (for example, to lift an arm), the impulse passes through the basal ganglia.  Like all nerve cells, those in the basal ganglia release chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that trigger the next nerve cell in the pathway to send an impulse.  A key neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia is dopamine.  Its overall effect is to increase nerve impulses to muscles.  When nerve cells in the basal ganglia degenerate, they produce less dopamine, and the number of connections between nerve cells in the basal ganglia decreases.  As a result, the basal ganglia cannot control muscle movement as they normally do, leading to tremor, slow movement (bradykinesia), a tendency to move less (hypokinesia), problems with posture and walking, and some loss of coordination.  Locating the Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia are collections of nerve cells located deep within the brain.  They include the following: Caudate nucleus (a C-shaped structure that tapers to a thin tail) Putamen Globus pallidus (located next to the putamen) Subthalamic nucleus Substantia nigra The basal ganglia help initiate and smooth out muscle movements, suppress involuntary movements, and coordinate changes in posture.  Causes of Parkinson Disease In Parkinson disease, synuclein (a protein in the brain that helps nerve cells communicate) forms clumps called Lewy bodies in nerve cells.  Lewy bodies consist of misfolded synuclein.  Synuclein can accumulate in several regions of the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra (deep within the cerebrum) and interfere with brain function.  Lewy bodies often accumulate in other parts of the brain and nervous system, suggesting that they may be involved in other disorders.  In Lewy body dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia with Lewy bodies is progressive loss of mental function characterized by the development of Lewy bodies in nerve cells. \n【2】 About 10% of people with Parkinson disease have relatives who have or have had the disease.  Also, several gene mutations that can cause Parkinson disease have been identified.  There is growing evidence that Parkinson disease is part of a more widespread disorder.  In this disorder, synuclein accumulates not only in the brain but also in nerve cells in the heart, esophagus, intestines, and elsewhere.  As a result, this disorder causes other symptoms such light-headedness when a person stands up, constipation, and difficulty swallowing, depending on where synuclein accumulates.  ny other disorders and drugs can cause symptoms similar to those of Parkinson disease.  Parkinson disease is sometimes hard to diagnose in older people because aging causes some of the same symptoms.  Symptoms of Parkinson Disease Usually, Parkinson disease begins subtly and progresses gradually.  The first symptom is Tremors in about two thirds of people Problems with movement or a reduced sense of smell in most of the others Tremors typically have the following characteristics: Are coarse and rhythmic Usually occur in one hand while the hand is at rest (a resting tremor) Often involve the hand moving as if it is rolling small objects around (called pill-rolling) Decrease when the hand is moving purposefully and disappear completely during sleep May be worsened by emotional stress or fatigue May eventually progress to the other hand, the arms, and the legs May also affect the jaws, tongue, forehead, and eyelids and, to a lesser degree, the voice In some people, a tremor never develops.  Sometimes the tremor becomes less obvious as the disease progresses and muscles become stiffer.  Parkinson disease typically also causes the following symptoms: Stiffness (rigidity): Muscles become stiff, making movement difficult.  When a doctor tries to bend the person's forearm back or straighten it out, the arm resists being moved and, when it moves, it starts and stops, as it is being ratcheted (called cogwheel rigidity).  Slowed movements: Movements become slow and smaller and are difficult to initiate.  Thus, people tend to move less.  When they move less, moving becomes more difficult because joints become stiff and muscles weaken.  Difficulty maintaining balance and posture: Posture becomes stooped, and balance is difficult to maintain.  Thus, people tend to topple forward or backward.  Because movements are slow, people often cannot move their hands quickly enough to break a fall.  These problems tend to develop later in the disease.  Walking becomes difficult, especially taking the first step.  Once started, people often shuffle, taking short steps, keeping their arms bent at the waist, and swinging their arms little or not at all.  While walking, some people have difficulty stopping or turning.  When the disease is advanced, some people suddenly stop walking because they feel as if their feet are glued to the ground (called freezing).  Other people unintentionally and gradually quicken their steps, breaking into a stumbling run to avoid falling.  This symptom is called festination.  Stiffness and decreased mobility can contribute to muscle ache and fatigue.  Having stiff muscles interferes with many movements: turning over in bed, getting in or out of a car, and standing up from a deep chair.  Usual daily tasks (such as dressing, combing the hair, eating, and brushing the teeth) take longer.  Because people often have difficulty controlling the small muscles of the hands, daily tasks, such as buttoning a shirt and tying shoelaces, become increasingly difficult.  Most people with Parkinson disease have shaky, tiny handwriting (micrographia) because initiating and sustaining each stroke of the pen is difficult.  People may mistakenly think of these symptoms as weakness.  However, strength and sensation are usually normal.  The face becomes less expressive (masklike) because the facial muscles that control expression do not move as much as they normally would.  This lack of expression may be mistaken for depression, or it may cause depression to be overlooked.  (Depression is common among people with Parkinson disease. ) Eventually, the face can take on a blank stare with the mouth open, and the eyes may not blink often.  Often, people drool or choke because the muscles in the face and throat are stiff, making swallowing difficult.  People often speak softly in a monotone and may stutter because they have difficulty articulating words.  Parkinson disease also causes other symptoms: Sleep problems, including insomnia and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. \n【3】 Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder Parasomnias are unusual behaviors that occur just before falling asleep, during sleep, or when waking up. \n【4】 In this disorder, the limbs, which normally do not move in REM sleep, may move suddenly and violently because people are acting out their dreams, sometimes injuring a bed partner.  Lack of sleep may contribute to depression, impaired thinking, and drowsiness during the day.  Urination problems may occur.  Urination may be difficult to start and to maintain (called urinary hesitancy).  People may have a compelling need to urinate (urgency).  Incontinence Urinary Incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. \n【5】 Difficulty swallowing Difficulty Swallowing Some people have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).  In dysphagia, foods and/or liquids do not move normally from the throat (pharynx) to the stomach. \n【6】 As a result, people may inhale (aspirate) mouth secretions and/or food they eat or liquids they drink.  Aspiration can cause pneumonia.  Constipation in Adults Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation). \n【7】 Loss of smell Loss of Smell Anosmia is complete loss of smell.  Hyposmia is partial loss of smell. \n【8】 Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia with Lewy bodies is progressive loss of mental function characterized by the development of Lewy bodies in nerve cells. \n【9】 In many others, thinking is impaired, but people may not recognize it.  Depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【10】 Depression tends to worsen as Parkinson disease becomes more severe.  Depression can also make movement problems worse.  Hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia can occur, particularly if dementia develops.  People may see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) or firmly hold certain beliefs despite clear evidence that contradicts them (delusions).  They may become mistrustful and think other people intend them harm (paranoia).  These symptoms are considered psychotic symptoms because they represent loss of contact with reality.  Psychotic symptoms are the most common reason people with Parkinson disease are put in an institution.  Having these symptoms increases the risk of dying.  Mental symptoms, including psychotic symptoms, may be caused by Parkinson disease or by a drug used to treat it.  The drugs used to treat Parkinson disease  can also cause problems, such as obsessive-compulsive behavior or difficulty controlling urges, resulting, for example, in compulsive gambling or collecting.  Diagnosis of Parkinson Disease A doctor's evaluation Sometimes computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging Sometimes use of levodopa to see whether it helps Parkinson disease is likely if people have the following: Fewer, slow movements The characteristic tremor Muscle rigidity Clear and long-lasting (sustained) improvement in response to levodopa Mild, early disease may be difficult for doctors to diagnose because it usually begins subtly.  Diagnosis is especially difficult in older people because aging can cause some of the same problems as Parkinson disease, such as loss of balance, slow movements, muscle stiffness, and stooped posture.  Sometimes essential tremor Essential tremor A tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, shaking movement of part of the body, such as the hands, head, vocal cords, trunk, or legs.  Tremors occur when muscles repeatedly contract and relax.   In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【11】 Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) In radionuclide scanning, radionuclides are used to produce images. \n【12】 However, SPECT and PET are currently used only in research facilities and do not distinguish Parkinson disease from other disorders that cause the same symptoms (parkinsonism).  If the diagnosis is unclear, doctors may give the person levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson disease.  If levodopa results in clear improvement, Parkinson disease is likely.  Treatment of Parkinson Disease General measures to manage symptoms Physical and occupational therapy Levodopa/carbidopa and other drugs Sometimes surgery (including deep brain stimulation) General measures used to treat Parkinson disease can help people function better.  Many drugs can make movement easier and enable people to function effectively for many years.  The mainstay of treatment for Parkinson disease is Levodopa plus carbidopa Other drugs are generally less effective than levodopa, but they may benefit some people, particularly if levodopa is not tolerated or is inadequate.  However, no drug can cure the disease.  Two or more drugs may be needed.  For older people, doses are often reduced.  Drugs that cause or worsen symptoms, particularly antipsychotic drugs, are avoided.  The drugs used to treat Parkinson disease can have troublesome side effects.  If people notice any unusual effects (such as difficulty controlling urges or confusion), they should report them to their doctor.  They should not stop taking a drug unless their doctor tells them to.  Deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure, is considered if people have advanced disease but no dementia nor psychiatric symptoms and drugs are ineffective or have severe side effects.  General measures Various simple measures can help people with Parkinson disease maintain mobility and independence: Continuing to do as many daily activities as possible Following a program of regular exercise Simplifying daily tasks—for example, having buttons on clothing replaced with Velcro fasteners or buying shoes with Velcro fasteners Using assistive devices, such as zipper pulls and button hooks Physical therapists Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs. \n【13】 Therapists may also recommend mechanical aids, such as wheeled walkers, to help people maintain independence.  Simple changes around the home can make it safer for people with Parkinson disease: Removing throw rugs to prevent tripping Installing grab bars in bathrooms and railings in hallways and other locations to reduce the risk of falling For constipation, the following can help: Consuming a high-fiber diet, including such foods as prunes and fruit juices Exercising Drinking plenty of fluids Using stool softeners (such as senna concentrate), supplements (such as psyllium), or stimulant laxatives (such as bisacodyl taken by mouth) to keep bowel movements regular Difficulty swallowing may limit food intake, so the diet must be nutritious.  Making an effort to sniff more deeply may improve the ability to smell, enhancing the appetite.  Levodopa/carbidopa Traditionally, levodopa, which is given with carbidopa, is the first drug used to treat Parkinson disease.  These drugs, taken by mouth, are the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson disease.  But when taken for a long time, levodopa may have side effects and become less effective.  So some experts have suggested that using other drugs first and delaying use of levodopa might help.  However, evidence now indicates that the side effects and reduced effectiveness after long-term use probably occur because Parkinson disease is worsening and are not related to when the drug was begun.  Still, because levodopa may become less effective after several years of use, doctors may prescribe another drug for people under 60, who will be taking drugs to treat the disease for a long time.  Other drugs that may be used include amantadine and dopamine agonists (drugs that act like dopamine, stimulating the same receptors on brain cells).  Such drugs are used because production of dopamine is decreased in Parkinson disease.  Levodopa reduces muscle stiffness, improves movement, and often substantially reduces tremor.  Taking levodopa produces dramatic improvement in people with Parkinson disease.  The drug enables many people with mild disease to return to a nearly normal level of activity and enables some people who are confined to bed to walk again.  Levodopa rarely helps people who have other disorders that can cause symptoms similar to those of Parkinson disease ,parkinsonism refers to symptoms of Parkinson disease (such as slow movements and tremors) that are caused by another condition. \n【14】 Levodopa is a dopamine precursor.  That is, it is converted into dopamine in the body.  Conversion occurs in the basal ganglia, where levodopa helps compensate for the decrease in dopamine due to the disease.  However, before levodopa reaches the brain, some of it is converted to dopamine in the intestine and in the blood.  Having dopamine in the intestine and blood increases the risk of side effects such as vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, and flushing.  Carbidopa is given with levodopa to prevent levodopa from being converted to dopamine before it reaches the basal ganglia.  As a result, there are fewer side effects, and more dopamine is available to the brain.  Domperidone can be used to treat the side effects of levodopa (and other antiparkinsonian drugs), such as nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension.  Domperidone, like carbidopa, reduces the amount of levodopa that is converted into dopamine in the intestine and cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels), where levodopa increases the risk of side effects.  To determine the best dose of levodopa for a particular person, doctors must balance control of the disease with the development of side effects, which may limit the amount of levodopa the person can tolerate.  These side effects include Nausea Vomiting Light-headedness Involuntary movements (of the mouth, face, and limbs) called dyskinesias Nightmares Hallucinations and paranoia (psychotic symptoms) Changes in blood pressure Confusion Obsessive or compulsive behavior or difficulty controlling urges, for example, resulting in compulsive gambling or uncontrollable spending Occasionally, levodopa is needed to maintain movement even though it is causing hallucinations, paranoia, or confusion.  In such cases, certain antipsychotic drugs Treatment of mental symptoms Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive degenerative disorder of specific areas of the brain. \n【15】 After taking levodopa for 5 or more years, more than half the people begin to alternate rapidly between a good response to the drug and no response—called on-off effects.  Within seconds, people may change from being fairly mobile to being severely impaired and immobile.  The periods of mobility after each dose become shorter, and symptoms may occur before the next scheduled dose—the off effects.  Also, symptoms may be accompanied by involuntary movements due to levodopa use, including writhing or hyperactivity.  One of the following can be used to control the off effects for a while: Taking lower, more frequent doses Switching to a form of levodopa that is released more gradually into the blood (a controlled-release formulation) Adding a dopamine agonist or amantadine However, after 15 to 20 years, the off effects become hard to suppress.  Surgery is then considered.  A formulation of levodopa/carbidopa (available in Europe) can be given using a pump connected to a feeding tube inserted in the small intestine.  The pump delivers levodopa continuously, thus keeping the level of drug about the same and making side effects less likely.  This formulation is being studied as treatment for people who have severe symptoms that cannot be relieved by drugs and who cannot be treated with brain surgery.  This formulation appears to greatly reduce the off times and increase quality of life.  Other drugs are generally less effective than levodopa, but they may benefit some people with Parkinson disease, particularly if levodopa is not tolerated or is insufficient.  Dopamine agonists, which act like dopamine, may be useful at any stage of the disease.  They include Pramipexole and ropinirole (given by mouth) Rotigotine (given through a skin patch) Apomorphine (injected under the skin) Side effects may limit the use of dopamine agonists taken by mouth.  In 1 to 2% of people who take them, these drugs may cause compulsive behavior, including compulsive gambling, excessive shopping, and overeating.  In such cases, the dose is reduced, or the drug is stopped and another drug substituted.  Pramipexole and ropinirole are given by mouth.  They can be used first instead of or with levodopa in people who are under 60 and have early Parkinson disease.  However, when used alone.  they are rarely effective for more than a few years.  Or the drugs can be used with levodopa in people with advanced Parkinson disease.  These drugs are usually taken 3 times a day.  Daytime sleepiness is a common side effect.  A rotigotine skin patch is applied once a day.  The patch is worn continuously for 24 hours, then removed and replaced.  The patch should be placed in different locations each day to reduce risk of skin irritation.  Rotigotine is used alone, early in the disease.  Because apomorphine is quick-acting, it is used to reverse the off effects of levodopa—when movement is difficult to initiate.  Thus, this drug is called rescue therapy.  It is usually used when people freeze in place, preventing them, for example, from walking.  Affected people or another person (such as a family member) can inject the drug up to 5 times a day as needed.  In some countries, apomorphine is available in a formulation that can be given using a pump to people who have severe symptoms when surgery is not an option.  The pump is a small device that can be clipped to a belt or put in a pocket.  A small tube from the pump is inserted under the skin.  Apomorphine is pumped from the device through the tube under the skin.  This system provides apomorphine automatically on a regular schedule.  Rasagiline and selegiline belong to a class of drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【16】 They slow the breakdown of levodopa into dopamine, thereby prolonging dopamine’s action in the body.  These drugs can be used alone to postpone the use of levodopa, but they are often given later to supplement levodopa.  Theoretically, if taken with certain foods (such as certain cheeses), beverages (such as red wine), or drugs, MAO inhibitors can have a serious side effect called hypertensive crisis Classification of blood pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【17】 However, this effect is unlikely when Parkinson disease is being treated because the doses used are low and the type of MAO inhibitor used (MAO type B inhibitors), particularly rasagiline, is less likely to have this effect.  Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (entacapone, opicapone, and tolcapone) slow the breakdown of levodopa and dopamine, prolonging their effects, and therefore appear to be a useful supplement to levodopa.  These drugs are used only with levodopa.  Tolcapone is seldom used now because rarely, it damages the liver.  However, tolcapone is stronger than entacapone and may be useful if off effects are severe or long-lasting.  Some anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? drugs are effective in reducing the severity of a tremor and can be used in the early stages of Parkinson disease or later to supplement levodopa.  Commonly used anticholinergic drugs include benztropine and trihexyphenidyl.  Anticholinergic drugs are particularly useful for very young people whose most troublesome symptom is a tremor.  Doctors try to avoid using these drugs in older people because they also have troublesome side effects (such as confusion, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, constipation, difficulty urinating, and loss of bladder control) and because these drugs, when taken for a long time, increase the risk of mental decline.  They may reduce tremor because they block the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and tremor is thought to be caused by an imbalance of acetylcholine (too much) and dopamine (too little).  Occasionally, other drugs with anticholinergic effects, including some antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants, are used, sometimes to supplement levodopa.  However, because these drugs are only mildly effective and because many anticholinergic effects are troublesome, these drugs are seldom used to treat Parkinson disease.  Nonetheless, tricyclic antidepressants Heterocyclic (including tricyclic) antidepressants Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【18】 Amantadine, a drug sometimes used to treat influenza, may be used alone to treat mild Parkinson disease or as a supplement to levodopa.  Amantadine probably has many effects that make it work.  For example, it stimulates nerve cells to release dopamine.  It is used most often to help control the involuntary movements (dyskinesias) that are side effects of levodopa.  If used alone, amantadine often loses its effectiveness after several months.   Deep brain stimulation People with involuntary movements or on-off effects due to long-term use of levodopa may benefit from deep brain stimulation.  Tiny electrodes are surgically implanted in part of the basal ganglia.  The electrodes send small amounts of electricity to the specific area of the basal ganglia responsible for the tremors.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is used to locate the specific area to be stimulated.  By stimulating this part, deep brain stimulation often greatly reduces involuntary movements and tremors and shortens the off part of the on-off effects.  Deep brain stimulation is available only at special centers.  Other procedures Focused ultrasound surgery uses MRI to identify areas of the brain affected by Parkinson disease.  Then concentrated ultrasound waves are applied the targeted area to destroy it.  This procedure does not involve invasive surgery.  In some countries, doctors surgically remove a small part of the brain that is severely affected or use a tiny electrical probe to destroy that part of the brain.  These procedures may lessen symptoms.  If these procedures are unsuccessful, deep brain stimulation of a different part of the brain may be done.  Stem cells Transplantation of stem cells into the brain, once thought to be a possible treatment for Parkinson disease, has been shown to be ineffective and to have troublesome side effects.  Treatment of mental symptoms Psychotic and other mental symptoms, whether caused by Parkinson disease itself, a drug, or something else, are treated.  Certain antipsychotic drugs—quetiapine, clozapine, or pimavanserin—are sometimes used to treat psychotic symptoms in older people with Parkinson disease and dementia.  These drugs, unlike other antipsychotics, do not worsen the symptoms of Parkinson disease.  They are well-tolerated by younger people and help control the psychotic symptoms that occur in people with Parkinson disease dementia With Lewy Bodies and Parkinson Disease Dementia with Lewy bodies is progressive loss of mental function characterized by the development of Lewy bodies in nerve cells. \n【19】 Clozapine is most effective, but its use is limited because it has serious side effects (such as a low white blood cell count) and requires frequent blood tests to check for these effects.  Recent evidence suggests that pimavanserin can effectively treat psychotic symptoms without worsening the symptoms of Parkinson disease.  Also, frequent blood tests are not required.  Antidepressants are used to treat depression.  Antidepressants with anticholinergic effects (such as amitriptyline) are sometimes used.  They may also help lessen the tremor.  However, many other antidepressants are very effective and have fewer side effects.  They include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【20】 Treatment of mental symptoms can help lessen problems with movement, improve quality of life, and sometimes delay the need to be put in an institution.  Caregiver and end-of-life issues Because Parkinson disease is progressive, people eventually need help with normal daily activities, such as eating, bathing, dressing, and toileting.  Caregivers can benefit from learning about the physical and psychologic effects of Parkinson disease and about ways to enable people to function as well as possible.  Because such care is tiring and stressful, caregivers may benefit from support groups.  Eventually, most people with Parkinson disease become severely disabled and immobile.  They may be unable to eat, even with assistance.  Dementia develops in about one third of them.  Because swallowing becomes increasingly difficult, death due to aspiration pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonia and Chemical Pneumonitis Aspiration pneumonia is lung infection caused by inhaling mouth secretions, stomach contents, or both. \n【21】 For some people, a nursing home may be the best place for care.

Diagnosis is clinical; evaluation requires ECG and cardiac monitoring.  Treatment is supportive.  Although injury and deaths due to lightning strikes have decreased significantly over the last 50 years, lightning strikes still cause about 30 deaths and several hundred injuries annually in the US.  Lightning tends to strike tall or isolated objects, including trees, towers, shelters, flagpoles, bleachers, and fences.  A person may be the tallest object in an open field.  Metal objects and water do not attract lightning but easily transmit electricity once they are hit.  Lightning can strike a person directly, or the current can be transferred to the person through the ground or a nearby object.  Lightning has been observed to strike 10 or more miles away from a storm, even in areas with clear skies, creating the potential for unexpected risk .  Lightning can also travel from outdoor power or electrical lines to indoor electrical equipment or telephone lines.  The force of a lightning strike can throw the person up to several meters.  Because the physics of lightning injury is different from that of generated electrical energy Electrical Injuries Electrical injury is damage caused by generated electrical current passing through the body. \n【1】 For example, damage from lightning injury is not determined by voltage or amperage.  Although lightning current contains a large amount of energy, it flows for an extremely brief period (1/10,000 to 1/1000 second).  It rarely, if ever, causes serious skin wounds and seldom causes rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome involving the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. \n【2】 Patients may have intracranial hemorrhage Intracerebral Hemorrhage Intracerebral hemorrhage is focal bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain parenchyma.  The cause is usually hypertension. \n【3】 Lightning can affect the heart but primarily affects the nervous system, damaging the brain, autonomic nervous system, and peripheral nerves.  Pearls & Pitfalls Unlike high-voltage and high-current electrical injury from generated sources, lightning rarely, if ever, causes serious skin wounds and seldom causes rhabdomyolysis or serious internal tissue damage. \n【4】 Keraunoparalysis is paralysis and mottling, coldness, and pulselessness of the lower and sometimes upper extremities plus sensory deficits; the cause is likely injury to the sympathetic nervous system.  Keraunoparalysis is common and usually resolves within several hours, although some degree of permanent paresis occasionally results.  Other manifestations of lightning injury may include Minor skin burns in a punctate or feathered, branched pattern Tympanic membrane perforation Cataracts (within days) Neurologic problems may include confusion, cognitive deficits, and peripheral neuropathy.  Neuropsychologic problems (eg, sleep disturbances, attention deficit, memory problems) may occur. \n【5】 Cognitive deficits, pain syndromes, and sympathetic nervous system damage ,eg, erectile dysfunction , 1 Symptoms and signs reference Lightning injuries include cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, and temporary or permanent neurologic deficits; serious burns and internal tissue injury are rare. \n【6】 Diagnosis of Lightning Injuries Recognition of cardiac and brain complications Lightning injuries may be witnessed or unwitnessed.  Unwitnessed injuries should be suspected when people found outside during or after storms have amnesia Amnesias Amnesia is partial or total inability to recall past experiences or inability to store new memories after the causative event. \n【7】 All patients struck by lightning should be evaluated for traumatic injuries.  ECG may be done if injury is severe.  Cardiac enzymes are measured for patients with the following: Chest pain Abnormal ECG Altered mental status Patients with initially abnormal or deteriorating mental status or focal neurologic deficits compatible with a brain lesion require a head CT or MRI.  Treatment of Lightning Injuries Supportive care Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is initiated for cardiac or respiratory arrest or both.  If an automated external defibrillator is available, it should be used for cardiac arrest.  Patients who are in cardiac arrest Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow. \n【8】 Thus, unlike in a typical mass-casualty event Overview of Incidents Involving Mass-Casualty Weapons Mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) are events that generate sufficiently high numbers of casualties to overwhelm available medical resources. \n【9】 Supportive care is provided.  Fluids are usually restricted to minimize potential brain edema.  Most patients who have been injured by lightning can be safely discharged unless cardiac effects or brain lesions are suspected.  Prevention of Lightning Injuries Most lightning injuries can be prevented by following lightning safety guidelines.  People should know the weather forecast and have an escape plan involving evacuation to a safer area (ideally a large, habitable building).  They should pay attention to the weather while outdoors so they can implement the escape plan if a storm comes up.  By the time thunder is heard, people are a\n【10】s, computers, or headsets attached by a cable to a sound system.  Cellular phones and other handheld devices and laptop computers are safe when used with battery power only because they do not attract lightning.  Key Points Lightning injuries tend to cause arrhythmias and brain dysfunction, unlike electrical injuries from generated sources, which tend to cause skin burns and internal tissue injury.  Suspect lightning injury if patients are found unconscious or amnestic outside after a storm.  When evaluating patients, consider traumatic injuries, arrhythmias, and brain and heart damage.

Ultrasonography or MRI/MRCP can usually detect a tumor in the bile ducts or gallbladder.  These cancers are usually fatal, but symptoms can be treated.  Bile is a fluid that is produced by the liver and aids in digestion.  Bile is transported through small tubes (bile ducts) that carry bile through the liver and then from the liver to the gallbladder and to the small intestine.  The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped sac located beneath the liver that stores bile and releases it when needed.   Cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) is rare.  It can originate anywhere in the bile ducts, particularly in those outside of the liver.  Being older or having primary sclerosing cholangitis Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis is inflammation with progressive scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts in and outside the liver.  Eventually, the ducts become blocked and then obliterated. \n【1】 Cancer of the gallbladder is also rare.  Nearly everyone with gallbladder cancer has gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder. \n【2】 Many people live only a few months after this cancer develops.  This cancer is more common among American Indians, people with large gallstones, and people with a extensive scarring of the gallbladder, which can occur in severe chronic cholecystitis Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually resulting from a gallstone blocking the cystic duct.  Typically, people have abdominal pain, fever, and nausea.  Polyps, which are noncancerous (benign) outgrowths of tissue, may develop in the gallbladder.  They rarely cause symptoms or require treatment.  They are found in about 5% of people during ultrasonography.  Surgery may be needed to remove larger polyps.  Sometimes cancers can block the flow of bile, but most blockages are caused by gallstones.  Even less often, cancer can spread (metastasize) from elsewhere in the body to adjacent structures or nearby lymph nodes, causing blockage.  Noncancerous tumors in bile ducts also cause blockages.  Symptoms of Bile Duct and Gallbladder Tumors Early symptoms include the following: Worsening jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.  Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia.   Abdominal discomfort Loss of appetite Weight loss Itchiness Symptoms gradually worsen.  Abdominal pain may become increasingly severe and constant.  The pain is usually caused by blockage of the bile ducts.  The stool may become pale.  People feel tired and uncomfortable.  They may feel a mass in their abdomen.  Gallbladder cancer causes similar symptoms.  Most gallbladder polyps cause no symptoms.  Diagnosis of Bile Duct and Gallbladder Tumors Ultrasonography, followed by other imaging tests Sometimes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or taking a tissue sample Doctors suspect bile duct or gallbladder cancer when a bile duct is blocked and no other cause is identified.  Bile duct cancer is suspected especially in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis is inflammation with progressive scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts in and outside the liver. \n【3】 If people have PSC, blood tests to measure substances secreted by tumors (tumor markers) are done periodically to check for this cancer. \n【4】 Usually, ultrasonography is done first.  Sometimes computed tomography (CT) is done, but results are often not conclusive.  CT cholangiography (CT of the bile ducts done after a radiopaque contrast agent is injected into a vein) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is usually necessary. \n【5】 In this procedure, a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and into the small intestine.  A thin tube (catheter) is inserted through the endoscope, and a radiopaque contrast agent, which is visible on x-rays, is injected through the catheter into the bile ducts.  Then x-rays are taken to detect any abnormalities.  This procedure enables doctors to obtain images and a tissue sample for examination under a microscope .  If these tests suggest a tumor but are not conclusive, doctors may take a tissue sample by inserting a thin needle through the skin into the area thought to be abnormal.  Ultrasonography or CT is used to guide the needle.  To determine how extensive the cancer is, doctors may have to do surgery to directly examine the area (a procedure called a diagnostic laparoscopy or an open laparotomy).  Treatment of Bile Duct and Gallbladder Tumors Insertion of stents into blocked bile ducts Sometimes surgery to remove tumor Most bile duct and gallbladder cancers are fatal, but treatment can help control symptoms.  Tubes (stents) inserted into a duct allow bile to flow past the blockage.  This procedure helps control pain and relieves itchiness.  Stents can be inserted during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).  Surgery to remove a cancerous tumor may be done, but usually the tumor cannot be completely removed.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cholangiocarcinoma may be used.  If tumors have spread from other parts of the body (metastasized), chemotherapy may provide some symptom relief but does not dramatically improve survival.  Very early gallbladder cancer that is found during surgery for gallstones can often be cured by removing the gallbladder.

Mixtures may contain various other substances (such as drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies) or may be contaminated with toxic heavy metals.  Because mixtures can vary so much and because there are so many mixtures that could be studied, most conventional research usually studies one herb, not a mixture.  However, one herb, used alone rather than as a part of a mixture, may not be considered effective by traditional practitioners. \n【3】 Medicinal uses Chinese herbal mixtures have been used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, Tourette syndrome, and many other disorders.  For the most part, evidence that these mixtures are effective is weak or inconclusive, although conclusive evidence is difficult to obtain because of the variability of the types and compositions of the herbs used.  For example, some evidence suggests that the herb Astragalus may improve quality of life for people being treated with chemotherapy for lung cancer.  However, it does not prolong life or slow the progression of cancer.  In such cases, more research is needed to determine whether the herbs are effective.  Possible side effects Each herb and mixture may have its own unique side effects.  For example, an herb called ma huang (Ephedra), an ingredient in many remedies, is a stimulant that can increase heart rate and blood pressure and thus increase the risk of stroke or heart attack.  In herbal mixtures, adverse effects may also result from interactions between active ingredients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Collarbone fractures often occur after a fall on an outstretched arm or a shoulder or after a direct blow.  These fractures cause pain, swelling, and sometimes a bulge or bump where the bone is broken.  Doctors can usually identify collarbone fractures based on a physical examination, but x-rays are taken to pinpoint the fracture's location and determine the extent of the injury.  Most collarbone fractures require only a sling, but some types of fractures require surgery.  Most occur near the middle of the bone.  The broken pieces of bone may stay in place (called a nondisplaced fracture) or be out of place (called a displaced fracture).  In some collarbone fractures, the main ligaments that hold the collarbone to the shoulder bone are torn.  Symptoms of Collarbone Fractures The area is painful and swollen, and pain may extend into the shoulder.  People may sense that the bone is moving and unstable.  Because the collarbone lies just under the skin and has little muscle over it, people may see a bulge or bump where the bone is broken.  The broken bone rarely breaks through the skin, but it may push the skin out.  This effect is called tenting because it resembles a tent pole holding up a tent.  Diagnosis of Collarbone Fractures X-rays Occasionally other imaging tests, such as computed tomography  are needed.  CT combines x-rays with computer technology to produce a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the injured area.  Treatment of Collarbone Fractures Usually, a sling Occasionally surgery Most collarbone fractures can be treated by immobilizing them with a sling for 4 to 6 weeks .

These cancers are more common among men because males who smoke continue to outnumber females who smoke and because oral human papillomavirus (HPV) Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) can be sexually transmitted and causes changes in cells, which can lead to genital warts or to precancer or cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, or throat. \n【1】 Most affected people are between the ages of 50 and 70.  However, the cancers caused by HPV, which are primarily oropharyngeal cancers Mouth and Throat Cancer Mouth and throat cancers are cancers that originate on the lips, the roof, sides, or floor of the mouth, tongue, tonsils, or back of the throat. \n【2】 Often, cancers of the mouth, nose, and throat are considered together by doctors because of certain similarities.  Among the similarities are the type of cancer and the causes.  More than 90% of cancers of the mouth, nose, and throat are squamous cell carcinomas, which means the cancer develops in the squamous cells that line the inside of the mouth, nose, or throat.  Most people who have mouth, nose, or throat cancers use tobacco, drink alcohol, or both.  Another cause of some types of these cancers is viral infection.  HPV Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) can be sexually transmitted and causes changes in cells, which can lead to genital warts or to precancer or cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, or throat. \n【3】 The virus is spread through kissing. \n【4】 A Look Inside the Nose and Throat The most common sites of mouth, nose, and throat cancers are The voice box (larynx) Laryngeal Cancer Laryngeal cancer is cancer originating in the larynx, also known as the voice box.  People may be hoarse or have a lump in the neck or difficulty breathing or swallowing. \n【5】 Skin cancer is most common among people who work or play sports outside and among sunbathers. \n【6】 For cancers that affect the bones, including the jawbone (osteosarcomas, malignant giant cell tumors, multiple myeloma, and metastatic tumors), see Primary Cancerous Bone Tumors that originally start in the bone are called primary bone tumors.  Primary bone tumors may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).  After cancer is diagnosed, it is staged. \n【7】 Symptoms of Mouth, Nose, and Throat Cancers Symptoms vary depending on the location of the cancer.  Common symptoms of mouth, nose, and throat cancers include Hoarseness A lump in the neck A painful open sore or a growth in the mouth Difficulty swallowing and resulting weight loss Sometimes red or white patches (erythroplakia or leukoplakia) in the mouth may be early symptoms.  Diagnosis of Mouth, Nose, and Throat Cancers Examination by a doctor or dentist Endoscopy Biopsy Imaging tests to determine the extent ,called staging Cancer is suspected based on a person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, and sometimes the results of screening tests. \n【8】 If a person has symptoms, the doctor can use a flexible viewing tube, called an endoscope, to examine the deeper regions in the mouth, nose, and throat.  The diagnosis is made by examining a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, from the suspected cancer.  Doctors insert a needle into the growth to get a small amount of tissue or cut out a small piece using a scalpel.

In general, outcomes are better when the cancer is diagnosed and treated before it has spread.  People with mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV have a better prognosis than a person whose tumors were caused by tobacco or alcohol.  Prevention of Mouth, Nose, and Throat Cancers It is important for people to eliminate risk factors for mouth, nose, and throat cancers, so everyone should stop using tobacco (smoking and chewing tobacco) and limit how much alcohol they drink.  Removing risk factors also helps prevent disease from coming back in people who have been treated for cancer. \n【13】 Treatment of Mouth, Nose, and Throat Cancers Surgery and/or radiation therapy Sometimes chemotherapy Palliative treatment of mouth, nose, and throat cancers usually involves surgery Surgery for Cancer Surgery is a traditional form of cancer treatment.

{"seq_id": "a6f337c3-09c8-465a-b4e7-f2e9e6d19f91", "title": null, "text": "【0】Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection results from 1 of 2 similar retroviruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) that destroy CD4+ lymphocytes and impair cell-mediated immunity, increasing risk of certain infections and cancers.  Initial infection may cause nonspecific febrile illness.  Risk of subsequent manifestations—related to immunodeficiency—is proportional to the level of CD4+ lymphocyte depletion.  HIV can directly damage the brain, gonads, kidneys, and heart, causing cognitive impairment, hypogonadism, renal insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy.  Manifestations range from asymptomatic carriage to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is defined by the presence of an AIDS-defining illness (serious opportunistic infections or cancers) or a CD4 count of < 200/mcL.  HIV infection can be diagnosed by antibody, nucleic acid (HIV RNA), or antigen (p24) testing.  Screening should be routinely offered to all adults and adolescents.  Treatment aims to suppress HIV replication by using combinations of ≥ 2 drugs that inhibit HIV enzymes; treatment can restore immune function in most patients if suppression of replication is sustained.   Infection in Infants and Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【1】 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus.  Retroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses defined by their mechanism of replication via reverse transcription to produce DNA copies that integrate into the host cell's genome.  There are 2 HIV types, HIV-1 and HIV-2.  HIV-1 causes most HIV infections worldwide, but HIV-2 causes a substantial proportion of infections in parts of West Africa.  In some areas of West Africa, both viruses are prevalent and may coinfect patients.  HIV-2 appears to be less virulent than HIV-1.  HIV-1 originated in Central Africa in the first half of the 20th century, when a closely related chimpanzee virus first infected humans.  Epidemic global spread began in the late 1970s, and AIDS was recognized in 1981.  Epidemiology of HIV Infection The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates  that in 2021, approximately 38 million people worldwide, including 1. 7 million children (< 15 years), were living with HIV; 54% were women and girls.  Approximately 25. 6 million (about 67%) of people living with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa.  In many sub-Saharan African countries, incidence of HIV infection is declining markedly from the very high rates of the 1990s; nevertheless, important gaps remain to meet the World Health Organization's Fast-Track strategy to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.  In 2021, approximately 1. 5 million people were newly infected with HIV, of whom approximately 860,000 (57%) were in sub-Saharan Africa.  Among people living with HIV in 2021, approximately 85% knew their HIV status and 75% were accessing treatment.  In 2021, approximately 650,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1. 9 million in 2004 and 1. 4 million in 2010.  However, through international efforts, as of 2021, an estimated 28. 7 million people living with HIV were accessing antiretroviral therapy (up from 7. 8 million in 2010), dramatically reducing deaths and transmission in many countries .  In the United States, at the end of 2019, an estimated 1,189,700 people ≥ 13 years were living with HIV, including an estimated 158,500 (13%) people whose infections had not been diagnosed.  In 2020, over 30,600 people received an HIV diagnosis in the United States, and 20,758 cases were due to male-to-male sexual contact; data for 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance activities.   HIV has spread in epidemiologically distinct patterns: Heterosexual intercourse (affecting men and women about equally) Men who have sex with men Contact with infected blood (eg, through sharing needles; through transfusions before effective screening of donors) Most HIV infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact, but risk factors vary according to region.  For instance, transmission among men who have sex with men is usually the most common way infection occurs in high-resource countries, but people who inject drugs are disproportionally affected in Southern Asia.  In areas where heterosexual transmission is dominant, HIV infection follows routes of trade, transportation, and economic migration to cities and spreads secondarily to rural areas.  In Africa, particularly southern Africa, the HIV epidemic has killed tens of millions of young adults, creating millions of orphans.  Factors associated with increased rates of spread include Poverty and sexual violence Lack of education Health care systems that do not provide access to HIV testing and antiretroviral drugs Stigmatization, criminalization, and discrimination against people with HIV Many opportunistic infections that complicate HIV are reactivations of latent infections.  Thus, epidemiologic factors that determine the prevalence of latent infections also influence risk of specific opportunistic infections.  In many countries with high rates of HIV infection, prevalence of latent tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【2】 Dramatic increases in reactivated tuberculosis and toxoplasmic encephalitis have followed the epidemic of HIV-induced immunosuppression in these countries.  Similarly in the United States, incidence of coccidioidomycosis is a pulmonary or hematogenously spread disseminated disease caused by the fungi Coccidioides immitis and C. \n【3】 Human herpesvirus 8 infection, which causes Kaposi sarcoma Kaposi Sarcoma Kaposi sarcoma is a multicentric vascular tumor caused by herpesvirus type 8. \n【4】 Thus, in the United States, > 90% of AIDS patients who have developed Kaposi sarcoma are men who have sex with men.  Transmission of HIV Infection Transmission of HIV requires contact with body fluids—specifically blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, or exudates from wounds or skin and mucosal lesions—that contain free HIV virions or infected cells.  Transmission is more likely with the high levels of virions that are typical during primary infection, even when such infections are asymptomatic.  Transmission by saliva or droplets produced by coughing or sneezing, although conceivable, is extremely unlikely.  HIV is not transmitted by contact that does not involve exchange of body fluids.  Transmission is usually Sexual: Direct transmission through sexual intercourse Needle- or instrument-related: Sharing of blood-contaminated needles or exposure to contaminated instruments Transfusion- or transplant-related Vertical: Transmission from an infected mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or through breast milk Sexual transmission of HIV Sexual practices such as fellatio (oral sex done to a male) and cunnilingus (oral sex done to a female) appear to be relatively low risk but not absolutely safe .  Risk does not increase significantly if semen or vaginal secretions are swallowed.  However, open sores in the mouth may increase risk.  The sexual practices with the highest risks are those that cause mucosal trauma, typically intercourse.  Anal-receptive intercourse poses the highest risk.  Mucous membrane inflammation facilitates HIV transmission; sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. \n【5】 Other practices that cause mucosal trauma include fisting (inserting most or all of the hand into the rectum or vagina) and using sexual toys.  When used during intercourse with a partner infected with HIV and/or with multiple concurrent sex partners, these practices increase the risk of HIV transmission.  Risk of transmission is increased in the early and advanced stages of HIV infection when HIV concentrations in plasma and genital fluids are higher. \n【6】 Circumcision seems to reduce the risk of males acquiring HIV infection by about 50%, by removing the penile mucosa (underside of foreskin), which is more susceptible to HIV infection than the keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium that covers the rest of the penis.   HIV Transmission Risk for Several Sexual Activities Risk Activity None (unless sores are present) Dry kissing Body-to-body rubbing and massage Using unshared inserted sexual devices (eg, sex toys) Genital stimulation by a partner but no contact with semen or vaginal fluids Bathing or showering together Contact with feces or urine if skin is intact Theoretical (extremely low risk unless sores are present) Wet kissing Fellatio (oral sex done to a male) without ejaculation or if a condom is used Cunnilingus (oral sex done to a female) if a barrier is used Oral-anal contact Digital vaginal or anal penetration, with or without a glove Use of shared but disinfected inserted sexual devices Low Fellatio without a condom and with ejaculation Cunnilingus if no barrier is used Vaginal or anal intercourse if a condom is used correctly Use of shared but not disinfected inserted sexual devices High Vaginal or anal intercourse with or without ejaculation if a condom is not used or is not used correctly Needle- and instrument-related transmission Risk of HIV transmission after skin penetration with a medical instrument contaminated with infected blood is on average about 1/300 without postexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis.  Immediate prophylaxis probably reduces risk to < 1/1500.  Risk appears to be higher if the wound is deep or if blood is inoculated (eg, with a contaminated hollow-bore needle).  Risk is also increased with hollow-bore needles and with punctures of arteries or veins compared with solid needles or other penetrating objects coated with blood because larger volumes of blood may be transferred.  Thus, sharing needles that have entered the veins of other people is a very high risk activity.  Risk of transmission from infected health care practitioners who take appropriate precautions is unclear but appears minimal.  In the 1980s, one dentist transmitted HIV to ≥ 6 of his patients by unknown means.  However, extensive investigations of patients cared for by other physicians infected with HIV, including surgeons, have uncovered few other cases. \n【7】 Transmission rates can be reduced significantly by treating mothers with HIV infection with antiretroviral drugs while they are pregnant, in labor, and breastfeeding.  Cesarean delivery and treatment of the infant for several weeks after birth also reduce the risk.  HIV is excreted in breast milk. \n【8】 In high-resource countries, women with HIV infection are advised not to breastfeed .  However, in resource-limited settings, breastfeeding is associated with reduced infant morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition and infectious diseases.  For women living with HIV in low-resource settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends antiretroviral treatment and adherence support combined with breastfeeding for at least 12 months .  Because many women with HIV infection and their infants are treated or take prophylactic antiretroviral medications during pregnancy, the incidence of AIDS in children is decreasing in many countries  Infection in Infants and Children Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【9】 Transfusion- and transplant-related transmission Screening of blood donors with tests for both antibody to HIV and HIV RNA has minimized risk of transmission via transfusion.  Current risk of transmitting HIV via blood transfusion is estimated to be < 1/2,000,000 per unit transfused in the United States.  However, in many high HIV burden countries, where blood and blood products are not screened for HIV, the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection remains high.  Rarely, HIV has been transmitted via transplantation of organs from HIV-seropositive donors.  Infection has developed in recipients of kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, bone, and skin—all of which contain blood—but screening for HIV greatly reduces risk of transmission.  HIV transmission is even more unlikely from transplantation of cornea, ethanol-treated and lyophilized bone, fresh-frozen bone without marrow, lyophilized tendon or fascia, or lyophilized and irradiated dura mater.  HIV transmission is possible via artificial insemination using sperm from HIV-positive donors.  Some cases of infection occurred in the early 1980s, before safeguards were introduced.  In the United States, sperm washing is considered an effective method of reducing the risk of partner insemination from a known HIV-positive sperm donor. \n【10】 Pathophysiology of HIV Infection HIV attaches to and penetrates host T cells via CD4+ molecules and chemokine receptors .  After attachment, HIV RNA and several HIV-encoded enzymes are released into the host cell.  Viral replication requires that reverse transcriptase (an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) copy HIV RNA, producing proviral DNA; this copying mechanism is prone to errors, resulting in frequent mutations and thus new HIV genotypes.  These mutations facilitate the generation of HIV that can resist control by the host’s immune system and by antiretroviral drugs.  Proviral DNA enters the host cell’s nucleus and is integrated into the host DNA in a process that involves integrase, another HIV enzyme.  With each cell division, the integrated proviral DNA is duplicated along with the host DNA.  Subsequently, the proviral HIV DNA can be transcribed to HIV RNA and translated to HIV proteins, such as the envelope glycoproteins 41 and 120.  These HIV proteins are assembled into HIV virions at the host cell inner membrane and budded from the cell surface within an envelop of modified human cell membrane.  Each host cell may produce thousands of virions.  After budding, protease, another HIV enzyme, cleaves viral proteins, converting the immature virion into a mature, infectious virion.  Simplified HIV life cycle HIV attaches to and penetrates host T cells, then releases HIV RNA and enzymes into the host cell.  HIV reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA as proviral DNA.  Proviral DNA enters the host cell’s nucleus, and HIV integrase facilitates the proviral DNA’s integration into the host’s DNA.  The host cell then produces HIV RNA and HIV proteins.  HIV proteins are assembled into HIV virions and budded from the cell surface.  HIV protease cleaves viral proteins, converting the immature virion to a mature, infectious virus.  Infected CD4+ lymphocytes produce > 98% of plasma HIV virions.  A subset of infected CD4+ lymphocytes constitutes a reservoir of HIV that can reactivate (eg, if antiviral treatment is stopped).  In moderate to heavy HIV infection, about 108 to 109 virions are created and removed daily.  The HIV average half-life in plasma is about 36 hours, about 24 hours intracellularly, and about 6 hours as an extracellular virus.  Every day roughly 30% of the total HIV burden in an infected individual is turned over. \n【11】 Hence, AIDS results from a continuous and consistent replication of HIV, leading to the virus and immune-mediated killing of CD4 lymphocytes.  Further, the high volume of HIV replication and high frequency of transcription errors by HIV reverse transcriptase result in many mutations, increasing the chance of producing strains resistant to host immunity and drugs.  Infection with another type of retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), is less common but can also cause serious disease.  Immune system Two main consequences of HIV infection are Damage to the immune system, specifically depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes Immune activation CD4+ lymphocytes are involved in cell-mediated and, to a lesser extent, humoral immunity.  CD4+ depletion may result from the following: Direct cytotoxic effects of HIV replication Cell-mediated immune cytotoxicity Thymic damage that impairs lymphocyte production Infected CD4+ lymphocytes have a half-life of about 2 days, which is much shorter than that of uninfected CD4+ cells.  Rates of CD4+ lymphocyte destruction correlate with plasma HIV level.  Typically, during the initial or primary infection, HIV levels are highest (> 106 copies/mL), and the CD4 count drops rapidly.  The normal CD4 count is about 750/mcL, and immunity is minimally affected if the count is > 350/mcL.  If the count drops below about 200/mcL, loss of cell-mediated immunity allows a variety of opportunistic pathogens to reactivate from latent states and cause clinical disease.  The humoral immune system is also affected.  Hyperplasia of B cells in lymph nodes causes lymphadenopathy, and secretion of antibodies to previously encountered antigens increases, often leading to hyperglobulinemia.  Total antibody levels (especially IgG and IgA) and titers against previously encountered antigens may be unusually high.  However, antibody response to new antigens (eg, in vaccines) decreases as the CD4 count decreases.  Abnormal elevation of immune activation may be caused in part by absorption of components of bowel bacteria.  Immune activation contributes to CD4+ depletion and immunosuppression by mechanisms that remain unclear.  Other tissues HIV also infects nonlymphoid monocytic cells (eg, dendritic cells in the skin, macrophages, brain microglia) and cells of the brain, genital tract, heart, and kidneys, causing disease in the corresponding organ systems. \n【12】 Thus, HIV levels and resistance patterns in these compartments may vary independently from those in plasma.  Disease progression During the first few weeks of primary infection, there are humoral and cellular immune responses: Humoral: Antibodies to HIV are usually measurable within a few weeks after primary infection; however, antibodies cannot fully control HIV infection because mutated forms of HIV that are not controlled by the patient’s current anti-HIV antibodies are generated.  Cellular: Cell-mediated immunity is a more important means of controlling the high levels of viremia (usually over 106 copies/mL) at first.  But rapid mutation of viral antigens that are targeted by lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity subvert control of HIV in all but a small percentage of patients.  Plasma HIV virion levels, expressed as number of HIV RNA copies/mL, stabilize after about 6 months at a level (set point) that varies widely among patients but averages 30,000 to 100,000/mL (4. 2 to 5 log10/mL). \n【13】 Chronic meningitis lasts ≥ 4 weeks. \n【14】 A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. \n【15】 Without treatment, risk of progression to AIDS is about 1 to 2%/year in the first 2 to 3 years of infection and about 5 to 6%/year thereafter.  Eventually, AIDS almost invariably develops in untreated patients.  HTLV Infections Infection with human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) 1 or 2 can cause T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and immunocompromise.  Some HTLV-infected patients develop infections similar to those that occur in patients infected with HIV. \n【16】 Symptoms and Signs of HIV Infection Initial HIV infection Initially, primary HIV infection may be asymptomatic or cause transient nonspecific symptoms (acute retroviral syndrome).  Acute retroviral syndrome usually begins within 1 to 4 weeks of infection and usually lasts 3 to 14 days.  Symptoms and signs are often mistaken for infectious mononucleosis or benign, nonspecific viral syndromes and may include fever, malaise, fatigue, several types of dermatitis, sore throat, arthralgias, generalized lymphadenopathy, and septic meningitis.  After the first symptoms disappear, most patients, even without treatment, have no symptoms or only a few mild, intermittent, nonspecific symptoms for a highly variable time period (2 to 15 years).  Symptoms during this relatively asymptomatic period may result from HIV directly or from opportunistic infections.  The following are most common: Lymphadenopathy White plaques due to oral candidiasis Herpes zoster Diarrhea Fatigue Fever with intermittent sweats Asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate cytopenias (eg, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) are also common.  Some patients experience progressive wasting (which may be related to anorexia and increased catabolism due to infections) and low-grade fevers or diarrhea.  Worsening HIV infection When the CD4 count drops to < 200/mcL, nonspecific symptoms may worsen and a succession of AIDS-defining illnesses develop.  In patients with HIV infection, certain syndromes are common and may require different considerations . \n【17】 In other patients, neurologic dysfunction may occur.  Evaluation may detect infections that do not typically occur in the general population, such as Disseminated mycobacterial infections Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infections There are over 170 recognized species of mycobacteria, mostly environmental. \n【18】  Most fungal vaginitis is caused by C. \n【19】 AIDS-associated KS is an aggressive, multicentric tumor that may involve the face, trunk, mucosal surfaces, lymphatics, or gastrointestinal tract.

Lymphoma, immunoblastic (or equivalent term) Lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systems. \n【27】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【28】Diagnosis of HIV Infection HIV antibody testing with or without HIV P24 antigen tests Nucleic acid amplification assays to determine HIV RNA level (viral load) HIV infection is suspected in patients with persistent, unexplained, generalized adenopathy or any of the AIDS-defining illnesses .  It may also be suspected in high-risk patients with symptoms that could represent acute primary HIV infection.  Diagnostic tests Detection of antibodies to HIV is sensitive and specific except during the first few weeks after infection (termed the \"window period\" of acute HIV infection).  However, the HIV p24 antigen (a core protein of the virus) is already present in the blood during most of this time and can be detected by assays.  Currently, a 4th-generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is recommended; it detects antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as the p24 HIV antigen.  The laboratory version is probably preferred over the point-of-care one for diagnosing early infection, but both can be done quickly (within 30 minutes).  If the test result is positive, an assay to differentiate HIV-1 and HIV-2 and an HIV RNA assay are done.  Earlier-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody assays are highly sensitive, but because they do not test for antigen, they are not positive as early as the 4th-generation combination test.  Also, results are rarely false-positive.  Positive ELISA results are therefore confirmed with a more specific test such as Western blot.  However, these tests have drawbacks: ELISA requires complex equipment.  Western blot requires well-trained technicians and is expensive.  The full testing sequence takes at least a day.  Point-of-care tests using blood or saliva (eg, particle agglutination, immunoconcentration, immunochromatography) can be done quickly (in 15 minutes) and simply, allowing testing in a variety of settings and immediate reporting to patients.  Positive results of these rapid tests should be confirmed by standard blood tests (eg, ELISA with or without Western blot) in high-resource countries and repetition with one or more other rapid tests in high HIV burden countries.  Negative tests need not be confirmed.  If HIV infection is suspected despite negative antibody test results (eg, during the first few weeks after infection), the plasma HIV RNA level may be measured.  The nucleic acid amplification assays used are highly sensitive and specific.  HIV RNA assays require advanced technology, such as reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is sensitive to extremely low HIV RNA levels.  Measuring p24 HIV antigen by ELISA is less sensitive and less specific than directly detecting HIV RNA in blood.  Staging HIV infection can be staged based on the CD4 count.  In patients ≥ 6 years old, stages are as follows: Stage 1: ≥ 500 cells/mcL Stage 2: 200 to 499 cells/mcL Stage 3: < 200 cells/mcL The CD4 count after 1 to 2 years of treatment provides an indication of ultimate immune recovery; CD4 counts may not return to the normal range despite prolonged suppression of HIV.  Monitoring When HIV is diagnosed, the following should be determined: CD4 count Plasma HIV RNA level Both are useful for determining prognosis and monitoring treatment.  The CD4 count is calculated as the product of the following: White blood cell count (eg, 4000 cells/mcL) Percentage of white blood cells that are lymphocytes (eg, 30%) Percentage of lymphocytes that are CD4+ (eg, 20%) Using the numbers above, the CD4 count (4000 x 0. 3 x 0. 2) is 240 cells/mcL, or about 1/3 of the normal CD4 count in adults, which is about 750 ± 250/mcL.  Plasma HIV RNA level (viral load) reflects HIV replication rates.  The higher the set point (the relatively stable virus levels that occur after primary infection), the more quickly the CD4 count decreases and the greater the risk of opportunistic infection, even in patients without symptoms.  Baseline HIV genotype can be determined using a sample of blood; availability of this testing varies by location.  HIV genotyping is used to identify mutations known to cause resistance to certain antiretroviral drugs and to help select a drug regimen likely to be effective for a specific patient with HIV infection.  Diagnosis of HIV-related conditions Diagnosis of the various opportunistic infections, cancers, and other syndromes that occur in patients infected with HIV is discussed elsewhere in The Manual.  Many have aspects unique to HIV infection.  Hematologic disorders (eg, cytopenias, lymphomas, cancers) are common and may be usefully evaluated with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  This procedure can also help diagnose disseminated infections with MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex), M.  tuberculosis, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, human parvovirus B19, P.  jirovecii, and Leishmania.  Most patients have normocellular or hypercellular marrow despite peripheral cytopenia, reflecting peripheral destruction.  Iron stores are usually normal or increased, reflecting anemia of chronic disease (an iron-reutilization defect).  Mild to moderate plasmacytosis, lymphoid aggregates, increased numbers of histiocytes, and dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells are common.  HIV-associated neurologic syndromes can be differentiated via lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis and central nervous system contrast-enhanced CT or MRI .  Screening for HIV Screening antibody tests or newer combination antigen/antibody tests should be offered routinely to adults and adolescents, particularly pregnant women, regardless of their perceived risk.  For people at highest risk, especially sexually active people who have multiple partners and who do not practice safe sex, testing should be repeated every 6 to 12 months.  Such testing is confidential and available, often free of charge, in many public and private facilities throughout the world.  Rapid tests have the advantage of offering preliminary test results at the initial encounter in less than 25 minutes.  They are especially useful for people who are unlikely to return for their test results.  People receiving HIV testing should also be provided information on prevention, care, and treatment services.  In the United States, screening for HIV infection is recommended in all adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years and in younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of infection .  Screening is also recommended in all pregnant persons, including those who present in labor or at delivery whose HIV status is unknown.  The World Health Organization suggests that, in settings with a high HIV burden, HIV testing be done using rapid antibody tests and enzyme immunoassays . \n【29】 Treatment with ART is recommended for all patients, because disease-related complications can occur even in untreated patients with high CD4 counts and because the toxicity of antiretrovirals has decreased as new drugs have been developed.  The benefits of ART outweigh the risks in every patient group and setting that has been carefully studied.  In the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, 5472 treatment-naïve patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts > 350 cells/mcL were randomized to start ART immediately (immediate initiation) or to defer ART until their CD4 count decreased to < 250 cells/mcL (deferred initiation). \n【30】 A few exceptional patients can control their HIV strain without treatment; they maintain normal CD4 counts and very low blood levels of HIV (long-term nonprogressors) or normal CD4 counts and undetectable blood levels of HIV (elite controllers).  These patients may not require ART, but studies to determine whether treating them is helpful have not been done and would be difficult because there are few of these patients and they would likely do well not taking ART for long periods.  Antiretroviral therapy: General principles ART aims to Reduce the plasma HIV RNA level to undetectable (ie, < 20 to 50 copies/mL) Restore the CD4 count to a normal level (immune restoration or reconstitution) A poor CD4 count response is more likely if the CD4 count at initiation of treatment is low (especially if < 50/mcL) and/or the HIV RNA level is high.  However, marked improvement is likely even in patients with advanced immunosuppression.  An increased CD4 count correlates with markedly decreased risk of opportunistic infections, other complications, and death.  With immune restoration, patients, even those with complications that have no specific treatment (eg, HIV-induced cognitive dysfunction) or that were previously considered untreatable (eg, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), may improve.  Outcomes are also improved for patients with cancers (eg, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma) and most opportunistic infections.  Patients with most acute opportunistic infections benefit from early ART (initiated during the management of the opportunistic infection).  However, for some opportunistic infections, such as tuberculous meningitis or cryptococcal meningitis, the evidence suggests that ART should be delayed (2 to 4 weeks in most cases) until the first phase of antimicrobial therapy for these infections is finished because of the increased frequency of adverse events and death.  The goal of ART can usually be achieved if patients take their medications > 95% of the time.  However, maintaining this degree of adherence is difficult.  Partial suppression (failure to lower plasma HIV RNA levels to undetectable levels) may select for single or multiple accumulated mutations in HIV that make viruses partially or completely resistant to a single drug or entire classes of drugs.  Unless subsequent treatment uses drugs of other classes to which HIV remains sensitive, treatment is more likely to fail.  The success of ART is assessed by measuring plasma HIV RNA levels every 8 to 12 weeks for the first 4 to 6 months or until HIV levels are undetectable and every 6 months thereafter.  Increasing HIV levels are the earliest evidence of treatment failure and may precede a decreasing CD4 count by months.  Maintaining patients on failing drug regimens selects for HIV mutants that are more drug-resistant.  However, compared with wild-type HIV, these mutants appear less able to reduce the CD4 count, and failing drug regimens are often continued when no fully suppressive regimen can be found.  If treatment fails, drug susceptibility (resistance) assays can determine the susceptibility of the dominant HIV strain to all available drugs.  Genotypic and phenotypic assays are available and can help clinicians select a new regimen that should contain at least 2 and preferably 3 drugs to which the HIV strain is more susceptible.  The dominant HIV strain in the blood of patients who are taken off antiretroviral therapy may revert over months to years to the wild-type (ie, susceptible) strain because the resistant mutants replicate more slowly and are replaced by the wild type.  Thus, if patients have not been treated recently, the full extent of resistance may not be apparent through resistance testing, but when treatment resumes, strains with resistance mutations often reemerge from latency and again replace the wild-type HIV strain.  Many patients living with HIV infection are taking complex regimens involving multiple pills to control the HIV RNA level (viral load), but often, no conventional HIV RNA resistance tests were done when viral treatment failed.  With the availability of new co-formulated HIV drugs, many patients could benefit from simplification of their ART regimen, guided by HIV DNA archive genotype testing (GenoSure Archive).  The HIV DNA genotype archive provides HIV-1 antiretroviral drug resistance data when conventional HIV RNA resistance testing cannot be done because patients have a low plasma HIV RNA level (< 500 copies/mL).  The HIV DNA archive genotype test analyzes integrated and unintegrated archived HIV-1 proviral DNA embedded in host cells.  The test amplifies cell-associated HIV-1 DNA from infected cells in whole blood samples, then uses next-generation sequencing technology to analyze the HIV-1 polymerase region.  The positive predictive value of the HIV DNA archive resistance test results may enable clinicians to identify HIV-resistance mutations that were previously unidentified and to select a potentially simpler regimen with co-formulated drugs (≥ 2 drugs in a single pill).  Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) Patients beginning ART sometimes deteriorate clinically, even though HIV levels in their blood are suppressed and their CD4 count increases, because of an immune reaction to subclinical opportunistic infections or to residual microbial antigens after successful treatment of opportunistic infections.  IRIS usually occurs in the first months of treatment but is occasionally delayed.  IRIS can complicate virtually any opportunistic infection and even tumors (eg, Kaposi sarcoma) but is usually self-limited or responds to brief regimens of corticosteroids.  IRIS has two forms: Paradoxical IRIS, which refers to worsening symptoms due to a previously diagnosed infection Unmasked IRIS, which refers to the first appearance of symptoms of an infection not previously diagnosed Paradoxical IRIS typically occurs during the first few months of treatment and usually resolves on its own.  If it does not, corticosteroids, given for a short time, are often effective.  Paradoxical IRIS is more likely to cause symptoms and symptoms are more likely to be severe when ART is started soon after treatment of an opportunistic infection is started.  Thus, for some opportunistic infections, ART is delayed until treatment of the opportunistic infection has reduced or eliminated the infection.  In patients with unmasked IRIS, the newly identified opportunistic infection is treated with antimicrobial drugs.  Occasionally, when the symptoms are severe, corticosteroids are also used.  Usually, when unmasked IRIS occurs, ART is continued.  An exception is cryptococcal meningitis.  Then ART is temporarily interrupted until the infection is controlled.  Determining whether clinical deterioration is caused by treatment failure, IRIS, or both requires assessment of the persistence of active infections with cultures and can be difficult.  Interruption of antiretroviral therapy Interruption of ART is usually safe if all drugs are stopped simultaneously, but levels of slowly metabolized drugs (eg, nevirapine) may remain high and thus increase the risk of resistance.  Interruption may be necessary if intervening illnesses require treatment or if drug toxicity is intolerable or needs to be evaluated.  After interruption to determine which drug is responsible for toxicity, clinicians can safely restart most drugs as monotherapy for up to a few days.  NOTE: The most important exception is abacavir; patients who had fever or rash during previous exposure to abacavir may develop severe, potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions with reexposure.  Risk of an adverse reaction to abacavir is 100-fold higher in patients with HLA-B*57:01, which can be detected by genetic testing.  Pearls & Pitfalls Patients who had an adverse reaction to abacavir should not be given the drug again.  If they are reexposed to the drug, they may have a severe, potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.  Prevention of opportunistic infections  Effective chemoprophylaxis is available for many opportunistic infections and reduces rates of disease due to P.  jirovecii, Candida, Cryptococcus, and MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex).  If therapy restores CD4 counts to above threshold values for > 3 months, chemoprophylaxis can be stopped.  Primary prophylaxis depends on the CD4 count: CD4 count < 200/mcL or oropharyngeal candidiasis (active or previous): Prophylaxis against P.  jirovecii pneumonia is recommended.  Double-strength trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) tablets given once/day or 3 times/week are effective.  Some adverse effects can be minimized with the 3 times/week dose or by gradual dose escalation.  Some patients who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX can tolerate dapsone (100 mg once/day). \n【31】 For the few patients who cannot tolerate either drug because of a troublesome adverse effect (eg, fever, neutropenia, rash), aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once/month or atovaquone 1500 mg once/day can be used.  CD4 count < 50/mcL: Prophylaxis against disseminated MAC consists of azithromycin or clarithromycin; if neither of these drugs is tolerated, rifabutin can be used.  Azithromycin can be given weekly as two 600-mg tablets; it provides protection (70%) similar to daily clarithromycin and does not interact with other drugs.  If latent tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection. \n【32】 For primary prophylaxis against some fungal infections (eg, esophageal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis or pneumonia), oral fluconazole 100 to 200 mg once/day or 400 mg weekly is successful but is infrequently used because the cost per infection prevented is high and diagnosis and treatment of these infections are usually successful.  Secondary prophylaxis (after control of the initial infection) is indicated if patients have had the following: Recurrent oral, vaginal, or esophageal candidiasis (Invasive) Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C.  albicans), manifested by mucocutaneous lesions, fungemia, and sometimes focal infection of multiple sites. \n【33】 Histoplasmosis is a pulmonary and hematogenous disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum; it is often chronic and usually follows an asymptomatic primary infection. \n【34】 Latent toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis is infection with Toxoplasma gondii. \n【35】 TMP/SMX (in doses used to prevent P.  jirovecii pneumonia) is used to prevent reactivation and consequent toxoplasmic encephalitis.  Latent infection is less common (about 15% of adults) in the United States than in Europe and most high HIV burden countries (up to 70 to 80% of adults).  P. \n【36】 Immunization The CDC 2022 recommendations for vaccination of HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 19 years include the following: Patients who have not received a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). \n【37】 All patients should be given the hepatitis B vaccine Hepatitis B (HepB) Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine is 80 to 100% effective in preventing infection or clinical hepatitis B in people who complete the vaccine series. \n【38】 Patients at risk of hepatitis A or desiring protection from it should be given the hepatitis A vaccine Hepatitis A (HepA) Vaccine Both hepatitis A vaccines provide long-term protection against hepatitis A. \n【39】 At the appropriate age, males and females should be given the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease.  HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPV. \n【40】 Adults who have not been previously vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine Meningococcal Vaccine The meningococcal serogroups that most often cause meningococcal disease in the US are serogroups B, C, and Y.  Serogroups A and W cause disease outside the US. \n【41】 Patients who did not receive tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine Vaccines that contain diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis help protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, but they do not prevent all cases. \n【42】 For patients who are beginning or continuing their Td series and have not yet been given Tdap, Tdap should be substituted for one of the Td boosters. \n【43】 The varicella vaccine Varicella Vaccine Varicella vaccination provides effective protection against varicella (chickenpox).  It is not known how long protection against varicella lasts. \n【44】 Generally, inactivated vaccines should be used.  These vaccines are effective less often in patients who are HIV-positive than in those who are HIV-negative.  Because live-virus vaccines are potentially dangerous for patients with severe immunosuppression, expert opinion should be sought when dealing with patients at risk of primary varicella; recommendations vary  infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【45】 Prognosis for HIV Infection Risk of AIDS, death, or both is predicted by the CD4 count in the short term Plasma HIV RNA level in the longer term For every 3-fold (0. 5 log10) increase in viral load, mortality over the next 2 to 3 years increases about 50%.  HIV-associated morbidity and mortality vary by the CD4 count, with the most deaths from HIV-related causes occurring at counts of < 50/mcL. \n【46】 Hence, prompt diagnosis of HIV before the disease is too advanced and immediate initiation of HIV treatment are essential to prognosis.  Another, less well-understood prognostic factor is the level of immune activation as determined by evaluating the expression of activation markers on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes.  Activation, which may be caused by leakage of bacteria across the HIV-damaged colonic mucosa, is a strong prognostic predictor but is not used clinically because this test is not widely available and antiretroviral therapy changes the prognosis, making this test less important.  A subgroup of people infected with HIV (termed long-term nonprogressors) remains asymptomatic with high CD4 counts and low HIV levels in the blood without antiretroviral treatment.  These people usually have vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses to their infecting HIV strain as measured by assays in vitro.  The specificity of this effective response is shown by the following: When these people acquire a superinfection with a second strain of HIV to which their immune response is not as effective, they convert to a more typical pattern of progression.  Thus, their unusually effective response to the first strain does not apply to the second strain.  These cases provide a rationale for counseling people infected with HIV that they still need to avoid exposure to possible HIV superinfection through unsafe sex or needle sharing.  Cure of HIV infection has not been thought possible, and thus lifelong drug treatment is considered necessary.  Patients living with HIV infection should be urged to take their antiretroviral drugs consistently. \n【47】 Periodic HIV treatment interruption is also detrimental. \n【48】 End-of-life care Although antiretroviral therapy has dramatically increased life expectancy for patients with AIDS, many patients still deteriorate and die.  Death may result from the following: Inability to take ART consistently, resulting in progressive immunosuppression Occurrence of untreatable opportunistic infections and cancers Liver failure due to hepatitis B or C Accelerated aging and age-related disorders Non-AIDS–related cancers that occur at a higher rate in patients with otherwise well-controlled HIV infection Death is rarely sudden; thus, patients usually have time to make plans.  Nonetheless, patients should record their plans for health care early, with clear instructions for end-of-life care.  Other legal documents, including powers of attorney Durable power of attorney for health care Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated. \n【49】 As patients near the end of life The Dying Patient Dying patients can have needs that differ from those of other patients.  So that their needs can be met, dying patients must first be identified. \n【50】 The profound weight loss in many people during the last stages of AIDS makes good skin care difficult.  The comprehensive support provided by hospice programs helps many patients because hospice providers are unusually skilled at symptom management, and they support caregivers and patient autonomy. \n【51】 Prevention of HIV Infection Vaccines against HIV have been difficult to develop because HIV surface proteins mutate easily, resulting in an enormous diversity of antigenic types.  Nonetheless, various vaccine candidates are under investigation, and a few have shown promise in clinical trials.  At the present time, there is no effective AIDS vaccine.  Prevention of transmission Vaginal microbicides (including antiretroviral drugs) inserted before sexual contact have thus far proved ineffective, and some appear to increase risk for women, perhaps by causing cellular damage and thus decreasing natural barriers to HIV.  Effective measures include the following: Public education: Education is effective and appears to have decreased rates of infection in some countries, notably Thailand and Uganda.  Because sexual contact accounts for most cases, teaching people to avoid unsafe sex practices is the most relevant measure .  Safer sex practices: People living with HIV who are not virally suppressed (ie, undetectable viral load) should practice safer sex behaviors that are essential to prevent the spread of the infection. \n【52】 Safer sex practices should be used by a patient infected with HIV whose infection is not virally suppressed whether they have sex with partners who are not infected with HIV or with partners with HIV infection.  Safer sex practices are advised when both partners are HIV-positive and one or both partners are not virally suppressed; unprotected sex between people with virally unsuppressed-HIV infection may expose a person to resistant or more virulent strains of HIV.  In addition, safer sex practices help to prevent transmission of other viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus) that cause severe disease in AIDS patients, as well as to syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including concerning infections such as multi-drug–resistant gonorrhea and sexually transmitted Neisseria meningitidis.  Condoms offer the best protection.  Oil-based lubricants should not be used because they may dissolve latex, increasing the risk of condom failure.  information on HIV Transmission. ) Counseling for people who use parenteral drugs: Counseling about the risk of sharing needles is important but is probably more effective if combined with provision of sterile needles and syringes to reduce transmission of HIV and other bloodborne viruses that are acquired by sharing contaminated injecting equipment, treatment of drug dependence, and rehabilitation.  Confidential testing for HIV infection: Testing should be offered routinely to adolescents and adults in virtually all health care settings.  To facilitate routine testing, some states no longer require written consent or extensive pre-test counseling. \n【53】 If pregnant women are known to have HIV infection or test positive for HIV, they should be counseled about the risk of mother-to-child transmission.  Pregnant women with HIV infection should be encouraged to accept therapy to prevent infection of the fetus or newborn, typically beginning at about 14 weeks gestation.  Combination therapy is typically used because it is more effective than monotherapy and less likely to result in drug resistance.  Some drugs can be toxic to the fetus or woman and should be avoided.  If women meet criteria for ART, they should begin a regimen tailored to their history and stage of pregnancy and continue it throughout pregnancy.  Cesarean delivery can also reduce risk of transmission.  Regardless of the antepartum regimen used or mode of delivery, all women infected with HIV should be given IV zidovudine during labor, and after birth, neonates should be given oral zidovudine, which is continued for 6 weeks after delivery  infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【54】 Some women choose to terminate their pregnancy because HIV can be transmitted in utero to the fetus or for other reasons.  Screening of blood and organs: Transmission by blood transfusion is still remotely possible in the United States because antibody results may be false-negative during early infection.  Currently, screening blood for antibody and p24 antigen is mandated in the United States and probably further reduces risk of transmission.  Risk is reduced further by asking people with risk factors for HIV infection, even those with recent negative HIV antibody test results, not to donate blood or organs for transplantation.  The FDA has issued guidance for deferral of blood donation, including deferral for 3 months after the most recent sexual contact for men who have had sex with another man and for women who have had sex with a man who has had sex with another man .  However, use of sensitive HIV screening tests and deferral of donors of organs, blood, and blood products have not been implemented consistently in high HIV burden countries.  Preexposure prophylaxis with antiretrovirals (PrEP): In PrEP, people who are not infected with HIV but are at high risk (eg, by having an HIV-infected sex partner) take an antiretroviral drug daily to reduce their risk of infection. \n【55】 The combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) can be used.  Use of PrEP does not eliminate the need to use other methods of reducing risk of HIV infection, including using condoms and avoiding high-risk behaviors (eg, needle sharing).  Data concerning infants of HIV-negative mothers taking TDF/FTC PrEP during pregnancy are incomplete, but currently, no adverse effects have been reported in children born to HIV-infected women treated with TDF/FTC.  Use of PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who user injection drugs is being studied.  Long-acting antiretroviral agents are licensed in the United States and other countries to further improve PrEP in high-risk populations with poor medication adherence; however, their availability remains limited.  For the current CDC recommendations, see Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States (2021 Update) – Clinical Practice Guideline.  Circumcision of men: Data from young African men show that circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection from female partners during vaginal sex by about 50%; male circumcision is probably similarly effective in other male-patient populations.  Whether male circumcision reduces HIV transmission from HIV-positive men to women or reduces the risk of acquiring HIV from an infected male partner is unknown.  Universal precautions: Medical and dental health care practitioners should wear gloves in situations that may involve contact with any patient’s mucous membranes or body fluids and should be taught how to avoid needlestick accidents.  Home caregivers of patients with HIV infection should wear gloves if their hands may be exposed to body fluids.  Surfaces or instruments contaminated by blood or other body fluids should be cleaned and disinfected.  Effective disinfectants include heat, peroxide, alcohols, phenolics, and hypochlorite (bleach).  Isolation of patients infected with HIV is unnecessary unless indicated by an opportunistic infection (eg, tuberculosis).  Treatment of HIV infection: Treatment with ART lowers the risk of transmission.  Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) Potential consequences of exposure to HIV have prompted the development of policies and procedures, particularly preventive treatment, to decrease risk of infection to health care workers.  Preventive treatment is indicated after Penetrating injuries involving HIV-infected blood (usually needlesticks) Heavy exposure of mucous membranes (eye or mouth) to infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal fluids, or other body fluids containing blood (eg, amniotic fluid) Body fluids such as saliva, urine, tears, nasal secretions, vomitus, or sweat are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody.  After initial exposure to blood, the exposed area is immediately cleaned with soap and water for skin exposures and with antiseptic for puncture wounds.  If mucous membranes are exposed, the area is flushed with large amounts of water.  The following are documented: Type of exposure Time elapsed since exposure Clinical information (including risk factors and serologic tests for HIV) about the source patient for the exposure and the person exposed Type of exposure is defined by Which body fluid was involved Whether exposure involved a penetrating injury (eg, needlestick, cut with sharp object) and how deep the injury was Whether the fluid had contact with nonintact skin (eg, abraded or chapped skin) or mucous membrane Risk of infection is about 0. 3% (1:300) after a typical percutaneous exposure and about 0. 09% (1:1100) after mucous membrane exposure.  These risks vary, reflecting the amount of HIV transferred to the person with the injury; the amount of HIV transferred is affected by multiple factors, including viral load of the source and type of needle (eg, hollow or solid).  However, these factors are no longer taken into account in PEP recommendations.  The source is qualified by whether it is known or unknown.  If the source is unknown (eg, a needle on the street or in a sharps disposal container), risk should be assessed based on the circumstances of the exposure (eg, whether the exposure occurred in an area where injection drug use is prevalent, whether a needle discarded in a drug-treatment facility was used).  If the source is known but HIV status is not, the source is assessed for HIV risk factors, and prophylaxis is considered.  The goal is to start PEP as soon after exposure as possible if prophylaxis is warranted.  CDC recommends providing PEP within 24 to 36 hours after exposure; a longer interval after exposure requires the advice of an expert. \n【56】 The drugs should be carefully selected to minimize adverse effects and provide a convenient dosing schedule and thus encourage PEP completion.  Preferred regimens include a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and an integrase inhibitor, either raltegravir or dolutegravir.  In patients with childbearing potential, raltegravir is preferred because dolutegravir is possibly teratogenic during the first trimester of pregnancy—this is under epidemiologic investigation.  Alternative regimens include 2 NRTIs plus a protease inhibitor. \n【57】 If the source’s virus is known or suspected to be resistant to ≥ 1 drug, an expert in antiretroviral therapy and HIV transmission should be consulted.  However, clinicians should not delay PEP pending expert consultation or drug susceptibility testing.  Also, clinicians should provide immediate evaluation and face-to-face counseling and not delay follow-up care. \n【58】 Key Points HIV infects CD4+ lymphocytes and thus interferes with cell-mediated and, to a lesser extent, humoral immunity.  HIV is spread mainly by sexual contact, parenteral exposure to contaminated blood or transplanted tissue or organs, and vertical transmission (in utero, during childbirth, or through breastfeeding).  Frequent viral mutations combined with immune system damage significantly impair the body's ability to clear the HIV infection.  Various opportunistic infections and cancers can develop and are the usual cause of death in untreated patients.  Diagnose using antibody tests, and monitor by measuring viral load and CD4 count.  Treat with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which can restore immune function to nearly normal in most patients if they take the drugs consistently.  Periodically counsel patients living with HIV about safer sex.  Use postexposure and preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis when indicated.  Give primary prophylaxis against opportunistic infections based on the CD4 count.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Burns cause varying degrees of pain, blisters, swelling, and skin loss. \n【5】 People have pain, usually due to the chest wall injury, and often feel short of breath. \n【6】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. \n【7】 During drowning, the body is deprived of oxygen, which can damage organs, particularly the brain. \n【8】 The pancreas is a leaf-shaped organ about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) long. \n【9】 Symptoms of COVID-19 vary significantly. \n【10】 Collapse of many alveoli ,a condition called atelectasis is a condition in which all or part of a lung becomes airless and collapses.  Blockage of the bronchial tubes is a common cause of atelectasis. \n【11】 Fluid in the alveoli and the collapse of many alveoli interfere with the movement of oxygen from inhaled air into the blood.  Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases sharply.  Movement of carbon dioxide from the blood to air that is exhaled is affected less, and the level of carbon dioxide in the blood changes very little.  Because respiratory failure in ARDS results mainly from low levels of oxygen, it is considered hypoxemic respiratory failure Causes Respiratory failure is a condition in which the level of oxygen in the blood becomes dangerously low or the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes dangerously high. \n【12】 Failure of several organs (a condition called multiple organ system failure) may also result.  Organ failure can begin soon after the start of ARDS or days or weeks later.  Additionally, people with ARDS are less able to fight lung infections, and they tend to develop bacterial pneumonia Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia Hospital-acquired pneumonia is lung infection that develops in people who have been hospitalized, typically after about 2 days or more of hospitalization. \n【13】 Symptoms of ARDS usually develops within 24 to 48 hours of the original injury or disease but may take as long as 4 or 5 days to occur.  The person first has shortness of breath, usually with rapid, shallow breathing.  Using a stethoscope, a doctor may hear crackling or wheezing sounds in the lungs.  The skin may become mottled or blue ,cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood. \n【14】 Other organs such as the heart and brain may malfunction, resulting in a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart. \n【15】 Diagnosis of ARDS Measurements of the levels of oxygen in the blood Chest x-ray The level of oxygen in the blood can be measured without taking a blood sample by using a sensor placed on a finger or an earlobe—a procedure called pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry Both arterial blood gas testing and pulse oximetry measure the amount of oxygen in the blood, which helps determine how well the lungs are functioning. \n【16】 The level of oxygen (along with carbon dioxide) in the blood can also be measured by analyzing a blood sample taken from an artery.  Chest x-rays show fluid in spaces that should be filled with air. \n【17】 Prognosis of ARDS Without prompt treatment, many people who have ARDS will not survive.  However, depending upon the underlying disorder, with appropriate treatment, about 60 to 75% of people with ARDS survive.  People who respond promptly to treatment usually recover completely with few or no long-term lung abnormalities.  Those whose treatment involves long periods on a ventilator (a machine that helps air get in and out of the lungs) are more likely to develop lung scarring.  Such scarring may decrease over a few months after the person is taken off the ventilator.  Lung scarring, if extensive, can impair lung function permanently in ways that are noticeable during certain day-to-day activities.  Less extensive scarring may impair lung function only when the lungs are stressed, such as during exercise or an illness.  Many people lose large amounts of weight and muscle during the illness. \n【18】 Treatment of ARDS Treatment of the cause Oxygen therapy Often mechanical ventilation People with ARDS are treated in an intensive care unit Types of units People who need specific types of care may be put in special care units.  Intensive care units (ICUs) are for people who are seriously ill. \n【19】 Successful treatment usually depends on treating the underlying disorder (for example, pneumonia).  Oxygen therapy Oxygen Therapy Oxygen therapy is a treatment that delivers extra oxygen to the lungs when the level of oxygen in the blood is too low.  Oxygen is a gas that makes up about 21% of the air we breathe. \n【20】 If oxygen delivered by a face mask or other device (such as a helmet or nasal prongs) does not correct the low blood oxygen levels, or if very high doses of inhaled oxygen are required, mechanical ventilation Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs. \n【21】 Usually a ventilator delivers oxygen-rich air under pressure using a tube inserted through the mouth into the windpipe (trachea).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Hormones are chemical messengers one part of your body sends to another part of your body.  These messengers control important body functions.  Sex hormones, such as estrogen and progestin, help control a woman's menstrual periods and fertility.  Doctors can use these hormones (or artificial versions of them) to prevent pregnancy.  What are hormonal methods of birth control? Hormonal birth control works in two ways: It keeps your ovaries from releasing eggs It thickens the mucus in your cervix so sperm can't get through If eggs aren't released or sperm can't get to them, you can't get pregnant.  Hormonal birth control methods include: Birth control pills Skin patch Vaginal ring Implant Shot How well does hormonal birth control work? Hormonal birth control is one of the most effective methods of birth control if you use it correctly.  If you do, your chance of getting pregnant the first year you use it is only about 3 in 1000.  Your chance of getting pregnant goes up if you don't take your pills correctly, especially if you miss pills the first week after your period.  Who can use hormonal birth control? Most women can use hormonal birth control.  You shouldn't take oral birth control (pills) that contains estrogen and progestin if you: Are 35 or older and have migraine headaches Migraines A migraine isn't just a bad headache.  A migraine is a particular kind of bad headache.  The pain can be on one or both sides of your head. \n【1】 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is when a blood clot forms inside a large vein. \n【2】 An embolism is a clump of material (usually a blood clot) moving through your bloodstream. \n【3】 Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.  Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteries. \n【4】 You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working right. \n【5】 Like all muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of blood to work.  Blood that pumps through the heart doesn't feed the heart muscle. \n【6】 Bile aids digestion by making cholesterol, fats, and fat-soluble vitamins easier to absorb from the intestine. \n【7】 Cancer cells don't look or work like normal cells and keep multiplying out of control.  Cancer cells can invade and destroy nearby healthy tissue. \n【8】 It's also called bariatric surgery. \n【9】 What are the different types of hormonal birth control? Talk to your doctor about which hormonal birth control is right for you.  Birth control pills contain both progestin and estrogen or only progestin to prevent you from getting pregnant.  Progestin-only pills don’t work quite as well.  Doctors usually give them only if you can’t have estrogen.  You must take a pill every day.  If you skip a pill, you may get pregnant.  The more pills you skip, the greater the chance of pregnancy.  When you stop taking the pills, you may be able to get pregnant right away or it may take a few months.  Side effects of birth control pills may include: Bleeding at unexpected times, particularly in the first few months of use Feeling sick to your stomach, bloating, and throwing up Sore breasts Blood clots in your legs or lungs Headaches Depression Dark patches on your skin (melasma) Higher chance of getting cervical cancer Weight gain Skin Patch A birth control skin patch is a thin, sticky patch that slowly releases estrogen and progestin to prevent you from getting pregnant.  Typically you wear a patch for 7 days and then put on a fresh one for another 7 days.  After you have used 3 patches, you wait a week before starting again.  You may have to use a backup method of birth control ,such as a condom Condoms A contraceptive is something used for preventing pregnancy (birth control).  Barrier contraceptives are a type of birth control that works by keeping sperm from getting to an egg. \n【10】 The ring releases estrogen and progestin to prevent you from getting pregnant.  Typically you leave the ring inside you for 3 weeks and then take it out for 1 week.  During that week you may have a period.  After the week has passed, you put in a fresh ring.

Heredity is the passing of genes from one generation to the next. \n【1】 Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. \n【2】 In most hereditary metabolic disorders, both parents of the affected child carry a copy of the abnormal gene.  Because usually two copies of the abnormal gene are necessary for the disorder to occur, usually neither parent has the disorder.  Some hereditary metabolic disorders are X-linked X-Linked Recessive Disorders , which means only one copy of the abnormal gene can cause the disorder in boys.  Amino acids Branched-Chain Amino Acids Amino acid metabolism disorders are hereditary metabolic disorders.  Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes that cause these disorders on to their children. \n【3】 The body makes some of the amino acids it needs and gets others from food.  Hereditary disorders of amino acid processing (metabolism) can result from defects either in the breakdown of amino acids or in the body’s ability to get amino acids into cells.  Because these disorders cause symptoms early in life, newborns are routinely screened Newborn Screening Tests Many serious disorders that are not apparent at birth can nonetheless be detected by various screening tests. \n【4】 In the United States, newborns are commonly screened for Homocystinuria is a disorder of amino acid metabolism that is caused by a lack of the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase, which is needed to metabolize the amino acid homocysteine. \n【5】 Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes that cause these disorders on to their children. \n【6】 Branched-Chain Amino Acids The branched-chain amino acids are called “branched-chain” because of their chemical structure.  Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are the branched-chain amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins in the body.  If these amino acids are not properly metabolized, they and their toxic by-products build up in the blood and urine, causing certain disorders.  Isovaleric acidemia When the amino acid leucine is not properly metabolized, harmful levels of isovaleric acid build up in the body.  In isovaleric acidemia, the enzyme needed to break down leucine, called isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase, is not present or not working correctly.  Isovaleric acidemia is also known as sweaty feet syndrome, because accumulated isovaleric acid gives off an odor that smells like sweat.  There are two forms of isovaleric acidemia.  One form manifests during the first few days of life, and the other form manifests several months or years after birth. \n【7】 Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes. \n【8】 Blood cells may not be made in the bone marrow the way they normally are.  Symptoms in the form that manifests later in life come and go and are similar to the symptoms of the form that manifests earlier but are less severe.  Doctors diagnose isovaleric acidemia by doing tests of blood and urine to detect elevated levels of isovaleric acid.  To treat isovaleric acidemia, doctors give hydration and nutrition (including high doses of the sugar dextrose) by vein and glycine supplements to help the body get rid of the excess acid.  If these measures do not help, doctors may need to remove small amounts of the infant’s blood (one syringe at a time) and replace it with equal volumes of fresh donor blood (called exchange transfusion) and remove substances from the blood via a catheter inserted through the abdominal wall into the abdomen ,called peritoneal dialysis Peritoneal dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly. \n【9】 All affected people need to restrict their consumption of leucine and continue to take supplements of glycine and another amino acid called carnitine.  The prognosis is excellent with treatment.  Maple syrup urine disease Children with maple syrup urine disease are unable to metabolize leucine, isoleucine, and valine. \n【10】 These by-products also cause body fluids and substances, such as urine, sweat, and earwax, to smell like maple syrup.  This disease is most common among Mennonite families.  There are many forms of maple syrup urine disease.  In the most severe form, infants have vomiting and lethargy and then develop neurologic abnormalities, including seizures and coma, during the first days of life and can die within days to weeks if untreated.  In the milder forms, children initially appear normal, but during infection, surgery, or other physical stress, they can develop vomiting, staggering, confusion, and coma.  Since 2007, nearly every state in the United States has required that all newborns be screened Newborn Screening Tests Many serious disorders that are not apparent at birth can nonetheless be detected by various screening tests. \n【11】 Doctors also look for elevated levels of amino acids in the blood.  The diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing Genetic Screening Before Pregnancy Genetic screening is used to determine whether a couple is at increased risk of having a baby with a hereditary genetic disorder. \n【12】 Doctors treat infants with severe disease by strictly limiting the diet and sometimes by removing substances from the blood via a catheter inserted through the abdominal wall into the abdomen (called peritoneal dialysis ) or by using a machine outside the body to remove and purify blood from the body ,called hemodialysis Dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly. \n【13】 Doctors also give hydration and nutrition by vein. \n【14】 After the disease has been brought under control, children must always consume a special artificial diet that is low in leucine, isoleucine, and valine.  Care providers should have an emergency plan in place for how to handle a sudden attack because it may result in a build-up of toxic substances in the blood and low blood sugar (called metabolic crisis).  Sudden attacks are most often triggered by common infections.  A liver transplant Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. The age at which symptoms start, symptoms, and treatment are similar to those of propionic acidemia except that doctors may give supplements of vitamin B12 instead of biotin.  Propionic acidemia When a specific enzyme (a type of protein) called propionyl CoA carboxylase is not functional, harmful levels of propionic acid build up in the body. \n【15】 Seizures or coma may occur.  Stressors, such as fasting, fever, or infection, may trigger an attack. \n【16】 Doctors diagnose propionic acidemia by doing tests of blood and urine to detect elevated levels of propionic acid.  The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring levels of propionyl CoA carboxylase in white blood cells or other tissue cells and/or by genetic testing.  To treat propionic acidemia, doctors give hydration and nutrition (including high doses of the sugar dextrose) by vein and restrict the infant's consumption of protein.

However, two conditions—synovial chondromatosis and tenosynovial giant cell tumors—occur in the lining (synovium) of joints.  These tumors are noncancerous (benign) but can cause severe damage to the joint.  Both conditions usually affect one joint, most often the knee or the hip, and can cause pain and a buildup of fluid.  To diagnose these conditions, doctors do x-rays X-rays A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination. \n【1】 To confirm the diagnosis, doctors usually remove a tissue sample for examination under a microscope (biopsy Diagnosis ).  Treatment for both requires surgical removal of the abnormal synovium (called synovectomy).   or noncancerous (benign). \n【2】 Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (also known as pigmented villonodular synovitis [PVNS]) causes the lining of the joint to become swollen and grow.  This growth harms the cartilage and bone around the joint.  The lining also produces extra fluid that can cause pain and swelling.  The process often causes bloody fluid in the joint.  Tenosynovial giant cell tumor usually affects one joint.  The treatment is usually surgical, but recurrences are not infrequent.  Pexidartinib, a drug taken by mouth, is used to diminish the tumor's growth, but only if symptoms are severe and not relieved by surgery.  Pexidartinib is available in the United States only in cancer centers through the manufacturer's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program.

The acute form is most often due to allergic drug reactions or to infections.  The chronic form occurs with a diverse array of causes, including genetic or metabolic disorders, obstructive uropathy, and chronic exposure to environmental toxins or to certain drugs and herbs.  Diagnosis is suggested by history and urinalysis and often confirmed by biopsy.  Treatment and prognosis vary by the etiology and potential reversibility of the disorder at the time of diagnosis.   Etiology of Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Tubulointerstitial nephritis can be primary, but a similar process can result from glomerular damage Overview of Glomerular Disorders The hallmark of glomerular disorders is proteinuria, which is often in the nephrotic range (≥ 3 g/day). \n【1】 Primary tubulointerstitial nephritis may be Acute  Chronic  Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) involves an inflammatory infiltrate and edema affecting the renal interstitium that often develops over days to months.  Over 95% of cases result from infection or an allergic drug reaction. \n【2】 Renal-ocular syndrome, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis plus uveitis, also occurs and is idiopathic.  Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) arises when chronic tubular insults cause gradual interstitial infiltration and fibrosis, tubular atrophy and dysfunction, and a gradual deterioration of renal function, usually over years.  Concurrent glomerular involvement (glomerulosclerosis) is much more common in CTIN than in ATIN.  Causes of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis are myriad; they include immunologically mediated disorders, infections, reflux or obstructive nephropathy, drugs, and other disorders.  CTIN due to toxins, metabolic derangements, hypertension, and inherited disorders results in symmetric and bilateral disease; when CTIN is due to other causes, renal scarring may be unequal and involve only one kidney.  Some well-characterized forms of CTIN include Analgesic nephropathy Analgesic Nephropathy Analgesic nephropathy is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by cumulative lifetime use of large amounts (eg, ≥ 2 kg) of certain analgesics. \n【3】 Hereditary cystic kidney diseases Overview of Cystic Kidney Disease Cystic kidney disease may be congenital or acquired. \n【4】 Symptoms and Signs of Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis Symptoms and signs of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) may be nonspecific and are often absent unless symptoms and signs of renal failure develop.  Many patients develop polyuria and nocturia (due to a defect in urinary concentration and sodium reabsorption).  ATIN symptom onset may be as long as several weeks after initial toxic exposure or as soon as 3 to 5 days after a 2nd exposure; extremes in latency range from 1 day with rifampin to 18 months with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  Fever and urticarial rash are characteristic early manifestations of drug-induced ATIN, but the classically described triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is present in < 10% of patients with drug-induced ATIN.  Abdominal pain, weight loss, and bilateral renal enlargement (caused by interstitial edema) may also occur in ATIN and with fever may mistakenly suggest renal cancer or polycystic kidney disease.  Peripheral edema and hypertension are uncommon unless renal failure occurs.  Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis Symptoms and signs are generally absent in chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis unless renal failure develops.  Edema usually is not present, and blood pressure is normal or only mildly elevated in the early stages.  Polyuria and nocturia may develop.  Diagnosis of Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Risk factors In acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN), active urinary sediment with sterile pyuria Sometimes renal biopsy Usually imaging to exclude other causes Few clinical and routine laboratory findings are specific for tubulointerstitial nephritis.  Thus, suspicion should be high when the following are present: Typical symptoms or signs Risk factors, particularly a temporal relationship between onset and use of a potentially causative drug Characteristic urinalysis findings, particularly sterile pyuria Modest proteinuria, usually < 1 g/day ,except with use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], which may cause nephrotic-range proteinuria, 3. \n【5】 Concentrating defect out of proportion to the degree of renal failure Eosinophiluria cannot be relied upon to make or exclude the diagnosis.  Other tests (eg, imaging) are usually necessary to differentiate ATIN or chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) from other disorders.  A presumptive clinical diagnosis of ATIN is often made based on the specific findings mentioned above, but renal biopsy Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【6】 Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis Urinalysis that shows signs of active kidney inflammation (active urinary sediment), including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and WBC casts, and absence of bacteria on culture (sterile pyuria) is typical; marked hematuria and dysmorphic RBCs are uncommon.  Eosinophiluria has traditionally been thought to suggest ATIN; however, the presence or absence of urinary eosinophils is not particularly useful diagnostically.  Proteinuria is usually minimal but may reach nephrotic range with combined ATIN-glomerular disease induced by NSAIDs, ampicillin, rifampin, interferon alfa, or ranitidine. \n【7】 Ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, or both may be needed to differentiate acute tubulointerstitial nephritis from other causes of acute kidney injury when kidney biopsy is not possible.  In ATIN, ultrasonography may show kidneys that are greatly enlarged and echogenic because of interstitial inflammatory cells and edema.  Radionuclide scans may show kidneys avidly taking up radioactive gallium-67 or radionuclide-labeled white blood cells (WBCs).  Positive scans strongly suggest ATIN (and indicate that acute tubular necrosis is less likely), but a negative scan does not exclude ATIN.  Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【8】 The earliest finding is interstitial edema, typically followed by interstitial infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes.  In severe cases, inflammatory cells can be seen invading the space between the cells lining the tubular basement membrane (tubulitis); in other specimens, granulomatous reactions resulting from exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, mycobacteria, or fungi may be seen.  The presence of noncaseating granulomas suggests sarcoidosis.  Immunofluorescence or electron microscopy seldom reveals any pathognomonic changes.  Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis Findings of CTIN are generally similar to those of ATIN, although urinary RBCs and WBCs are uncommon.  Because CTIN is insidious in onset and interstitial fibrosis is common, imaging tests may show small kidneys with evidence of scarring and asymmetry.  In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal biopsy is not often done for diagnostic purposes.  However, if there is concern for alternative diagnoses, it could be pursued.  Glomeruli vary from normal to completely destroyed.  Tubules may be absent or atrophied.  Tubular lumina vary in diameter but may show marked dilation, with homogeneous casts.  The interstitium contains varying degrees of inflammatory cells and fibrosis.  Nonscarred areas appear almost normal.  Grossly, the kidneys are small and atrophic.  Prognosis for Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis In drug-induced ATIN, renal function usually recovers within 6 to 8 weeks when the causative drug is stopped, although some residual scarring is common.  Recovery may be incomplete, with persistent azotemia above baseline.  Prognosis is usually worse if ATIN is caused by NSAIDs than by other drugs.  When other factors cause ATIN, histologic changes usually are reversible if the cause is recognized and removed; however, some severe cases progress to fibrosis and chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【9】 Regardless of cause, irreversible injury is suggested by the following: Diffuse rather than patchy interstitial infiltrate Significant interstitial fibrosis Delayed response to prednisone Acute kidney injury lasting >3 weeks Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis In CTIN, prognosis depends on the cause and on the ability to recognize and stop the process before irreversible fibrosis occurs.  Many genetic ,eg, cystic kidney disease Overview of Cystic Kidney Disease Cystic kidney disease may be congenital or acquired.  Congenital disorders may be inherited as autosomal dominant disorders or autosomal recessive disorders or have other causes , metabolic (eg, cystinosis), and toxic (eg, previous exposure to heavy metals) causes may not be modifiable, in which case CTIN usually evolves to end-stage renal disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【10】 Treatment of Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Treatment of cause (eg, stopping the causative drug) Corticosteroids for immune-mediated and sometimes drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis Treatment of both ATIN and CTIN is management of the cause.  For immunologically induced ATIN and sometimes drug-induced ATIN, corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 1 mg/kg orally once/day with gradual tapering of the dose over 4 to 6 weeks) may accelerate recovery.  For drug-induced ATIN, corticosteroids are most effective when given within 2 weeks of stopping the causative drugs.  NSAID-induced ATIN is less responsive to corticosteroids than other drug-induced ATIN.  ATIN should be proven by biopsy before corticosteroids are started.  Treatment of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis often requires supportive measures such as controlling blood pressure and treating anemia associated with kidney disease.  In patients with CTIN and progressive renal injury, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may slow disease progression but should not be used together because of an additive risk of hyperkalemia and accelerating disease progression.  Pearls & Pitfalls In patients with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be used together because of the additive risk of hyperkalemia and acceleration of disease progression.  Key Points Causes of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) are myriad and much more diverse than those for acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN), which is usually caused by an allergic reaction to a drug or by an infection.  Symptoms are often absent or nonspecific, particularly in CTIN.  Suspect the diagnosis based on risk factors and urinary sediment, exclude other causes using imaging, and sometimes confirm the diagnosis by biopsy.  Stop causative drugs, treat any other causes, and provide supportive treatment.  Treat biopsy-proven immune-mediated and sometimes drug-induced ATIN with corticosteroids (within 2 weeks of stopping any causative drugs).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diffuse hyperpigmentation Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【3】 After eliminating drugs as a cause of diffuse hyperpigmentation, patients should be tested for the most common systemic causes.  These causes include Addison disease Addison Disease Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. \n【4】 Skin findings are nondiagnostic; therefore, a skin biopsy is not necessary or helpful.  The search for underlying cancer should be based on a review of systems.  Melasma (Chloasma) Melasma consists of dark brown, roughly symmetric patches of hyperpigmentation with irregular borders on the face (usually on the forehead, temples, cheeks, cutaneous upper lip, or nose).  It occurs primarily in pregnant women (melasma gravidarum, also called the mask of pregnancy) and in women taking oral contraceptives Oral Contraceptives Oral contraceptives (OCs) mimic ovarian hormones. \n【5】 Ten percent of cases occur in nonpregnant women and dark-skinned men.  Melasma is more prevalent among and lasts longer in people with dark skin.  Because melasma risk increases with increasing sun exposure, the mechanism probably involves overproduction of melanin by hyperfunctional melanocytes.  Other than sun exposure, aggravating factors include Autoimmune thyroid disorders Photosensitizing drugs In women, melasma fades slowly and incompletely after childbirth or cessation of hormone use.  In men, melasma rarely fades.  The mainstay of melasma management is strict photoprotection agents.  Patients should use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher, wear protective clothing and hats, and avoid direct sun exposure.  During and after therapy, strict sun protection must be maintained.  Because visible light is not blocked by most sunscreens, patients should use a tinted sunscreen (eg, that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide).  The addition of antioxidants to the sunscreen and oral adjunctive photoprotection agents such as Polypodium leucotomas can enhance protection ,1 Melasma references Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【6】 Most cases are due to an increase in melanin production and deposition. \n【7】 Because of potential health and environmental toxicities, oxybenzone and benzophenone-3 are usually not preferred sunscreens ,3 Melasma references Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【8】 Other treatment depends on whether the pigmentation is epidermal or dermal; epidermal pigmentation becomes accentuated with a Wood light Diagnostic tests are indicated when the cause of a skin lesion or disease is not obvious from history and physical examination alone. \n【9】 Only epidermal pigmentation responds to treatment.  Most topical melasma treatments are used in combination rather than individually.  Triple topical therapy is first-line treatment that is often effective and consists of a combination of Hydroquinone 2 to 4% Tretinoin 0. 05 to 1% A class V to VII topical corticosteroid  Hydroquinone depigments the skin by blocking the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and inhibiting melanocyte metabolic processes.  Hydroquinone should be tested behind one ear or on a small patch on the forearm for 1 week before use on the face because it may cause irritation or an allergic reaction.  Tretinoin promotes keratinocyte turnover and can exfoliate skin that contains epidermal pigment.  Corticosteroids help block synthesis and secretion of melanin.  Two promising technologies being tried in conjunction with triple topical therapy are the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser and nonablative fractional resurfacing.  If triple topical therapy is not available, then hydroquinone 3 to 4% applied twice a day for up to 8 weeks at a time (chronic continuous use can theoretically increase the risk of exogenous ochronosis, which is a permanent form of hyperpigmentation) may be considered; 2% hydroquinone is useful as maintenance.  Azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream can be used in place of or with hydroquinone and/or tretinoin.  Azelaic acid is a tyrosinase inhibitor that reduces melanin production.  In addition, topical kojic acid has been increasingly used; it is a chelating agent that blocks tyrosine conversion to melanin.  During pregnancy, azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream and chemical peeling with glycolic acid are safe to use.  Hydroquinone and tretinoin are not safe to use.  Second-line treatment options for patients with severe melasma unresponsive to topical bleaching agents include chemical peeling with glycolic acid or 30 to 50% trichloroacetic acid.  Laser treatments also have been used but are not standard therapy.  Oral therapies have been studied.  A randomized study has shown improvement with oral tranexamic acid in patients with moderate-to-severe melasma ,4 Melasma references Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【10】 Lentigines (singular: lentigo) are flat, tan to brown, oval macules.  They are commonly due to chronic sun exposure (solar lentigines; sometimes called liver spots but are not related to hepatic dysfunction) and occur most frequently on the face and back of the hands.  They typically first appear during middle age and increase in number with age.  Although progression from lentigines to melanoma has not been established, lentigines are an independent risk factor for melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).  Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【11】 If lentigines are a cosmetic concern, they are treated with cryotherapy or laser; hydroquinone is not effective.  Nonsolar lentigines are sometimes associated with systemic disorders, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with multiple hamartomatous polyps in the stomach, small bowel, and colon along with distinctive pigmented skin lesions. \n【12】 Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation Changes are usually diffuse but sometimes have drug-specific distribution patterns or hues .  Mechanisms include Increased melanin in the epidermis (tends to be more brown) Increased melanin in the epidermis and high dermis (mostly brown with hints of gray or blue) Increased melanin in the dermis (tends to be more grayish or blue) Dermal deposition of the drug, metabolite, or drug–melanin complexes (usually slate or bluish gray) Drugs may cause secondary hyperpigmentation. \n【13】  In fixed drug eruptions, red plaques or blisters form at the same site each time the causative drug is taken; residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation usually persists, especially in darker skin types.  Typical lesions occur on the face (especially the lips), hands, feet, and genitals.  Typical inciting drugs include antibiotics (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and barbiturates.  Treatment of drug-induced hyperpigmentation involves stopping the causative drug; the hyperpigmentation fades very slowly in some if not all cases.  Because many drugs that cause skin pigmentation also cause photosensitivity reactions Photosensitivity is a cutaneous overreaction to sunlight. \n【14】 Key Points Common causes of focal hyperpigmentation include injury, inflammation, phytophotodermatitis, lentigines, melasma, freckles, café-au-lait macules, and acanthosis nigricans.  Common causes of widespread hyperpigmentation include melasma, drugs, cancers, and other systemic disorders.  Test patients who have widespread hyperpigmentation not caused by drugs for disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, and Addison disease.

Diagnosis is by measuring plasma levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and individual lipoproteins.  Treatment involves dietary changes, exercise, and lipid-lowering drugs. \n【2】 There is no natural cutoff between normal and abnormal lipid levels because lipid measurements are continuous.  A linear relation probably exists between lipid levels and cardiovascular risk, so many people with “normal” cholesterol levels benefit from achieving still lower levels.  Consequently, there are no numeric definitions of dyslipidemia; the term is applied to lipid levels for which treatment has proven beneficial.  Proof of benefit is strongest for lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels.  In the overall population, evidence is less strong for a benefit from lowering elevated TG and increasing low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels.  HDL levels do not always predict cardiovascular risk.  For example, high HDL levels caused by some genetic disorders may not protect against cardiovascular disorders, and low HDL levels caused by some genetic disorders may not increase the risk of cardiovascular disorders.  Although HDL levels predict cardiovascular risk in the overall population, the increased risk may be caused by other factors, such as accompanying lipid and metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertriglyceridemia, rather than the HDL level itself.  Classification of Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemias were traditionally classified by patterns of elevation in lipids and lipoproteins \n【3】 .  A more practical system categorizes dyslipidemias as primary or secondary and characterizes them by Increases in cholesterol only (pure or isolated hypercholesterolemia) Increases in TGs only (pure or isolated hypertriglyceridemia), Increases in both cholesterol and TGs (mixed or combined hyperlipidemias) This system does not take into account specific lipoprotein abnormalities (eg, low HDL or high LDL) that may contribute to disease despite normal cholesterol and TG levels.   Etiology of Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemias may be Primary: Genetic Secondary: Caused by lifestyle and other factors Both primary and secondary causes contribute to dyslipidemias in varying degrees.  For example, in familial combined hyperlipidemia, expression may occur only in the presence of significant secondary causes.  Primary causes are single or multiple gene mutations that result in either overproduction or defective clearance of triglycerides and LDL, or in underproduction or excessive clearance of HDL  Dyslipidemias .  The names of many primary disorders reflect an old nomenclature in which lipoproteins were detected and distinguished by how they separated into alpha (HDL) and beta (LDL) bands on electrophoretic gels.   Secondary causes contribute to many cases of dyslipidemia in adults.  The most important secondary cause of dyslipidemia in high-resource countries is A sedentary lifestyle with excessive dietary intake of total calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats Trans fats are polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids to which hydrogen atoms have been added; they are used in some processed foods and are as atherogenic as saturated fat.  Other common secondary causes of dyslipidemia include Diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. \n【4】 Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.  Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. \n【5】 Diabetes is an especially significant secondary cause because patients tend to have an atherogenic combination of high TGs; high small, dense LDL fractions; and low HDL (diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemic hyperapo B).  Patients with type 2 diabetes are especially at risk.  The combination may be a consequence of obesity, poor control of diabetes, or both, which may increase circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), leading to increased hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production.  TG-rich VLDL then transfers TG and cholesterol to LDL and HDL, promoting formation of TG-rich, small, dense LDL and clearance of TG-rich HDL.  Diabetic dyslipidemia is often exacerbated by the increased caloric intake and physical inactivity that characterize the lifestyles of some patients with type 2 diabetes.  Women with diabetes may be at special risk of cardiac disease as a result of this form of dyslipidemia.  Symptoms and Signs of Dyslipidemia itself usually causes no symptoms but can lead to symptomatic vascular disease, including coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. \n【6】 High levels of triglycerides (> 500 mg/dL [> 5. 65 mmol/L]) can cause acute pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).  The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake. \n【7】 Very high triglyceride levels can also cause hepatosplenomegaly, paresthesias, dyspnea, and confusion.  High levels of LDL can cause arcus corneae and tendinous xanthomas at the Achilles, elbow, and knee tendons and over metacarpophalangeal joints.  Other clinical findings that occur in patients with high LDL (eg, in familial hypercholesterolemia) include xanthelasma (lipid rich yellow plaques on the medial eyelids). \n【8】 Patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia may have arcus corneae, tendinous xanthomas and xanthelasma plus planar or tuberous xanthomas.  Planar xanthomas are flat or slightly raised yellowish patches.  Tuberous xanthomas are painless, firm nodules typically located over extensor surfaces of joints.  Patients with severe elevations of TGs can have eruptive xanthomas over the trunk, back, elbows, buttocks, knees, hands, and feet.  Patients with the rare dysbetalipoproteinemia can have palmar and tuberous xanthomas.  Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 2000 mg/dL [> 22. 6 mmol/L]) can give retinal arteries and veins a creamy white appearance (lipemia retinalis).  Extremely high lipid levels also give a lactescent (milky) appearance to blood plasma.  Symptoms can include paresthesias, dypsnea, and confusion.  Xanthoma Manifestations Eruptive Xanthoma (Skin) Eruptive xanthomas are skin manifestations of elevated triglyceride levels. \n【9】 Eruptive Xanthoma Patients with severe elevations of TGs can have eruptive xanthomas over the trunk, back, elbows, buttocks, knees, hands, and feet. \n【10】 Davidson, MD.  Tendon Xanthomas Tendon xanthomas (arrow) are diagnostic of familial hypercholesterolemia.  Diagnosis of Dyslipidemia Serum lipid profile (measured total cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol and calculated LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol) Dyslipidemia is suspected in patients with characteristic physical findings or complications of dyslipidemia (eg, atherosclerotic disease).  Primary lipid disorders are suspected when patients have Physical signs of dyslipidemia such as tendon xanthomas, which are pathognomonic for familial hypercholesterolemia Onset of premature atherosclerotic disease (men < 55 years, women < 60 years) A family history of premature atherosclerotic disease or severe hyperlipidemia Serum cholesterol > 190 mg/dL (> 4. 9 mmol/L) Dyslipidemia is diagnosed by measuring serum lipids.  Routine measurements (lipid profile) include total cholesterol (TC), TGs, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol.  Lipid profile measurement Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol are measured directly.  TC and TG values reflect cholesterol and TGs in all circulating lipoproteins, including chylomicrons, VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL, and HDL.  TC values can vary by 10% and TGs by up to 25% day-to-day even in the absence of a disorder.  TC and HDL cholesterol can be measured in the nonfasting state, but most patients should have all lipids measured while fasting (usually for 12 hours) for maximum accuracy and consistency.  Pearls & Pitfalls Total and HDL cholesterol can be measured in the nonfasting state, but most patients should have all lipids measured while fasting (usually for 12 hours) for maximum accuracy and consistency.  Testing should be postponed until after resolution of acute illness because TG and lipoprotein(a) levels increase and cholesterol levels decrease in inflammatory states.  Lipid profiles can vary for about 30 days after an acute myocardial infarction (MI); however, results obtained within 24 hours after MI are usually reliable enough to guide initial lipid-lowering therapy.  LDL cholesterol values are most often calculated as the amount of cholesterol not contained in HDL and VLDL.  VLDL is estimated by TG ÷ 5 because the cholesterol concentration in VLDL particles is usually one fifth of the total lipid in the particle.  Thus, This calculation is valid only when TGs are < 400 mg/dL (< 4. 5 mmol/L) and patients are fasting because eating increases TGs.  The calculated LDL cholesterol value incorporates measures of all non-HDL, nonchylomicron cholesterol, including that in IDL and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)].  LDL can also be measured directly using plasma ultracentrifugation, which separates chylomicrons and VLDL fractions from HDL and LDL, and by an immunoassay method.  Direct measurement may be useful in some patients with elevated TGs, but these direct measurements are not routinely necessary.  The role of apo B testing is under study because values reflect all non-HDL cholesterol (in VLDL, IDL, and LDL) and may be more predictive of CAD risk than LDL cholesterol.  Non-HDL cholesterol (TC − HDL cholesterol) may also be more predictive of CAD risk than LDL cholesterol, especially in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.  Other tests Patients with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease with normal or near-normal lipid levels, or high LDL levels refractory to drug therapy should have Lp(a) levels measured.  Lp(a) levels may also be directly measured in patients with borderline high LDL cholesterol levels to determine whether drug therapy is warranted.  C-reactive protein may be measured in the same populations.  Measurements of LDL particle number or apoprotein B-100 (apo B) may be useful in patients with elevated TGs and the metabolic syndrome.  Apo B provides similar information to LDL particle number because there is one apo B molecule for each LDL particle.  Apo B measurement includes all atherogenic particles, including remnants and Lp(a).  Secondary causes Tests for secondary causes of dyslipidemia should be done in most patients with newly diagnosed dyslipidemia and when a component of the lipid profile has inexplicably changed for the worse.  Such tests include measurements of Creatinine Fasting glucose Liver enzymes Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Urinary protein Screening is done using a fasting lipid profile (TC, TGs, HDL cholesterol, and calculated LDL cholesterol).  Different medical societies have different recommendations on when to begin screening.  Lipid measurement should be accompanied by assessment for other cardiovascular risk factors, including Cigarette use Diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. \n【11】 A definite age after which patients no longer require screening has not been established, but evidence supports screening of patients into their 80s, especially in the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  Patients with an extensive family history of heart disease should also be screened by measuring Lp(a) levels. \n【12】 Treatment of Dyslipidemia Risk assessment by explicit criteria Lifestyle changes (eg, exercise, dietary modification) For high LDL cholesterol, statins, bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors For high TG, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and sometimes other measures General principles The main indication for dyslipidemia treatment is prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. \n【13】 Treatment is indicated for all patients with ASCVD (secondary prevention) and for some without (primary prevention).  Treatment of children is controversial; dietary changes may be difficult to implement, and no data suggest that lowering lipid levels in childhood effectively prevents heart disease in adulthood.  Moreover, the safety and effectiveness of long-term lipid-lowering treatment are questionable. \n【14】 Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia should be treated beginning at age 8 to 10.  Children with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia require diet, drugs, and often LDL apheresis to prevent premature death; treatment is begun when the diagnosis is made.  Treatment options depend on the specific lipid abnormality, although different lipid abnormalities often coexist.  In some patients, a single abnormality may require several therapies; in others, a single treatment may be adequate for several abnormalities.  Treatment should always include treatment of hypertension Treatment Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. \n【15】 In general, treatment options for men and women are the same.  Elevated LDL cholesterol treatment For all individuals, the prevention of ASCVD requires an emphasis on a heart-healthy lifestyle, particularly diet and exercise.  Other options to lower LDL cholesterol in all age groups include drugs, dietary supplements, procedural interventions, and experimental therapies.  Many of these options are also effective for treating other lipid abnormalities.  Dietary changes include Decreasing intake of saturated fats and cholesterol Increasing the proportion of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates Maintaining ideal body weight Referral to a dietitian is often useful, especially for older people.  Exercise lowers LDL cholesterol in some people and also helps maintain ideal body weight.  Dietary changes and exercise should be used whenever feasible, but AHA/ACC guidelines recommend also using drug treatment for certain groups of patients after discussion of the risks and benefits of statin therapy.  For drug treatment in adults, the 2018 AHA/ACC/ Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommends treatment with a statin for 4 groups of patients, comprised of those with any of the following: Clinical ASCVD LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4. 9 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75, with diabetes and LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL (1. 8 to 4. 9 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75, LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL (1. 9 mmol/L), and estimated 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥ 7. 5% Risk of ASCVD is estimated using the pooled cohort risk assessment equations, which replace previous risk calculation tools.  This new risk calculator is based on sex, age, race, total and HDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure , diabetes and smoking status, and use of antihypertensives or statins.  When considering whether to give a statin, clinicians may also take into account other factors, including LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL (4. 1 mmol/L), family history of premature ASCVD (ie, age of onset < 55 in male 1st degree relative, or < 65 in female 1st degree relative), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L (≥ 19 nmol/L), coronary artery calcium score ≥ 300 Agatston units (or ≥ 75th percentile for the patient's demographic), ankle-brachial index < 0. 9, and increased lifetime risk.  Increased lifetime risk (identified using the ACC/AHA risk calculator) is relevant because 10-year risk may be low in younger patients, in whom longer-term risk should be taken into account.  Statins are the treatment of choice for LDL cholesterol reduction because they demonstrably reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, leading to up-regulation of LDL receptors and increased LDL clearance.  They reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 60% and produce small increases in HDL and modest decreases in TGs.  Statins also appear to decrease intra-arterial inflammation, systemic inflammation, or both by stimulating production of endothelial nitric oxide and may have other beneficial effects.  Other classes of lipid-lowering drugs are not the first choice because they have not demonstrated equivalent efficacy for decreasing ASCVD.  Statin treatment is classified as high, moderate, or low intensity and is given based on treatment group and age .  The choice of statin may depend on the patient's co-morbidities, other drugs, risk factors for adverse events, statin intolerance, cost, and patient preference.  Adverse effects with statins are uncommon but include liver enzyme elevations and myositis or rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome involving the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. \n【16】 Liver enzyme elevations are uncommon, and serious liver toxicity is extremely rare.  Muscle problems occur in up to 10% of patients taking statins and may be dose-dependent.  Muscle symptoms can occur without enzyme elevation.  Adverse effects are more common among older patients, patients with several disorders, and patients taking several drugs.  In some patients, changing from one statin to another or lowering the dose (after temporarily discontinuing the drug) relieves the problem.  Muscle toxicity seems to be most common when some of the statins are used with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P3A4 (eg, macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals, cyclosporine) and with fibrates, especially gemfibrozil.  Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.  In patients with ASCVD, the more that LDL-C is reduced by statin therapy the greater the risk reduction.  Thus, initial treatment is a statin at maximally tolerated dose to lower LDL cholesterol by > 50% (high-intensity therapy).  For very high risk ASCVD patients ,eg, those with a recent myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. \n【17】 Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. LDL-C level > 70 mg/dL (> 1. 2 mmol/L) despite maximal statin therapy should prompt the addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab). \n【18】  The adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase inhibitor, bempedoic acid, is a first-in-class oral drug that impairs cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases LDL receptors.  It lowers LDL cholesterol by 15 to 17%.  Bempedoic acid is especially useful in patients with statin-associated muscle adverse effects because it does not cause muscle pain or weakness.  It can be used as monotherapy or as an add-on to other lipid-lowering therapy.  It is also commercially available in combination with ezetimibe.  Risks include hyperuricemia and tendon rupture.  Bile acid sequestrants block intestinal bile acid reabsorption, forcing up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors to recruit circulating cholesterol for bile synthesis.  They are proved to reduce cardiovascular mortality.  Bile acid sequestrants are usually used with statins or with nicotinic acid Low HDL to augment LDL cholesterol reduction and are the drugs of choice for women who are or are planning to become pregnant.  Bile acid sequestrants are safe, but their use is limited by adverse effects of bloating, nausea, cramping, and constipation.  They may also increase TGs, so their use is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.  Cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam (but to a lesser degree), interfere with absorption of other drugs—notably thiazides, beta-blockers, warfarin, digoxin, and thyroxine—an effect that can be decreased by administration at least 4 hours before or 1 hour after other drugs.  Bile acid sequestrants should be given with meals to increase their efficacy.  Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol.  Ezetimibe usually lowers LDL cholesterol by 15 to 20% and causes small increases in HDL and a mild decrease in triglycerides.  Ezetimibe can be used as monotherapy in patients intolerant to statins or added to statins for patients taking maximum statin doses with persistent LDL cholesterol elevation.  Adverse effects are infrequent.  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are available as subcutaneous injections given once or twice per month.  These drugs keep PCSK9 from attaching to LDL receptors, leading to improved function of these receptors.  LDL cholesterol is lowered by 40 to 70%. \n【19】 Dietary supplements that lower LDL cholesterol levels include fiber supplements and commercially available margarines and other products containing plant sterols (sitosterol, campesterol) or stanols.  Fiber supplements decrease cholesterol levels in multiple ways, including decreased absorption and increased excretion.  Oat-based fiber supplements can decrease total cholesterol by up to 18%.  Plant sterols and stanols decrease cholesterol absorption by displacing cholesterol from intestinal micelles and can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 10% without affecting HDL or TGs.  Drugs for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia include PCSK9 inhibitors, lomitapide, and evinacumab.  Lomitapide is an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that interferes with the secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins in the liver and intestine.  Dose is begun low and gradually titrated up about every 2 weeks.  Patients must follow a diet with less than 20% of calories from fat.  Lomitapide can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, diarrhea, increased hepatic fat, elevated liver enzymes).  Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like protein 3, an inhibitor of LPL and endothelial lipase.  It can decrease LDL cholesterol (by 47%), TG, and HDL cholesterol.  Evinacumab is given by intravenous infusion once monthly.  It can cause gout, influenza-like illness, and infusion reactions.  Procedural approaches are reserved for patients with severe hyperlipidemia (LDL cholesterol > 300 mg/dL [> 7. 74 mmol/L]) and no vascular disease.  LDL apheresis may be done in patients with LDL cholesterol > 200 mg/dL (> 5. 16 mmol/L) and vascular disease that is refractory to conventional therapy, such as occurs with familial hypercholesterolemia.  Options include LDL apheresis (in which LDL is removed by extracorporeal plasma exchange) and, rarely, ileal bypass (to block reabsorption of bile acids) and liver transplantation (which transplants LDL receptors).  LDL apheresis is the procedure of choice in most instances when maximally tolerated therapy fails to lower LDL adequately.  Apheresis is also the usual therapy in patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia who have limited or no response to drug therapy.  Elevated LDL cholesterol in children Childhood risk factors besides family history and diabetes include cigarette smoking, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol (< 35 mg/dL [< 0. 9 mmol/L]), obesity, and physical inactivity.  For children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends dietary treatment for children with LDL cholesterol > 110 mg/dL (> 2. 8 mmol/L).  Drug therapy is recommended for children > 8 years and with either of the following: Poor response to dietary therapy, LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4. 9 mmol/L), and no family history of premature cardiovascular disease LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4. 13 mmol/L) and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease or ≥ 2 risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease Drugs used in children include many of the statins.  Children with familial hypercholesterolemia may require a second drug to achieve LDL cholesterol reduction of at least 50%.  Elevated triglycerides Although it is unclear whether elevated TGs independently contribute to cardiovascular disease, they are associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities that contribute to coronary artery disease (eg, diabetes, metabolic syndrome).  Consensus is emerging that lowering elevated TGs is beneficial.  No target goals exist, but levels < 150 mg/dL (< 1. 7 mmol/L) are generally considered desirable.  No guidelines specifically address treatment of elevated TGs in children.  The overall treatment strategy is to first implement lifestyle changes, including exercise, weight loss, and avoidance of concentrated dietary sugar and alcohol.  Intake of 2 to 4 servings/week of marine fish high in omega-3 fatty acids may be effective, but the amount of omega-3 fatty acids is often lower than needed; supplemental doses may be helpful.  In patients with diabetes, glucose levels should be tightly controlled.  If these measures are ineffective, lipid-lowering drugs should be considered.  Patients with very high TG levels (> 1,000 mg/dL [> 11 mmol/L]) may need to begin drug therapy at diagnosis to more quickly reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues). \n【20】 Fibrates reduce TGs by about 50%.  They appear to stimulate endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leading to increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver and muscle and decreased hepatic VLDL synthesis.  They also increase HDL by up to 20%.  Fibrates can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes.  They uncommonly cause cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder.  In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones. \n【21】 Fibrates may potentiate muscle toxicity when used with statins and potentiate the effects of warfarin.  Statins can be used in patients with TGs < 500 mg/dL (< 5. 65 mmol/L) if LDL cholesterol elevations are also present; statins may reduce both LDL cholesterol and TGs through reduction of VLDL.  If only TGs are elevated, fibrates are the drug of choice.  Omega-3 fatty acids in high doses (1 to 6 g a day of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) can be effective in reducing TGs.  The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are the active ingredients in marine fish oil or omega-3 capsules.  Adverse effects include eructation and diarrhea.  These effects may be decreased by giving the fish oil capsules with meals in divided doses (eg, twice a day or 3 times a day).  Omega-3 fatty acids can be a useful adjunct to other therapies.  Prescription omega-3 fatty acid preparations are indicated for triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dL (> 5. 65 mmol/L).  The Apo CIII inhibitor (an antisense inhibitor of apo CIII), volanesorsen, is now available in some countries.  It lowers triglyceride levels in patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels, including people with lipoprotein lipase deficiency.  It is given as a weekly injection.  Low HDL Although higher HDL levels predict lower cardiovascular risk, it is not clear whether treatments to increase HDL cholesterol levels decrease risk of death.  Guidelines in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATPIII) define low HDL cholesterol as < 40 mg/dL [< 1. 04 mmol/L]; the guidelines do not specify an HDL cholesterol target level and recommend interventions to raise HDL cholesterol only after LDL cholesterol targets have been reached.  Treatments for LDL cholesterol and triglyceride reduction often increase HDL cholesterol, and the 3 objectives can sometimes be achieved simultaneously.  Pearls & Pitfalls Although higher HDL levels predict lower cardiovascular risk, it is not clear whether treatments to increase HDL cholesterol levels decrease risk of cardiovascular events or death.  Treatment includes lifestyle changes such as an increase in exercise and weight loss.  Alcohol raises HDL cholesterol but is not routinely recommended as a therapy because of its many other adverse effects.  Drugs may be successful in raising levels when lifestyle changes alone are insufficient, but it is uncertain whether raising HDL levels reduces mortality.  Nicotinic acid (niacin) is the most effective drug for increasing HDL.  Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it appears to both increase HDL production and inhibit HDL clearance; it may also mobilize cholesterol from macrophages.  Niacin also decreases TGs and, in doses of 1500 to 2000 mg/day, reduces LDL cholesterol.  Niacin causes flushing, pruritus, and nausea; premedication with low-dose aspirin may prevent these adverse effects.  Extended-release preparations cause flushing less often.  However, most over-the-counter slow-release preparations are not recommended; an exception is polygel controlled-release niacin.  Niacin can cause liver enzyme elevations and occasionally liver failure, insulin resistance, and hyperuricemia and gout.  It may also increase homocysteine levels Hyperhomocysteinemia may predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis. \n【22】 The combination of high doses of niacin with statins may increase the risk of myopathy.  In patients with average LDL cholesterol and below-average HDL cholesterol levels, niacin combined with statin treatment may be effective in preventing cardiovascular disorders.  In patients treated with statins to lower LDL cholesterol to < 70 mg/dL (< 1. 8 mmol/L), niacin does not appear to have added benefit and may cause increased adverse effects, including ischemic stroke Ischemic Stroke Ischemic stroke is sudden neurologic deficits that result from focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction (eg, positive results on diffusion-weighted MRI). \n【23】 Fibrates increase HDL.  Fibrates may decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with TGs > 200 mg/dL (> 2. 26 mmol/L) and HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL (< 1. 04 mmol/L).  Cholesterol ester transport protein (CETP) inhibitors raise HDL levels by inhibiting CETP.  Several studies have not shown a benefit.  Studies with infusion of recombinant apo A1 Milano have not shown benefit.  Elevated Lp(a) The upper limit of normal for Lp(a) is about 30 mg/dL (75 nmol/L), but values in African Americans run higher.  Few data exist to guide the treatment of elevated Lp(a) or to establish treatment efficacy.  Niacin is the only drug that directly decreases Lp(a); it can lower Lp(a) by > 20% at higher doses.  The usual approach in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to lower LDL cholesterol aggressively.  LDL apheresis has been used to lower Lp(a) in patients with high Lp(a) levels and progressive vascular disease.  An antisense inhibitor of apo (a) is in development.  Secondary causes of dyslipidemia Treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia should always involve lifestyle changes and statins to reduce LDL cholesterol.  To decrease the risk of pancreatitis, fibrates can be used to decrease TGs when levels are > 500 mg/dL ,> 5.  Metformin lowers TGs, which may be a reason to choose it over other oral antihyperglycemic drugs when treating diabetes.  Some thiazolidinediones (TZDs) increase both HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.  Some TZDs also decrease TGs.  These antihyperglycemic drugs should not be chosen over lipid-lowering drugs to treat lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes but may be useful adjuncts.  Patients with very high TG levels and less than optimally controlled diabetes may have a better response to insulin than to oral antihyperglycemic drugs.  Treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency.  Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. \n【24】 Abnormal lipid levels in patients with low-normal thyroid function (high-normal TSH levels) improve with hormone replacement.  Reducing the dosage of or stopping drugs that cause lipid abnormalities should be considered.  Monitoring treatment Lipid levels should be monitored periodically after starting treatment.  No data support specific monitoring intervals, but measuring lipid levels 2 to 3 months after starting or changing therapies and once or twice yearly after lipid levels are stabilized is common practice.  Liver and severe muscle toxicity with statin use occurs in 0. 5 to 2% of all users.  Routine monitoring of liver enzyme levels is not necessary, and routine measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is not useful to predict the onset of rhabdomyolysis.  Muscle enzyme levels need not be checked regularly unless patients develop myalgias or other muscle symptoms.  If statin-induced muscle damage is suspected, statin use is stopped and CK may be measured.  When muscle symptoms subside, a lower dose or a different statin can be tried.  If symptoms do not subside within 1 to 2 weeks of stopping the statin, another cause should be sought for the muscle symptoms ,eg, polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyalgia Rheumatica Polymyalgia rheumatica is a syndrome closely associated with giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).  It affects adults > 55. \n【25】 Key Points Elevated lipid levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thus can lead to symptomatic coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease.  Causes of dyslipidemia include a sedentary lifestyle with excessive dietary intake of calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats and/or genetic (familial) abnormalities of lipid metabolism.  Diagnose using serum lipid profile (measured total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and calculated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]).  Screening tests should be done at age 9 to 11 years and again at age 17 to 21 years (age 2 to 8 if there is a strong family history of severe hyperlipidemia or premature coronary artery disease or other risk factors); adults are screened every 5 years beginning at age 20.  Treatment with a statin is indicated to reduce risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for all patients in 4 major risk groups as defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and for those without who have certain other combinations of risk factors and elevated lipid levels.  Optimize adherence, lifestyle changes, and statin usage before adding a non-statin drug; if a patient has an LDL cholesterol level > 70 mg/dL (> 1. 8 mmol/L) with high risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adding ezetimibe or PSCK9 inhibitor is reasonable.  Other treatment depends on the specific lipid abnormality but should always include lifestyle changes, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, and in some patients with increased risk of myocardial infarction or death due to coronary artery disease, daily low-dose aspirin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis is by ultrasonographic measurement of amniotic fluid volume.  Management involves close fetal monitoring and serial ultrasonographic assessments.  Causes of oligohydramnios include the following: Uteroplacental insufficiency ,eg, due to preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation.  Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. \n【1】 It can be an obstetric emergency. \n【2】 Rupture of membranes Prelabor Rupture of Membranes (PROM) Prelabor rupture of membranes is leakage of amniotic fluid before onset of labor.  Diagnosis is clinical. \n【3】 Late-term pregnancy is defined as 41 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks.  Antenatal surveillance should be considered at 41 weeks. \n【4】 Symptoms and Signs of Oligohydramnios itself tends not to cause maternal symptoms other than a sense of decreased fetal movement.  Uterine size may be less than expected based on gestational age.  Disorders causing or contributing to oligohydramnios may cause symptoms.  Diagnosis of Oligohydramnios Ultrasonographic measurement of amniotic fluid volume Comprehensive ultrasonographic examination, including evaluation for fetal malformations Testing for clinically suspected maternal causes Oligohydramnios may be suspected if uterine size is less than expected for dates or if fetal movements are decreased; it may also be suspected based on incidental ultrasonographic findings.  However, qualitative estimates of amniotic fluid volume tend to be subjective.  If oligohydramnios is suspected, amniotic fluid should be assessed quantitatively using the amniotic fluid index (AFI) or single deepest pocket (SDP).  The volume of amniotic fluid cannot be measured directly.  Thus, excessive fluid is defined indirectly using one of the following ultrasonographic criteria: AFI ≤ 5 cm: AFI is the sum of the vertical depth of fluid measured in each quadrant of the uterus; normal AFI ranges from > 5 to < 24 cm.  SDP < 2 cm: SDP is a measurement of the deepest pocket of amniotic fluid; normal SDP is ≥ 2 to < 8 cm.  It appears that neither AFI nor SDP is superior to the other in terms of preventing adverse perinatal outcomes.  Each has limitations: AFI often results in overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios; SDP results in overdiagnosis of polyhydramnios .  Identification of cause If oligohydramnios is diagnosed, clinicians should check for possible causes, including premature rupture of membranes.  Comprehensive ultrasonographic examination is done to check for fetal malformations and any evident placental causes (eg, placental abruption).  Clinicians can offer amniocentesis and fetal karyotyping if ultrasonography suggests fetal malformations or aneuploidy.  If uteroplacental insufficiency is suspected and intrauterine growth restriction is detected, the umbilical artery is assessed using Doppler ultrasonography. \n【5】 Treatment of Oligohydramnios Serial ultrasonography to determine AFI and monitor fetal growth Nonstress testing or biophysical profile Ultrasonography should be done at least once every 2 to 4 weeks (every 2 weeks if growth is restricted) to monitor fetal growth.  The AFI should be measured at least once a week.  Most experts recommend fetal monitoring Fetal Monitoring Labor consists of a series of rhythmic, involuntary or medically induced contractions of the uterus that result in effacement (thinning and shortening) and dilation of the uterine cervix. \n【6】 However, this approach has not been proved to prevent fetal death.  Also, optimal time for delivery is controversial and can vary based on patient characteristics and fetal complications. \n【7】 Key Points Oligohydramnios is amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age.  Oligohydramnios can be caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, drugs, fetal abnormalities, or rupture of membranes.  It can cause problems in the fetus (eg, growth restriction, limb contractures, death, delayed lung maturation, inability to tolerate labor).  If oligohydramnios is suspected, determine the amniotic fluid index or single deepest pocket and test for possible causes (including doing a comprehensive ultrasonographic evaluation).  Do ultrasonography a least once every 4 weeks, and consider fetal monitoring at least once a week and delivery at 36 to 37 weeks/6 days or at diagnosis if diagnosed at ≥ 37 weeks (although optimal time for delivery varies based on clinical context).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Most patients with anosmia have normal perception of salty, sweet, sour, and bitter substances but lack flavor discrimination, which largely depends on olfaction.  Therefore, they often complain of losing the sense of taste (ageusia) and of not enjoying food.  Etiology of Anosmia occurs when intranasal swelling or other obstruction prevents odors from gaining access to the olfactory area; when the olfactory neuroepithelium is destroyed; or when the olfactory nerve fila, bulbs, tracts, or central connections are destroyed .   Major causes of anosmia include Head trauma Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. \n【1】 Drugs can contribute to anosmia in susceptible patients.  Other causes include prior head and neck radiation, recent nasal or sinus surgery, nasal and brain tumors, and toxins.  The role of tobacco is uncertain.  Anosmia may be an early symptom, and thus a clue to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  Pearls & Pitfalls Immediately quarantine patients at risk of COVID-19 who have sudden loss of smell.  Evaluation of Anosmia History of present illness should assess the time course of symptoms and their relation to any URI or head injury.  Important associated symptoms are nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or both.  The nature of rhinorrhea should be assessed (eg, watery, mucoid, purulent, bloody).  Review of systems should assess neurologic symptoms, particularly those involving mental status (eg, difficulty with recent memory) and cranial nerves (eg, diplopia, difficulty speaking or swallowing, tinnitus, vertigo).  Past medical history should include history of sinus disorders, cranial trauma or surgery, allergies, drugs used, and exposure to chemicals or fumes.  Physical examination The nasal passages should be inspected for swelling, inflammation, discharge, and polyps.  Having the patient breathe through each nostril sequentially (while the other is manually occluded) may help identify obstruction.  A complete neurologic examination, particularly of mental status and cranial nerves, is done.  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Previous head injury Neurologic symptoms or signs Sudden onset Local or global epidemic of COVID-19 Interpretation of findings Sudden onset after significant head trauma Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. \n【2】 A history of chronic rhinosinusitis Sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactions. \n【3】 However, because these findings are common in the population, the physician should be wary of missing another disorder.  Progressive confusion and recent memory loss in an older patient suggest Alzheimer disease Alzheimer Disease Alzheimer disease causes progressive cognitive deterioration and is characterized by beta-amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray matter. \n【4】 Waxing and waning neurologic symptoms affecting multiple areas suggest a neurodegenerative disease such as multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. \n【5】 Slowly progressive anosmia in an older patient with no other symptoms or findings suggests normal aging as the cause.  Testing An in-office test of olfaction can help confirm olfactory dysfunction.  Commonly, one nostril is pressed shut, and a pungent odor such as from a vial containing coffee, cinnamon, or tobacco is placed under the open nostril; if the patient can identify the substance, olfaction is presumed intact.  The test is repeated on the other nostril to determine whether the response is bilateral.  Unfortunately, the test is crude and unreliable.  If anosmia is present and no cause is readily apparent on clinical evaluation , patients should have CT of the head (including sinuses) with contrast to rule out a tumor or unsuspected fracture of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa.  MRI is also used to evaluate intracranial disease and may be needed as well, particularly in those patients with no nasal or sinus pathology on CT.  A psychophysical assessment of odor and taste identification and threshold detection is done as well.  This assessment commonly involves use of one or several commercially available testing kits.  One kit uses a scratch-and-sniff battery of odors, whereas another kit involves sequential dilutions of an odorous chemical.  If COVID-19 is suspected, patients should be tested and managed according to local protocols.  Treatment of Anosmia Specific causes are treated; however, smell does not always recover even after successful treatment of sinusitis.  There are no treatments for anosmia.  Patients who retain some sense of smell may find adding concentrated flavoring agents to food improves their enjoyment of eating.  Smoke alarms, important in all homes, are even more essential for patients with anosmia.  Patients should be cautioned about consumption of stored food and use of natural gas for cooking or heating, because they have difficulty detecting food spoilage or gas leaks.  Geriatrics Essentials There is a significant loss of olfactory receptor neurons with normal aging, leading to a marked diminution of the sense of smell.  Changes are usually noticeable by age 60 and can be marked after age 70.  Key Points Anosmia may be part of normal aging.  Common causes include URI, sinusitis, and head trauma.

Deficiency may be asymptomatic or it may cause exercise-induced myalgias or cramping; expression seems to be variable because, despite the high frequency of the mutant allele (10 to 14%), the frequency of the muscle phenotype is quite low in patients homozygous for the mutant allele.  When symptomatic patients exercise, they do not accumulate ammonia or inosine monophosphate as do unaffected people; this is how the disorder is diagnosed.  Treatment of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency is exercise modulation as appropriate.  Adenosine deaminase deficiency Adenosine deaminase converts adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, which are further broken down and excreted.  Enzyme deficiency (from 1 of > 60 known mutations) results in accumulation of adenosine, which is converted to its ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide (dATP) forms by cellular kinases.  The dATP increase results in inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and underproduction of other deoxyribonucleotides.  DNA replication is compromised as a result.

Digestion breaks food down into its separate parts: Proteins Fats Carbohydrates Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are nutrients because they provide nutrition.  Other nutrients are: Vitamins and minerals After food is digested, nutrients go into your body through the walls of your intestines.  This is called absorption.  Locating the Small Intestine What is malabsorption? Malabsorption means you don't properly take in (absord) nutrients from food.  A problem somewhere in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract keeps you from absorbing one or more kinds of nutrients.  Malabsorption can be caused by diseases, surgery on your intestines, or intestinal infections You'll usually lose weight and have diarrhea and smelly stool (poop) After a while, you may get vitamin deficiencies Overview of Vitamins are a vital part of a healthy diet.  The recommended dietary allowance (RDA)—the amount most healthy people need each day to remain healthy—has been determined for most vitamins. \n【1】pancreas The pancreas is an organ that contains two types of glandular tissue: Pancreatic acini Islets of Langerhans  The acini produce digestive enzymes. \n【2】 Your pancreas is an organ in your upper belly that makes juices that help you digest food. \n【3】 It makes body fluids thick and sticky.  These sticky fluids clog up the lungs, digestive system, and many other organs. \n【4】 Lactase is an enzyme in your small intestines that digests lactose so your body can absorb it. \n【5】 Your GI tract is the tube that goes from your mouth to your anus. \n【6】 Malabsorption is when you have trouble absorbing the nutrients in your food.  Nutrients are things that provide nutrition to your body. \n【7】 You have a large intestine and a small intestine.  Your small intestine is where food is absorbed. \n【8】 Other symptoms include: Feeling gassy and bloated Losing weight For women, stopped periods Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause: Low blood count  Easy bruising Tingling of hands and feet How do doctors diagnose malabsorption? Doctors usually do: Stool tests to look for unabsorbed fat Blood tests If these tests show malabsorption, doctors then do tests to look for the cause.  They may: Look down your stomach and intestines with a flexible viewing scope (endoscopy) Measure certain chemicals in your breath Take x-rays after you swallow a liquid contrast agent X-rays with a radiopaque contrast agent X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).  In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease. \n【9】 Some malabsorption diseases have specific treatments.  For example, tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics.  In general, if you have trouble with only certain foods, doctors will have you avoid them.

The amount of blood produced can vary from a few streaks of blood mixed with normal sputum to large amounts of pure blood.  Other symptoms, such as fever and difficulty breathing, may be present, depending on the cause of hemoptysis.  Causes of Coughing Up Blood Although hemoptysis can be frightening, most causes turn out not to be serious.  Blood-streaked sputum is common in many minor respiratory illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections (URIs) and viral bronchitis.  Sometimes the cause is blood from the nose that has traveled down the throat and then is coughed up.  Such blood is not considered hemoptysis.  Common causes Infection is the most common cause .  In adults, 70 to 90% of cases are caused by Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the windpipe (trachea) and the airways that branch off the trachea (bronchi) caused by infection. \n【1】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【2】 About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. \n【3】 However, cancer that has spread to the lungs from elsewhere in the body rarely causes hemoptysis.  Fungal infection with Aspergillus ,called aspergillosis is an infection, usually of the lungs, caused by the fungus Aspergillus.  A ball of fungus fibers, blood clots, and white blood cells may form in the lungs or sinuses. \n【4】 Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic contagious infection caused by the airborne bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved. \n【5】 The cause is unknown. \n【6】 Heart failure and heart valve disorders can rarely cause mild hemoptysis.  Massive hemoptysis is the production of more than about a pint (about 600 milliliters) of blood within 24 hours.  The most common causes include the following: Lung cancer Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.  About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. \n【7】 It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved. \n【8】 Warning signs In people with hemoptysis, the following symptoms are of particular concern: Large amounts of blood coughed up Shortness of breath Signs of significant blood loss (weakness, dizziness when standing up, thirst, sweating, and a rapid heart rate) Weakness or fatigue Having a tracheostomy When to see a doctor People with warning signs should go the hospital immediately.  People without warning signs who have risk factors for serious disorders and those with more than just blood-streaked sputum should see a doctor in a day or two.  If people have only blood-streaked sputum (which is usually caused by an upper respiratory infection), a doctor's evaluation is not as urgent.  People can call a doctor, who can decide whether and how rapidly they need to be seen based on their symptoms, medical history, and other factors.  Typically, a delay of a few days or so is not harmful.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history and then do a physical examination.  What doctors find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (Some Causes and Features of Hemoptysis ).  Doctors ask When the person started coughing up blood How long the coughing has been going on Whether anything specific triggers it (such as cold, exertion, or lying down) About how much blood is coughed up (such as streaks, a teaspoonful, or a cupful) Whether the person has other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, chest pain, or leg pain Doctors determine whether blood was actually coughed (and not vomited or dripped down the back of the throat from a nosebleed).  Doctors ask people about their medical history (if not already known) and their risk factors for causes.  A history of frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising, or liver disease suggests a possible blood clotting disorder Overview of Blood Clotting Disorders Blood clotting (coagulation) disorders are dysfunctions in the body's ability to control the formation of blood clots. \n【9】 Doctors review the drugs the person is taking to check for drugs that inhibit clotting (anticoagulants).  During the physical examination, doctors review vital signs to check for fever, rapid heart or breathing rate, and test for a low oxygen level in the blood.  They do a full heart and lung examination, inspect the neck veins for signs of fullness such as bulging, and check the legs for puffiness.  Puffiness in one leg may indicate a blood clot ,deep vein thrombosis Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins, usually in the legs. \n【10】 Doctors also examine the abdomen, skin, and mucous membranes.  The person is asked to cough during the examination.  If any blood is coughed up, the doctor notes its color and the amount of blood.  Doctors also check the nose and mouth for bleeding sites.  Clues from the history and examination help doctors determine the cause.  A sensation of postnasal drip or any bleeding from the nose, particularly without coughing, may mean that the blood being coughed up has dripped down the back of the throat from the nose.  Nausea and vomiting of black, brown, or coffee-ground–colored material usually means that the blood is from the stomach or intestine and is being vomited and not coughed.  Frothy sputum, bright red blood, and, if the amount is massive, a sensation of choking usually mean that the blood is from the trachea or lungs (called true hemoptysis).  If cough has just begun and if the person is otherwise in good health and has no risk factors for tuberculosis, fungal infection, or pulmonary embolism, the cause is usually an acute respiratory infection, such as bronchitis.  If coughing up blood is caused by a heart or lung disorder, the person has almost always already been diagnosed with that heart or lung disorder.  That is, coughing up blood is usually not the first symptom of a heart or lung disorder.   Testing If hemoptysis is severe, persistent, or unexplained, testing is needed.  If people have coughed up massive amounts of blood, they are treated and their condition is stabilized before testing is done. \n【11】 If the chest x-ray is abnormal or if the person has symptoms of or risk factors for a particular disorder, computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy are done.  In bronchoscopy, a flexible viewing tube is inserted into the windpipe and bronchi to identify the bleeding site.  Occasionally, bronchoscopy is necessary to confirm that blood is being coughed up from the lower airways and not from the nose, stomach, or intestine.  If pulmonary embolism seems possible, doctors do CT using a radiopaque contrast to show blood vessels ,called CT angiography In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【12】 Depending on the results of that scan, pulmonary arteriography may be done.  Doctors often check for lung cancer Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. \n【13】 In most people, a complete blood count and blood tests that assess the blood's ability to clot are done to detect blood clotting problems.  Despite testing, the cause of hemoptysis is not identified in 30 to 40% of people.  However, when hemoptysis is severe, the cause is usually identified.  Treatment of Coughing Up Blood Bleeding may produce clots that block the airways and lead to further breathing problems.  Therefore, coughing is important to keep the airways clear and should not be suppressed with cough suppressants (antitussive drugs).  Hemoptysis may be mild and may stop by itself or when the disorder causing the bleeding (such as heart failure or infection) is successfully treated.  If a large clot blocks a major airway, doctors may have to remove the clot using bronchoscopy.  Rarely, hemoptysis is severe or does not stop by itself.  If so, a tube may need to be inserted through the mouth or nose into the windpipe or lower into the airways to help keep the airways open.  If the source of bleeding is a major blood vessel, a doctor may try to close off the bleeding vessel using a procedure called bronchial artery angiography and embolization.  Using x-rays for guidance, the doctor passes a catheter into the vessel and then injects a chemical, fragments of a gelatin sponge, or a wire coil to block the blood vessel and thereby stop the bleeding.  Sometimes bronchoscopy or surgery may be needed to stop severe or continuing bleeding, or surgery may be needed to remove a diseased or cancerous portion of the lung.  These high-risk procedures are used only as last resorts.  If clotting abnormalities are contributing to the bleeding, a person may need a transfusion of plasma, clotting factors, or platelets.  Tranexamic acid, a drug that is inhaled, may be given to treat hemoptysis that does not resolve on its own or with treatment of the underlying disorder.  Key Points Blood-streaked sputum is usually caused by a respiratory infection and, if it resolves, is not usually cause for worry.  A lower respiratory tract infection and inhalation of a foreign object are the most common causes in children.  Doctors must distinguish hemoptysis from bleeding that comes from the mouth, nose, or throat and from blood that is vomited.  Blood-streaked sputum in people who smoke usually requires further evaluation.  People who cough up massive amounts of blood must be treated and stabilized immediately, before testing can be done.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}

Thyroid hormone secretion may be decreased, increased, or normal.  Diagnosis is made by confirming thyroid size with ultrasonography.  Treatment is thyroid hormone replacement when hypothyroidism is present.  Surgery is indicated when breathing or swallowing is impaired.   Etiology of Congenital Goiter Congenital goiter may be caused by dyshormonogenesis (abnormal thyroid hormone production), transplacental passage of maternal antibodies, or transplacental passage of goitrogens.  Some causes of congenital goiter are hereditary.  Dyshormonogenesis Genetic defects in thyroid hormone production result in increased levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn can cause congenital goiter.  Goiter is present in about 15% of cases of congenital hypothyroidism Congenital hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. \n【1】 There are a number of gene abnormalities that cause dyshormonogenesis (eg, DUOX2, TG, TPO, SLC5A5); they commonly have an autosomal recessive form of inheritance Autosomal Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. \n【2】 Dyshormonogenesis can result from a defect in any of the steps in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, including Failure to concentrate iodide Defective organification of iodide due to an abnormality in the thyroid peroxidase enzyme or in the hydrogen peroxide–generating system Defective thyroglobulin synthesis or transport Abnormal iodotyrosine deiodinase activity Children with Pendred syndrome have mild hypothyroidism in Infants and Children Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. \n【3】 Although Pendred syndrome is caused by a genetic defect, it rarely manifests in the newborn period.  Transplacental passage of maternal antibodies Women with an autoimmune thyroid disorder produce antibodies that may cross the placenta during the third trimester.  Depending on the disorder, the antibodies either block thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors, causing hypothyroidism, or stimulate them, causing hyperthyroidism in Infants and Children Hyperthyroidism is excessive thyroid hormone production.  Diagnosis is by thyroid function testing (eg, free serum thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone). \n【4】 Typically, in affected infants, the changes in hormone secretion and the associated goiter resolve spontaneously within 3 to 6 months.  Transplacental passage of goitrogens, such as amiodarone, iodine, or antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole), taken by the mother can cross the placenta, sometimes causing hypothyroidism and rarely causing goiter.  Symptoms and Signs of Congenital Goiter The most common manifestation of congenital goiter is firm, symmetric, nontender enlargement of the thyroid.  Enlargement is most often diffuse but can be nodular.  It may be noticeable at birth or detected later.  In some patients, enlargement is not directly observable, but continued growth can cause deviation or compression of the trachea, compromising breathing and swallowing.  Many children with goiters are euthyroid, but some present with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.  Diagnosis of Congenital Goiter Ultrasonography If the diagnosis of congenital goiter is suspected, thyroid size is typically assessed by ultrasonography.  Free thyroxine (T4) measurement The thyroid gland, located in the anterior neck just below the cricoid cartilage, consists of 2 lobes connected by an isthmus. \n【5】 Treatment of Congenital Goiter Surgical treatment of enlargement causing symptoms related to compression Sometimes thyroid hormone Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone.
