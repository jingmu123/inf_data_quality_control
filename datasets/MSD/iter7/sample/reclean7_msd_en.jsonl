This condition can result in discomfort, interfere with speech and swallowing, make wearing dentures difficult, cause halitosis is a frequent or persistent unpleasant breath odor. \n【1】 Long-standing xerostomia can result in severe tooth decay Caries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities.  The symptoms—tender, painful teeth—appear late. \n【2】 Xerostomia is a common complaint among older adults, affecting about 20% of them.   Pathophysiology of Xerostomia Stimulation of the oral mucosa signals the salivatory nuclei in the medulla, triggering an efferent response.  The efferent nerve impulses release acetylcholine at salivary gland nerve terminals, activating muscarinic receptors (M3), which increase saliva production and flow.  Medullary signals responsible for salivation may also be modulated by cortical inputs from other stimuli (eg, taste, smell, anxiety).  Etiology of Xerostomia is usually caused by the following: Drugs Radiation to the head and neck (for cancer treatment) Systemic disorders are less commonly the cause, but xerostomia is common in Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【3】 Drugs are the most common cause ; about 400 prescription drugs and many over-the-counter (OTC) drugs cause decreased salivation.  The most common include the following: Anticholinergics Antiparkinsonian drugs Some drug categories (eg, analgesics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian drugs, diuretics, hypoglycemic drugs, psychoactive drugs) pose special risks for older adults. \n【4】 They are invariably painful. \n【5】 The damage is exacerbated by the bruxing Bruxism is clenching or grinding of teeth.  Bruxism can occur during sleep (sleep bruxism) and while awake (awake bruxism). \n【6】 This combination causes very rapid destruction of teeth.  Tobacco use is a major individual and public health problem.  Dependence develops rapidly. \n【7】 Radiation Incidental radiation to the salivary glands during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer often causes severe xerostomia (5200 cGy causes severe, permanent dryness, but even low doses can cause temporary drying).  Evaluation of Xerostomia History of present illness should include acuity of onset, temporal patterns (eg, constant vs intermittent, presence only on awakening), provoking factors, including situational or psychogenic factors (eg, whether xerostomia occurs only during periods of psychologic stress or certain activities), assessment of fluid status (eg, fluid intake habits, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea), and sleeping habits.  A history of use of recreational drugs should be taken.  Review of systems should seek symptoms of causative disorders, including dry eyes, dry skin, rashes, and joint pain . \n【8】 Drug profiles should be reviewed for potential offending drugs .  Physical examination is focused on the oral cavity, specifically any apparent dryness (eg, whether the mucosa is dry, sticky, or moist; whether saliva is foamy, thick, stringy, or normal in appearance), the presence of any lesions caused by Candida albicans, and the condition of the teeth.  The presence and severity of xerostomia can be assessed in several ways.  For example, a tongue blade can be held against the buccal mucosa for 10 seconds.  If the tongue blade falls off immediately when released, salivary flow is considered normal.  The more difficulty encountered removing the tongue blade, the more severe the xerostomia.  In women, the lipstick sign, where lipstick adheres to the front teeth, may be a useful indicator of xerostomia.  If there appears to be dryness, the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands should be palpated while observing the ductal openings for saliva flow.  The openings are at the base of the tongue anteriorly for the submandibular and sublingual glands and on the middle of the inside of the cheek for the parotid glands.  Drying the duct openings with a gauze square before palpation aids observation.  If a graduated container is available, the patient can expectorate once to empty the mouth and then expectorate all saliva into the container.  Normal production is 0. 3 to 0. 4 mL/min.  Significant xerostomia is 0.  Dental caries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities. \n【9】 A common manifestation of C.  albicans infection is areas of erythema and atrophy (eg, loss of papillae on the dorsum of the tongue).  Less common is the better-known white, cheesy curd that bleeds when wiped off.  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Extensive tooth decay Concomitant dry eyes, dry skin, rash, or joint pain Risk factors for HIV Interpretation of findings Xerostomia is diagnosed by symptoms, appearance, and absence of salivary flow when massaging the salivary glands.  No further assessment is required when xerostomia occurs after initiation of a new drug and stops after cessation of that drug or when symptoms appear within several weeks of irradiation of the head and neck.  Xerostomia that occurs with abrupt onset after head and neck trauma may be caused by nerve damage.  Concomitant presence of dry eyes, dry skin, rash, or joint pain, particularly in a female patient, suggests a diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【10】 Xerostomia that occurs only during nighttime or that is noted only on awakening may be indicative of excessive mouth breathing in a dry environment.  Testing Sialometry Salivary gland biopsy For patients in whom the presence of xerostomia is unclear, sialometry can be conducted by placing collection devices over the major duct orifices and then stimulating salivary production with citric acid or by chewing paraffin. 4 to 1. 5 mL/min/gland.  Flow monitoring can also help determine response to therapy. \n【11】 The lower lip is a convenient site for biopsy.  Treatment of Xerostomia Cause treated and causative drugs stopped when possible Cholinergic drugs Saliva substitutes Regular oral hygiene and dental care to prevent tooth decay When possible, the cause of xerostomia should be addressed and treated.  For patients with drug-related xerostomia whose therapy cannot be changed to another drug, drug schedules should be modified to achieve maximum drug effect during the day because nighttime xerostomia is more likely to cause caries.  Custom-fitted acrylic night guards carrying fluoride gel may also help limit caries in these patients.  For all drugs, easy-to-take formulations, such as liquids, should be considered, and sublingual dosage forms should be avoided.  The mouth and throat should be lubricated with water before swallowing capsules and tablets or before using sublingual nitroglycerin.  Patients should avoid decongestants and antihistamines. \n【12】 Patients using oral appliance therapy may benefit from a room humidifier.  Symptom control Symptomatic treatment consists of measures that do the following: Increase existing saliva Replace lost secretions Control caries Drugs that augment saliva production include cevimeline and pilocarpine, both cholinergic agonists.  Cevimeline (30 mg orally 3 times a day) has less M2 (cardiac) receptor activity than pilocarpine and a longer half-life.  The main adverse effect is nausea.  Pilocarpine (5 mg orally 3 times a day) may be given after ophthalmologic and cardiorespiratory contraindications are excluded; adverse effects include sweating, flushing, and polyuria.  Sipping sugarless fluids frequently, chewing xylitol-containing gum, and using an over-the-counter saliva substitute containing carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or glycerin may help.  Petroleum jelly can be applied to the lips and under dentures to relieve drying, cracking, soreness, and mucosal trauma.  A cold-air humidifier may aid mouth breathers, who typically have their worst symptoms at night.  Meticulous oral hygiene is essential.  Patients should brush and floss regularly (including just before bedtime) and use fluoride rinses or gels daily; using newer toothpastes with added calcium and phosphates also may help avoid rampant caries.  An increased frequency of preventive dental visits with plaque removal is advised.  The most effective way to prevent caries is to sleep with individually fitted carriers containing 1. 1% sodium fluoride or 0. 4% stannous fluoride.  In addition, a dentist can apply a 5% sodium fluoride varnish 2 to 4 times a year.  Patients should avoid sugary or acidic foods and beverages and any irritating foods that are dry, spicy, astringent, or excessively hot or cold.  It is particularly important to avoid ingesting sugar near bedtime.  Geriatrics Essentials Although xerostomia becomes more common among older patients, this is probably due to the many drugs typically used by those patients rather than aging itself.  Key Points Drugs are the most common cause, but systemic diseases (most commonly Sjögren syndrome or HIV) and radiation therapy also can cause xerostomia.  Symptomatic treatment includes increasing existing saliva flow with stimulants or drugs, and artificial saliva replacement; xylitol-containing gum and sugarless candy may be useful.  Patients with xerostomia are at high risk of tooth decay; meticulous oral hygiene, additional preventive measures in home care, and professionally applied fluorides are essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:26:13"}

Because usually two copies of the abnormal gene are necessary for the disorder to occur, usually neither parent has the disorder.   Sphingolipidoses occur when people do not have the enzymes needed to break down (metabolize) sphingolipids, which are compounds that protect the cell surface and serve certain functions in the cells.  There are many other types of sphingolipidoses: Fabry disease is a type of lysosomal storage disorder called a sphingolipidosis.  It is caused by a buildup of glycolipid in tissues. \n【4】 It causes intellectual disability, paralysis, blindness, deafness, and eventually death. \n【5】 It is caused by a buildup of fats (lipids) in the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, and spleen. \n【6】 Types A and B are sphingolipidoses and are caused by a buildup of sphingomyelin in the tissues. \n【7】 Gangliosides build up in affected children because the enzyme needed to break down gangliosides, called hexosaminidase A, is not working correctly.  Tay-Sachs disease This disease is most common among families of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish origin. \n【8】 Muscle tightness and stiffness develop, followed by paralysis, dementia, and blindness.

Heme is a chemical compound that contains iron and gives blood its red color.  Heme is a key component of several important proteins in the body.  One of those proteins is hemoglobin, which enables red blood cells to carry oxygen.  Heme is also an important part of certain enzymes made by the liver.  Enzymes are special proteins produced by cells that speed up chemical reactions in the body.  Heme is produced mainly in the bone marrow and liver through a complex process that requires eight different enzymes working in concert.  The enzymes work one after another in separate steps that take the starting building blocks through several different intermediate compounds, finally producing heme.  If there is a deficiency in one of these enzymes, certain intermediate compounds (porphyrin precursors) may accumulate.  These may accumulate in the Bone marrow Liver Skin Other tissues Heme precursors may also appear in excess in the blood or be excreted in the urine or stool.  The accumulated heme precursors cause symptoms and can often be detected by testing to help diagnose porphyria.  The specific heme precursors that accumulate and the symptoms that develop depend on which enzyme is deficient.  Porphyrias are a group of different disorders, each caused by a deficiency in one of the enzymes needed for heme production.  Each enzyme deficiency is caused by an abnormality in the gene (a mutation) responsible for the production of the enzyme in question.  The abnormal gene is almost always inherited from one of the parents or, rarely, both.  Classification of Porphyrias can be classified in several ways.  Classification according to the specific enzyme deficiency is the most accurate.  A simpler classification system distinguishes porphyrias as acute or cutaneous: Acute porphyrias: Porphyrias that cause neurologic, mental, and abdominal symptoms Cutaneous porphyrias: Porphyrias that cause skin symptoms when the skin is exposed to sunlight A third classification system is based on where the excess precursors originate: Hepatic porphyrias: Precursors originate primarily in the liver Erythropoietic porphyrias: Precursors originate primarily in the bone marrow Some porphyrias are classified into more than one of these categories.  Acute porphyrias cause intermittent attacks of abdominal, mental health, and neurologic symptoms.  These attacks are typically triggered by prescription medications (including oral contraceptives), alcohol, smoking, and other factors such as fasting, infections, or stress.  In young women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle are also a typical trigger of acute attacks.  The most common acute porphyria is Acute intermittent porphyria, which causes abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms, is the most common acute porphyria.  Many people never experience symptoms. \n【1】 Cutaneous porphyrias cause symptoms involving the skin after the skin is exposed to sunlight.  In these porphyrias, certain porphyrins are deposited in the skin.  When exposed to light and oxygen, these porphyrins generate an unstable form of oxygen capable of damaging the skin.  Some cutaneous porphyrias cause symptoms that tend to be continuous or intermittent.  These porphyrias include Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common porphyria and causes blistering and fragility of skin exposed to sunlight. \n【2】 Identical skin symptoms are also caused by two of the acute porphyrias (variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria).  Because symptoms take a while to develop after sun exposure, people are often unaware of the connection between their symptoms and sun exposure.  Other cutaneous porphyrias cause symptoms more immediately after a sun exposure.  These porphyrias are Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-Linked Protoporphyria Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are conditions related to abnormalities of enzymes involved in the production of heme and characterized by sensitivity to sunlight. \n【3】 The pain can last for hours or days.  The skin often has no change in appearance, but swelling and redness may occur.  People with these disorders usually experience early warning symptoms such as tingling or mild burning sensation, called prodromal symptoms, before developing the more severe and persistent skin symptoms.  People who experience such warning symptoms should seek shelter from the sun immediately to try to prevent the occurrence of the more severe symptoms.  Diagnosis of Porphyrias Measuring porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in the urine or blood Genetic testing Blood or urine tests Blood and urine can be tested for porphyrins or their precursor forms.  In many of the porphyrias, the urine may take on a red or reddish brown discoloration.  Sometimes the discoloration appears only after the urine has stood in air and light for minutes to hours.  Secondary porphyrinuria Doctors diagnose porphyrias by measuring porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in the urine.  Several diseases unrelated to porphyrias, such as blood disorders or liver disorders, and exposures to certain medications or to toxins such as alcohol, benzene, and lead, may themselves increase the amount of urine porphyrins.  This phenomenon is described as secondary porphyrinuria.  It is a common cause of erroneous over-diagnosis of porphyria.  Screening for Porphyrias In order to avoid exposure to substances that can precipitate acute porphyria attacks or cutaneous porphyria symptoms, people need to know whether they carry a genetic mutation that leads to a deficient enzyme.  Commonly, the genes in a blood or saliva sample are analyzed.  A child whose parent has a known genetic abnormality that can cause an acute porphyria ideally should be tested for presence of the same mutation well before puberty.  The child then can learn in advance how to avoid acute attacks, which are rare before puberty.  Older family members of a person with a known genetic abnormality should also be tested to confirm or reject the possibility that they are predisposed to developing an acute porphyria or could pass the disorder to a child.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:05:40"}

Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death.  Diagnosis is by electrocardiography.  Treatment of more than brief episodes is with cardioversion or antiarrhythmics, depending on symptoms.  If necessary, long-term treatment is with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.   Some experts use a cutoff rate of ≥ 100 beats/minute for ventricular tachycardia (VT).  Repetitive ventricular rhythms at slower rates are called accelerated idioventricular rhythms or slow VT; they are usually benign and are not treated unless patients have hemodynamic symptoms.  Most patients with VT have a significant heart disorder, particularly prior myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. \n【1】 Electrolyte abnormalities , acidemia, hypoxemia, and adverse drug effects contribute. \n【2】 Ventricular tachycardia may be monomorphic or polymorphic and nonsustained or sustained.  Monomorphic VT: Single abnormal focus or reentrant pathway and thus regular, identical-appearing QRS complexes Polymorphic VT: Several different foci or pathways and thus irregular, varying QRS complexes Nonsustained VT: Lasts < 30 seconds Sustained VT: Lasts ≥ 30 seconds or is terminated sooner because of hemodynamic collapse Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. \n【3】 Patients are predisposed to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased adrenergic activity.  VT frequently deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions.  It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes. \n【4】 Symptoms and Signs of Ventricular Tachycardia of short duration or slow rate may be asymptomatic.  Sustained VT is almost always symptomatic, causing palpitations, symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, or sudden cardiac death.  Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is by ECG .  Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0. 12 second) should be considered VT until proved otherwise.  Pearls & Pitfalls Any wide QRS complex tachycardia ,QRS ≥ 0.  Diagnosis is supported by ECG findings of dissociated P-wave activity, fusion or capture beats, uniformity of QRS vectors in the V leads (concordance) with discordant T-wave vector (opposite QRS vectors), and a frontal-plane QRS axis in the northwest quadrant.  Differential diagnosis includes supraventricular tachycardia Reentrant Supraventricular Tachycardias (SVT) Including Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome Reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) involve reentrant pathways with a component above the bifurcation of the His bundle. \n【5】 However, because some patients tolerate VT surprisingly well, concluding that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin is a mistake.  Using medications appropriate for supraventricular tachycardia (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) in patients with VT may cause hemodynamic collapse and death.  Pearls & Pitfalls Because some patients tolerate ventricular tachycardia surprisingly well, it is a mistake to conclude that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin.  Broad QRS ventricular tachycardia The QRS duration is 160 millisecond.  An independent P wave can be seen in II (arrows).  There is a leftward mean frontal axis shift.  Treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia Acute: Sometimes synchronized direct current cardioversion, sometimes class I or class III antiarrhythmics Long-term: Usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Acute Treatment of acute ventricular tachycardia depends on symptoms and duration of VT. \n【6】 Stable sustained VT can be treated with synchronized direct current cardioversion Direct Current (DC) Cardioversion-Defibrillation The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.  Treatment is directed at causes. \n【7】 Stable sustained VT can also be treated with intravenous class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs .  Lidocaine acts quickly but is frequently ineffective.  If lidocaine is ineffective, IV procainamide may be given, but it may take up to 1 hour to work.  IV amiodarone is frequently used but does not usually work quickly.  Failure of IV procainamide or IV amiodarone is an indication for cardioversion.  Nonsustained VT does not require immediate treatment unless the runs are frequent or long enough to cause symptoms.  In such cases, antiarrhythmics are used as for sustained VT.  Long-term The primary goal is preventing sudden death, rather than simply suppressing the arrhythmia.  It is best accomplished by use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia. \n【8】 However, the decision about whom to treat is complex and depends on the estimated probability of life-threatening VTs and the severity of underlying heart disorders .  Long-term treatment is not required when the index episode of ventricular tachycardia resulted from a transient cause (eg, during the 48 hours after onset of myocardial infarction) or a reversible cause (acid-base disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, proarrhythmic drug effect).  In the absence of a transient or reversible cause, patients who have had an episode of sustained VT typically require an ICD.  Most patients with sustained VT and a significant structural heart disorder should also receive a beta-blocker.  If an ICD cannot be used, amiodarone may be the preferred antiarrhythmic for prevention of sudden death.  Because nonsustained VT is a marker for increased risk of sudden death in patients with a structural heart disorder, such patients (particularly those with an ejection fraction < 0. 35) require further evaluation.  Such patients should receive an ICD.  When prevention of VTs is important (usually in patients who have an ICD and are having frequent episodes of VT), antiarrhythmics or transcatheter or surgical ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia. \n【9】 Any class Ia, Ib, Ic, II, or III antiarrhythmic drug Medications for Arrhythmias The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia. \n【10】 Because beta-blockers are safe, they are the first choice unless contraindicated.  If an additional drug is required, sotalol is commonly used, then amiodarone.  Transcatheter ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.  Key Points Any wide-complex (QRS ≥ 0. 12 second) tachycardia should be considered ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proved otherwise.  Patients who do not have a pulse should be cardioverted.  Synchronized cardioversion or antiarrhythmic drugs may be tried if the patient is stable.

Many changes are due to the development of heart disorders, which become more common with aging.  Other changes are due to aging itself.   As people age, the heart tends to enlarge slightly, developing thicker walls and slightly larger chambers.  The increase in size is mainly due to an increase in the size of individual heart muscle cells.  Thicker walls also become stiffer, which does not allow the chambers to fill with as much blood before each ventricle pumps. \n【1】 Obesity is influenced by a combination of factors, which usually results in consuming more calories than the body needs. \n【2】 During rest, the older heart functions in almost the same way as a younger heart, except the heart rate (number of times the heart beats within a minute) is slightly lower.  Also, during exercise, older people's heart rate does not increase as much as in younger people.  The walls of the arteries and arterioles become thicker, and the space within the arteries expands slightly.  Elastic tissue within the walls of the arteries and arterioles is lost.  Together, these changes make the vessels stiffer and less resilient  Since the arteries and arterioles are less elastic, blood pressure cannot adjust quickly when people stand, and older people are at risk for dizziness or in some cases fainting when they stand up suddenly.  Because arteries and arterioles become less elastic as people age, they cannot relax as quickly during the rhythmic pumping of the heart.  As a result, blood pressure increases more when the heart contracts (during systole)—sometimes above normal—than it does in younger people.  Abnormally high blood pressure during systole with normal blood pressure during diastole is very common among older people.

Ingestion, most common among children < 5 years, can result in aspiration pneumonitis.  Inhalation, most common among adolescents, can result in ventricular fibrillation, usually without warning symptoms.  Diagnosis of pneumonitis is by clinical evaluation, chest x-ray, and oximetry.  Gastric emptying is contraindicated because aspiration is a risk.  Treatment is supportive.   Ingestion of hydrocarbons, such as petroleum distillates (eg, gasoline, kerosene, mineral oil, lamp oil, paint thinners), results in minimal systemic effects but can cause severe aspiration pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs. \n【1】 Toxic potential mainly depends on viscosity, measured in Saybolt seconds universal (SSU).  Hydrocarbon liquids with low viscosity (SSU < 60), such as gasoline and mineral spirits, can spread rapidly over large surface areas and are more likely to cause aspiration pneumonitis than are hydrocarbons with SSU > 60, such as tar.  Hydrocarbons, if ingested in large amounts, may be absorbed systemically and cause central nervous system (CNS) or hepatic toxicity, which is more likely with halogenated hydrocarbons (eg, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene).  Recreational inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbons , called huffing or bagging, is common among adolescents.  It can cause euphoria and mental status changes and can sensitize the heart to endogenous catecholamines. \n【2】 Chronic toluene ingestion can cause long-term CNS toxicity, characterized by periventricular, occipital, and thalamic destruction.  Symptoms and Signs of Hydrocarbon Poisoning After ingestion of even a very small amount of liquid hydrocarbon, patients initially cough, choke, and may vomit.  Young children may have cyanosis, hold their breath, and cough persistently.  Older children and adults may report burning in the stomach.  Aspiration pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs. \n【3】 Symptoms and signs of pneumonitis may develop a few hours before infiltrates are visible on x-ray.  Substantial systemic absorption, particularly of a halogenated hydrocarbon, may cause lethargy, coma, and seizures.  Nonfatal pneumonitis usually resolves in about 1 week; mineral or lamp oil ingestion usually resolves in 5 to 6 weeks.  Arrhythmias usually occur before presentation and are unlikely to recur after presentation unless patients have excessive agitation.  Diagnosis of Hydrocarbon Poisoning Chest x-ray and oximetry done about 6 hours after ingestion If patients are too obtunded to provide a history, hydrocarbon exposure may be suspected if their breath or clothing has an odor or if a container is found near them.  Paint residue on the hands or around the mouth may suggest recent paint sniffing.  Diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs. \n【4】 If respiratory failure is suspected, arterial blood gases are measured.  Acute ingestion of hydrocarbons causes CNS depression and coma primarily.  Chronic exposure to certain hydrocarbons (n-hexane, MnBK) causes demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.  Strength is severely affected but sensation and reflexes may be minimally affected.  Central nervous system toxicity is diagnosed by neurologic examination and MRI.  Major MRI findings include atrophy, white matter T2-weighted hyperintensity, and basal ganglia and thalamic T2-weighted hypointensity.  Treatment of Hydrocarbon Poisoning Supportive care Avoidance of gastric emptying Any contaminated clothing is removed, and the skin is washed.

Diagnosis is by abdominal x-ray.  Treatment is surgical repair.   Neonates with jejunoileal atresia usually present late during day 1 or on day 2 with increasing abdominal distention, failure to pass stools, emesis, and feeding problems.  A history of polyhydramnios is common.  Etiology of Jejunoileal Atresia Jejunoileal atresias occur as a result of an ischemic insult during pregnancy.  The ischemic insult can be due to intussusception is telescoping of one portion of the intestine (intussusceptum) into an adjacent segment (intussuscipiens), causing intestinal obstruction and sometimes intestinal ischemia. \n【1】 Causes vary. \n【2】 Maternal smoking and cocaine use have been associated with intestinal atresia.  There is an estimated incidence of about 1 in 10,000 live births.  This disorder affects both sexes equally.  Jejunoileal atresias are equally distributed between the jejunum and ileum ,1 Etiology reference Jejunoileal atresia is incomplete formation of part of the small intestine. Associated congenital anomalies are less common with jejunoileal atresia than duodenal atresia The duodenum can be obstructed by atresia, stenosis, and pressure due to an extrinsic mass. \n【3】 The most common associated conditions are cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. \n【4】 Peritoneal calcifications suggest the presence of meconium peritonitis, which is a sign of intrauterine intestinal perforation and can be seen in about 10% of cases.  The presence of meconium peritonitis should raise suspicion of meconium ileus is obstruction of the terminal ileum by abnormally tenacious meconium; it most often occurs in neonates with cystic fibrosis. \n【5】1007/s11894-016-0490-4 Classification of Jejunoileal Atresia There are 5 major types of jejunoileal atresia: Type I consists of a membrane completely occluding the lumen with the intestine intact.  Type II is a gap in the intestine with a fibrous cord between the proximal and distal segments of intestine.  Type IIIA is a mesenteric gap without any connection between the segments.  Type IIIB is jejunal atresia with absence of the distal superior mesenteric artery; the distal small bowel is coiled like an apple peel, and the gut is short.  Type IV consists of multiple atretic segments (resembling a string of sausages).  Diagnosis of Jejunoileal Atresia Abdominal x-rays Plain abdominal x-rays are done; they may reveal dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels and a paucity of air in the colon and rectum.  A barium enema reveals a microcolon (due to disuse).  Because about 10% of patients also have cystic fibrosis (nearly 100% if meconium ileus is also present), testing for cystic fibrosis Diagnosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. \n【6】 Treatment of Jejunoileal Atresia Surgical repair Preoperative management of jejunoileal atresia consists of placing a nasogastric tube, giving nothing by mouth, and providing IV fluids.  Surgical repair is the definitive therapy.  During surgery, the entire intestine should be inspected for multiple areas of atresia.  The atretic portion is resected, usually with a primary anastomosis.  If the proximal portion of the ileum is extremely dilated and difficult to anastomose to the distal, unused part of the intestine, it is sometimes safer to do a double-barreled ileostomy and defer anastomosis until the caliber of the distended proximal intestine has diminished.  A procedure that tapers the dilated proximal loop is also a consideration ,1 Treatment references Jejunoileal atresia is incomplete formation of part of the small intestine. The prognosis for infants with jejunoileal atresia is very good with > 90% survival.  Prognosis is based on the length of remaining small bowel and the presence of the ileocecal valve.  Infants who subsequently develop short bowel syndrome is malabsorption resulting from extensive resection of the small bowel (usually more than two thirds the length of the small intestine). \n【7】 They should be provided continuous enteral feedings to promote gut adaptation, maximize absorption, and minimize the use of TPN.  Infants should also be provided small amounts of nutrition by mouth to maintain sucking and swallowing.  Prognosis for infants with ultrashort bowel syndrome has improved significantly because of newer surgical techniques including bowel-lengthening procedures (eg, serial transverse enteroplasty procedure or STEP), improved medical care, and the ability to do small bowel transplantation ,2 Treatment references Jejunoileal atresia is incomplete formation of part of the small intestine.  Key Points Jejunoileal atresia usually manifests in the first day or two of life with signs of bowel obstruction.

Affected children may be slow to learn names of colors or letters, to count, or to learn to read or write.  Children take a series of academic and intelligence tests given by learning specialists, and doctors may apply established criteria to make the diagnosis.  Treatment involves a learning plan tailored to the child’s skills.  Learning disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders Definition of Developmental Disorders are better called neurodevelopmental disorders. \n【1】 Learning disorders affect only certain functions, whereas in children with intellectual disability, difficulties affect cognitive functions broadly.  Three common types of learning disorders are Reading disorders of written expression Mathematics disorders Thus, children with learning disorders may have significant difficulty understanding and learning math, but have no difficulty reading, writing, and doing well in other subjects.  Dyslexia is a specific reading disorder involving difficulty separating single words from groups of words and parts of words (phonemes) within each word. \n【2】 Learning disorders do not include learning problems that are due primarily to problems of vision, hearing, coordination, or emotional disturbance, although these problems can also occur in children with learning disorders.  Children may be born with a learning disorder or develop one as they grow.  Although the causes of learning disorders are not fully understood, they include abnormalities in the basic processes involved in understanding or in using spoken or written language or numerical and spatial reasoning. \n【3】 Bilirubin is a yellow substance formed when hemoglobin .  After birth, possible factors include exposure to environmental toxins such as lead Poisoning affects many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, kidneys, liver, and blood. \n【4】 Traumatic events that occur during childhood, such as child abuse and maltreatment, also can contribute to the development of learning disorders.  Although the total number of children in the United States with learning disorders is unknown, in the 2019–2020 school year, 7. 3 million students (or 14% of all public school students) ages 3 to 21 in the United States received special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Among students receiving these special education services, 33% (or about 5% of all students) had specific learning disabilities.  Boys with learning disorders may outnumber girls five to one, although girls are often not recognized or diagnosed as having learning disorders.  Many children, particularly those with behavioral problems, do poorly in school and are tested by educational psychologists for learning disorders.  However, some children with certain types of learning disorders hide their deficits well, avoiding diagnosis and therefore treatment, for a long time.  arning disorders can occur in children with normal and high intellectual function.  Symptoms of Learning Disorders Young children may be slow to learn the names of colors or letters, to assign words to familiar objects, to count, and to progress in other early learning skills.  Learning to read and write may be delayed.  Other symptoms may be a short attention span and distractibility , speech/language problems, difficulty understanding spoken information, and a short memory span.  Affected children may have difficulty with activities that require fine motor coordination, such as printing and copying, and may have very messy handwriting or hold a pencil awkwardly.  Children who have a learning disorder may have trouble organizing or beginning tasks or retelling a story in sequential order, or confuse math symbols and misread numbers.  Children with learning disorders may have difficulty communicating.  Some children initially become frustrated and later develop behavioral problems, such as being easily distracted, hyperactive, withdrawn, shy, or aggressive. \n【5】 Diagnosis of Learning Disorders Educational, medical, and psychologic evaluations Established criteria Children who are not reading or learning at the level expected for their age should be evaluated.  Doctors examine children for any physical disorders that could interfere with learning, including doing hearing and vision tests.  Hearing and vision disorders should not be mistaken for a learning disorder.  Children take a series of intelligence tests, both verbal and nonverbal, and academic tests of reading, writing, and math skills.  Often these tests can be done by specialists at the child’s school, at the parents’ request.  In the United States and other nations, schools are required by law to provide testing and appropriate accommodations.  A psychologic evaluation is done to determine whether the child has emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression, or a developmental disorder, such as ADHD, because these disorders often coexist with a learning disability and can make the disability worse.  Psychologists ask about the child's attitude toward school and relationships and assess the child's self-esteem and self-confidence.  The following areas are evaluated, and these criteria are used to help determine whether a child has a learning disorder: Reading Understanding the meaning of written material Spelling Writing (for example, using proper grammar and punctuation, expressing ideas clearly) Understanding what numbers mean and their relationship to one another (in older children, doing simple calculations) Mathematical reasoning (for example, using mathematical concepts to solve problems) Children who are significantly below the level expected for their age in at least one of these areas for 6 months or longer despite treatment may have a learning disorder. \n【6】 Treatment of Learning Disorders Educational management Sometimes psychostimulant drugs The most useful treatment for a learning disorder is education that is carefully tailored to the individual child.  The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to provide free and appropriate education to children and adolescents with learning disorders.  Education must be provided in the least restrictive, most inclusive setting possible—that is, a setting where the children have every opportunity to interact with nondisabled peers and have equal access to community resources.  The Americans with Disability Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act also provide for accommodations in schools and other public settings. \n【7】 Measures such as eliminating food additives, taking large doses of vitamins, and analyzing the child’s system for trace minerals are often tried but unproved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#3#", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:19:23"}

A low potassium level has many causes but usually results from vomiting, diarrhea, adrenal gland disorders, or use of diuretics.  A low potassium level can make muscles feel weak, cramp, twitch, or even become paralyzed, and abnormal heart rhythms may develop.  The diagnosis is based on blood tests to measure the potassium level.  Usually, eating foods rich in potassium or taking potassium supplements by mouth is all that is needed.  ,See also Overview of Electrolytes Well over half of the body's weight is made up of water.  Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments. \n【1】 Potassium Overview of Potassium's Role in the Body Potassium is one of the body's electrolytes, which are minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in body fluids such as blood. \n【2】 Potassium is needed for cells, muscles, and nerves to function correctly.  Causes of Hypokalemia Typically, the potassium level becomes low because too much is lost from the digestive tract due to vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive laxative use.  Sometimes too much potassium is excreted in urine, usually because of drugs that cause the kidneys to excrete excess sodium, water, and potassium (diuretics).  In many adrenal disorders, such as Cushing syndrome In Cushing syndrome, the level of corticosteroids is excessive, usually due to taking corticosteroid drugs or overproduction by the adrenal glands. \n【3】 Certain drugs (such as insulin, albuterol, and terbutaline) cause more potassium to move from blood into cells and can result in hypokalemia.  However, these drugs usually cause temporary hypokalemia, unless another condition is also causing potassium to be lost.  Hypokalemia sometimes occurs with or is caused by a low level of magnesium in the blood .  Hypokalemia is rarely caused by consuming too little potassium because many foods (such as beans, dark leafy greens, potatoes, fish, and bananas) contain potassium.   Symptoms of Hypokalemia A slight decrease in the potassium level in blood usually causes no symptoms.  A larger decrease can cause muscle weakness, cramping, twitches, and even paralysis.  Abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart. \n【4】 They may develop even when the decrease is slight if people already have a heart disorder or take the heart drug digoxin.  If hypokalemia lasts for an extended time, kidney problems may develop, causing the person to urinate frequently and drink large amounts of water.  Diagnosis of Hypokalemia Measurement of potassium level in the blood Electrocardiography Sometimes measurement of amount of potassium in urine The diagnosis is made by measuring a low potassium level in the blood.  Doctors then try to identify what is causing the potassium level to decrease.  The cause may be clear based on the person’s symptoms (such as vomiting) or use of drugs or other substances.  If the cause is not clear, doctors measure how much potassium is excreted in urine to determine whether excess excretion is the cause.  Because low potassium levels can cause abnormal heart rhythms, doctors usually do electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded. \n【5】 Treatment of Hypokalemia Potassium supplements If a disorder is causing hypokalemia, it is treated.  Usually, potassium can be replaced by taking potassium supplements by mouth.  Because potassium can irritate the digestive tract, supplements should be taken in small doses with food several times a day rather than in a single large dose.  Special types of potassium supplements, such as wax-impregnated or microencapsulated potassium chloride, are much less likely to irritate the digestive tract.  To treat hypokalemia more rapidly, potassium is given by vein (intravenously) in the following situations: The potassium level is dangerously low.  The low level causes abnormal heart rhythms.  Supplements taken by mouth are ineffective.  People continue to lose more potassium than can be replaced using supplements taken by mouth.  Most people who take diuretics do not need to take potassium supplements.  Nevertheless, doctors periodically check the potassium level in blood so that supplements can be given if necessary.  Alternatively, diuretics that help the kidneys conserve potassium (potassium-sparing diuretics), such as amiloride, eplerenone, spironolactone, or triamterene can be used, but these drugs are used only if the kidneys are functioning normally.

The shoulder is painful when the arm is moved over the head and later, even when the arm is not moved.  Exercises help.  The rotator cuff consists of the muscles that attach the shoulder blade to the head of the humerus.  The rotator cuff strengthens the shoulder joint and helps rotate the upper arm.  Anatomy of a Shoulder Joint Rotator cuff pinching (impingement) and tendinitis often occur in sports that require the arms to be moved over the head repeatedly, such as pitching in baseball, lifting heavy weights over the shoulder, serving the ball in racket sports, and swimming freestyle, butterfly, or backstroke.  Repeatedly moving the arm over the head causes the top of the arm bone to pinch the rotator cuff muscles against the top part of the shoulder blade and can result in inflammation and swelling of the muscles.  If the movement is continued despite the inflammation, the tendon can weaken and tear.  Even without overuse and chronic inflammation, the rotator cuff can be torn suddenly by a powerful movement (such as a severe stretch or pull) or a fall.  Symptoms of Rotator Cuff Injury Shoulder pain is the main symptom.  At first, the pain occurs only during activities that require lifting the arm over the head (impingement syndrome).  Pain is worse when lifting the arm between 60 and 120° away from the side.  Unless effectively treated, the shoulder may later become painful at rest (tendinitis), often particularly at night, disrupting sleep.  If the tendon tears, normal outward turning of the arm at the shoulder is weak or impossible.  Diagnosis of Rotator Cuff Injury A doctor's evaluation Doctors make the diagnosis based on the person’s symptoms and examination findings.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sometimes is needed to rule out a tear of the rotator cuff muscles.  Treatment of Rotator Cuff Injury Rest Rehabilitation The shoulder can be rested by keeping the arm in a sling for a couple of days if pain is moderate or severe.  Exercises that involve raising the arm above the level of the shoulder, especially against resistance, should be avoided.  Once the shoulder can be moved through its range of motion without pain, the rotator cuff muscles can then be strengthened.  Exercises to strengthen some of the muscles restore balance to the rotator cuff and decrease impingement during activities that involve reaching overhead.  If the pain is severe, doctors may prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs or sometimes inject a corticosteroid into the space above the rotator cuff (bursa).  Surgery is sometimes needed when the rotator cuff is torn or tendinitis does not resolve with other treatments.  Surgery removes excess bone from the shoulder, creating a larger space for the rotator cuff and thus preventing pinching of the rotator cuff when the arm moves above the head.  If the rotator cuff is torn, surgical repair is usually recommended.  Exercises to Strengthen the Rotator Cuff Muscles Prone Shoulder Extension 1.  Lie on stomach with involved arm hanging off edge of bed with thumb pointed out away from body.  2.  Keep elbow straight and extend arm to trunk level while squeezing the scapula down and back.  3.

A postpartum infection is usually diagnosed after 24 hours have passed since delivery and the woman has had a temperature of 100. 4° F or higher on two occasions at least 6 hours apart.  Postpartum infections seldom occur because doctors try to prevent or treat conditions that can lead to infections.  However, infections, if they develop, may be serious.  Thus, if a woman has a temperature of more than 100. 4° F at any time during the first week after delivery, she should call the doctor.  Postpartum infections may be Directly related to delivery ,occurring in the uterus Infections of the Uterus After Delivery Infections that develop after delivery of a baby ( postpartum infections) usually begin in the uterus.

Your heart rate is how fast your heart beats.  Your heart should always have a regular, rhythmic beat, like the ticking of a clock.  What is an abnormal heart rhythm? Abnormal heart rhythms are heartbeats that are: Irregular Too fast (tachycardia) Too slow (bradycardia) Abnormal heart rhythms are also called arrhythmias.  Most common arrhythmias do not cause symptoms, are harmless, and do not need treatment Heart disorders are the most common cause of an abnormal heart rhythm You may feel fine, but sometimes you can feel your abnormal heart rhythm  Some abnormal heart rhythms make you feel weak or dizzy Doctors do an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity.  It's quick, painless, and harmless.  The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram. \n【1】 Your heart rhythm is controlled by: Pacemaker cells in your heart Your brain Hormones, minerals, and other substances in your blood There are special pacemaker cells in a part of your heart called the SA node (sinoatrial node).  Pacemaker cells send out regular electrical signals to your heart muscle to make it contract The pacemaker cells have their own natural rhythm of 60 to 100 signals per minute.  However, nerves from your brain can send messages to the cells telling them to speed up or slow down.  Your heart's conduction system has tiny strips of tissue sort of like electrical wires.  The conduction system carries the pacemaker signals to the rest of your heart The conduction system includes a gateway called the AV node (atrioventricular node).  The AV node controls how signals pass from the upper chambers of your heart (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles).  When the conduction system is working properly, the signals get to each of your heart muscle cells at just the right time so your heart gives a good, strong beat that pumps blood properly.  Hormones, such as thyroid hormone What are thyroid hormones? Your thyroid is a gland below the Adam’s apple in the front of your neck.  Glands make and release hormones.  Hormones stimulate other cells or tissues into action. \n【2】 Many drugs, medicines, and chemicals also affect your heart rhythm.  You also need the right balance of minerals  in your blood for your heart to beat properly.  What causes abnormal heart rhythms? Your heart rhythm can become abnormal if there's a problem with: Your pacemaker cells Your heart's conducting system Chemicals and drugs in your blood The most common cause of a heart rhythm problem is a heart disorder, such as: Coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) The heart is a muscle that pumps blood.  Like all muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of blood to work.  Blood that pumps through the heart doesn't feed the heart muscle. \n【3】 Your heart has four chambers.  The atria are the two upper chambers in your heart—the right atrium and the left atrium. \n【4】 Four heart valves control how blood flows in and out of your heart. \n【5】 Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. \n【6】 This can damage the pacemaker cells or the conducting system.  Other causes of abnormal heart rhythms include: Medicines Heart abnormalities you were born with Sometimes doctors can't tell what's causing your abnormal heart rhythm.  What are the symptoms of an abnormal heart rhythm? Your symptoms depend mainly on whether your heart is: Pumping enough blood Not pumping enough blood If your heart is pumping enough blood, you may feel normal.  Or you may feel like your heart is skipping beats (called palpitations).  Some people say strong palpitations may feel like a fish flopping around in their chest.  If your heart is not pumping enough blood, you also may have: Weakness Problems exercising Shortness of breath Feeling light-headed or dizzy Chest pain Fainting Go to the doctor if you have any of these symptoms.  How can doctors tell if I have an abnormal heart rhythm? Doctors feel your pulse and do: An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. \n【7】 Doctors then may have you: Wear a small device under your clothes that records your heart's electrical activity for a day or more  If doctors think you have a dangerous heart problem, they'll admit you to the hospital.  You'll be in a unit where your heart rate and rhythm can be recorded and seen by the nurses and doctors.  If doctors need more information about your abnormal heart rhythm, they may do: Electrophysiologic testing is used to evaluate serious abnormalities in heart rhythm or electrical conduction . \n【8】 The doctor puts a thin plastic tube (catheter) through an artery and into your heart. \n【9】 Doctors insert a thin flexible tube (catheter) into a large blood vessel (for example, one in your leg) and thread it up into your heart.  The catheter has electrodes on its tip that record your heart's electrical activity from the inside.  The catheter can also stimulate your heart electrically to see how it responds.  How do doctors treat abnormal heart rhythms? Some abnormal heart rhythms are harmless and don’t need treatment.  Sometimes, lifestyle changes help, such as: Changing or stopping one of your medicines Not drinking alcohol or caffeine Not smoking Not doing heavy exercise (if an abnormal heart rhythm happens during exercise) Different abnormal rhythms require different treatment.  Doctors may use: Medicines An artificial pacemaker (a small electrical device that doctors put in your chest or belly to signal your heart when to beat) An electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm (called cardioversion, defibrillation, or electroversion) A treatment called ablation to destroy the abnormal heart tissue Artificial pacemakers sometimes include a defibrillator so the same device can trigger a normal heart beat or stop an abnormal rhythm with a shock.  This combination device is called an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator).  Doctors do ablation if they find that one small bit of heart tissue is causing the abnormal rhythm.  Getting rid of the tissue often gets rid of the rhythm problem.  Often they do ablation during electrophysiologic testing.  They use a catheter to deliver a high-frequency electrical current that destroys a small area of the heart.  You may need to stop driving for a while until doctors know whether the treatment is working.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:18:25"}

Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.  Most pain relievers are effective for nociceptive pain (due to injury) but are less effective for neuropathic pain is caused by damage to or dysfunction of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain. \n【1】 For many types of pain, especially chronic pain is pain that lasts or recurs for months or years. \n【2】 In some cases, treating the underlying disorder eliminates or minimizes the pain.  For example, setting a broken bone in a cast or giving antibiotics for an infected joint helps reduce pain.  However, even if the underlying disorder can be treated, pain relievers may still be needed to quickly manage the pain.   in is often treated with a combination of drugs and nondrug treatments.  Drugs used to relieve pain fall into three categories: Nonopioid Opioid (narcotic) Adjuvant (drugs that are usually used to treat other problems such as seizures or depression but that can also relieve pain) Nonopioid Pain Relievers A variety of nonopioid pain relievers are available.  They are often effective for mild to moderate pain and sometimes for severe pain.  These drugs are often preferred for treating pain.  People do not become physically dependent on these drugs or tolerant of their pain-relieving effects.  Aspirin and acetaminophen are available without a prescription (over-the-counter, or OTC).  Several other nonopioid analgesics (such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) are available OTC, but higher doses may require a prescription.  OTC pain relievers are reasonably safe to take for short periods of time.  People should follow the instructions on the label for the maximum dose, frequency, and length of time the drug should be taken.  A doctor should be consulted if symptoms worsen or do not go away.  Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Many of the most commonly used nonopioid pain relievers are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are examples.  These drugs are usually used to treat mild to moderate pain.  NSAIDs not only relieve pain, but they may also reduce the inflammation that often accompanies and worsens pain.  NSAIDs are often taken by mouth.  Some NSAIDs (ketorolac diclofenac, and ibuprofen) can also be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly).  Indomethacin can be given as a rectal suppository.  Diclofenac is also available as a cream.  Although widely used, NSAIDs can have side effects, sometimes serious ones.  Problems in the digestive tract: All NSAIDs tend to irritate the stomach’s lining and cause digestive upset (such as heartburn, indigestion, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach pain), peptic ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices. \n【3】 Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors), a type of NSAID, are less likely to irritate the stomach and cause bleeding than other NSAIDs.  Taking NSAIDs with food and using antacids may help prevent stomach irritation.  The drug misoprostol can help prevent stomach irritation and ulcers, but it can cause other problems, including diarrhea.  Proton pump inhibitors Stomach acid plays a role in a number of disorders of the stomach, including peptic ulcer, gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \n【4】 Bleeding problems: All NSAIDs interfere with the clotting tendency of platelets (cell-like particles in the blood that help stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured).  Consequently, NSAIDs increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the digestive tract if they irritate the stomach’s lining.  Coxibs are less likely to cause bleeding than other NSAIDs.  Fluid retention or kidney problems: NSAIDs sometimes cause fluid retention and swelling.  Regular use of NSAIDs may also increase the risk of developing a kidney disorder, sometimes resulting in kidney failure (a disorder called analgesic nephropathy).  Increased risk of heart and blood vessel disorders: Studies suggest that with all NSAIDs except aspirin, the risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in the legs may be increased.  The risk appears to be higher with higher doses and longer use of the drug.  The risk is also higher with some NSAIDs than with others.  These problems may be related directly to the drug’s effect on clotting or indirectly to a small but persistent increase in blood pressure caused by the drug.  People who take NSAIDs for a long time are more likely to have these problems.  Such people need to have regular appointments with their doctor to check for high blood pressure, kidney failure, and ulcers or bleeding in the digestive tract and to evaluate their risk of heart disease and stroke.  Taking NSAIDs for a short time is unlikely to cause serious problems.  The risk of side effects may be increased for some groups of people, such as the following: Older people who drink alcoholic beverages regularly People with coronary artery disease, other heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disorders, or risk factors for these disorders Older people and people who have heart failure, high blood pressure, or a kidney or liver disorder require a doctor’s supervision when they take NSAIDs.  Some prescription heart and blood pressure drugs may not work as well when taken with NSAIDs.   taken for a long time, NSAIDs, including those available without a prescription, can have serious side effects.  NSAIDs vary in how quickly they work and how long they relieve pain.  Although NSAIDs are about equally effective, people respond to them differently.  One person may find a particular drug to be more effective or to have fewer side effects than another.  Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has been used for about 100 years.  Aspirin is taken by mouth and provides 4 to 6 hours of moderate pain relief.  Because aspirin can irritate the stomach, it may be combined with an antacid (called buffered) or coated so that it passes quickly through the stomach and dissolves when it reaches the small intestine (called enteric coated).  These products are intended to reduce stomach irritation.  However, buffered or enteric-coated aspirin can still irritate the stomach because aspirin also reduces the production of substances that help protect the stomach’s lining.  These substances are called prostaglandins.  Aspirin increases the risk of bleeding throughout the body because it makes platelets less able to function.  Platelets are cell fragments in the blood that help blood clot.  Anyone who has an increased tendency to bleed (a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia) or uncontrolled high blood pressure should not take aspirin except under a doctor’s supervision.  People who take aspirin and anticoagulants (drugs that make blood less likely to clot), such as warfarin, are closely monitored to avoid life-threatening bleeding.  Usually, aspirin should not be taken in the week before scheduled surgery.  Aspirin can aggravate asthma.  People with nasal polyps are likely to develop wheezing if they take aspirin.  A few people, who are sensitive (allergic) to aspirin, may have a severe allergic reaction , leading to a rash, itching, severe breathing problems, or shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow to the organs is low, decreasing delivery of oxygen and thus causing organ damage and sometimes death. \n【5】 Such a reaction requires immediate medical attention.  In very high doses, aspirin can have serious side effects such as abnormal breathing, fever, or confusion.  One of the first signs of an overdose may be noise in the ears .  Most children and teenagers should not take aspirin because they could develop Reye syndrome is a very rare but life-threatening disorder that causes inflammation and swelling of the brain and impairment and loss of function of the liver. \n【6】 Although rare, Reye syndrome can have serious consequences, including death.  Topical NSAIDs Some NSAIDs are available as creams or gels that are applied directly to the skin over the painful area.  For example, diclofenac gel can be applied to a joint to relieve pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. \n【7】 Diclofenac is also available as a patch, which can be used to relieve acute pain due to minor sprains, strains, and bruises.  Ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen are generally believed to be gentler on the stomach than aspirin, although few studies have compared the drugs.  Like aspirin, these drugs can cause digestive upset, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding.  They can make asthma worse and increase blood pressure.  Taking one of these drugs probably slightly increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and blood clots in the arteries of the legs.  The risk may be lower with naproxen than with other NSAIDs.  Thus, naproxen may be a better choice when people with a high risk of these disorders require NSAIDs.  Although ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen generally interfere with blood clotting less than aspirin does, people should not take these drugs with anticoagulants (such as warfarin) except under a doctor’s close supervision.  People who are allergic to aspirin may also be allergic to ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen.  If a rash, itching, breathing problems, or shock develops, medical attention is required immediately.  Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors) Coxibs, such as celecoxib, are a group of drugs that differ from other NSAIDs.  Other NSAIDs block the following two enzymes: COX-1, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins that protect the stomach and play a crucial role in blood clotting COX-2, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins that promote inflammation Coxibs tend to block mainly COX-2 enzymes.  Thus, coxibs are as effective as other NSAIDs in the treatment of pain and inflammation.  But coxibs are less likely to damage the stomach and to cause nausea, bloating, heartburn, bleeding, and peptic ulcers.  They are also less likely to interfere with clotting than are other NSAIDs.  Because of these differences, coxibs may be useful for people who cannot tolerate other NSAIDs and for people who are at high risk of certain complications (such as gastrointestinal bleeding) from use of other NSAIDs.  Such people include the following: Older people taking anticoagulants People with a history of ulcers People taking an analgesic for a long time However, coxibs, like other NSAIDs, appear to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in the legs.  As a result, before people with certain conditions are given a coxib, they are told about the risk and the need to be closely monitored.  These conditions include Cardiovascular disorders (such as coronary artery disease) Strokes Risk factors for these disorders Coxibs, like other NSAIDs, are not appropriate for people who have heart failure or who are at increased risk of heart failure (such as those who have had a heart attack).  How Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Work Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work in two ways: They reduce the sensation of pain.  At higher doses, they reduce the inflammation that often accompanies and worsens pain.  NSAIDs have these effects because they reduce the production of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins.  Different prostaglandins have different functions, such as making nerve cells more likely to respond to pain signals and causing blood vessels to widen (dilate).  Most NSAIDs reduce prostaglandin production by blocking both cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), which are crucial to the formation of prostaglandins.  One type of NSAID, the coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors), tend to block mainly COX-2 enzymes.  Only COX-2 enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins that promote inflammation Molecules and the resulting pain.  These prostaglandins are released in response to an injury—burn, break, sprain, strain, or invasion by a microorganism.  The result is inflammation, which is a protective response: The blood supply to the injured area increases, bringing in fluids and white blood cells to wall off the damaged tissue and remove any invading microorganisms.  Prostaglandins that are formed through the action of COX-1 enzymes help protect the digestive tract from stomach acid and play a crucial role in blood clotting.  Because most NSAIDs block COX-1 enzymes and thus reduce the production of these prostaglandins, they may irritate the stomach’s lining.  Such irritation can cause digestive upset, peptic ulcers, and bleeding in the digestive tract.  Because coxibs block mainly COX-2 enzymes, they are less likely to cause problems due to stomach irritation.  However, coxibs block some COX-1 enzymes, so even coxibs may slightly increase the risk of these problems.   Acetaminophen is roughly comparable to aspirin in its potential to relieve pain and lower a fever.  But unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen has the following characteristics: Has virtually no useful anti-inflammatory activity Does not affect the blood’s ability to clot Has almost no adverse effects on the stomach How acetaminophen works is not clearly understood.  Acetaminophen is taken by mouth or a suppository inserted into the rectum, and its effects generally last 4 to 6 hours.  Acetaminophen appears to be a very safe drug.  However, high doses can lead to liver damage, which may be irreversible .  People with a liver disorder should use lower doses than those usually prescribed.  Whether lower doses taken for a long time can harm the liver is less certain.  People who regularly consume large amounts of alcohol are probably at highest risk of liver damage from overuse of acetaminophen.  People who are taking acetaminophen and stop eating because of a bad cold, influenza, or another reason may be more vulnerable to liver damage.  Opioid Pain Relievers (analgesics)—sometimes called narcotics—are effective for many different types of pain.  Usually, they are the strongest pain relievers.  Opioids are chemically related to morphine, a natural substance extracted from poppies.  Some opioids are extracted from other plants, and other opioids are produced in a laboratory.  Opioids are often prescribed for a few days to treat severe pain that is likely to lessen quickly (such as pain due to injury or after surgery).  Doctors usually switch people to nonopioid pain relievers as soon as possible because opioids may have side effects and there is a risk of misuse or addiction.  Opioids are not usually recommended to treat people with chronic pain.  Doctors sometimes prescribe opioids for longer periods of time for people who have severe pain due to cancer or a terminal illness, especially as part of care at the end of life, including hospice care Hospice is a concept and a program of care that is specifically designed to minimize suffering for dying people and their family members. \n【8】 In these situations, side effects can usually be prevented or managed, and misuse or addiction is less of a concern.  Before prescribing opioids for any type of chronic pain, doctors consider What the usual treatment approach is Whether other treatments could be used Whether the person has a high risk of side effects from an opioid Whether the person is at risk of misuse or abuse of an opioid drug or is likely to use the drugs for other purposes (for example, to sell them) Doctors may refer people to a pain specialist or a mental health care practitioner who has expertise in substance misuse if the risk of having a problem is high.  For example, people who have had an addiction usually need such a referral.  When opioids are prescribed for chronic pain, doctors explain the nature of the person's disorder (if known) and the risks and benefits of other possible treatments, including nonopioid drugs and no treatment.  Doctors ask people about their goals and expectations.  They usually give the person written information that describes the risks of taking opioids.  After people discuss this information with their doctor and understand it, they are asked to sign an informed consent Before performing any invasive test or providing medical treatment, doctors must obtain permission from a competent patient in a manner that is informed and voluntary. \n【9】 When doctors prescribe an opioid for chronic pain, they explain the risks and side effects of opioids.  People are advised Not to drink alcohol or take antianxiety drugs or sleep aids when taking the opioid To take the recommended dose at the recommended times and not to change the dose To store the opioid in a safe, secure place Not to share the opioid with anyone To contact their doctor if the drug makes them drowsy or they have any other side effects (such as confusion, constipation, or nausea) To dispose of unused pills as directed To keep naloxone (an opioid antidote) on hand and to learn and teach family members how to administer it if an opioid overdose occurs If an opioid is prescribed, doctors have usual practices to ensure the person's safety.  Doctors typically ask the person to get opioid prescriptions only from one doctor and fill prescriptions at the same pharmacy every time.  They see the person frequently for follow-up visits and monitor the use of the drug to make sure it is safe and effective.  For example, doctors may periodically test the person's urine to determine whether the drug is being taken correctly.  They also ask the person to sign an agreement that specifies conditions required for opioid use, including any monitoring that may be needed.  To avoid misuse by others, the person should keep opioids in a safe place and dispose of any unused drugs by returning them to the pharmacy.  Side effects of opioids have many side effects.  Side effects are more likely to occur in people with certain disorders: kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).  Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【10】 The following commonly occur when opioids are used: Drowsiness Mental fuzziness or confusion Nausea and vomiting Constipation Less common side effects of opioids include Retention of urine Involuntary contraction of muscles  Itching A dangerous slowing of breathing Death Drowsiness is a common side effect of opioids.  For some people who take opioids, drowsiness disappears or decreases within a few days.  If people continue to feel drowsy, a different opioid can be tried because the degree of drowsiness caused by different opioids varies.  Before an important event that requires alertness, people may be given a stimulant drug (such as methylphenidate or modafinil) to offset the drowsiness.  For some people, drinking a caffeinated beverage helps offset the drowsiness.  When feeling drowsy after taking an opioid, people should avoid driving and take extra care to prevent falls and accidents.  Confusion can also result from taking opioids, especially if people are older.  Opioids increase the risk of falls in older people.  Nausea sometimes occurs in people with pain, and opioids can increase the nausea.  Antiemetic drugs taken by mouth, suppository, or injection help prevent or relieve nausea.  Some commonly used antiemetic drugs are metoclopramide, hydroxyzine, and prochlorperazine.  The itching caused by taking opioids may be relieved by an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine, taken by mouth or given intravenously.  Constipation in Adults Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation). \n【11】 Stimulant laxatives Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation). \n【12】 Increasing the intake of fluids and the amount of fiber in the diet can also help.  Osmotic agents Laxatives such as polyethylene glycol can also be useful.  These agents pull large amounts of water into the large intestine to stimulate bowel movements.  Some people need enemas.  When these measures are not effective, doctors may prescribe a drug (such as methylnaltrexone) that blocks only the effects of opioids in the stomach and intestine and does not lessen the pain relief.  Retention of urine Urinary Retention is inability to urinate or incomplete emptying of the bladder.  People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence. \n【13】 Trying to urinate a second time after a brief pause (double voiding) or applying gentle pressure on the lowest part of the abdomen (the area over the bladder) during urination may help.  Sometimes a drug that relaxes muscles of the bladder (such as tamsulosin) is used.  For most people, nausea and itching disappear or decrease within a few days.  But constipation and retention of urine usually decrease much more slowly, if at all.  Serious side effects can occur when people take too much of an opioid.  These side effects include a dangerous slowing of breathing (respiratory depression), coma, and even death.  The following adds to the risk of developing respiratory depression and of dying from respiratory arrest: Having certain conditions (such as liver, kidney, respiratory, or mental health disorders) Having a substance use disorder Substance Use Disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【14】 For people who are at increased risk of opioid side effects (including respiratory depression), doctors may prescribe naloxone when they prescribe the opioid.  Nurses and family members or caregivers should watch for serious side effects of opioids and, if such side effects occur, be ready to inject naloxone or spray it into the person's nose.  Doctors or pharmacists usually teach the person taking the opioid and family members or caregivers how to administer naloxone.  Tolerance is a person's diminished response to a drug, which occurs when the drug is used repeatedly and the body adapts to the continued presence of the drug. \n【15】 They need higher doses because their body adapts to and thus responds less well to the drug.  However, for most people, the same opioid dose remains effective for a long time.  Often, the need for a higher dose means that the disorder is worsening, not that tolerance is developing.  Physical dependence Long-term effects Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【16】 That is, they experience withdrawal symptoms if the drug is stopped.  Withdrawal symptoms Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【17】 When opioids are stopped after long-term use, doctors reduce the dose gradually over a period of time to minimize the development of such symptoms.  Physical dependence is not the same as opioid use disorder Substance Use Disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【18】 Dependence is characterized by a craving for the drug and compulsive, uncontrolled use of the drug despite the harm done to the user or other people.  Most people who take opioids to control pain and have not previously had problems with drug abuse do not become addicted to opioids.  Nonetheless, doctors regularly monitor people who are taking opioid analgesics for signs of addiction.  Administration of opioids When possible, opioids are taken by mouth .  When opioids are taken by mouth, the dose and time they are taken can be adjusted more easily.  When they need to be taken for a long time, they may be given by mouth or through a patch placed on the skin .  Opioids are given by injection routes Drugs are introduced into the body by several routes. \n【19】 Some people who need to take opioids for a long time and are helped by an opioid taken by mouth cannot tolerate its side effects.  For these people, an opioid can be injected directly into the space around the spinal cord through a pump (intrathecally Injection routes ).  Problems with use of opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【20】 Problems with using opioids include opioid misuse, diversion, and abuse.  Opioid misuse may be intentional or unintentional.  It includes any use that differs from what is prescribed.  Diversion involves selling or giving a prescribed drug to others.  Abuse refers to recreational use of the drug.  That is, the drugs are taken for the feelings of pleasure or sensations they produce, rather than to treat pain or another medical condition.  Up to one third of people taking opioids for a long time to treat chronic pain misuse them.  Opioid use disorder Substance Use Disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【21】 It refers to compulsive use of opioids despite having problems caused by taking them.  Also, people who have this disorder may require higher and higher doses to achieve the same effects and may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the opioid.  They may try to stop taking opioids or reduce the amount they are taking but cannot.  Taking high doses of opioids for a long time increases the risk of developing opioid use disorder.  Adjuvant Analgesics are drugs that are usually used to treat other disorders, but can also relieve pain.  Adjuvant analgesics are thought to work by changing the way nerves process pain.  An adjuvant analgesic is the first and only drug used to treat pain due to nerve damage  and conditions such as fibromyalgia is characterized by poor sleep, fatigue, mental cloudiness, and widespread aching and stiffness in soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments. \n【22】 The adjuvant analgesics most commonly used for pain are Antidepressants Drug Treatment for Depression Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【23】 Tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine) may be more effective for this purpose than other antidepressants, but newer antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, including duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran) may have fewer of the side effects that limit how much of the drug can be taken.  Tricyclic antidepressants are effective for neuropathic pain is caused by damage to or dysfunction of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain. \n【24】 Headaches are one of the most common reasons people visit a doctor. \n【25】 It may be present all the time (chronic) or come and go (recurring). \n【26】 Pain that occurs externally in the genital area (vulva, or labia) is called vulvar pain. \n【27】 The doses of tricyclic antidepressants used to treat pain are usually too low to treat depression or anxiety.  Thus, if tricyclic antidepressants are used to treat pain, additional drugs are usually needed to treat depression or anxiety if present.  Duloxetine appears to be effective for neuropathic pain due to diabetes ,called diabetic neuropathy Nerve damage in diabetes People with diabetes mellitus have many serious long-term complications that affect many areas of the body, particularly the blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys. fibromyalgia is characterized by poor sleep, fatigue, mental cloudiness, and widespread aching and stiffness in soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments. \n【28】 The doses of duloxetine used to treat pain are also adequate to treat depression or anxiety if present.  Venlafaxine has similar effects.  Milnacipran is effective for fibromyalgia.  People may respond to one antidepressant and not to others, so sometimes doctors try a few drugs until an effective one is found.  Antiseizure drugs may be used to relieve neuropathic pain.  Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used, but many others, including carbamazepine, clonazepam, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, topiramate, and zonisamide, help relieve pain in some people.  Gabapentin can be used to treat the pain that can result from shingles  and many other types of neuropathic pain is caused by damage to or dysfunction of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain. \n【29】 Pregabalin can be used to relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia is characterized by poor sleep, fatigue, mental cloudiness, and widespread aching and stiffness in soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  postherpetic neuralgia, or neuropathic pain due to a problem in the brain or spinal cord.  Antiseizure drugs, such as topiramate, can prevent migraine headaches Migraines A migraine headache is typically a pulsating or throbbing pain that ranges from moderate to severe.  It can affect one or both sides of the head. \n【30】 Anesthetics A local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, may be injected into the skin to control pain due to an injury or even neuropathic pain.  Local anesthetics can also be injected around nerves to block pain—a procedure called a nerve block.  It is often used to treat pain caused by damage to a specific large nerve.  For example, a sympathetic nerve block Nondrug Pain Treatments Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【31】 (A sympathetic nerve block can relieve pain caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for stressful or emergency situations. ) Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine applied as a lotion, an ointment, or a skin patch, can be used to control pain due to some conditions.  Mexiletine, used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, is sometimes used to treat neuropathic pain.  These anesthetics are usually used for a short period of time.  For example, rinsing with small amounts of an anesthetic mouthwash a few times a day can relieve pain due to mouth sores.  However, some people with chronic pain benefit from using topical anesthetics for a long time.  For example, a lidocaine patch or gel can help relieve postherpetic neuralgia is chronic pain in areas of skin supplied by nerves infected with herpes zoster ( shingles). \n【32】 Other drugs Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone, can be taken by mouth if severe pain is caused by inflammation (as occurs in gout).  Some evidence suggests that baclofen (a muscle relaxant) can help relieve neuropathic pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is severe facial pain due to malfunction of the 5th cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). \n【33】 Pamidronate (used to treat certain bone disorders) can help relieve neuropathic pain due to complex regional pain syndrome is chronic neuropathic pain characterized by persistent burning or aching pain plus certain abnormalities that occur in the same area as the pain. \n【34】 Low doses of ketamine (an anesthetic) are sometimes given intravenously in a hospital to people who have complex regional pain syndrome when other treatments are ineffective.  Tizanidine (a muscle relaxant), taken by mouth, and clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a patch, can help relieve neuropathic pain is caused by damage to or dysfunction of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain. \n【35】 High-strength capsaicin (a substance found in hot peppers), given in a patch, helps relieve neuropathic pain due to postherpetic neuralgia.  A low-strength capsaicin cream may also help reduce the pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia and by other disorders such as osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. \n【36】 The cream is most often used by people with localized pain due to arthritis.  This cream must be applied several times a day.  Nondrug Pain Treatments In addition to drugs, many other treatments can help relieve pain.  Applying cold or warm compresses directly to a painful area often helps .  Neuromodulation methods use electric stimulation include to change how nerves process pain.  Techniques include the following: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) Spinal cord stimulation Peripheral nerve stimulation Physical or occupational therapy may be used to relieve chronic pain and help people function better.  Sometimes doing exercises or increasing activity level helps.  For example, walking regularly can help relieve lower back pain more effectively than resting in bed. \n【37】 How acupuncture works is poorly understood, and some experts still doubt the technique’s effectiveness.  Some people find substantial relief with acupuncture, at least for a time.  Biofeedback, a type of mind-body medicine, is a method of bringing unconscious biologic processes under conscious control. \n【38】 In one distraction technique, people may learn to visualize themselves in a calm, comforting place (such as in a hammock or on a beach) when they feel pain.  Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce pain and pain-related disability and help people cope.  This type of therapy includes counseling to help people focus on coping with the pain, rather than on its effects and limitations.  It may include counseling to help people and their family work together to manage pain.  The importance of psychologic support for people in pain should not be underestimated.  Friends and family members should be aware that people in pain suffer, need support, and may develop depression and anxiety, which may require psychologic counseling.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:16:07"}

It is one of the most common reasons people see doctors who specialize in skin disorders (dermatologists).  Itching makes people want to scratch.  Scratching temporarily relieves itching but can damage the skin, sometimes resulting in more itching (the itch–scratch cycle) or infection (called a secondary infection).  Over time, the skin can become thick and scaly (called lichenification).  Causes of Itching can result from Skin disorders of other organs (systemic disorders) Disorders of the nervous system Psychologic disorders Drugs, medications, and chemicals In many skin and systemic allergic disorders, itching is caused by histamine.  Histamine is a chemical in the body that is stored in mast cells. \n【1】 When mast cells are stimulated by various allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction), they release histamine.  When histamine is released into the blood, it can cause many symptoms, including itching and inflammation. \n【2】 Skin disorders The most common causes of itching are skin disorders: Dry skin ,see xeroderma Dry Skin (Xeroderma) Xeroderma is ordinary dry skin.   Normal skin owes its soft, pliable texture to its water content. \n【3】 Systemic disorders are less common causes of itch than skin disorders.  Some of the more common systemic causes of itching are Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【4】 Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. \n【5】 White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. \n【6】 Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. \n【7】 Disorders of the nervous system Irritation of sensory nerves, for example, when a nerve is compressed, can cause itching localized to the part of the body supplied by that nerve.  In contrast, some disorders that affect the nervous system may cause widespread (generalized) itching because itch neurons (one type of nerve cell) are too active or are less inhibited by other neurons.  For example, in multiple sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed. \n【8】 This process makes the itch neurons less inhibited and thus more active.  Itch that results from nervous system disorders is called neuropathic itch.  Psychologic disorders Some people who have psychologic disorders may have itching for which no physical cause can be found.  This type of itching is called psychogenic itching.  Drugs, medications, and chemicals Drugs, including medications, and chemicals can cause itching when taken internally or when applied to the skin.  Usually the itching is caused by an allergic reaction.  A few drugs, such as morphine and some radiopaque contrast agents Procedure for CT used when taking certain x-rays, can also cause itching without causing an allergic reaction.  Evaluation of Itching Not every episode of itching requires immediate evaluation by a doctor.  The following information can help people decide whether a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Most conditions that cause itching are not serious.  Warning signs The following may indicate that the cause could be serious: Weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats may indicate a serious infection or a tumor.  Weakness, numbness, or tingling may indicate a nervous system disorder.  Abdominal pain or a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes ,jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.   may indicate a gallbladder or liver disorder.  Excessive thirst, abnormally frequent urination, and weight loss may indicate diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【9】 When to see a doctor People who have weight loss, fatigue, or night sweats should see a doctor as soon as possible.  People who have any of the other warning signs or severe itching should probably see a doctor immediately.  What the doctor does Doctors ask many questions and look at the skin.  Often, a person needs to undress so that the entire skin surface can be checked.  If no clear cause is found after checking the skin, doctors may do a complete physical examination to check for systemic causes.  Testing may be necessary to diagnose certain systemic causes and sometimes skin disorders.  If itching is widespread and begins shortly after use of a drug or medication, that drug or medication may be the cause.  If itching (usually with a rash) is confined to an area that was in contact with a substance, particularly if the substance is known to cause contact dermatitis is skin inflammation caused by direct contact with a particular substance. \n【10】 However, allergic causes of widespread itching can be difficult to identify because affected people have usually eaten several different foods and have been exposed to many substances that could cause an allergic reaction before itching develops.  Similarly, identifying a drug that is causing the reaction in a person taking several drugs may be difficult.  Sometimes the person has been taking the drug or medication causing the reaction for months or even years before a reaction occurs.   Testing Most causes of itching can be diagnosed without testing.  If the diagnosis of a skin abnormality is not clear from its appearance and the person's history, removal  of a skin sample may be necessary so that it can be analyzed.  If the cause of itching seems to be an allergic reaction but the substance causing the allergic reaction is not evident, skin testing may be necessary.  In skin testing, substances that can cause allergic reactions on contact are applied to the skin in a patch (called patch testing Skin tests ).  If the cause seems not to be an allergic reaction or skin disorder, testing is done based on the person's other symptoms.  For example, tests may be done for gallbladder or liver disorders, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disorders, diabetes, or cancer.  Treatment of Itching Skin care Topical treatments Systemic treatments The most important aspect of treating itch is to address the cause.  In addition, other measures can help relieve itching.  Skin care If itching is caused by dry skin, modifications to basic skin care are often very effective.  Dryness is often caused by excessive bathing and washing.  Skin care adjustments should include bathing or washing less frequently, using lukewarm instead of hot water, and using less soap.  Excessive rubbing of dry skin should be avoided, and a moisturizing cream should be applied after bathing or washing.  In addition, humidifying dry air (for example, in winter) and not wearing wool clothing can also help.  Topical treatments are substances that are applied to the skin, such as creams and lotions. \n【11】 Corticosteroid creams, lotions, and ointments should be used only when the skin is inflamed, such as when a person has a rash.  They should usually not be used when The skin is infected.  An infestation is present.  The cause is systemic.  Itch-relieving topical treatments that do not address a specific cause can also be given and include lotions or creams that contain menthol, camphor, pramoxine, or capsaicin.  Creams and lotions that contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine or the anesthetic benzocaine are not recommended.  Exposure to ultraviolet light at a doctor's office or in the home  can often help lessen itchy skin disorders.  It also often helps relieve itching without a rash (caused by various disorders) when other treatments are unsuccessful.  Systemic treatments are medications that are taken internally by mouth or by injection.  They are used if itching is widespread or if topical treatments are ineffective.  Antihistamines Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions) are inappropriate responses of the immune system to a normally harmless substance. \n【12】 Some antihistamines, such as cyproheptadine, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine, cause drowsiness.  They help relieve itching and, when used before bedtime, aid in sleep.  Helping people sleep is important because severe itch can affect sleep and thus greatly decrease well being.  Because they can cause drowsiness, these medications are usually not given during the day.  In addition, they should also be used selectively and carefully by older people because older people are at higher risk of falling.  Cetirizine and loratadine cause less drowsiness but rarely can have this effect in older people.  Fexofenadine causes less drowsiness but sometimes causes a headache.  Doxepin makes people very drowsy and is effective, so it can be taken at bedtime if itching is severe.  Cholestyramine is used to treat itching caused by certain gallbladder or liver disorders.  However, cholestyramine has an unpleasant taste, causes constipation, and can decrease absorption of other medications.  Gabapentin, an antiseizure medication Antiseizure drugs In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction. \n【13】 Key Points Itching can result from a variety of different causes, and each cause requires different treatment.  If the person has no rash or skin abnormalities, the cause may be a systemic disorder, a nerve problem, or a drug or medication reaction.  Skin care measures (such as limiting bathing, moisturizing the skin, and humidifying the air) help relieve itching when it is caused by dry skin.  Itching can usually be relieved by topical or systemic treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 17:34:12"}

Blood may be easily seen by the naked eye (overt), or blood may be present in amounts too small to be visible (occult).  Occult bleeding is detected only by testing a stool specimen with special chemicals Stool Occult Blood Tests Bleeding in the digestive system can be caused by something as insignificant as a little irritation or as serious as cancer. \n【1】 Hematemesis is blood that is visible in vomit (hematemesis), which indicates the bleeding is coming from the upper GI tract, usually from the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine.  When blood is vomited, it may be bright red if bleeding is brisk and ongoing.  Alternatively, vomited blood may have the appearance of coffee grounds.  It results from bleeding that has slowed or stopped, and the blood looks like coffee grounds because it has been partially digested by acid in the stomach.  Blood may also be passed from the rectum: As black, tarry stools (melena) As bright red blood (hematochezia) In apparently normal stool if bleeding is less than a few teaspoons per day Melena is more likely when bleeding comes from the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.  The black color of melena is caused by blood that has been exposed for several hours to stomach acid and enzymes and to bacteria that normally reside in the large intestine.  Melena may continue for several days after bleeding has stopped.  Hematochezia is more likely when bleeding comes from the large intestine, although it can be caused by very rapid bleeding from the upper portions of the digestive tract as well.  People who have lost only a small amount of blood may feel well otherwise.  However, serious and sudden blood loss may be accompanied by a rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and reduced urine flow.  A person may also have cold, clammy hands and feet.  Severe bleeding may reduce the flow of blood to the brain, causing confusion, disorientation, sleepiness, and even extremely low blood pressure .  Slow, chronic blood loss may cause symptoms and signs of low blood count , such as weakness, easy fatigue, paleness (pallor), chest pain, and dizziness.  People with underlying ischemic heart disease may develop chest pain (angina) or a have a heart attack (myocardial infarction) because of decreased blood flow through the heart.   Causes of Gastrointestinal Bleeding The causes of GI bleeding are divided into three areas: Upper GI tract Lower GI tract Small intestine , Home.  The most common causes are difficult to specify because causes vary by the area that is bleeding and the person's age.  However, in general, the most common causes of upper GI bleeding are Ulcers or erosions of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices. \n【2】 Esophageal varices are caused by high blood pressure in blood vessels in and around the liver  A tear in the lining of the esophagus after vomiting  The most common causes of lower GI bleeding are Polyps of the large intestine Polyps of the Colon and Rectum A polyp is a projecting growth of tissue from the wall of a hollow space, such as the intestines.  Some polyps are caused by hereditary conditions. \n【3】 The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure. \n【4】 Abdominal pain and bloody stools are common. \n【5】 Bleeding from the small intestine is rare but can result from blood vessel abnormalities, tumors, or a Meckel diverticulum A Meckel diverticulum is a saclike outpouching of the wall of the small intestine that is present in some children at birth. \n【6】 Bleeding from any cause is more likely, and potentially more severe, in people who have chronic liver disease Overview of Liver Disease can manifest in many different ways. \n【7】 Liver disease makes bleeding more likely because a poorly functioning liver produces fewer of the proteins that help blood clot .  Drugs that can cause or worsen bleeding include anticoagulants (such as heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban), those that affect platelet function (such as aspirin and certain other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and clopidogrel), and those that affect the stomach's protective barrier against acid (such as NSAIDs).  Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Bleeding GI bleeding typically requires evaluation by a doctor.  The following information can help people decide when a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs In people with GI bleeding, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.  They include Fainting Light-headedness (near syncope) is a sense that one is about to faint. \n【8】 If people with such findings have no warning signs and feel otherwise well, a delay of a day or two is not harmful.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the GI bleeding and the tests that may need to be done , Home.  The history is focused on finding out exactly where the bleeding is coming from, how rapid it is, and what is causing it.  Doctors need to know how much blood (for instance, a few teaspoons or several clots) is being passed and how often blood is being passed.  People with hematemesis are asked whether blood was passed the first time they vomited or only after they vomited a few times with no blood.  Doctors ask people with rectal bleeding whether pure blood was passed; whether it was mixed with stool, pus, or mucus; or whether blood simply coated the stool.  People with bloody diarrhea are asked about recent travel or other possible forms of exposure to other agents that can cause digestive tract illness (for instance, food poisoning).  Doctors then ask about symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and easy bleeding or bruising and symptoms of anemia (such as weakness, easy exhaustion [fatigability], and dizziness).  Doctors need to know about any current or past digestive tract bleeding and the results of any previous colonoscopy (examination of the entire large intestine, the rectum, and the anus using a flexible viewing tube).  People should tell doctors whether they have inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea. \n【9】 The physical examination is focused on the person’s vital signs (such as pulse, breathing rate, blood pressure, and temperature) and other indicators of shock or a decrease in the volume of circulating blood (hypovolemia—rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, pallor, sweating, little urine production, and confusion) and anemia.  Doctors also look for small purplish red (petechiae) and bruise-like (ecchymoses) spots on the skin, which are signs of bleeding disorders.  Doctors also look for signs of chronic liver disease ,such as spider angiomas, fluid in the abdominal cavity , ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen. \n【10】 Doctors do a rectal examination to look at stool color and check it for blood and to search for tumors and fissures Anal Fissure An anal fissure is a tear or ulcer in the lining of the anus (the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body). \n【11】 Doctors also examine the anus to look for hemorrhoids are dilated, twisted blood vessels located in the wall of the lower rectum and anus. \n【12】  Testing The need for tests depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination, particularly whether warning signs are present.  There are four main testing approaches to GI bleeding: Blood tests and other laboratory studies Upper endoscopy for suspected upper GI tract bleeding Colonoscopy for lower GI tract bleeding (unless clearly caused by hemorrhoids) Angiography if bleeding is rapid or severe The person’s blood count helps indicate how much blood has been lost.  A low platelet count is a risk factor for bleeding.  Other blood tests include prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and liver tests, all of which help detect problems with blood clotting.  Doctors often do not do blood tests on people who have minor bleeding caused by hemorrhoids.  If the person has vomited blood or dark material (which may represent partially digested blood), the doctor sometimes passes a small, hollow plastic tube through the person’s nose down into the stomach  and suctions out the stomach contents.  Bloody or pink contents indicate active upper GI bleeding, and dark or coffee-ground material indicates that bleeding is slow or has stopped.  Sometimes, there is no sign of blood even though the person was bleeding very recently.  A nasogastric tube may be inserted in anyone who has not vomited but has passed a large amount of blood from the rectum (if not from an obvious hemorrhoid) because this blood may have originated in the upper digestive tract.  If the nasogastric tube reveals signs of active bleeding, or the person’s symptoms strongly suggest the bleeding is originating in the upper digestive tract, the doctor usually does upper endoscopy.  Upper endoscopy is an examination of internal structures using a flexible viewing tube (endoscope). \n【13】 An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to see the bleeding source and often treat it and is often done without a nasogastric tube being passed.  People with symptoms typical of hemorrhoids may need only sigmoidoscopy (examination of the lower part of the large intestine, the rectum, and anus using an endoscope).  All other people with hematochezia should have colonoscopy (examination of the entire large intestine, the rectum, and the anus using an endoscope).  Occasionally, endoscopy (both upper and lower) and colonoscopy do not show the cause of bleeding.  There are still other options for finding the source of the bleeding.  Doctors may do endoscopy of the small bowel (enteroscopy).  If bleeding is rapid or severe, doctors sometimes do angiography In angiography, x-rays are used to produce detailed images of blood vessels. \n【14】 During angiography, doctors use a catheter to inject an artery with a contrast agent that can be seen on x-rays.  Angiography helps doctors diagnose upper digestive tract bleeding and allows them to do certain treatments .  Doctors may also inject the person with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker .  With the use of a special scanning camera, the radioactive marker can sometimes show the approximate location of the bleeding.  Before doing angiography or surgery, doctors may also do a test called CT angiography In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【15】 During this procedure, a type of imaging called computed tomography (CT) and a radiopaque contrast agent are used to produce images of blood vessels and sometimes can show the location of the bleeding.  Doctors may do a small-bowel follow-through, which is a series of detailed x-rays of the small intestine.  Another option is video capsule endoscopy (wireless video endoscopy) is a procedure in which the person swallows a battery-powered capsule. \n【16】 Video capsule endoscopy is especially useful in the small intestine, but it is not very useful in either the colon or stomach because these organs are easier to see using endoscopy.  Treatment of Gastrointestinal Bleeding There are two goals to treating people with GI bleeding: Replace lost blood with fluid given by vein (intravenously) and sometimes with a blood transfusion Stop any ongoing bleeding Hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena should be considered an emergency.  People with severe GI bleeding should be admitted to an intensive care unit Types of units People who need specific types of care may be put in special care units.  Intensive care units (ICUs) are for people who are seriously ill. \n【17】 Replacing fluids and blood People with sudden, severe blood loss require intravenous fluids and sometimes an emergency blood transfusion Overview of Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or a blood component from one healthy person (a donor) to a sick person (a recipient). \n【18】 Stopping the bleeding Most GI bleeding stops without treatment.  Sometimes, however, it does not.  The type and location of bleeding tells the doctors what treatment to use.  For example, doctors can often stop peptic ulcer bleeding during endoscopy by using a device that uses an electrical current to produce heat (electrocautery), heater probes, or injections of certain drugs.  If endoscopy does not stop the bleeding, surgery may be needed.  For esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, which can cause major bleeding. \n【19】 People with esophageal varices may be given injections of the drug octreotide to help stop the bleeding.  Antibiotics may also be given.  Doctors can sometimes control severe, ongoing lower GI bleeding caused by diverticula or angiodysplasias during colonoscopy by using clips, an electrocautery device, coagulation with a heater probe, or injection with epinephrine.  Polyps can be removed by a wire snare or electrocautery.  If these methods do not work or are impossible, doctors do angiography Testing during which they may pass a catheter into the bleeding vessel and then inject a chemical, fragments of a gelatin sponge, or a wire coil to block the blood vessel and thereby stop the bleeding (embolization) or inject vasopressin to reduce blood flow to the bleeding vessel.  People with continued bleeding may need surgery, so it is important for doctors to know the location of the bleeding site.  Doctors may give people with upper GI bleeding a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) by vein (intravenously) to help control the bleeding.  Internal hemorrhoid bleeding stops spontaneously in most cases.  For people whose bleeding does not stop without treatment, doctors do anoscopy and may place rubber bands around the hemorrhoids or inject them with substances that stop bleeding or do electrocautery or surgery .  Essentials for Older People In older people, hemorrhoids are dilated, twisted blood vessels located in the wall of the lower rectum and anus. \n【20】 Peptic ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices. \n【21】 Bleeding from enlarged veins in the esophagus ,esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, which can cause major bleeding.  Esophageal varices are caused by high blood pressure in blood vessels in and around the liver  is less common than in younger people.  Older people poorly tolerate massive GI bleeding.  Doctors must diagnosis older people quickly, and treatment must be started sooner than in younger people, who can better tolerate repeated episodes of bleeding.  Key Points about Gastrointestinal Bleeding Rectal bleeding may result from upper or lower GI bleeding.  Most people stop bleeding spontaneously.  Endoscopy is usually the first treatment choice for people whose bleeding will not stop without treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:46:26"}

Depending on when they are born, preterm newborns have underdeveloped organs, which may not be ready to function outside of the uterus.  A previous preterm birth, multiple births, poor nutrition during pregnancy, late prenatal care, infections, assisted reproductive techniques (such as in vitro fertilization), and high blood pressure can increase the risk of a preterm birth.  Because many organs are underdeveloped, preterm newborns may have difficulty breathing and feeding and are prone to bleeding in the brain, infections, and other problems.  The earliest and smallest preterm newborns are at far greater risk of having problems, including developmental problems.  Although some preterm newborns grow up with permanent problems, the majority of survivors have mild or no long-term problems.  Early prenatal care may decrease the risk of a preterm birth.  Preterm birth can sometimes be delayed for a brief period by giving the mother medications to slow or stop contractions.  When an infant is expected to be delivered significantly early, doctors can give the mother injections of a corticosteroid to speed the development of the fetus’s lungs and help prevent bleeding in the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage).   Gestational age refers to how far along the fetus is.  The gestational age is the number of weeks between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery.  This time frame is often adjusted according to other information doctors receive, including the results of early ultrasound scans, which give additional information regarding the gestational age.  The baby is estimated to be due (the due date) at 40 weeks of gestation.  Newborns are classified by gestational age as preterm if they are delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.  Preterm infants are further categorized as Extremely preterm: Delivered before 28 weeks of gestation Very preterm: Delivered at 28 to before 32 weeks of gestation Moderately preterm: Delivered at 32 to before 34 weeks of gestation Late preterm: Delivered at 34 to before 37 weeks of gestation About 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States is born before full term.  Greater degrees of prematurity are associated with greater risks of serious and even life-threatening complications.  Extreme prematurity is the single most common cause of death in newborns.  Also, newborns born very prematurely are at increased risk of long-term problems, especially delayed development Definition of Developmental Disorders are better called neurodevelopmental disorders. \n【1】 Nonetheless, most infants who are born prematurely grow up with no long-term difficulties.  Causes of Preterm Birth The causes of preterm birth are frequently unknown.  However, there are many known risk factors for preterm birth.  Adolescents and older women, women of lower socioeconomic status, and women who have less formal education are at increased risk of preterm birth.  Risk factors from a previous pregnancy: Previous preterm birth (biggest risk factor) Previous multiple pregnancies Multiple Births The term multiple births refers to the presence of more than one fetus in the uterus.  The number of twin, triplet, and other multiple births has been increasing during the last two decades. \n【2】 A pregnancy may be ended by surgically removing the contents of the uterus or by taking certain drugs. \n【3】 Usually, kidney disorders worsen only in pregnant women who have high blood pressure that is not well-controlled. \n【4】 After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows.  Symptoms of Preterm Newborns usually weigh less than 5½ pounds (2. 5 kilograms), and some weigh as little as 1 pound (½ kilogram).  Symptoms often depend on immaturity of various organs.  Extremely preterm newborns tend to require a longer stay in the neonatal intensive care unit  in the hospital until their organs can function well on their own.  Late preterm newborns, on the other hand, may have only a few organ systems, if any, that need time to mature.  Late preterm newborns may stay in the hospital until they can regulate their body temperature and the level of sugar (glucose) in their blood, eat well, and gain weight.  The immune system in any preterm newborn is also underdeveloped, and therefore preterm newborns are prone to infections.  Physical Features of a Preterm Newborn Small size Large head relative to rest of the body Little fat under the skin Thin, shiny, pink skin Veins visible beneath the skin Few creases on soles of feet Scant hair Soft ears, with little cartilage Underdeveloped breast tissue Boys: Small scrotum with few folds; testes may be undescended Testes and Retractile Testes Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) are testes that remain in the abdomen or the groin instead of descending into the scrotum. \n【5】 The risk of complications increases with the degree of prematurity.  Risk of complications also depends in part on the presence of certain causes of prematurity, such as infection, diabetes, high blood pressure, or preeclampsia.  Underdeveloped brain Several problems arise when an infant is born before the brain is fully developed.  These problems include Inconsistent breathing: The part of the brain that controls regular breathing may be so immature that preterm newborns breathe inconsistently, with short pauses in breathing or periods during which breathing stops completely for 20 seconds or longer .  Difficulty coordinating feeding and breathing: The parts of the brain that control reflexes involving the mouth and throat are immature, so preterm newborns may not be able to suck and swallow normally, resulting in difficulty coordinating feeding with breathing.  Bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain: Newborns born very prematurely are at increased risk of bleeding in the brain Bleeding in and around the brain Birth injury is damage that occurs as a result of physical pressure during the birthing process, usually during transit through the birth canal. \n【6】 Underdeveloped digestive tract and liver An underdeveloped digestive tract and liver can cause several problems, including the following: Frequent episodes of spitting-up: Initially, preterm newborns may have difficulty with feedings.  Not only do they have immature sucking and swallowing reflexes, but their small stomach empties slowly, which can lead to frequent episodes of spitting up .  Frequent episodes of not tolerating feedings: The intestines of preterm newborns move very slowly, and preterm newborns frequently have difficulty passing stools.  Because of the slow movement of the intestinal tract, preterm infants do not easily digest the breast milk or formula they are given.  Intestinal damage: Very preterm newborns may develop a serious condition in which part of the intestine becomes severely damaged and may cause infection .  Hyperbilirubinemia: Preterm newborns are prone to developing hyperbilirubinemia Jaundice in the Newborn Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream. \n【7】 In hyperbilirubinemia, the newborn's liver is slow in clearing bilirubin (the yellow bile pigment that results from the normal breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood.  Thus, the yellow pigment accumulates, giving the skin and the whites of the eyes a yellow color (jaundice).  Preterm newborns tend to become jaundiced in the first few days after birth.  Usually, jaundice is mild and resolves as newborns take in larger amounts during feedings and have more frequent bowel movements (bilirubin is removed in the stool, giving it its bright yellow color at first).  Rarely, very high levels of bilirubin accumulate and put newborns at risk of developing kernicterus.  Kernicterus Complications of jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream. \n【8】 Antibodies from the mother cross the placenta late in the pregnancy and help protect the newborn from infection at birth.  Preterm newborns have fewer of their mother's protective antibodies and therefore are at higher risk of developing infections, especially infection in the blood  or tissues around the brain .  The use of invasive devices for treatment, such as catheters in blood vessels and breathing tubes (endotracheal tubes), further increases the risk of developing serious bacterial infections.  Underdeveloped kidneys Before delivery, waste products produced in the fetus are removed by the placenta and then excreted by the mother’s kidneys.  After delivery, the newborn’s kidneys must take over these functions.  Kidney function is diminished in very preterm newborns but improves as the kidneys mature.  Newborns with underdeveloped kidneys may have difficulty regulating the amount of salt and other electrolytes as well as water in the body.  Kidney problems may lead to growth failure and a buildup of acid in the blood .  Underdeveloped lungs The lungs of preterm newborns may not have had enough time to fully develop before birth.  The tiny air sacs called alveoli that absorb oxygen from the air and remove carbon dioxide from the blood are not formed until about the beginning of the last third of pregnancy (third trimester).  In addition to this structural development, the tissues of the lungs must make a fatty material called surfactant.  Surfactant coats the inside of the air sacs and allows them to remain open throughout the breathing cycle, making it easy to breathe.  Without surfactant, the air sacs tend to collapse at the end of each breath, making breathing very difficult.  Usually, the lungs do not make surfactant until about 32 weeks of pregnancy, and production is typically not adequate until about 34 to 36 weeks. \n【9】 Newborns with breathing problems may need help with breathing with a ventilator Mechanical Ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs. \n【10】 The more preterm the newborn, the less surfactant is available, and the greater the likelihood that respiratory distress syndrome will develop.  There is no treatment to make the lung structure mature more rapidly, but with adequate nutrition, the lungs continue to mature over time.  There are two approaches to increase the amount of surfactant and reduce the likelihood and severity of respiratory distress: Before birth: Corticosteroid medications such as betamethasone increase surfactant production in the fetus and are given to the mother by injection when a preterm delivery is anticipated, typically 24 to 48 hours before delivery.  After birth: Doctors may give surfactant directly into the newborn's windpipe (trachea). \n【11】 Most infants who have BPD have had respiratory distress syndrome and needed treatment with a ventilator.  In BPD, the lungs develop scar tissue and the infant needs continued help with breathing, sometimes with a ventilator.  In most cases, the infant very slowly recovers from the disease.  Underdeveloped eyes The retina Structure and Function of the Eyes The structures and functions of the eyes are complex. \n【12】 The retina is nourished by blood vessels on its surface.  The blood vessels grow from the center of the retina to the edges during the course of the pregnancy and do not finish growing until near term.  In preterm infants, particularly the least mature infants, the blood vessels may stop growing and/or grow abnormally.  Many preterm infants need extra oxygen, and this also can cause the blood vessels of the retina to grow abnormally.  The abnormal vessels can bleed or cause scar tissue that can pull on the retina.  This disorder is called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) Retinopathy of prematurity is a disorder of premature infants in which the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina) grow abnormally. \n【13】 In the most severe cases, the retina detaches from the back of the eye and causes blindness.  Preterm infants, particularly those born before 31 weeks of gestational age, typically have periodic eye examinations so doctors can look for abnormal development of the blood vessels.  If there is a high risk of retinal detachment, doctors may use laser treatments or give a medication called bevacizumab.  Preterm newborns are also at increased risk of developing other eye problems, such as nearsightedness Causes (myopia), misalignment of the eyes , or both.  Difficulty regulating blood sugar levels Because preterm newborns have difficulty feeding and maintaining normal blood sugar (glucose) levels, they are often treated with glucose solutions given by vein (intravenously) or given small, frequent feedings.  Without regular feedings, preterm newborns may develop low blood glucose levels .  Most newborns with hypoglycemia do not develop symptoms.  Other newborns become listless with poor muscle tone, feed poorly, or become jittery.  Rarely, seizures develop.  Preterm newborns are also prone to developing high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) if they have an infection or bleeding in the brain or receive too much glucose intravenously.  However, hyperglycemia rarely causes symptoms and can be controlled by limiting the amount of glucose given to the newborn or by using insulin for a short period of time.  Heart problems A common issue among less mature infants is a patent ductus arteriosus In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta (ductus arteriosus) fails to close as it usually does shortly after birth. \n【14】 The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel in the fetus that connects the two large arteries leaving the heart, the pulmonary artery and the aorta .  In a full-term infant, the muscle wall of the ductus arteriosis closes the blood vessel in the first few hours or days of life.  In preterm infants, however, the blood vessel may stay open, resulting in excessive blood flow through the lungs and requiring more work from the heart.  In most preterm infants, the PDA eventually closes on its own, but medications are sometimes given to help the PDA close more quickly.  In some cases, a surgical procedure to close the PDA is done.  Difficulty regulating body temperature is maintained by the brain.  Because preterm newborns do not have a mature brain, they have trouble regulating their body temperature.  Preterm newborns have a large skin surface area relative to their weight compared to full-term newborns, so they tend to lose heat rapidly and have difficulty maintaining normal body temperature, especially if they are in a cool room, there is a draft, or they are near a window when it is cold outside.  If the baby is not kept warm, the body temperature falls .  Newborns who have hypothermia gain weight poorly and may have a number of other complications.  To prevent hypothermia, preterm babies are kept warm in an incubator or with an overhead radiant warmer .  Diagnosis of Preterm Newborns Appearance of the newborn Gestational age Doctors usually know whether a baby is born prematurely based on the newborn's calculated gestational age and physical features observed after birth.  They examine the newborn and do any needed blood, laboratory, hearing, eye, and imaging tests as part of the routine newborn evaluation Physical Examination of the Newborn The doctor usually gives the newborn a thorough physical examination within the first 24 hours of life. \n【15】 These screenings may need to be repeated frequently as the newborn grows and before discharge from the hospital.  Prognosis for Preterm Newborns Over recent decades, the survival and overall outcome of preterm newborns has improved dramatically, but problems such as delayed development, cerebral palsy (CP) Cerebral palsy refers to a group of symptoms that involve difficulty moving and muscle stiffness (spasticity). \n【16】 The most important factors in determining outcome are Birthweight Degree of prematurity Whether the mother was given corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours before a preterm delivery Complications that arise after birth The sex of the baby also affects the likelihood of a good outcome: girls have a better prognosis than boys who have the same degree of prematurity.  Survival itself is rare if infants are born at less than 23 weeks of gestation.  Infants born at 23 to 24 weeks may survive, but few survive without some degree of neurologic injury.  Most infants born after 27 weeks of gestation survive without neurologic problems.  Prevention of Preterm Birth Regular prenatal care Medical Care During Pregnancy Ideally, a couple who is thinking of having a baby should see a doctor or other health care practitioner to discuss whether pregnancy is advisable.  Usually, pregnancy is very safe. \n【17】 However, many of the conditions that increase the risk of prematurity cannot be avoided.  In all cases, women who think they may be in preterm labor or have had rupture of the membranes should contact their obstetrician immediately to arrange for appropriate evaluation and treatment.  Assisted reproductive techniques Assisted Reproductive Technologies involve working with sperm and eggs or embryos in a laboratory (in vitro) with the goal of producing a pregnancy. \n【18】 These pregnancies have a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery and its complications.  However, a technique called elective single embryo transfer, which is the implantation of a single embryo, reduces the risk of a multiple pregnancy and may be considered a good option for some women.  Treatment of Preterm Newborns Treatment of complications Treatment of prematurity involves managing the complications resulting from underdeveloped organs.  All specific disorders are treated as needed.  For instance, preterm newborns may be given treatments that help with breathing problems (such as mechanical ventilation for lung disease and surfactant treatment), antibiotics for infections, blood transfusions for anemia, and laser surgery for eye disease or they may need special imaging studies like echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.  It uses no x-rays. \n【19】 Parents are encouraged to visit and interact with their newborn as much as possible.  Skin-to-skin contact  between the newborn and the mother or father is beneficial to the newborn whenever possible and facilitates bonding.  Parents of all infants should remove fluffy materials including blankets, quilts, pillows, and stuffed toys from the infant's crib at home because these items may increase the risk of sudden unexplained infant death Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Sudden infant death syndrome is the sudden, unexpected death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy infant between 1 month and 1 year of age. \n【20】 Infants at home should be placed on their back and not their stomach to sleep because sleeping on the stomach also increases the risk of SUID .  Very preterm newborns may need to be hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit for days, weeks, or months.  They may require a breathing tube and a machine that helps air get in and out of the lungs ,ventilator Mechanical Ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.  Some people with respiratory failure need a mechanical ventilator  until they are able to breathe on their own.  They receive nutrition into their veins until they can tolerate feedings into their stomach through a feeding tube feeding may be used to feed people whose digestive tract is functioning normally but who cannot eat enough to meet their nutritional needs. \n【21】 The mother’s breast milk is the best food for preterm infants.  Use of breast milk decreases the risk of developing an intestinal problem called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) Necrotizing enterocolitis is injury to the inner surface of the intestine.  This disorder occurs most often in newborns who are premature and/or seriously ill. \n【22】 Because breast milk is low in some nutrients like calcium, it may need to be mixed with a fortifying solution for newborns who have a very low birthweight.  Infant formulas made specifically for preterm infants that are high in calories also can be used when necessary.  Very preterm newborns may require a medication that prompts them to breathe, such as caffeine, until the part of the brain that controls regular breathing has matured.  To keep warm, these newborns need to be kept in an incubator until they are able to maintain a normal body temperature.  Extremely preterm newborns require all the same care as very preterm newborns.  Like very preterm newborns, these newborns cannot be released from the hospital until they are able to breathe on their own, take oral feedings, maintain a normal body temperature, and gain weight.  Discharge from the hospital Preterm infants typically remain hospitalized until their medical problems are under satisfactory control and they are Taking an adequate amount of milk without special assistance Gaining weight steadily Able to maintain a normal body temperature in a crib No longer having pauses in breathing (apnea of prematurity) Most preterm infants are ready to go home when they are at 35 to 37 weeks of gestational age and weigh 4 to 5 pounds (2 to 2. 5 kilograms).  However, there is wide variation.  The length of time the infant stays in the hospital does not affect the long-term prognosis.  Because preterm newborns are at risk of stopping breathing (apnea), and having low levels of oxygen in the blood and a slow heart rate while in a car seat, many hospitals in the United States do a car seat challenge test before preterm babies are discharged.  The test is done to determine whether babies are stable in the semi-reclined position of a car seat.  This test is usually done using the car seat provided by the parents.  Preterm babies, including those who pass the test, should be observed by a non-driving adult during all car seat travel until the babies have reached the due date and have remained consistently able to tolerate being in the car seat.  Because the baby's color should be observed, travel should be limited to daylight hours.  Long trips should be broken up into 45- to 60-minute segments so that the baby can be taken out of the car seat and repositioned.  Surveys show that most car seats are not installed optimally, so a check of the car seat by a certified car seat inspector is recommended.  Inspection sites can be found here.  Some hospitals offer an inspection service, but casual advice provided by an uncertified hospital staff member should not be considered equivalent to inspection by a certified car seat expert.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that car seats be used only for vehicular transportation and not as an infant seat or bed at home.  Many doctors also recommend that parents do not put preterm infants in swings or bouncy seats for the first few months at home.  After discharge, preterm infants are carefully monitored for developmental problems and receive physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy as needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:21:45"}

The masses may be asymptomatic (common in adults) or cause obstructive respiratory symptoms (more likely in children).  Testing involves CT with biopsy and adjunctive tests as needed.  Treatment differs by cause.  Mediastinal masses are divided into those that occur in the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum.  The anterior mediastinum extends from the sternum to the pericardium in the inferior region and from the sternum to the brachiocephalic vessels in the superior region.  The middle mediastinum lies between the anterior and posterior mediastinum.  The posterior mediastinum is bounded by the pericardium and trachea anteriorly and the vertebral column posteriorly.  Etiology of Mediastinal Masses Adults In adults, the most common causes vary by location: Anterior mediastinum: Thymomas and lymphomas Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systems. \n【1】 Some causes of mediastinal masses in adults Children In children, the most common mediastinal masses are neurogenic tumors and cysts. \n【2】  Symptoms and Signs of Mediastinal Masses Many mediastinal masses are asymptomatic.  In general, malignant lesions and masses in children are much more likely to cause symptoms.  The most common symptoms are chest pain and weight loss.  Lymphomas Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systems. \n【3】 Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings. \n【4】 Symptoms and signs also depend on location.  Large anterior mediastinal masses may cause dyspnea when patients are lying supine.  Lesions in the middle mediastinum may compress blood vessels or airways, causing the superior vena cava syndrome Regional spread or airway obstruction.  Lesions in the posterior mediastinum may encroach on the esophagus, causing dysphagia or odynophagia.  Diagnosis of Mediastinal Masses Chest x-ray CT and sometimes MRI Sometimes tissue examination Mediastinal masses are most often incidentally discovered on chest x-ray or other imaging tests during an examination for chest symptoms.  Additional diagnostic testing, usually imaging and biopsy, is indicated to determine etiology.  CT with IV contrast is the most valuable imaging technique.  With thoracic CT, normal variants and benign tumors, such as fat- and fluid-filled cysts, can be distinguished from other processes.  An MRI is done if the structure is cystic.  MRI may be useful in determining whether the mass is compressing or invading adjacent structures.  A definitive diagnosis can be obtained for many mediastinal masses with needle aspiration or needle biopsy Transthoracic needle biopsy of thoracic or mediastinal structures uses a cutting needle to aspirate a core of tissue for histologic analysis. \n【5】 Fine-needle aspiration techniques usually suffice for carcinomatous lesions, but a cutting-needle biopsy should be done whenever lymphoma, thymoma, or a neural mass is suspected.  If ectopic thyroid tissue is considered, thyroid-stimulating hormone is measured.  Treatment of Mediastinal Masses Depends on cause Treatment depends on etiology.  Some benign lesions, such as pericardial cysts, can be observed.  Most malignant tumors should be removed surgically, but some, such as lymphomas, are best treated with chemotherapy.  Granulomatous disease should be treated with the appropriate antimicrobial drug.  Key Points In adults, thymomas and lymphomas (both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) are the most common anterior lesions, lymph node enlargement and vascular masses are the most common middle lesions, and neurogenic tumors and esophageal abnormalities are the most common posterior lesions.  In children, the most common mediastinal masses are neurogenic tumors and cysts.

Patients often also have major depressive disorder Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【1】 They may also have another personality disorder .  Patients with social phobia and avoidant personality disorder have more severe symptoms and disability than those with either disorder alone.  Etiology of AVPD Research suggests that experiences of rejection and marginalization during childhood and innate traits of social anxiousness and avoidance may contribute to avoidant personality disorder.  Avoidance in social situations has been detected as early as about age 2 years.  Symptoms and Signs of AVPD Patients with avoidant personality disorder avoid social interaction, including those at work, because they fear that they will be criticized or rejected or that people will disapprove of them, as in the following situations: They may refuse a promotion because they fear coworkers will criticize them.  They may avoid meetings.  They avoid making new friends unless they are sure they will be liked.  These patients assume people will be critical and disapproving until rigorous tests proving the contrary are passed.  Thus, before joining a group and forming a close relationship, patients with this disorder require repeated assurances of support and uncritical acceptance.  Patients with avoidant personality disorder long for social interaction but fear placing their well-being in the hands of others.  Because these patients limit their interactions with people, they tend to be relatively isolated and do not have a social network that could help them when they need it.  These patients are very sensitive to anything slightly critical, disapproving, or mocking because they constantly think about being criticized or rejected by others.  They are vigilant for any sign of a negative response to them.  Their tense, anxious appearance may elicit mockery or teasing, thus seeming to confirm their self-doubts.  Low self-esteem and a sense of inadequacy inhibit these patients in social situations, especially new ones.  Interactions with new people are inhibited because patients think of themselves as socially inept, unappealing, and inferior to others.  They tend to be quiet and timid and try to disappear because they tend to think that if they say anything, others will say it is wrong.  They are reluctant to talk about themselves lest they be mocked or humiliated.  They worry they will blush or cry when they are criticized.  Patients with avoidant personality disorder are very reluctant to take personal risks or participate in new activities for similar reasons.  In such cases, they tend to exaggerate the dangers and use minimal symptoms or other problems to explain their avoidance.  They may prefer a limited lifestyle because of their need for security and certainty.  Diagnosis of AVPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder, patients must have A persistent pattern of avoiding social contact, feeling inadequate, and being hypersensitive to criticism and rejection This pattern is shown by the presence of ≥ 4 of the following: Avoidance of job-related activities that involve interpersonal contact because they fear that they will be criticized or rejected or that people will disapprove of them Unwillingness to get involved with people unless they are sure of being liked Reserve in close relationships because they fear ridicule or humiliation Preoccupation with being criticized or rejected in social situations Inhibition in new social situations because they feel inadequate Self-assessment as socially incompetent, unappealing, or inferior to others Reluctance to take personal risks or participate in any new activity because they may be embarrassed Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.  Differential diagnosis Avoidant personality disorder must be distinguished from the following 2 disorders: Social phobia is fear of and anxiety about being exposed to certain social or performance situations.  These situations are avoided or endured with substantial anxiety. \n【2】 Avoidant personality disorder involves more pervasive anxiety and avoidance than social phobia, which is often specific to situations that may result in public embarrassment (eg, public speaking, performing on stage).  However, social phobia may involve a broader avoidance pattern and thus may be hard to distinguish.  The 2 disorders often occur together. \n【3】 However, patients with schizoid personality disorder become isolated because they are disinterested in others, whereas those with avoidant personality disorder become isolated because they are hypersensitive to possible rejection or criticism by others.  Other personality disorders may be similar in some ways to avoidant personality disorder but can be distinguished by characteristic features .  Treatment of AVPD Cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on social skills Supportive psychotherapy Psychodynamic psychotherapy Anxiolytics and antidepressants General treatment Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment. \n【4】 Patients with avoidant personality disorder often avoid treatment.  Effective therapies for patients with both social phobia and avoidant personality disorder include Cognitive-behavioral therapy that focuses on acquisition of social skills, done in groups Other group therapies if the group consists of people with the same difficulties Patients with avoidant personality disorder benefit from Individual therapies that are supportive and sensitive to the patient's hypersensitivities toward others Psychodynamic psychotherapy, which focuses on underlying conflicts, may be helpful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 23:14:27"}

Bile ducts (such as the hepatic ducts and the common bile duct), unlike the liver, are supplied with blood from only one major blood vessel, the hepatic artery.  Thus, disruption of blood flow through the hepatic artery can prevent the bile ducts from obtaining enough oxygen.  Consequently, the cells lining the ducts are damaged or die—a disorder called ischemic cholangiopathy.  Blood flow can be disrupted when A liver transplant is rejected.  Blood vessels are injured during liver transplantation surgery or removal of the gallbladder by laparoscopy.  Blood vessels are injured by radiation therapy.  People have a disorder that makes blood more likely to clot .  A procedure that is done to block blood flow to a tumor in the liver (called chemoembolization) also blocks blood flow to healthy tissue.  Ischemic cholangiopathy most commonly occurs in people who have had a liver transplant Liver Transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. \n【1】 Symptoms of Ischemic Cholangiopathy The damaged bile duct becomes inflamed, narrows (causing a stricture), or both.  Then the flow of bile slows or is blocked.  If bile cannot move through the liver and bile ducts quickly enough, the pigment in bile (bilirubin) builds up in the blood and is deposited in the skin.  As a result, the skin and the whites of the eyes turn yellow ,called jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.  Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. The narrowing or blockage can prevent bile (which contains pigments such as bilirubin) from entering the small intestine and being eliminated in stool.  As a result, the stools become pale, and because more bile is eliminated in urine, the urine becomes dark.  Itching (pruritus) is common, often beginning in the hands and feet but usually affecting the whole body.  Itching is especially worse at night.  Bile duct infection  may also occur, producing abdominal pain, chills, and fever.  Diagnosis of Ischemic Cholangiopathy History of a predisposing condition (for example, liver transplant) A doctor's evaluation Blood tests and imaging studies The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and abnormal blood test results, especially in people who have conditions that make ischemic cholangiopathy more likely ,such as liver transplant Liver Transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. Ultrasonography helps doctors visualize the ducts, but the results may be inconclusive. \n【2】 ERCP involves inserting a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) through the mouth and into the small intestine and injecting a contrast agent into the bile duct system.  Treatment of Ischemic Cholangiopathy Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting Change in drugs (in people with liver transplants) In addition to detecting narrowing of the bile ducts, ERCP can be used to treat strictures.  A wire with a deflated balloon at its end is introduced through the endoscope.  Doctors inflate the balloon to widen (dilate) narrowed areas.  A mesh tube (stent) is then inserted to keep the duct open.

Collarbone fractures often occur after a fall on an outstretched arm or a shoulder or after a direct blow.  These fractures cause pain, swelling, and sometimes a bulge or bump where the bone is broken.  Doctors can usually identify collarbone fractures based on a physical examination, but x-rays are taken to pinpoint the fracture's location and determine the extent of the injury.  Most collarbone fractures require only a sling, but some types of fractures require surgery.  ,See also Overview of Fractures A fracture is a crack or break in a bone.  Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.  Fractures usually result from injuries or overuse.  The injured part hurts  Collarbone fractures are a common fracture, particularly among children.  Fracturing the Collarbone In some collarbone fractures, the broken pieces stay in place (called a nondisplaced fracture).  Most occur near the middle of the bone.  The broken pieces of bone may stay in place (called a nondisplaced fracture) or be out of place (called a displaced fracture).  In some collarbone fractures, the main ligaments that hold the collarbone to the shoulder bone are torn.  Symptoms of Collarbone Fractures The area is painful and swollen, and pain may extend into the shoulder.  People may sense that the bone is moving and unstable.  Because the collarbone lies just under the skin and has little muscle over it, people may see a bulge or bump where the bone is broken.  The broken bone rarely breaks through the skin, but it may push the skin out.  This effect is called tenting because it resembles a tent pole holding up a tent.

EPA/DHA also reduces triglycerides.  The 2021 OMEMI trial (Omega-3 Fatty acids in Elderly with Myocardial Infarction) was a randomized clinical trial in which 1027 patients aged 70 to 82 years with recent (2 to 8 weeks) acute myocardial infarction were treated with 1. 8 g of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (930 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 660 mg docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo (corn oil) daily in addition to standard of care.  The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, unscheduled revascularization, stroke, all-cause death, and heart failure hospitalization after 2 years.

Positioning Patient comfort with excellent exposure of burned areas Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Initial care of all burn wounds Stabilize patient as per trauma protocol.  Irrigate chemical burns involving the skin Etiology Burns are injuries of skin or other tissue caused by thermal, radiation, chemical, or electrical contact. \n【1】 During the first 30 minutes after injury, use room temperature (20 to 25° C) or cold tap-water irrigation, immersion, or compresses to limit the extent of the burn and provide significant pain relief.  Add ice chips to water or saline to lower the temperature as needed.  However, avoid immersing burned tissue in ice or ice water because ice immersion increases pain and burn depth and increases the risk of frostbite and, if the burn surface is large, systemic hypothermia.  Treat pain before doing anything to the burn wound.  The best analgesics for severe pain are usually IV opioids in titrated doses, such as fentanyl 1 mcg/kg, or morphine 0. 1 mg/kg.  For minor burns, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen also may be effective.  Remove all clothing and gross debris from the burned area.  Remove any jewelry from the burn and distally, such as rings.  Cover the burn with a moist, sterile dressing soaked in room temperature water or saline.  The dressing should be kept cool and moist to provide continued pain relief.  Give tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine Indications A vaccine for tetanus alone is available, but the tetanus vaccine is typically combined with those for diphtheria and/or pertussis. \n【2】 Incompletely immunized patients should also receive tetanus immune globulin 250 units IM.  Transfer stable patients with major burns to a burn center.  For other patients, complete burn wound care.  Definitive burn wound care Clean the burned area gently with a clean cloth or gauze and soap and water or a mild antibacterial wound cleanser such as chlorhexidine.  Irrigate the wound with saline or water.  Some physicians recommend leaving unruptured blisters intact, and others recommend opening them with scissors and forceps.  Regardless, loose skin and broken blisters are devitalized tissue that should be debrided by peeling from the wound and snipping with scissors close to the border with viable, attached epidermis.  Apply a sterile burn dressing, with or without a topical agent.  There are several options for burn dressings.  Some are impregnated with antimicrobials (eg, silver).  Most are a form of gauze, but there are biosynthetic dressings with some of the characteristics of skin that adhere to the wound and can be left in place for extended periods of time.  Some are typically used over a layer of antimicrobial cream or ointment, whereas those containing an antimicrobial are not.  In all cases, dressings should be sterile and have an absorptive layer sufficient for the amount of exudate expected.  Consider applying a layer of antibiotic cream or ointment such bacitracin or mupirocin directly to all wounds except for 1st-degree or superficial burns.  Silver sulfadiazine, once a mainstay of topical burn treatment, is no longer recommended because it is no better than other topical antibiotic preparations and may impair wound healing .  Cover the wound surface.  There are many commercial dressings available but a fine-mesh gauze or commercial nonadherent gauze is appropriate.  Cover and pad the wound with loose gauze fluffs.  If fingers and toes are involved, pad the web spaces and the digits individually and separate them with strips of gauze.  Wrap the entire dressing with an absorbent, slightly elastic material.  Aftercare Provide analgesics to take at home.  Instruct the patient to elevate an affected limb to prevent swelling, which may cause delayed healing or infection.  Follow up in about 24 hours.  At the first follow-up visit, remove the dressing and reassess the burn for depth of injury and need for further debridement, then redress.  The timing and location (eg, clinic, home) of subsequent dressing changes depend on The type of dressing used: Some dressings are intended to be left on for a period of time and others are changed frequently.  Patient and family capability: Large burns, areas requiring awkward or complicated dressings, and patients with limited self-care skills, may need more frequent professional care and/or less frequent changes.  The amount of exudate produced by the wound: Drier burns need less frequent dressing changes.  For self-care, patients should gently remove the old dressing, rinse the wound with lukewarm tap water, and apply similar material as first used.  In any case, the wound should be examined 5 to 7 days after injury.  Warnings and Common Errors Do not underestimate the need for procedural analgesia and sometimes sedation, particularly for complicated debridement or dressing changes.  Inadequate analgesia deters thorough wound care.  Tips and Tricks For burns on the face and neck: Clean the wound with chlorhexidine and debride blisters and any loose skin, then apply a bland topical antibiotic such as bacitracin but leave the wound uncovered.  The wound can be washed 2 or 3 times per day, followed by reapplication of the topical agent.  Alternatives to IV opioids include regional or nerve block anesthesia; inhaled nitrous oxide; or IV ketamine.  For debridement of small burns, local anesthetic injection may be adequate analgesia.  Home burn care and dressing changes may be quite painful.  An adequate supply of an oral opioid analgesic should be provided, and responsible analgesic use should be encouraged.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:26:18"}

Symptoms of Temporal Bone Fracture People have pain and often Bleeding from the ear Bleeding behind the eardrum Bruising of the skin behind the ear Other symptoms and complications vary depending on the exact location of the fracture.  Some people have facial paralysis on the side of the fracture.  Facial paralysis can develop immediately or after some time and can be mild or severe.  Another symptom is severe hearing loss.  Hearing loss and Deafness may result from damage to the three tiny bones (called the ossicles) that connect the eardrum to the inner ear or from damage to the cochlea or the nerve that leads to the cochlea.  If the vestibular apparatus is damaged, people may feel as if they or their surroundings are spinning (vertigo) or have problems with balance.  Sometimes, fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) leaks from the brain through the fracture and appears as clear fluid draining from the ear or nose.  Leakage of this fluid indicates that the brain is exposed to possibly serious infection from bacteria in the ear canal.  Diagnosis of Temporal Bone Fracture Computed tomography (CT) Testing for damage to facial nerves and hearing Diagnosis is made with CT Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【2】 Doctors also may test the person's hearing and whether the face is paralyzed.  If problems are found, further testing is usually done, such as detailed hearing testing Nerve conduction studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【3】 Treatment of Temporal Bone Fracture Treatment of symptoms as necessary Treatment is necessary only if the fracture causes problems.  Treatment of facial paralysis If facial paralysis is immediate and severe, surgery may be needed.  If paralysis is mild or delayed, a corticosteroid drug given by mouth is typically prescribed.  Treatment of hearing loss If hearing loss stems from damage to the ossicles, the ossicles are repaired surgically.  Hearing loss that results from damage to the cochlea or its nerve is usually permanent.  Treatment of vertigo If vertigo is caused by damage that cannot be repaired surgically, a benzodiazepine drug (usually used to treat anxiety) may provide some relief.  People can sometimes learn to compensate for problems that vertigo causes (such as loss of balance) through a series of exercises called vestibular rehabilitation.  Treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leakage People with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid should be hospitalized.  If the leak does not stop on its own within a few days, surgery or insertion of a drain near the spinal cord in the lower back (lumbar drain) may be needed to prevent infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 17:37:38"}

Most cases are due to an increase in melanin production and deposition.   Focal hyperpigmentation is most often postinflammatory in nature, occurring after injury  or other causes of inflammation ,eg, acne Vulgaris is the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and/or cysts as a result of obstruction and inflammation of pilosebaceous units . \n【1】 Acanthosis nigricans causes focal hyperpigmentation and a velvety plaque most often on the axillae and posterior neck.  Diffuse hyperpigmentation Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【2】 After eliminating drugs as a cause of diffuse hyperpigmentation, patients should be tested for the most common systemic causes.  These causes include Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. \n【3】 Skin findings are nondiagnostic; therefore, a skin biopsy is not necessary or helpful.  The search for underlying cancer should be based on a review of systems.  Melasma (Chloasma) Melasma consists of dark brown, roughly symmetric patches of hyperpigmentation with irregular borders on the face (usually on the forehead, temples, cheeks, cutaneous upper lip, or nose).  It occurs primarily in pregnant women (melasma gravidarum, also called the mask of pregnancy) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OCs) mimic ovarian hormones. \n【4】 Ten percent of cases occur in nonpregnant women and dark-skinned men.  Melasma is more prevalent among and lasts longer in people with dark skin.  Because melasma risk increases with increasing sun exposure, the mechanism probably involves overproduction of melanin by hyperfunctional melanocytes.  Other than sun exposure, aggravating factors include Autoimmune thyroid disorders Photosensitizing drugs In women, melasma fades slowly and incompletely after childbirth or cessation of hormone use.  In men, melasma rarely fades.  The mainstay of melasma management is strict photoprotection agents.  Patients should use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher, wear protective clothing and hats, and avoid direct sun exposure.  During and after therapy, strict sun protection must be maintained.  Because visible light is not blocked by most sunscreens, patients should use a tinted sunscreen (eg, that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide).  The addition of antioxidants to the sunscreen and oral adjunctive photoprotection agents such as Polypodium leucotomas can enhance protection .  Because of potential health and environmental toxicities, oxybenzone and benzophenone-3 are usually not preferred sunscreens .  Other treatment depends on whether the pigmentation is epidermal or dermal; epidermal pigmentation becomes accentuated with a Wood light Diagnostic tests are indicated when the cause of a skin lesion or disease is not obvious from history and physical examination alone. \n【5】 Only epidermal pigmentation responds to treatment.  Most topical melasma treatments are used in combination rather than individually.  Triple topical therapy is first-line treatment that is often effective and consists of a combination of Hydroquinone 2 to 4% Tretinoin 0. 05 to 1% A class V to VII topical corticosteroid  Hydroquinone depigments the skin by blocking the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and inhibiting melanocyte metabolic processes.  Hydroquinone should be tested behind one ear or on a small patch on the forearm for 1 week before use on the face because it may cause irritation or an allergic reaction.  Tretinoin promotes keratinocyte turnover and can exfoliate skin that contains epidermal pigment.  Corticosteroids help block synthesis and secretion of melanin.  Two promising technologies being tried in conjunction with triple topical therapy are the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser and nonablative fractional resurfacing.  If triple topical therapy is not available, then hydroquinone 3 to 4% applied twice a day for up to 8 weeks at a time (chronic continuous use can theoretically increase the risk of exogenous ochronosis, which is a permanent form of hyperpigmentation) may be considered; 2% hydroquinone is useful as maintenance.  Azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream can be used in place of or with hydroquinone and/or tretinoin.  Azelaic acid is a tyrosinase inhibitor that reduces melanin production.  In addition, topical kojic acid has been increasingly used; it is a chelating agent that blocks tyrosine conversion to melanin.  During pregnancy, azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream and chemical peeling with glycolic acid are safe to use.  Hydroquinone and tretinoin are not safe to use.  Second-line treatment options for patients with severe melasma unresponsive to topical bleaching agents include chemical peeling with glycolic acid or 30 to 50% trichloroacetic acid.  Laser treatments also have been used but are not standard therapy.  Oral therapies have been studied.  A randomized study has shown improvement with oral tranexamic acid in patients with moderate-to-severe melasma . \n【6】 Lentigines (singular: lentigo) are flat, tan to brown, oval macules.  They are commonly due to chronic sun exposure (solar lentigines; sometimes called liver spots but are not related to hepatic dysfunction) and occur most frequently on the face and back of the hands.  They typically first appear during middle age and increase in number with age.  Although progression from lentigines to melanoma has not been established, lentigines are an independent risk factor for melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).  Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【7】 If lentigines are a cosmetic concern, they are treated with cryotherapy or laser; hydroquinone is not effective.  Nonsolar lentigines are sometimes associated with systemic disorders, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with multiple hamartomatous polyps in the stomach, small bowel, and colon along with distinctive pigmented skin lesions. \n【8】 Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation Changes are usually diffuse but sometimes have drug-specific distribution patterns or hues .  Mechanisms include Increased melanin in the epidermis (tends to be more brown) Increased melanin in the epidermis and high dermis (mostly brown with hints of gray or blue) Increased melanin in the dermis (tends to be more grayish or blue) Dermal deposition of the drug, metabolite, or drug–melanin complexes (usually slate or bluish gray) Drugs may cause secondary hyperpigmentation. \n【9】  In fixed drug eruptions, red plaques or blisters form at the same site each time the causative drug is taken; residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation usually persists, especially in darker skin types.  Typical lesions occur on the face (especially the lips), hands, feet, and genitals.  Typical inciting drugs include antibiotics (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and barbiturates.  Treatment of drug-induced hyperpigmentation involves stopping the causative drug; the hyperpigmentation fades very slowly in some if not all cases.  Because many drugs that cause skin pigmentation also cause photosensitivity reactions Photosensitivity is a cutaneous overreaction to sunlight. \n【10】 Key Points Common causes of focal hyperpigmentation include injury, inflammation, phytophotodermatitis, lentigines, melasma, freckles, café-au-lait macules, and acanthosis nigricans.  Common causes of widespread hyperpigmentation include melasma, drugs, cancers, and other systemic disorders.  Test patients who have widespread hyperpigmentation not caused by drugs for disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, and Addison disease.  Treat melasma initially with a combination of hydroquinone 2 to 4%, tretinoin 0. 05 to 1%, and a class V to VII topical corticosteroid.

The aorta is the main artery that carries blood away from your heart to the rest of your body.  Four heart valves control how blood flows in and out of your heart.  The valves are like one-way doors that keep blood flowing in the right direction.  The aortic valve separates your heart from the aorta.  This valve opens into the aorta to let blood out of your heart.  The valve closes to keep blood from running back into your heart.  Aortic regurgitation is a leak in your aortic valve.  Because of the leak, some of the blood pumped out of your heart flows back into your heart each time the left ventricle relaxes.  Aortic regurgitation happens because of problems with your aortic valve, such as a birth defect or infection The more blood that leaks backward, the harder your heart has to work to pump out enough blood Eventually, your heart has to pump so hard to compensate for the leak that you develop heart failure Your heart pumps blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to the rest of your body.  Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. \n【1】 Aortic regurgitation can develop suddenly or gradually.  Causes of sudden aortic regurgitation include: Bacterial infection of your valve  A tear in the lining of your aorta  Causes of gradual aortic regurgitation include: Weakening of your valve or the first part of your aorta, such as from a birth defect Untreated rheumatic fever is inflammation of the joints, heart, skin, and nervous system, resulting from a complication of untreated streptococcal infection of the throat. \n【2】 Mild aortic regurgitation may not cause symptoms.  Severe aortic regurgitation causes symptoms of heart failure Your heart pumps blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to the rest of your body. \n【3】 Doctors suspect aortic regurgitation by listening to your heart with a stethoscope.  Doctors use echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Echocardiography can be used to detect abnormalities in heart wall motion and to measure the volume of blood being pumped from the heart with each beat. \n【4】 If the echocardiography shows you might have aortic dissection The aorta is the main blood vessel (artery) that carries blood away from your heart to the rest of your body.  The wall of the aorta has several layers. \n【5】 A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your body. \n【6】 A computer records changes in the magnetic field around your body. \n【7】 How do doctors treat aortic regurgitation? Doctors may give you medicine to lower your blood pressure so there's less force pushing blood back into your heart.  Aortic regurgitation often gets worse over time.  Doctors will monitor your symptoms and repeat the echocardiography to decide when to do surgery.  Your aortic valve should be surgically repaired or replaced before your heart muscle is damaged.  Doctors can replace the valve with: A plastic, mechanical valve A valve from a pig or cow heart (bioprosthetic valve) If you get a mechanical valve, you'll need to take blood-thinning medicine for the rest of your life, but the valve may last several decades.  If you get a bioprosthetic valve, you'll need to take the blood-thinning medicine for only a few months, but the valve will last only 10 to 12 years.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 01:35:30"}

Glucosamine is extracted from a material (chitin) present in the shells of crabs, oysters, and shrimp.  Glucosamine can be applied topically in a cream or salve or taken in tablet or capsule form, usually as glucosamine sulfate, but sometimes as glucosamine hydrochloride.  Glucosamine often is taken with chondroitin sulfate is a natural component of cartilage.  It is extracted from shark or cow cartilage or manufactured synthetically.  It is frequently combined with glucosamine. \n【1】  What claims are made about glucosamine? People take glucosamine mostly to treat osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. \n【2】 Its role in treating osteoarthritis in other locations is less well-defined.  Does glucosamine work? Evidence is conflicting.  Some evidence suggests it has both pain-relieving and disease-modifying effects, whereas other large and well-designed studies show it to be of no benefit.  One large study has shown that glucosamine hydrochloride is beneficial when combined with chondroitin sulfate.  Evidence supports use of glucosamine sulfate from a specific manufacturer, Rotta Research Laboratorium, for mild to moderate osteoarthritis in the knee when taken for at least 6 months.  The benefit of glucosamine for severe osteoarthritis in the knee or osteoarthritis in other locations is less clear.  What are the possible side effects of glucosamine? Glucosamine is safe for most people.  Common side effects are itching and mild digestive problems such as heartburn, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea.  Other side effects include fatigue, headache, difficulty sleeping, sun sensitivity, and nail changes.  People with liver disease should avoid glucosamine if possible.  People who have a shellfish allergy and take glucosamine extracted from shellfish may have an allergic reaction.  Some people with asthma have had flares.

The same black powder confined tightly in a container would cause a low-grade explosion.  In high-grade explosives, the ignition wave travels through the material at supersonic speed and causes a supersonic blast (detonation) wave; common examples include nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT— Examples of Low-Grade and High-Grade Explosives ).  \n【1】 In mass-casualty incidents involving explosions, 3 concentric zones are identified: Blast epicenter Secondary perimeter Blast periphery In the blast epicenter (kill zone), any survivors are probably mortally injured, technical rescue capabilities and extrication are likely to be required, and advanced life support and high victim-to-care-provider ratios are required for any survivors.  In the secondary perimeter (critical casualty zone), survivors will have multiple injuries, and standard rescue capabilities and moderate victim-to-care-provider ratios are required.  In the blast periphery (walking-wounded zone), most casualties will have non–life-threatening injuries and psychologic trauma, no rescue is required, and basic support and self-help are needed.   Pathophysiology of Explosive and Blast Injuries include both physical and psychologic trauma.  Physical trauma includes fractures, respiratory compromise, injuries to soft tissue and internal organs, internal and external blood loss with shock, burns, and sensory impairment, especially of hearing and sight.  Five mechanisms of blast injury have been described .   The supersonic blast wave in primary blast injury compresses gas-filled spaces, which then rapidly reexpand, causing shearing and tearing forces that can damage tissue and perforate organs.  Blood is forced from the vasculature into air spaces and surrounding tissue.  Pulmonary involvement (blast lung injury) may cause pulmonary contusion, systemic air embolism (especially in the brain and spinal cord), and free-radical–associated injuries ; it is a common cause of delayed mortality.  Primary blast injury also includes intestinal barotrauma (particularly with underwater explosions), acoustic barotrauma (including tympanic-membrane rupture, hemotympanum without rupture, and fracture or dislocation of ossicles in the middle ear), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. \n【2】 Symptoms and Signs of Explosive and Blast Injuries Most injuries (eg, fractures, lacerations, brain injuries) manifest the same as in other types of trauma.  Blast lung injury may cause dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, decreased breath sounds, apnea, hypoxia, cyanosis, and hemodynamic instability.  Air embolism may manifest as stroke, myocardial infarction, acute abdomen, blindness, deafness, spinal cord injury, or claudication.  Damage to the tympanic membrane and the inner ear may impair hearing, which should always be assessed.  Patients with abdominal blast injury may have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, rectal pain, tenesmus, testicular pain, and unexplained hypovolemia.  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. \n【3】 There also is concern that multiple lower-level blast exposures may have a cumulative deleterious neurocognitive effect and perhaps lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disorder that may occur after repetitive head trauma or blast injuries. \n【4】 Diagnosis of Explosive and Blast Injuries Clinical evaluation Imaging studies as indicated by findings Patients are evaluated as for most multiple trauma casualties , except that special effort is directed at identifying blast injury, particularly blast lung (and consequent air embolism), ear trauma, occult penetrating injury, and crush injury.  Apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension are the clinical triad classically associated with blast lung injury.  Tympanic membrane rupture has been considered to predict blast lung injury, but pharyngeal petechiae may be a better predictor.  Chest x-ray is done, which may show a characteristic butterfly pattern.  Cardiac monitoring is done in all patients.  Patients with possible crush injury are tested for myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia, and ECG changes.  Triage In blast injuries, less seriously injured patients often bypass prehospital triage and go directly to hospitals, possibly overwhelming medical resources in advance of the later arrival of more seriously injured patients.  On-scene triage differs from standard trauma triage mainly in that blast injuries may be more difficult to recognize initially, so initial triage should be geared toward identifying blast lung, blast abdomen, and acute crush syndrome in addition to more obvious injuries.  Treatment of Explosive and Blast Injuries Primary and secondary survey for traumatic injuries Recovery position and sometimes hyperbaric oxygen therapy for air embolism Fluid resuscitation and monitoring for rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome involving the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. \n【5】 High-flow oxygen and fluid administration are priorities, and early chest tube placement should be considered.  Most injuries ,eg, lacerations are tears in soft body tissue. \n【6】 Most fractures result from a single, significant force applied to normal bone. \n【7】 Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging  are managed as discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.  Because air embolism may worsen after initiation of positive-pressure ventilation, positive-pressure ventilation should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  If it is used, slower rates and lower inspiratory pressure settings should be chosen.  Patients suspected of having air-gas embolism should be placed in the coma (or recovery) position, halfway between left lateral decubitus and prone, with the head at or below the level of the heart.  Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy may be useful . \n【8】 Forced diuresis using an alkaline mannitol solution to maintain urine output up to 8 L/day and a urinary pH of ≥ 5 may help.  Arterial blood gases (ABGs), electrolytes, and muscle enzymes should be monitored.  Hyperkalemia is treated with calcium, insulin, and glucose .  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be particularly useful in patients with deep tissue infections.  Monitoring for compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia.  The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury. \n【9】 Patients may need fasciotomy if the difference between diastolic blood pressure and compartment pressure is < 30 mm Hg.  Hypovolemia and hypotension may not be apparent initially but may suddenly occur after tissue release and reperfusion, so large volumes of intravenous fluid (eg, 1 to 2 L Ringer's lactate or normal saline) are given both before and after reperfusion.  Fluids are continued at a rate sufficient to maintain a urine output of 300 to 500 mL/hour.

It is characterized by an inability to pay attention, disorientation, an inability to think clearly, and fluctuations in the level of alertness (consciousness).  Many disorders, medications, recreational drugs, and poisons cause delirium.  Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms and results of a physical examination, and they use blood, urine, and imaging tests to identify the cause.  Promptly correcting or treating the condition causing delirium usually cures it.   Delirium is an abnormal mental state, not a disease.  Although the term has a specific medical definition, it is often used to describe any type of confusion.  Although delirium and dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. \n【1】 Delirium affects mainly attention, and dementia affects mainly memory.  Delirium begins suddenly and often has a definite beginning point.  Dementia typically begins gradually and has no definite beginning point .  Delirium is never normal and often indicates a usually serious, newly developed problem, especially in older people.  People who have delirium need immediate medical attention.  If the cause of delirium is identified and corrected quickly, delirium can usually be cured.  Because delirium is a temporary condition, determining how many people have it is difficult.  Delirium affects 15 to 50% of hospitalized people.  Delirium may occur at any age but is more common among older people.  Delirium is common among residents of nursing homes.  When delirium occurs in younger people, it is usually due to drug use (prescription, over-the-counter, or recreational) or a life-threatening disorder.  What Is Confusion? Confusion means different things to different people, but doctors use the term to describe people who cannot process information normally.  Confused people cannot Follow a conversation Answer questions appropriately Understand where they are Make critical judgments that affect safety Remember important facts Confusion has many different causes, including the use of certain drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, and recreational) and a wide variety of disorders.  Delirium and dementia, though very different disorders, both cause confusion.  When a person is confused, doctors try to determine what the cause is, particularly whether it is delirium or dementia.  If confusion develops or worsens suddenly, the cause may be delirium.  In such cases, medical attention is needed immediately because delirium may be caused by a serious disorder.  Also, treating the cause, once identified, can often reverse the delirium.  If confusion develops slowly, the cause may be dementia.  Medical attention is needed but not urgently.  Treatment may slow the mental decline in people with dementia but usually cannot stop the decline.  Causes of Delirium Development or worsening of many disorders can cause delirium.  Any person can become delirious when extremely ill or taking medications or drugs that affect brain function (psychoactive medications or drugs).  Overall, the most common causes of delirium are the following: Drugs or medications (particularly those with anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? or psychoactive effects) and opioids Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body.  Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration. \n【2】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【3】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【4】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver. \n【5】 Delirium often develops during hospitalization in people who have dementia.  Delirium can result from less severe conditions in older people and in people who have had a stroke or who have dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. \n【6】 Less severe conditions that can trigger delirium include Minor illnesses (such as a urinary tract infection) Severe constipation in Adults Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation). \n【7】 Hospitalization Being in unfamiliar surroundings such as a hospital Confusion and Mental Decline Due to Hospitalization Being ill, particularly when it involves taking drugs for pain or anxiety, can make anyone confused.  The hospital environment adds to the problem. \n【8】 In ICUs, people are isolated in a room that typically has no windows or clocks.  Thus, people are deprived of normal sensory stimulation and can become disoriented.  Sleep is disturbed by staff members who awaken people during the night to monitor and treat them and by loud beeping monitors, intercoms, voices in the hallway, and alarms.  Furthermore, most people in ICUs have serious disorders and may be treated with medications that can trigger delirium.  People in ICUs may have seizures Seizure Disorders In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction. \n【9】 These seizures can cause delirium, but the seizures may not be recognized because they do not cause convulsions or other typical symptoms of seizures.  If the seizures are not recognized, they may not be treated appropriately and promptly.  Surgery Delirium is also very common after surgery, probably because of the stress of surgery, the anesthetics used during surgery, and the pain relievers (analgesics) used after surgery.  Delirium may also develop when people who are about to have surgery do not have access to a substance they have been using, such as a recreational drug, alcohol, or tobacco.  When people stop using such substances, they may have withdrawal Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【10】 Drug use The most common reversible cause of delirium is use of medications and recreational drugs.  In younger people, using recreational drugs and acute intoxication with alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【11】 In older people, prescription medications are usually the cause.  Psychoactive drugs directly affect nerve cells in the brain, sometimes causing delirium.  They include the following: Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【12】 The following are some examples: Medications with anticholinergic effects Benefits and Risks of Prescription Drugs , including many over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines Amphetamines are stimulant drugs that are used to treat certain medical conditions but are also subject to abuse. \n【13】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful. \n【14】 Delirium commonly occurs in people who have alcohol use disorder and who suddenly stop drinking alcohol (called delirium tremens Withdrawal symptoms ) and in people who have heroin use disorder and who suddenly stop using heroin.  Disorders Abnormal blood levels of electrolytes Overview of Electrolytes Well over half of the body's weight is made up of water.  Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments. \n【15】 Abnormal electrolyte levels may result from use of a diuretic, dehydration, or disorders such as kidney failure and widespread cancer.  Blood sugar levels that are extremely high (hyperglycemia) or low  commonly cause delirium.  An underactive thyroid gland  causes delirium with sluggishness (lethargy).  An overactive thyroid gland  causes delirium with hyperactivity.  If liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function. \n【16】 In these disorders, the liver or kidneys do not process and eliminate medications normally.  As a result, medications may accumulate in the blood and reach the brain, causing delirium.  In younger people (once drugs and alcohol are excluded), the cause of delirium is usually A condition that directly affects the brain—for example, a brain infection, such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). \n【17】 Wernicke encephalopathy is a brain disorder that causes confusion, eye problems, and loss of balance and results from thiamin deficiency. \n【18】 If untreated, Wernicke encephalopathy can cause severe brain damage, coma, or death. \n【19】 Delirium may be the first symptom in older people with a viral disease, such as COVID-19.  Poisons In younger people, ingestion of poisons, such as rubbing alcohol or antifreeze, is a common cause of delirium.  Spotlight on Aging: Delirium is more common among older people.  It is a common reason that family members of older people seek help from a doctor or at a hospital.  About 15 to 50% of older people experience delirium at some time during a hospital stay.  Causes In older people, delirium can result from any condition that causes delirium in younger people.  But it can also result from less severe conditions, such as the following: Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. \n【20】 People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence. \n【21】 These changes include An increased sensitivity to medications or drugs Changes in the brain The presence of conditions that increase the risk of delirium Drugs: Older people are much more sensitive to many medications and drugs.  In older people, drugs that affect the way the brain functions, such as sedatives, are the most common cause of delirium.  However, drugs that do not normally affect brain function, including many over-the-counter medications (especially antihistamines), can also cause it.  Older people are more sensitive to the anticholinergic effects Benefits and Risks of Prescription Drugs that many of these medications have.  One of these effects is confusion.  Age-related changes in the brain: Delirium occurs more often in older people partly because some age-related changes in the brain make them more susceptible.  For example, older people tend to have fewer brain cells and lower levels of acetylcholine—a substance that enables brain cells to communicate with each other.  Any stress (due to a drug, disorder, or situation) that causes the level of acetylcholine to further decrease can make it harder for the brain to function.  Thus, in older people, such stresses are particularly likely to cause delirium.  Other conditions: Older people are also more likely to have other conditions that make them more susceptible to delirium, such as the following: Stroke Dementia Parkinson disease Other disorders that cause nerve degeneration Use of three or more medications Dehydration Undernutrition Immobility Delirium is often the first sign of another, sometimes serious disorder.  For example, the first symptom in older people with COVID-19 may be delirium, sometimes with no other symptoms of COVID-19.  Symptoms Delirium tends to last longer in older people.  Confusion, the most obvious symptom, may be harder to recognize in older people.  Younger people with delirium may be agitated, but very old people tend to become quiet and withdrawn.  In such cases, recognizing delirium is even harder.  Having delirium also increases the risk that older people with COVID-19 will have to stay in an intensive care unit (ICU), go to a rehabilitation facility after being discharged from the hospital, and/or die.  If psychotic behavior develops in older people, it usually indicates delirium or dementia.  Psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder rarely begins during old age.  Older people are more likely to have dementia, which makes delirium harder to identify.  Both cause confusion.  Doctors try to distinguish the two by determining how quickly the confusion developed and what the person’s previous mental function was.  Doctors also ask the person a series of questions that test various aspects of thinking .  Doctors usually treat people whose mental function suddenly worsens—even if they have dementia—as if they have delirium until proved otherwise.  Having dementia increases the risk of developing delirium, and some people have both.  Treatment Delirium and the hospitalization it usually requires can cause many other problems, such as undernutrition is a deficiency of calories or of one or more essential nutrients. \n【22】 These problems may have serious consequences in older people.  Thus, older people can benefit from treatment managed by an interdisciplinary team Interdisciplinary care Providing medical care to older people can be complicated.  People often have many different health care practitioners at different locations. \n【23】 Prevention To help prevent delirium in an older person during a hospital stay, family members can ask hospital staff members to help—by doing the following: Encouraging the person to move around regularly Placing a clock and calendar in the room Minimizing the interruptions and noises during the night Making sure the person eats and drinks enough Family members can visit and talk with the person and thus help keep the person oriented.  People with delirium may be frightened, and the familiar voice of a family member can have a calming effect.  Symptoms of Delirium usually begins suddenly and progresses over hours or days.  The actions of people with delirium vary but roughly resemble those of a person who is becoming progressively more intoxicated.  The hallmark of delirium is An inability to pay attention People with delirium cannot concentrate, so they have trouble processing new information and cannot recall recent events.  Thus, they do not understand what is happening around them.  They become disoriented.  Sudden confusion about time and often about place (where they are) may be an early sign of delirium.  If delirium is severe, people may not know who they or other people are.  Thinking is confused, and people with delirium ramble, sometimes becoming incoherent.  Their level of awareness (consciousness) may fluctuate.  That is, people may be overly alert one moment and drowsy and sluggish the next.  Other symptoms also often change within minutes and tend to worsen during the evening (a phenomenon called sundowning).  People with delirium often sleep restlessly or reverse their sleep-wake cycle, sleeping during the day and staying awake at night.  People may have bizarre, frightening visual hallucinations, seeing things or people that are not there.  Some people develop paranoia (unwarranted feelings of being persecuted) or have delusions (false beliefs usually involving a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences).  Personality and mood may change.  Some people become so quiet and withdrawn that no one notices that they are delirious.  Others become irritable, agitated, and restless and may pace.  People who develop delirium after taking sedatives are likely to become very drowsy and withdrawn.  Those who have taken amphetamines or who have stopped taking sedatives may become aggressive and hyperactive.  Some people alternate between the two types of behavior.  Delirium can last hours, days, or even longer, depending on the severity and the cause.  If the cause of delirium is not quickly identified and treated, people may become increasingly drowsy and unresponsive, requiring vigorous stimulation to be aroused .  Stupor may lead to coma or death.  ychotic behavior that begins during old age usually indicates delirium or dementia.  Diagnosis of Delirium A doctor's evaluation Mental status testing Blood, urine, and imaging tests to check for possible causes Doctors suspect delirium based on symptoms, particularly when people cannot pay attention and when their ability to pay attention fluctuates from one moment to the next.  However, mild delirium may be difficult to recognize.  Doctors may not recognize delirium in hospitalized people.  Most people thought to have delirium are hospitalized to evaluate them and protect them from injuring themselves or others.  Diagnostic procedures can be done quickly and safely in the hospital, and any disorders detected can be treated quickly.  Because delirium may be caused by a serious disorder (which could be rapidly fatal), doctors try to identify the cause as quickly as possible.  Treating the cause, once identified, can often reverse the delirium.  Doctors first try to distinguish delirium from other disorders that affect mental function.  Doctors do so by collecting as much information about the person’s medical history as possible, by doing a physical examination, and by testing.  Medical history Friends, family members, or other observers are asked for information because people with delirium are usually unable to answer.  Questions include the following: How the confusion began (suddenly or gradually) How quickly it progressed What the person’s physical and mental health has been like What drugs (including alcohol and recreational drugs, especially if the person is younger) and dietary supplements (including medicinal herbs) the person uses Whether any drugs have been started or stopped recently Information may also come from medical records, the police, emergency medical personnel, or evidence such as pill bottles and certain documents.  Documents such as a checkbook, recent letters, or notification of unpaid bills or missed appointments can indicate a change in mental function.  If delirium is accompanied by agitation and hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia, it must be distinguished from a psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder, such as manic-depressive illness Bipolar Disorder In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania. \n【24】 Typically, people with a psychosis due to a psychiatric disorder do not have confusion or memory loss, and the level of consciousness does not change.  Psychotic behavior that begins during old age usually indicates delirium or dementia.   Physical examination During the physical examination, doctors check for signs of disorders that can cause delirium, such as infections and dehydration.  A neurologic examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【25】 Mental status testing People who may have delirium are given a mental status test Mental Status When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system. \n【26】 First, they are asked questions to determine whether the main problem is being unable to pay attention.  For example, they are read a short list and asked to repeat it.  Doctors must determine whether people take in (register) what is read to them.  People with delirium cannot.  The mental status test also includes other questions and tasks, such as testing short-term and long-term memory, naming objects, writing sentences, and copying shapes.  People with delirium may be too confused, agitated, or withdrawn to respond to this test.  Testing Samples of blood and urine are usually taken and analyzed to check for disorders that doctors think may be causing delirium.  For example, abnormalities in electrolyte and blood sugar levels and liver and kidney disorders are common causes of delirium.  So doctors usually do blood tests to measure electrolyte and blood sugar levels and to evaluate how well the liver and kidneys are functioning.  If doctors suspect a thyroid disorder, tests may be done to evaluate how well the thyroid gland is functioning.  Or if doctors suspect that certain medications may be the cause, they may do tests to measure medication levels in the blood.  These tests can help determine whether the levels are high enough to have harmful effects and whether a person took an overdose.  Cultures Culture of Microorganisms Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. \n【27】 A chest x-ray may be done to determine whether pneumonia may be the cause of delirium, especially in older people who are breathing fast, whether or not they have a fever or cough.  Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually done.  Sometimes a test that records the brain's electrical activity ,electroencephalography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【28】 Electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry (using a sensor that measures oxygen levels in the blood), and a chest x-ray may be used to evaluate how well the heart and lungs are functioning.  In people with a fever or headache, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) may be done to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for analysis.  Such analysis helps doctors rule out infection of or bleeding around the brain and spinal cord as possible causes.  Treatment of Delirium Treatment of the cause General measures to manage agitation Most people who have delirium are hospitalized.  However, when the cause of delirium can be corrected readily (for example, when the cause is low blood sugar), people are observed for a short time in the emergency department and can then return home.  Treatment of the cause Once the cause is identified, it is promptly corrected or treated.  For example, doctors treat infections with antibiotics, dehydration with fluids and electrolytes given intravenously, and delirium due to stopping alcohol with benzodiazepines (as well as measures to help people not start drinking alcohol again).  Prompt treatment of the disorder causing delirium usually prevents permanent brain damage and may result in a complete recovery.  Any medications that may be making the delirium worse are stopped if possible.  General measures are also important.  The environment is kept as quiet and calm as possible.  It should be well-lit to enable people to recognize what and who is in their room and where they are.  Placing clocks, calendars, and family photographs in the room can help with orientation.  At every opportunity, staff and family members should reassure people and remind them of the time and place.  Procedures should be explained before and as they are done.  People who need glasses or hearing aids should have access to them.  People who have delirium are prone to many problems, including dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body. \n【29】 Preventing such problems requires meticulous care.  Thus, people, particularly older people, may benefit from treatment managed by an interdisciplinary team Interdisciplinary care Providing medical care to older people can be complicated. \n【30】 Management of agitation People who are extremely agitated or who have hallucinations may injure themselves or their caregivers.  The following measures can help prevent such injuries: Family members are encouraged to stay with the person.  The person is put in a room near the nurses’ station.  The hospital may provide an attendant to stay with the person.  The person's medication regimen is simplified as much as possible.  Devices, such as intravenous lines, bladder catheters, or padded restraints, are not used if possible because they can further confuse and upset the person, increasing the risk of injury.  However, sometimes during hospitalization, padded restraints must be used—for example, to keep the person from pulling out intravenous lines and to prevent falls.  Restraints are applied carefully by a staff member trained in their use, released at frequent intervals, and stopped as soon as possible because they can upset the person and worsen agitation.  Medications are used to manage agitation only after all other measures have been ineffective. \n【31】 However, they may prolong or worsen agitation, and some have anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? , including confusion, blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, light-headedness, difficulty starting and continuing to urinate, and loss of bladder control.  Newer antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine have fewer side effects than older antipsychotics, such as haloperidol.  But if used for a long time, the newer medications may cause weight gain and abnormal fat (lipid) levels ,hyperlipidemia Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.  Lifestyle, genetics, disorders  and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【32】 In older people with psychosis and dementia, these medications may increase the risk of stroke, and death.  Benzodiazepines (a type of sedative Drugs Used to Treat Anxiety Disorders ), such as lorazepam, are used when delirium is due to withdrawal from a sedative or alcohol.  Benzodiazepines are not used to treat delirium caused by other conditions because they can make people, particularly older people, more confused, drowsy, or both.  Doctors are careful when prescribing these medications, particularly for older people.  They use the lowest dose possible and stop the medication as soon as possible.  Prognosis for Delirium Most people with delirium recover fully if the condition causing delirium is rapidly identified and treated.  Any delay decreases the chance of a full recovery.  Even when delirium is treated, some symptoms may persist for many weeks or months, and improvement may occur slowly.  In some people, delirium evolves into chronic brain dysfunction similar to dementia.  Hospitalized people who have delirium are more likely to develop complications in the hospital (including death) than those who do not have delirium.  About 35 to 40% of people who have delirium while in a hospital die within 1 year, but the cause of death is often another serious disorder, not delirium itself.  Hospitalized people who have delirium, particularly older people, have a longer hospital stay, higher treatment costs, and a longer recovery time after they leave the hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:12:49"}

However, some people have disorders that cause them to bruise or bleed too easily.  Sometimes people bleed without any obvious triggering event or injury.  Spontaneous bleeding may occur in almost any part of the body, but it is most common in the nose and mouth and the digestive tract.  People with hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in one of two blood clotting factors: factor VIII or factor IX. \n【1】 Most often, bleeding is minor, but it can be severe enough to be life-threatening.  However, even minor bleeding is dangerous if it occurs in the brain.  Several symptoms may suggest that a person has a bleeding disorder: Unexplained nosebleeds (epistaxis) Excessive or prolonged menstrual blood flow (menorrhagia) Prolonged bleeding after minor cuts, blood drawing, minor surgical or dental procedures, or tooth brushing or flossing Unexplained skin marks, including tiny red or purple dots (petechiae), red or purple patches (purpura), bruises (ecchymoses), or small blood vessels that are widened and therefore visible in the skin or mucous membranes (telangiectasias) Skin Symptoms That Suggest a Bleeding Disorder Telangiectasias on the Hand  Petechiae (Mouth) Petechiae are small red spots as seen here in the mouth.   Ecchymoses (Bruises) Ecchymoses are large purple bruises seen here on the leg.   Sometimes a laboratory test done for some other reason shows the person has a susceptibility to bleeding. \n【2】 An abnormality in any of these factors can lead to excessive bleeding or bruising: Platelet disorders Overview of Platelet Disorders Platelets (sometimes called thrombocytes) are cell fragments produced in the bone marrow that circulate in the bloodstream and help blood to clot. \n【3】 The deficiency can cause bleeding; therefore, all newborns should be given a vitamin K injection. \n【4】 Later, if the disorder becomes severe, bleeding may occur.  A decrease in blood clotting factors usually causes bleeding and bruising.  Defects in blood vessels usually cause red or purple spots and patches on the skin, rather than bleeding.  Senile purpura and purpura simplex Most commonly, easy or excessive bruising occurs because the skin and blood vessels are fragile.  Women are commonly affected with purpura simplex is increased bruising that is due to fragile blood vessels.  Purpura simplex is extremely common.  The cause is not known. \n【5】 Older people are commonly affected with senile purpura.  Bruises tend to develop on the thighs, buttocks, and upper arms.  However, people have no other symptoms of excessive bleeding, and blood test results are normal.  These conditions are not serious, and no treatment is needed.  Common causes Overall, the most common causes of easy bleeding include Severe platelet deficiency Use of drugs that inhibit clotting , including heparin, warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants Liver disease (causing inadequate production of clotting factors) Platelet deficiency can be due to inadequate production of platelets by the bone marrow or excessive destruction of platelets .  People who have a tendency to form blood clots may take heparin, warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (including dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) to decrease that tendency .  However, sometimes these drugs decrease the body's clotting ability too much, and people have bleeding and/or bruising.  The liver is a major site of blood clotting factor production, and helps to regulate blood clotting, and so people with liver disease ,for example, hepatitis Overview of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.   Hepatitis is common throughout the world. \n【6】 Less common causes Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in one of two blood clotting factors: factor VIII or factor IX. \n【7】 People have excessive bleeding into deep tissues such as muscles, joints, and the back of the abdominal cavity, usually following minor trauma.  Bleeding may occur in the brain, which can be fatal.  Certain disorders trigger the clotting system throughout the body.  Instead of causing blood clots everywhere, platelets and clotting factors are quickly used up and bleeding occurs.  This process, called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream, blocking small blood vessels. \n【8】 People with DIC are often already in a hospital.  They bleed excessively from needle punctures and often have significant digestive tract bleeding.   Evaluation of Bruising and Bleeding Doctors first try to establish whether the person's symptoms actually represent easy or excessive bleeding.  If so, they look for possible causes.  The following information can help people know when to see a doctor and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs In people with easy bruising or bleeding, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.  They include Symptoms of serious blood loss, such as sweating, weakness, faintness or dizziness, nausea, or extreme thirst Pregnancy or recent delivery Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, diarrhea, or feeling ill all over Headache, confusion, or other sudden symptoms related to the brain or nervous system When to see a doctor People with warning signs should see a doctor right away, as should those who are still bleeding and those who have lost more than a small amount of blood.  People without warning signs who notice that they bleed or bruise easily should call their doctor.  The doctor determines how quickly to evaluate people based on their symptoms and other factors.  Typically, people who do not feel well or have risk factors for bleeding, such as liver disease or use of certain drugs, or who have a family history of a bleeding disorder should be seen within a day or two.  People who feel well but had a few nosebleeds that stopped on their own or who have bruises or spots on their skin can be seen when practical.  A delay of a week or so is unlikely to be harmful.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination sometimes suggests a cause of the bleeding or bruising, but typically tests need to be done.  Doctors ask about types of bleeding, including frequent nosebleeds, gum bleeding while tooth brushing, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), blood in stool or urine, or dark tarry stool (melena).  They also ask about other symptoms, including abdominal pain and diarrhea (suggesting a digestive disorder), joint pain (suggesting a connective tissue disorder), and lack of menstrual periods and morning sickness (suggesting pregnancy).  They ask about whether the person is taking drugs (such as aspirin, indomethacin, heparin, or warfarin) that are known to increase the risk of bleeding.  Easy bleeding in a person taking warfarin, especially if the dose has recently increased, is likely due to the drug.  Doctors also ask if the person has a condition that is likely to cause a problem with blood clotting, such as Severe infection, cancer, liver disease Overview of Liver Disease can manifest in many different ways. \n【9】 Heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for liver disease, and IV drug use is a risk factor for HIV infection.  People with a family history of excessive bleeding are likely to have an inherited bleeding disorder such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a hereditary disorder in which blood vessels are malformed, making them fragile and prone to bleeding. \n【10】 However, not all people with these disorders know about a family history of the disorder.  During the physical examination, doctors check vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate).  These signs can give an early indication of serious disorders, especially low blood volume or an infection.  A high heart rate together with low blood pressure suggests low blood volume due to bleeding.  Fever suggests an infection.  Doctors examine the skin and mucous membranes (nose, mouth, and vagina) looking for signs of bleeding.  A digital rectal examination is done to look for bleeding from the digestive tract.  Doctors also look for signs, such as tenderness during movement and local swelling, that may indicate bleeding in deeper tissues.  A person with bleeding inside the head may have confusion, a stiff neck, or neurologic abnormalities (such as headache, vision problems or weakness).  The sites of bleeding may offer a clue to the cause.  Bleeding from superficial sites, including skin and mucous membranes, suggests a problem with platelets or blood vessels.  On the other hand, bleeding into deep tissues suggests a problem with clotting.  Additional findings may help doctors narrow the cause.  Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and yellow color of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice) suggest bleeding caused by liver disease.  A woman who is pregnant or has recently delivered or a person who is in shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow to the organs is low, decreasing delivery of oxygen and thus causing organ damage and sometimes death. \n【11】 A rash on the legs, joint pain, and digestive upset suggest immunoglobulin─A associated vasculitis Immunoglobulin A–Associated vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is inflammation of mainly small blood vessels that most often occurs in children. \n【12】 Testing Most people with excessive bleeding require blood tests.  The initial tests are Complete blood count Doctors select tests to help diagnose blood disorders based on the person's symptoms and the results of the physical examination. \n【13】 They are done to determine whether the clotting system is normal.  If one of these tests reveals an abnormality, additional tests are usually needed to identify the cause.  Other blood tests may be needed to confirm bleeding caused by HIV infection or hepatitis.  A bone marrow biopsy Bone Marrow Examination Red blood cells, most white blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow, the soft fatty tissue inside bone cavities. \n【14】 Imaging tests are often done to detect internal bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.  For example, computed tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【15】 Abdominal CT is done in people with abdominal pain.  Tests of the Blood Clotting System Common. MultimediaPopup. LabTest Treatment of Bruising and Bleeding The specific treatment for easy bruising and bleeding depends on the cause.  For example, Cancers and infections are treated Causative drugs are stopped Vitamins are given for vitamin deficiency People with liver disease are sometimes given vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma transfusions People with more serious bleeding need intravenous fluids and sometimes blood transfusions Overview of Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or a blood component from one healthy person (a donor) to a sick person (a recipient). \n【16】 Once the deficient factor is identified, the person can be given a transfusion of that clotting factor Blood clotting factors Hemostasis is the body's way of stopping injured blood vessels from bleeding.  Hemostasis includes clotting of the blood. \n【17】 People with easy bruising due to skin and blood vessel fragility do not need to be treated, although doctors sometimes suggest that people avoid taking aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Essentials for Older People may be more prone to easy bruising.  As people age, the skin thins and people lose some of the protective layer of fat below the skin surface.  So a minor bump is more likely to cause blood vessels to break, leading to bruising.  Also, the small blood vessels themselves become less elastic and more fragile, leading to easier bruising.  Older people also are more likely to take aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants, which make bruising and bleeding more likely.  Key Points Excessive bleeding may occur on its own or after minor injury.  Bleeding can range from minimal to massive and is very dangerous if it occurs within the brain.  Liver disease, low platelet count, and certain drugs (especially warfarin, heparin, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) are common causes.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an uncommon but serious cause that most often develops in people who are already ill or in the hospital.  Easy bruising is common and is rarely a cause for concern if people feel well and have no other signs of easy bleeding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:57:21"}

Diagnosis is clinical.  Treatment involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents.  Psoriatic arthritis develops in about 30% of patients with psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales. \n【2】 Prevalence is increased in patients with AIDS.  Risk is increased in patients with human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) or some other specific alleles (HLA-Cw6, HLA-B38, HLA-B39, HLA-DR) in family members.  Etiology and pathophysiology of psoriatic arthritis are unknown.  Symptoms and Signs of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriasis of the skin or nails may precede or follow joint involvement.  Severity of the joint and skin disease is often discordant.  Also, skin lesions may be hidden in the scalp, ears, gluteal folds, or umbilicus and go unrecognized by the patient.  Peripheral psoriatic arthritis may involve small, medium, and large joints with a high tendency to affect distal interphalangeal joints of fingers and toes.  It may manifest in different patterns such as asymmetric oligoarthritis, symmetric polyarthritis (which can be confused with rheumatoid arthritis), and arthritis mutilans that is characterized by rapid destructive arthritis with telescoping of the digits.  Joint and skin symptoms may lessen or worsen simultaneously.  Inflammation of the flexor tendons of fingers, toes, or both may lead to sausage-shaped deformities (dactylitis), which are not present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.  Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【3】 Rheumatoid nodules are absent.  Arthritic remissions tend to be more frequent, rapid, and complete than in rheumatoid arthritis, but progression to chronic arthritis and crippling may occur.  Enthesopathy (inflammation at tendinous insertion into bone—eg, Achilles tendinitis, patellar tendinitis, elbow epicondyles, spinous processes of the vertebrae) can develop and cause pain and swelling.  Axial involvement may be present, especially in male patients with positive HLA-B27, and usually manifests as asymmetric involvement of the sacroiliac joints. \n【4】 Also apparent are pitting of the nails and salmon patches on the skin. \n【5】  This appearance is typical of plaque psoriasis. \n【6】 Diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis Clinical evaluation Rheumatoid factor (RF) Psoriatic arthritis should be suspected in patients with both psoriasis and arthritis.  Because psoriasis may be overlooked or hidden or develop only after arthritis occurs, psoriatic arthritis should be considered in any patient with seronegative inflammatory arthritis, particularly with involvement of distal interphalangeal joints, asymmetric or lower spine involvement, or presence of enthesitis and/or dactylitis: these patients should be examined for psoriasis and nail pitting and should be questioned about a family history of psoriasis.  Patients suspected of having psoriatic arthritis should be tested for RF.  Occasionally, RF test results can be positive.  However, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【7】 Psoriatic arthritis is diagnosed clinically and by excluding other disorders that can cause such similar manifestations.  X-ray findings common in psoriatic arthritis include distal interphalangeal joint involvement; resorption of terminal phalanges and cupping of proximal phalanges; arthritis mutilans; and extensive destruction, proliferative bone reaction, a sausage-like appearance to digits, and dislocation of large and small joints.  The main distinguishing features from rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to the presence of psoriasis, include findings of dactylitis, joint asymmetry, distal interphalangeal and sacroiliac joint involvement, and more prominent enthesitis.  Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs—particularly methotrexate), apremilast, and biologic agents (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha antagonists, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, abatacept, and guselkumab) For axial disease, biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha antagonists, secukinumab, ixekizumab, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and consideration of the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab Treatment of psoriatic arthritis is directed at controlling skin lesions Treatment Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease that manifests most commonly as well-circumscribed, erythematous papules and plaques covered with silvery scales. \n【8】 A treat-to-target approach to achieve full disease remission or minimal disease activity has been suggested and can be assessed at each visit by using the disease activity index for psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA) or minimal disease activity (MDA) scores .  Drug therapy has been similar to that for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【9】 Hydroxychloroquine is inconsistently of benefit and may cause exfoliative dermatitis or aggravate underlying psoriasis.  Benefit may be gained from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【10】 TNF-alpha antagonists have been particularly effective.  Methotrexate 10 to 15 mg orally once/week (with folic acid 1 mg orally once/day) is given.  If tolerated but not adequate, the dosage of methotrexate is increased after 3- to 5-week intervals to a maximum of 25 mg orally or by injection once/week (oral bioavailability decreases above 15 mg in a single dose).  In some patients, skin is more responsive than the joints to methotrexate.  Sulfasalazine is usually given as enteric-coated tablets.  Benefit should occur within 3 months.  Enteric coating or dose reduction may increase tolerability.  Because neutropenia may occur early, complete blood count (CBC) should be obtained after 1 to 2 weeks and then about every 12 weeks during therapy.  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be obtained at about 6-month intervals and whenever the dose is increased.  Response has been inconsistent.  Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that is effective for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  The initial dosage is 10 mg orally once/day, titrated to the maintenance dose of 30 mg orally twice a day as tolerated.  Adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, headache, depression, and weight loss.  Skin is often more responsive to this medication than the joints.  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab, and their biosimilars) reduce the progression of joint damage .  TNF inhibitors occasionally paradoxically trigger psoriaform reactions including plaque, palmoplantar pustular, and guttate psoriasis.  Ustekinumab is an interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 antagonist.  The dosage is 45 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4 (loading dosages) followed by 45 mg every 12 weeks thereafter.  The dosage is 90 mg subcutaneously if the patient weighs > 100 kg.  Adverse effects are similar to those of the other biologic agents Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【11】 Guselkumab is an anti-IL-23-specific monoclonal antibody that is effective in treating moderate to severe psoriasis and has shown to be effective in treating psoriatic arthritis as well.  It is given by subcutaneous injections at a recommended dose of 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter.  Secukinumab is an IL-17 inhibitor.  Secukinumab can be given at a dosage of 150 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter.  Without the loading (weekly) dosage, secukinumab is given at 150 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.  ​If patients continue to have active psoriatic arthritis, a dose of 300 mg should be considered.  ​Secukinumab may be given with or without methotrexate.  Adverse effects include urticaria, upper respiratory infections, fungal infections due to Candida, diarrhea, herpes zoster, and worsening inflammatory bowel disease.  Ixekizumab is an IL-17A inhibitor.  It is indicated for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy as well as for adults with active psoriatic arthritis.  It may be given alone or in combination with a conventional DMARD (eg, methotrexate).  The dosage is 160 mg subcutaneously (two 80-mg injections) at week 0, followed by 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.  Ixekizumab increases the risk of upper respiratory infections and fungal infections and has also been associated with worsening symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.  Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  It is available for adults with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response to or who are intolerant of methotrexate or other DMARDs.  The dosage is 5 mg orally 2 times a day.  The extended-release dosage is 11 mg orally once/day.  Potential adverse effects include risk of infection, particularly varicella-zoster virus reactivation, increased creatinine levels, neutropenia, venous thromboembolic events, and hyperlipidemia. \n【12】 Abatacept is a soluble fusion cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) Ig.  It is available for adults with active psoriatic arthritis and can be used with or without a nonbiologic DMARD (eg, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide).  It may be given as an IV infusion or as a subcutaneous injection.  For the IV infusion, the dose is weight adjusted as follows: 500 mg for patients weighing < 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 60 to 100 kg, and 1 g for patients weighing > 100 kg.  After the initial dosage, abatacept should be given at weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter.  The subcutaneous injection dosage is 125 mg once/week.  Adverse effects include pulmonary toxicity, susceptibility to infection, headache, upper respiratory infection, sore throat, and nausea. \n【13】 Key Points Psoriatic arthritis is chronic inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that occurs in patients with psoriasis; however, psoriasis may be mild or overlooked or may have not yet developed.  Arthritis is commonly asymmetric, involves large and small joints (including axial joints), and typically affects the finger and toe distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints more than others.

Symptoms may not develop until late in the disease.  Diagnosis is by funduscopy; further details are elucidated by color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.  Treatment includes control of blood glucose and blood pressure (BP).  Ocular treatments included retinal laser photocoagulation, intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs (eg, aflibercept, ranibizumab, bevacizumab), intraocular corticosteroids, vitrectomy, or a combination.  Pathophysiology of Diabetic Retinopathy is a major cause of blindness, particularly among working-age adults.  The degree of retinopathy is highly correlated with Duration of diabetes Blood glucose levels BP levels Pregnancy can impair blood glucose control and thus worsen retinopathy.  Nonproliferative retinopathy (also called background retinopathy) develops first and causes increased capillary permeability, microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, macular ischemia, and macular edema (thickening of the retina caused by fluid leakage from capillaries).  Proliferative retinopathy develops after nonproliferative retinopathy and is more severe; it may lead to vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment.  Proliferative retinopathy is characterized by abnormal new vessel formation (neovascularization), which occurs on the inner (vitreous) surface of the retina and may extend into the vitreous cavity and cause vitreous hemorrhage.  Neovascularization is often accompanied by preretinal fibrous tissue, which, along with the vitreous, can contract, resulting in traction retinal detachment.  Neovascularization may also occur in the anterior segment of the eye on the iris; neovascular membrane growth in the anterior chamber angle of the eye at the peripheral margin of the iris can occur, and this growth leads to neovascular glaucoma.  Vision loss with proliferative retinopathy may be severe.  Clinically significant macular edema can occur with nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy and is the most common cause of vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy.  Symptoms and Signs of Diabetic Retinopathy Nonproliferative retinopathy Vision symptoms are caused by macular edema or macular ischemia.  However, patients may not have vision loss even with advanced retinopathy.  The first signs of nonproliferative retinopathy are Capillary microaneurysms Dot and blot retinal hemorrhages Hard exudates Cotton-wool spots (soft exudates) Hard exudates are discrete, yellow particles within the retina.  When present, they suggest chronic edema.  Cotton-wool spots are areas of microinfarction of the retinal nerve fiber layer that lead to retinal opacification; they are fuzzy-edged and white and obscure underlying vessels.  Signs in later stages are Macular edema  Venous dilation and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities Proliferative retinopathy Symptoms may include blurred vision, floaters (black spots) or flashing lights (photopsias) in the field of vision, and sudden, severe, painless vision loss.  These symptoms are typically caused by vitreous hemorrhage or traction retinal detachment.  Proliferative retinopathy, unlike nonproliferative retinopathy, causes formation of fine preretinal vessel neovascularization visible on the optic nerve or retinal surface.  Macular edema or retinal hemorrhage may be visible on funduscopy.  Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy Funduscopy Color fundus photography Fluorescein angiography Optical coherence tomography Diagnosis is by funduscopy.  Color fundus photography helps grade the level of retinopathy.  Fluorescein angiography is used to determine the extent of retinopathy, to develop a treatment plan, and to monitor the results of treatment.  Optical coherence tomography is also useful to assess severity of macular edema and treatment response.  Screening Because early detection is important, all patients with diabetes should have an annual dilated ophthalmologic examination.  Pregnant patients with diabetes should be examined every trimester.  Vision symptoms (eg, blurred vision) are indications for ophthalmologic referral.  Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Control of blood glucose and blood pressure (BP) For macular edema, intraocular injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs, intraocular corticosteroid implants, focal laser, and/or vitrectomy For high-risk or complicated proliferative retinopathy, anti-VEGF drugs, panretinal laser photocoagulation and sometimes vitrectomy Control of blood glucose and BP are critical; intensive control of blood glucose slows progression of retinopathy.  Clinically significant diabetic macular edema is treated with intraocular injection of anti-VEGF drugs (eg, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept) and/or with focal laser photocoagulation .  The intraocular dexamethasone implant and intravitreal triamcinolone can treat eyes with persistent macular edema.  In certain countries, an intraocular fluocinolone implant is available for patients with chronic diabetic macular edema.  Vitrectomy can help in recalcitrant diabetic macular edema.  In select cases of severe nonproliferative retinopathy, panretinal laser photocoagulation may be used; however, usually panretinal laser photocoagulation can be delayed until proliferative retinopathy develops.  Proliferative diabetic retinopathy with high-risk characteristics of vitreous hemorrhage, extensive preretinal neovascularization, or anterior segment neovascularization/neovascular glaucoma should be treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation.  Studies have also supported the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy .  These treatments significantly reduce the risk of severe vision loss. \n【1】 Prevention of Diabetic Retinopathy Control of blood glucose and blood pressure is critical; intensive control of blood glucose delays onset of retinopathy.  Key Points Features of diabetic retinopathy can include microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhage, exudates, cotton-wool spots, macular edema, macular ischemia, neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and traction retinal detachment.  Test patients who have diabetic retinopathy with color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.  Screen all diabetic patients with an annual dilated ophthalmologic examination.  Treat patients with macular edema with intraocular anti-VEGF drugs (eg, ranibizumab, aflibercept, bevacizumab), intraocular corticosteroid implants, focal laser photocoagulation, and/or vitrectomy.

Symptoms may be absent or include urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, and flank pain.  Systemic symptoms and even sepsis may occur with kidney infection.  Diagnosis is based on analysis and culture of urine.  Treatment is with antibiotics and removal of any urinary tract catheters and obstructions. \n【1】 Some are commensal organisms present among normal intestinal flora. \n【2】 Among adults aged 20 to 50 years, UTIs are about 50-fold more common in women.  In women in this age group, most UTIs are cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【3】 In men of the same age, most UTIs are urethritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【4】 The incidence of UTI increases in patients > 50 years, but the female:male ratio decreases because of the increasing frequency of prostate enlargement and instrumentation in men.  Pathophysiology The urinary tract, from the kidneys to the urethral meatus, is normally sterile and resistant to bacterial colonization despite frequent contamination of the distal urethra with colonic bacteria.  The major defense against urinary tract infection (UTI) is complete emptying of the bladder during urination.  Other mechanisms that maintain the tract’s sterility include urine acidity, the vesicoureteral valve, and various immunologic and mucosal barriers.  About 95% of UTIs occur when bacteria ascend the urethra to the bladder and, in the case of pyelonephritis, ascend the ureter to the kidney.  The remainder of UTIs are hematogenous.  Systemic infection can result from UTI, particularly in older patients.  About 6. 5% of cases of hospital-acquired bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. \n【5】 Uncomplicated UTI is usually considered to be cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【6】 Also, some experts consider UTIs to be uncomplicated even if they affect postmenopausal women or patients with well-controlled diabetes.  In men, most UTIs occur in children or older patients, are due to anatomic abnormalities or instrumentation, and are considered complicated.  The rare UTIs that occur in men aged 15 to 50 years are usually in men who have unprotected anal intercourse or in those who have an uncircumcised penis, and they are generally considered uncomplicated.  UTIs in men this age who do not have unprotected anal intercourse or an uncircumcised penis are very rare and, although also considered uncomplicated, warrant evaluation for urologic abnormalities.  Complicated UTI can involve either sex at any age.  It is usually considered to be pyelonephritis or cystitis that does not fulfill criteria to be considered uncomplicated.  A UTI is considered complicated if the patient is a child, is pregnant, or has any of the following: A structural or functional urinary tract abnormality and obstruction of urine flow Obstructive Uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy). \n【7】 Diagnosis is clinical.  Treatment is a bowel management program and perineal exercises, but sometimes colostomy is needed. \n【8】 The increased risk of UTI in women using antibiotics or spermicides probably occurs because of alterations in vaginal flora that allow overgrowth of Escherichia coli.  In older women, soiling of the perineum due to fecal incontinence is involuntary defecation. \n【9】 Anatomic, structural, and functional abnormalities are risk factors for UTI.  A common consequence of anatomic abnormality is vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【10】 VUR is usually caused by a congenital defect that results in incompetence of the ureterovesical valve.  VUR can also be acquired in patients with a flaccid bladder due to spinal cord injury or after urinary tract surgery.  Other anatomic abnormalities predisposing to UTI include urethral valves (a congenital obstructive abnormality), delayed bladder neck maturation, bladder diverticulum, and urethral duplications .  Structural and functional urinary tract abnormalities that predispose to UTI usually involve obstruction of urine flow and poor bladder emptying.  Urine flow can be compromised by calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.  They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【11】 Bladder emptying can be impaired by neurogenic dysfunction Neurogenic Bladder is bladder dysfunction (flaccid or spastic) caused by neurologic damage.  Symptoms can include overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retention. \n【12】 Apical prolapse is descent of the vaginal vault or vaginal cuff after hysterectomy. \n【13】 UTI caused by congenital factors manifests most commonly during childhood.  Most other risk factors are more common in older patients. \n【14】 Indications include the following: Helping diagnose urologic disorders  and recent surgery.  Etiology The bacteria that most often cause cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【15】 The remaining gram-negative urinary pathogens are usually other enterobacteria, typically Klebsiella or Proteus mirabilis, and occasionally Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Among gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus saprophyticus is isolated in 5 to 10% of bacterial UTIs.  Less common gram-positive bacterial isolates are Enterococcus faecalis (group D streptococci) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci), which may be contaminants, particularly if they were isolated from patients with uncomplicated cystitis.  In hospitalized patients, E.  coli accounts for about 50% of cases.  The gram-negative species Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Serratia account for about 40%, and the gram-positive bacterial cocci E.  faecalis, S.  saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus account for the remainder.  Classification Urethritis Infection of the urethra with bacteria (or with protozoa, viruses, or fungi) occurs when organisms that gain access to it acutely or chronically colonize the numerous periurethral glands in the bulbous and pendulous portions of the male urethra and in the entire female urethra.  The sexually transmitted pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Trichomonas vaginalis , and herpes simplex virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex viruses (human herpesviruses types 1 and 2) commonly cause recurrent infection affecting the skin, mouth, lips, eyes, and genitals. \n【16】 Cystitis is infection of the bladder.  It is common in women, in whom cases of uncomplicated cystitis are usually preceded by sexual intercourse (honeymoon cystitis).  In men, bacterial infection of the bladder is usually complicated and usually results from ascending infection from the urethra or prostate or is secondary to urethral instrumentation.  The most common cause of recurrent cystitis in men is chronic bacterial prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain. \n【17】 Acute urethral syndrome, which occurs in women, is a syndrome involving dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation.  Some disorders cause a painful ache over the bladder or perineum. \n【18】 However, in acute urethral syndrome (unlike in cystitis), routine urine cultures are either negative or show colony counts that are lower than the traditional criteria for diagnosis of bacterial cystitis.  Urethritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【19】 Noninfectious causes have been proposed, but supporting evidence is not conclusive, and most noninfectious causes usually cause little or no pyuria.  Possible noninfectious causes include anatomic abnormalities (eg, urethral stenosis), physiologic abnormalities (eg, pelvic floor muscle dysfunction), hormonal imbalances (eg, atrophic urethritis), localized trauma, gastrointestinal system symptoms, and inflammation.  Asymptomatic bacteriuria Urine testing is absence of UTI signs or symptoms in a patient whose urine culture satisfies criteria for UTI.  Pyuria may or may not be present.  Because it is asymptomatic, such bacteriuria is found mainly when high-risk patients are screened or when urine culture is done for other reasons.  Screening patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria is indicated for those at risk of complications if the bacteriuria is untreated.  Such patients include Pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later  Patients who have had a kidney transplant Kidney Transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation. \n【20】 If they are asymptomatic, these patients should not be screened routinely, because they are at low risk.  In patients with indwelling catheters, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria often fails to clear the bacteriuria and only leads to development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.  Acute pyelonephritis is bacterial infection of the kidney parenchyma.  The term should not be used to describe tubulointerstitial nephropathy Tubulointerstitial Nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal function. \n【21】 In women, about 20% of community-acquired bacteremias Bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. \n【22】 Pyelonephritis is uncommon in men with a normal urinary tract.  In 95% of cases of pyelonephritis, the cause is ascension of bacteria through the urinary tract.  Although obstruction  predisposes to pyelonephritis, most women with pyelonephritis have no demonstrable functional or anatomic defects.  In men, pyelonephritis is always due to some functional or anatomic defect.  Cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【23】 The risk of bacterial ascension is greatly enhanced when ureteral peristalsis is inhibited (eg, during pregnancy, by obstruction, by endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria). \n【24】 Pyelonephritis not caused by bacterial ascension is caused by hematogenous spread, which is particularly characteristic of virulent organisms such as S.  aureus, P.  aeruginosa, Salmonella species, and Candida species.  The affected kidney is usually enlarged because of inflammatory polymorphonuclear neutrophils and edema.  Infection is focal and patchy, beginning in the pelvis and medulla and extending into the cortex as an enlarging wedge.  Cells mediating chronic inflammation appear within a few days, and medullary and subcortical abscesses may develop.  Normal parenchymal tissue between foci of infection is common.  Papillary necrosis may be evident in acute pyelonephritis associated with diabetes, obstruction, sickle cell disease, pyelonephritis in renal transplants, pyelonephritis due to candidiasis, or analgesic nephropathy.  Although acute pyelonephritis is frequently associated with renal scarring in children, similar scarring in adults is not detectable in the absence of reflux or obstruction.  Symptoms and Signs Older patients and patients with a neurogenic bladder is bladder dysfunction (flaccid or spastic) caused by neurologic damage. \n【25】 Causes include almost any disorder or drug. \n【26】 When symptoms are present, they may not correlate with the location of the infection within the urinary tract because there is considerable overlap; however, some generalizations are useful.  In urethritis, the main symptoms are dysuria and, primarily in men, urethral discharge.  Discharge can be purulent, whitish, or mucoid.  Characteristics of the discharge, such as the amount of purulence, do not reliably differentiate gonococcal from nongonococcal urethritis.  Cystitis onset is usually sudden, typically with frequency, urgency, and burning or painful voiding of small volumes of urine.  Nocturia, with suprapubic pain and often low back pain, is common.  The urine is often turbid, and microscopic (or rarely gross) hematuria can occur.  A low-grade fever may develop.  Pneumaturia (passage of air in the urine) can occur when infection results from a vesicoenteric or vesicovaginal fistula or from emphysematous cystitis.  In acute pyelonephritis, symptoms may be the same as those of cystitis.  One third of patients have urinary frequency is the need to urinate many times during the day, at night (nocturia), or both but in normal or less-than-normal volumes. \n【27】 However, with pyelonephritis, symptoms typically include chills, fever, flank pain, colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  If abdominal rigidity is absent or slight, a tender, enlarged kidney is sometimes palpable.  Costovertebral angle percussion tenderness is generally present on the infected side. \n【28】 Diagnosis Urinalysis Sometimes urine culture Diagnosis by culture is not always necessary.  If done, diagnosis by culture requires demonstration of significant bacteriuria in properly collected urine. \n【29】 Urine collection is then by clean-catch or catheterization.  To obtain a clean-catch, midstream specimen, the urethral opening is washed with a mild, nonfoaming disinfectant and air dried.  Contact of the urinary stream with the mucosa should be minimized by spreading the labia in women and by pulling back the foreskin in uncircumcised men.  The first 5 mL of urine is not captured; the next 5 to 10 mL is collected in a sterile container.  A specimen obtained by catheterization is preferable in older women (who typically have difficulty obtaining a clean-catch specimen) and in women with vaginal bleeding or discharge.  Many clinicians also use catheterization to obtain a specimen if evaluation includes a pelvic examination.  Diagnosis in patients with indwelling catheters is discussed elsewhere .  Testing, particularly culturing, should be done within 2 hours of specimen collection; if not, the sample should be refrigerated.  Urine testing Microscopic examination of urine is useful but not definitive.  Pyuria is defined as ≥ 8 white blood cells (WBCs)/mcL of uncentrifuged urine, which corresponds to 2 to 5 WBCs/high-power field in spun sediment.  Most truly infected patients have > 10 WBCs/mcL.  The presence of bacteria in the absence of pyuria, especially when several strains are found, is usually due to contamination during sampling.  Microscopic hematuria occurs in up to 50% of patients, but gross hematuria is uncommon.  WBC casts, which may require special stains to differentiate from renal tubular casts, indicate only an inflammatory reaction; they can be present in pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【30】 Pyuria in the absence of bacteriuria and of urinary tract infection (UTI) is possible, for example, if patients have nephrolithiasis Urinary Calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. \n【31】 Women who have dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation. \n【32】 Dipstick tests also are commonly used.  A positive nitrite test on a freshly voided specimen (bacterial replication in the container renders results unreliable if the specimen is not tested rapidly) is highly specific for UTI, but the test is not very sensitive.  The leukocyte esterase test is very specific for the presence of > 10 WBCs/mcL and is fairly sensitive.  In adult women with uncomplicated UTI with typical symptoms, most clinicians consider positive microscopic and dipstick tests sufficient; in these cases, given the likely pathogens, cultures are unlikely to change treatment but add significant expense.  Cultures are recommended in patients whose characteristics and symptoms suggest complicated UTI or an indication for treatment of bacteriuria.  Common examples include the following: Pregnant women Postmenopausal women Men Prepubertal children Patients with urinary tract abnormalities or recent instrumentation Patients with immunosuppression or significant comorbidities Patients whose symptoms suggest pyelonephritis Symptoms and Signs Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【33】 An uncontaminated specimen must be obtained for culture.  Culture of a morning specimen is most likely to detect UTI.  Samples left at room temperature for > 2 hours can give falsely high colony counts due to continuing bacterial proliferation.  Criteria for culture positivity include isolation of a single bacterial species from a midstream, clean-catch, or catheterized urine specimen.  For asymptomatic bacteriuria, criteria for culture positivity based on the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America  are Two consecutive clean-catch, voided specimens (for men, one specimen) from which the same bacterial strain is isolated in colony counts of >105/mL Among women or men, in a catheter-obtained specimen, a single bacterial species is isolated in colony counts of > 102/mL For symptomatic patients, culture criteria are Uncomplicated cystitis in women: > 103/mL Uncomplicated cystitis in women: > 102/mL (This quantification may be considered to improve sensitivity to E.  coli. ) Acute, uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women: > 104/mL Complicated UTI: > 105/mL in women; or > 104/mL in men or from a catheter-derived specimen in women Acute urethral syndrome: > 102/mL of a single bacterial species Any positive culture result, regardless of colony count, in a sample obtained via suprapubic bladder puncture should be considered a true positive.  In midstream urine, E.  coli in mixed flora may be a true pathogen .  Occasionally, UTI is present despite lower colony counts, possibly because of prior antibiotic therapy, very dilute urine (specific gravity < 1. 003), or obstruction to the flow of grossly infected urine.  Repeating the culture improves the diagnostic accuracy of a positive result, ie, may differentiate between a contaminant and a true positive result.  Newer molecular urine testing may sometimes reveal unusual pathogens in patients with refractory or recurrent UTI.  Infection localization Clinical differentiation between upper and lower UTI is impossible in many patients, and testing is not usually advisable.  When the patient has high fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and gross pyuria with casts, pyelonephritis is highly likely.  The best noninvasive technique for differentiating bladder from kidney infection appears to be the response to a short course of antibiotic therapy.  If the urine has not cleared after 3 days of treatment, pyelonephritis should be sought.  Symptoms similar to those of cystitis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【34】 Vaginitis can often be distinguished by the presence of vaginal discharge, vaginal odor, and dyspareunia.  Men with symptoms of cystitis that do not respond to usual antimicrobial therapy may have prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain. \n【35】 Other testing Seriously ill patients require evaluation for sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【36】 Patients with abdominal pain or tenderness are evaluated for other causes of an acute abdomen Acute Abdominal Pain is common and often inconsequential.  Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is almost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease. \n【37】 Patients who have dysuria/pyuria but no bacteriuria should have testing for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), typically using nucleic acid-based testing of swabs from the urethra and cervix .  Most adults do not require assessment for structural abnormalities unless the following occur: The patient has ≥ 2 episodes of pyelonephritis.  Infections are complicated.  Nephrolithiasis is suspected.  There is painless gross hematuria or new renal insufficiency.  Fever persists for ≥ 72 hours. \n【38】 Occasionally, voiding cystourethrography, retrograde urethrography, or cystoscopy is warranted.  Urologic investigation is not routinely needed in women with symptomatic cystitis or asymptomatic recurrent cystitis, because findings do not influence therapy.  Children with UTI often require imaging. \n【39】 Treatment Antibiotics Occasionally surgery (eg, to drain abscesses, correct underlying structural abnormalities, or relieve obstruction) All forms of symptomatic bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) require antibiotics.  For patients with troublesome dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation. \n【40】 Choice of antibiotic should be based on the patient’s allergy and adherence history, local resistance patterns (if known), antibiotic availability and cost, and patient and provider tolerance for risk of treatment failure.  Propensity for inducing antibiotic resistance should also be considered.  When urine culture is done, choice of antibiotic should be modified when culture and sensitivity results are available to the most narrow-spectrum drug effective against the identified pathogen.  Surgical correction is usually required for obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy). \n【41】 Diagnosis is by MRI.  Treatment is directed at relieving compression. \n【42】 Catheter drainage of an obstructed urinary tract aids in prompt control of UTI.  Occasionally, a renal cortical abscess or perinephric abscess requires surgical drainage.  Instrumentation of the lower urinary tract in the presence of infected urine should be deferred if possible.  Sterilization of the urine before instrumentation and antibiotic therapy for 3 to 7 days after instrumentation can prevent life-threatening urosepsis.  Urethritis Sexually active patients with symptoms are usually treated presumptively for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pending test results.  A typical regimen is ceftriaxone 250 mg IM plus either azithromycin 1 g orally once or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days.  All sex partners within 60 days should be evaluated. \n【43】 Cystitis First-line treatment of uncomplicated cystitis is nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice a day for 5 days (it is contraindicated if creatinine clearance is < 60 mL/min), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 160/800 mg orally twice a day for 3 days, or fosfomycin 3 g orally once.  Less desirable choices include a fluoroquinolone or a beta-lactam antibiotic.  If cystitis recurs within a week or two, a broader spectrum antibiotic (eg, a fluoroquinolone) can be used and the urine should be cultured.  Complicated cystitis should be treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics chosen based on local pathogens and resistance patterns and adjusted based on culture results.  Urinary tract abnormalities must also be managed.  Acute urethral syndrome Treatment depends on clinical findings and urine culture results: Women with dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation. \n【44】 Women who have dysuria but neither pyuria nor bacteriuria do not have the true urethral syndrome.  They should be evaluated for noninfectious causes of dysuria.  Evaluation may include therapeutic trials, for example, of behavioral treatments (eg, biofeedback and pelvic musculature relaxation), surgery (for urethral stenosis), and drugs (eg, hormone replacement for suspected atrophic urethritis, anesthetics, antispasmodics).  Asymptomatic bacteriuria Typically, asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes, older patients, or patients with chronically indwelling bladder catheters Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections A catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a UTI in which the positive culture was taken when an indwelling urinary catheter had been in place for > 2 calendar days. \n【45】 However, patients at risk of complications from asymptomatic bacteriuria  should have any treatable causes addressed and be given antibiotics as for cystitis Treatment Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【46】 In pregnant women, only a few antibiotics can be safely used.  Oral beta-lactams, sulfonamides, and nitrofurantoin are considered safe in early pregnancy, but trimethoprim should be avoided during the 1st trimester, and sulfamethoxazole should be avoided during the 3rd trimester, particularly near parturition.  Patients with untreatable obstructive problems  may require long-term suppressive therapy.  Acute pyelonephritis Antibiotics are required.  Outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics is possible if all of the following criteria are satisfied: Patients are expected to be adherent Patients are immunocompetent Patients have no nausea or vomiting or evidence of volume depletion, or extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction, occurs as a result of loss of total body sodium. \n【47】 A 2nd option is usually TMP/SMX 160/800 mg orally twice a day for 14 days.  However, local sensitivity patterns should be considered because in some parts of the US, > 20% of E.  coli are resistant to sulfa.  Patients not eligible for outpatient treatment should be hospitalized and given parenteral therapy selected on the basis of local sensitivity patterns.  First-line antibiotics are usually renally excreted fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin.  Other choices, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin, the aminoglycoside plazomicin , broad-spectrum cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime), aztreonam, beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations (ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam), and imipenem/cilastatin, are usually reserved for patients with more complicated pyelonephritis (eg, with obstruction, calculi, resistant bacteria, or a hospital-acquired infection) or recent urinary tract instrumentation.  Parenteral therapy is continued until defervescence and other signs of clinical improvement occur.  In > 80% of patients, improvement occurs within 72 hours.  Oral therapy can then begin, and the patient can be discharged for the remainder of a 7- to 14-day treatment course.  Complicated cases require longer courses of IV antibiotics with total duration of 2 to 3 weeks and urologic correction of anatomic defects.  Outpatient management can be considered in pregnant women with pyelonephritis, but only if symptoms are mild, close follow-up is available, and (preferably) pregnancy is < 24 weeks' gestation.  Outpatient treatment is with cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone 1 to 2 g IV or IM, then cephalexin 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 10 days).  Otherwise, 1st-line IV antibiotics include cephalosporins, aztreonam, or ampicillin plus gentamicin.  If pyelonephritis is severe, possibilities include piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem.  Fluoroquinolones and TMP/SMX should be avoided.  Because recurrence is common, some authorities recommend prophylaxis after the acute infection resolves with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally or cephalexin 250 mg orally every night during the remainder of the pregnancy and for 4 to 6 weeks after pregnancy. \n【48】 Prevention In women with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), physical examination should include pelvic examination to detect manageable conditions, such as vulvovaginal atrophy, urethral diverticulum, fecal incontinence is involuntary defecation. \n【49】 Men with recurrent UTI should be evaluated for prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain. \n【50】 In women who experience ≥ 3 urinary tract infections (UTIs)/year, behavioral measures are recommended, including increasing fluid intake, avoiding spermicides and diaphragm use, not delaying urination, wiping front to back after defecation, avoiding douching, and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse.  If these techniques are unsuccessful, antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered.  Common options are continuous and postcoital prophylaxis.  Although some evidence shows that cranberry products prevent UTI in women, others do not; the optimal dose is unknown; and they can have high amounts of oxalates (possibly increasing risk of oxalate stones).  Thus, most experts do not recommend use of cranberry products for prevention of symptomatic UTI in women .  Continuous prophylaxis commonly begins with a 6-month trial.  If UTI recurs after 6 months of prophylactic therapy, prophylaxis may be reinstituted for 2 or 3 years.  Choice of antibiotic depends on susceptibility patterns of prior infections.  Common options are trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 40/200 mg orally once a day or 3 times a week, nitrofurantoin 50 or 100 mg orally once a day, cephalexin 125 to 250 mg orally once a day, and fosfomycin 3 g orally every 10 days.  Fluoroquinolones are effective but are not usually recommended because resistance is increasing.  Also, fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in pregnant women and children.  Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated if creatinine clearance is < 60 mL/min.  Long-term use can rarely cause damage to the lungs, liver, and nervous system.  Methenamine has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the prevention of UTI in older adults with CrCl > 30 ml/min .  Postcoital prophylaxis in women may be more effective if UTIs are temporally related to sexual intercourse.  Usually, a single dose of one of the drugs used for continuous prophylaxis (other than fosfomycin) is effective.  Contraception is recommended for women using a fluoroquinolone because these drugs can potentially injure a fetus.  Although concern exists that antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, pharmacokinetic studies have not shown a significant or consistent effect.  Nonetheless, some experts still recommend that women who use oral contraceptives use barrier contraceptives while they are taking antibiotics.  In pregnant women, effective prophylaxis of UTI is similar to that in nonpregnant women, including use of postcoital prophylaxis.  Appropriate patients include those with acute pyelonephritis during a pregnancy, patients with > 1 episode (despite treatment) of UTI or bacteriuria during pregnancy, and patients who required prophylaxis for recurrent UTI before pregnancy.  In postmenopausal women, antibiotic prophylaxis is similar to that described previously.  Additionally, topical estrogen therapy markedly reduces the incidence of recurrent UTI in women with atrophic vaginitis or atrophic urethritis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义重复#0#45#Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys.  重复出现多次\n语义重复#16#49#prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain 重复出现多次\n ", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 23:30:26"}

Excessive daytime sleepiness refers to being unusually sleepy or falling asleep during the day.   Insomnia can be a disorder or can be a symptom of other disorders.  Excessive daytime sleepiness is not a disorder but a symptom of various sleep-related disorders.  Difficulty falling and staying asleep and waking up earlier than desired are common among young and old.  About 10% of adults have long-standing (chronic) insomnia, and about 30 to 50% sometimes have insomnia.  most half of people have insomnia at one time or another.  Prescription sleep aids and over-the-counter sleep aids that contain diphenhydramine are not good choices for treating insomnia.  The best treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy, which includes changes in behavior to improve sleep.  When sleep Overview of Sleep is necessary for survival and good health, but why sleep is needed and exactly how it benefits people are not fully understood. \n【2】 People with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness are sleepy, tired, and irritable during the day and have trouble concentrating and functioning.  People with excessive daytime sleepiness may fall asleep when working or driving.  There are different types of insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia): Commonly, people have difficulty falling asleep when they cannot let their mind relax and they continue to think and worry.  Sometimes the body is not ready for sleep at what is considered a usual time for sleep.  That is, the body’s internal clock is out of sync with the earth’s cycle of light and dark—as can occur with many types of circadian rhythm sleep disorders occur when people’s internal sleep-wake schedule (clock) does not align with the earth’s cycle of darkness (night) and light (day). \n【3】 Difficulty staying asleep and waking up earlier than desired (sleep maintenance insomnia): People with this type of insomnia fall asleep normally but wake up several hours later and cannot fall asleep again easily.  Sometimes they drift in and out of a restless, unsatisfactory sleep.  Sleep maintenance insomnia is more common among older people, who are more likely to have difficulty staying asleep than are younger people. \n【4】 This type of insomnia may be a sign of depression in people of any age.  Causes of Insomnia and EDS Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness may be caused by conditions inside or outside the body.  Some conditions cause insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, and some cause one or the other.  Some people have chronic insomnia that has little or no apparent relationship to any particular cause.  Genetic factors may be involved.  Common causes Insomnia is most often caused by Poor sleep habits, such as drinking a caffeinated beverage in the late afternoon or evening, exercising late at night, or having an irregular sleep-wake schedule Mental health disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders Other disorders such as heart and lung disorders, disorders that affect muscles or bones, or chronic pain Stress, such as that due to hospitalization, loss of a job, or a death in the family (called adjustment insomnia) Excessive worrying about sleeplessness and another day of fatigue (called psychophysiologic insomnia) Sleeping late or napping to make up for lost sleep may make sleeping during the next night even harder. \n【5】 About 80% of people with major depression have excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia, and about 40% of people with chronic insomnia have a mental health disorder, usually depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【6】 Any disorder that causes pain or discomfort, particularly if worsened by movement, can cause brief awakenings and interfere with sleep.  Less common causes Drugs, when used for a long time or when stopped (withdrawal), can cause insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness.   Many mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs can cause abnormal movements during sleep and may disturb sleep.  Sedatives that are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia can cause irritability and apathy and reduce mental alertness.  Also, if a sedative is taken for more than a few days, stopping the sedative can make the original sleep problem suddenly worse.  Sometimes the cause is a sleep disorder. \n【7】 It also occurs in people who have other disorders (such as a heart disorder) or who take certain drugs.  Central or obstructive sleep apnea causes breathing to become shallow or to stop repeatedly throughout the night. \n【8】 Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Periodic limb movement disorder involves repetitive movements of the arms, legs, or both during sleep. \n【9】 As a result, people are sleepy during the day.  Typically, people with periodic limb movement disorder are unaware of their movements and the brief awakenings that follow.  Restless legs syndrome Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Periodic limb movement disorder involves repetitive movements of the arms, legs, or both during sleep. \n【10】 People usually also have creepy, crawly sensations in the limbs.  Evaluation of Insomnia and EDS Usually, the cause of insomnia can be identified based on the person's description of the current problem and results of a physical examination.  Many people have obvious problems, such as poor sleep habits, stress, or coping with shift work.  Warning signs Certain symptoms are cause for concern: Falling asleep while driving or during other potentially dangerous situations Frequently falling asleep without warning Stopping breathing during sleep or waking up with gasping or choking (reported by a bed partner) Moving violently or injuring self or others during sleep Sleepwalking A heart or lung disorder that is constantly changing (is unstable) Attacks of muscle weakness  A recent stroke When to see a doctor People should see a doctor soon if they have warning signs or if their sleep-related symptoms interfere with their daily activities.  If healthy people have sleep-related symptoms for a short time (less than 1 or 2 weeks) but do not have warning signs, they can try changes in behavior Sleep hygiene The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. \n【11】 If these changes do not help after a week or so, people should see a doctor.  What the doctor does The doctor asks people about the following: Their sleep patterns Habits around bedtime Use of drugs (including recreational drugs) Use of other substances (such as alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco) Degree of stress Medical history (including disorders that can interfere with sleep) Level of physical activity Disorders that interfere with sleep include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders. \n【12】 People may be asked to keep a sleep log.  In it, they record a detailed description of their sleep habits, with sleep and wake times (including awakening during the night), use of naps, and any problems with sleeping.  When considering the diagnosis of insomnia, the doctor considers that some people need less sleep than others.  If people have excessive daytime sleepiness, the doctor may ask them to fill out a questionnaire indicating how likely they are to fall asleep in various situations.  The doctor may ask their sleep partner to describe any abnormalities that occur during sleep, such as snoring and pauses in breathing.  A physical examination is done to check for disorders that can cause insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness, particularly obstructive sleep apnea.  Testing Tests are not needed if symptoms suggest a cause such as poor sleep habits, stress, shift work disorder, or restless leg syndrome (an irresistible urge to move the legs or arms just before or during sleep).  Doctors sometimes refer people to a sleep disorders specialist for evaluation in a sleep laboratory. \n【13】 Other tests are sometimes also done.  Polysomnography is usually done overnight in a sleep laboratory, which may be located in a hospital, clinic, hotel room, or other facility that is equipped with a bed, bathroom, and monitoring equipment.  Electrodes are pasted to the scalp and face to record the brain's electrical activity ,electroencephalography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【14】 Applying these electrodes is painless.  The recordings help provide doctors with information about sleep stages.  Electrodes are also attached to other areas of the body to record heart rate ,electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded. \n【15】 A painless clip is attached to a finger or an ear to record oxygen levels in the blood.  Polysomnography can detect breathing disorders (such as obstructive or central sleep apnea), seizure disorders, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and unusual movements and behaviors during sleep (parasomnias).  Polysomnography is now commonly done in the home to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, but not any other sleep disorders.  A multiple sleep latency test is done to distinguish between physical fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness and to check for narcolepsy.  People spend the day in a sleep laboratory.  They are given the opportunity to take five naps at 2-hour intervals.  They lie in a darkened room and are asked to take a nap.  Polysomnography is used as part of this test to assess how quickly people fall asleep.  It detects when people fall asleep and is used to monitor the stages of sleep during the naps.  The maintenance of wakefulness test is used to determine how well people can remain awake while sitting in a quiet room.  This test helps determine how severe daytime sleepiness is and whether people can safely do their usual daily activities (such as driving a car).  Tests to evaluate the heart, lungs, and liver may be done in people with excessive daytime sleepiness if symptoms or results from the physical examination suggest that another disorder is the cause.  Treatment of Insomnia and EDS Treatment of insomnia depends on its cause and severity but typically involves a combination of the following: Treatment of disorders contributing to insomnia Good sleep hygiene Cognitive-behavioral therapy Sleep aids If insomnia results from another disorder, that disorder is treated.  Such treatment may improve sleep.  For example, if people have insomnia and depression, treating the depression often relieves the insomnia.  Some antidepressant drugs also have sedative effects that help with sleep when the drugs are given before bed.  However, these drugs may also cause daytime sleepiness, particularly in older people.  Good sleep hygiene The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. \n【16】 But if daytime sleepiness and fatigue develop, especially if they interfere with daytime functioning, additional treatment is warranted, mainly counseling  and sometimes prescription sleep aids The most commonly reported sleep-related problems are insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. \n【17】 If people are considering taking an over-the-counter sleep aid, they should first talk to their doctor because these drugs can have significant side effects.  Alcohol is not an appropriate sleep aid and may actually interfere with sleep.  It produces an unrefreshing sleep with many awakenings during the night.  Sleep hygiene focuses on changes in behavior to help improve sleep.  These changes include limiting the amount of time spent in bed, establishing a regular sleep/wake schedule, and doing things to relax before going to bed (such as reading or taking a warm bath).  Limiting the amount of time spent in bed is intended to help eliminate long periods of being awake in the middle of the night.   Cognitive-behavioral therapy, done by a trained sleep therapist, may help people when insomnia interferes with daily activities and when changes in behavior to help improve sleep (good sleep hygiene) alone are ineffective.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy is typically done in four to eight individual or group sessions but can be done remotely through the Internet or by telephone.  The effects of this therapy last a long time after therapy ends.  The therapist helps people change their behavior to improve sleep.  The therapist asks people to keep a sleep diary.  In the diary, people record how well and how long they sleep as well as any behavior that might interfere with sleep (such as eating or exercising late at night, consuming alcohol or caffeine, feeling anxious, or being unable to stop thinking when trying to sleep).  Therapists may recommend limiting the amount of time spent in bed so that people spend less time lying in bed and trying unsuccessfully to sleep.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help people understand their problem, unlearn bad sleeping habits, and eliminate unhelpful thoughts, such as worrying about losing sleep or the next day’s activities.  This therapy also includes relaxation training, which may involve techniques such as visual imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and breathing exercises.  Prescription sleep aids When a sleep disorder interferes with normal activities and a sense of well-being, occasionally taking prescription sleep aids (also called hypnotics or sleeping pills) for up to a few weeks may help.  Among the most commonly used sleep aids are sedatives, minor tranquilizers, and antianxiety drugs Misuse of Antianxiety Medications and Sedatives Antianxiety and sedative medications are prescription drugs used to relieve anxiety and/or help with sleep, but their use can result in dependency and a substance use disorder. \n【18】 Most sleep aids require a doctor’s prescription because they may cause problems.  Loss of effectiveness: Once people become accustomed to a sleep aid, it may become ineffective.  This effect is called tolerance.  Withdrawal symptoms: If a sleep aid is taken for more than a few days, stopping it suddenly can make the original sleep problem worse (causing rebound insomnia) and can increase anxiety.  Thus, doctors recommend reducing the dose slowly over a period of several weeks until the drug is stopped.  Habit-forming or addiction potential: If people use certain sleep aids for more than a few days, they may feel that they cannot sleep without them.  Stopping the drug makes them anxious, nervous, and irritable or causes disturbing dreams.  Potential for overdose: If taken in higher than recommended doses, some of the older sleep aids can cause confusion, delirium, dangerously slow breathing, a weak pulse, blue fingernails and lips, and even death.  Serious side effects: Most sleep aids, even when taken at recommended doses, are particularly risky for older people and for people with breathing problems because sleep aids tend to suppress areas of the brain that control breathing.  Some can reduce daytime alertness, making driving or operating machinery hazardous.  Sleep aids are especially dangerous when taken with other drugs that can cause daytime drowsiness and suppress breathing, such as alcohol, opioids (narcotics), antihistamines, or antidepressants.  The combined effects are more dangerous.  Rarely, especially if taken at higher than recommended doses or with alcohol, sleep aids have been known to cause people to walk or even drive during sleep and to cause severe allergic reactions.  Sleep aids also increase the risk of falls at night.  Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used sleep aids.  Some benzodiazepines (such as flurazepam) are longer acting than others (such as temazepam and triazolam).  Doctors try to avoid prescribing long-acting benzodiazepines for older people.  Older people cannot metabolize and excrete drugs as well as younger people.  Thus for them, taking these drugs may be more likely to cause daytime drowsiness, slurred speech, falls, and occasionally confusion.  Other useful sleep aids are not benzodiazepines but affect the same areas of the brain as benzodiazepines.  These drugs (eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem) are shorter acting than most benzodiazepines and are less likely to lead to daytime drowsiness.  Zolpidem also comes in a longer-acting (extended-release, or ER) form and a very short acting (low-dose) form.  Ramelteon, a newer sleep aid, has the same advantages as these shorter-acting drugs.  In addition, it can be used longer than benzodiazepines without losing its effectiveness or causing withdrawal symptoms.  It is not habit-forming and does not appear to have overdose potential.  However, it is not effective in many people.  Ramelteon affects the same area of the brain as melatonin (a hormone that helps promote sleep) and is thus called a melatonin receptor agonist.  Three relatively new drugs (daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant) can be used to treat insomnia.  They help people fall asleep and help them stay asleep.  These drugs block orexin receptors in the brain that are involved in controlling sleep.  Thus, they are called oxexin receptor blockers (antagonists).  They are taken by mouth once a day shortly before going to bed.  However, these drugs are not overly effective for treating insomnia.  The most common side effect is drowsiness.  Over-the-counter sleep aids Some sleep aids that are available without a prescription (over-the-counter, or OTC) contain antihistamines (such as doxylamine and diphenhydramine).  Antihistamines Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions) are inappropriate responses of the immune system to a normally harmless substance. \n【19】 Antihistamines may have significant side effects, such as daytime drowsiness or sometimes nervousness, agitation, difficulty urinating, falls, and confusion, especially in older people.  Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland (located in the middle of the brain), regulates the sleep-wake cycle. \n【20】 It can be used to treat insomnia.  It may be effective when sleep problems are caused by consistently going to sleep and waking up late (for example, going to sleep at 3 AM and waking up at 10 AM or later)—called delayed sleep phase disorder.  To be effective, melatonin should be taken when the body normally produces melatonin (the early evening for most people).  Use of melatonin for insomnia is controversial, but because it has few side effects, it is safe to use.  Side effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness.  Melatonin can be effective for short-term use (up to a few weeks), but the effects of using it for a long time are unknown.  Also, melatonin products are unregulated, and thus purity and content cannot be confirmed.  A doctor should supervise the use of melatonin.  Marijuana (cannabis) is a drug made from the plants Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica that contain a psychoactive chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). \n【21】 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main active ingredient in marijuana.  Synthetic cannabinoids are man-made drugs that are similar to THC. \n【22】 Many other medicinal herbs and dietary supplements, such as skullcap and valerian, are available in health food stores, but their effects on sleep and their side effects are not well-understood.  Antidepressants Some antidepressants Drug Treatment for Depression Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【23】 These drugs may be used in the rare instances when people who are not depressed cannot tolerate other sleep aids.  However, side effects, such as daytime sleepiness, can be a problem, especially for older people.  Doxepin, used as an antidepressant when given in high doses, may be an effective sleep aid when given in very low doses.  Essentials for Older People: Insomnia and EDS Because sleep patterns deteriorate as people age, older people are more likely to report insomnia than younger people.  As people age, they tend to sleep less and to awaken more often during the night and to feel sleepier and to nap during the day.  The periods of the deep sleep that are most refreshing become shorter and eventually disappear.  Usually, these changes alone do not indicate a sleep disorder in older people.  Older people who have interrupted sleep can benefit from the following: Regular bedtimes Lots of exposure to light during the day Regular exercise Less napping during the day (because napping may make getting a good night’s sleep even harder) Many older people with insomnia do not need to take sleep aids.  But if they do, they should keep in mind that these drugs can cause problems.  For example, sleep aids can cause confusion and reduce daytime alertness, making driving hazardous.  Thus, caution is required.  Key Points Poor sleep habits, stress, and conditions that disrupt people's internal sleep-wake schedule (such as shift work) cause many cases of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness.  However, sometimes the cause is a disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea or a mental disorder.  Polysomnography done in a sleep laboratory or at home is usually recommended when doctors suspect the cause is obstructive sleep apnea or another sleep disorder, when the diagnosis is uncertain, or when general measures do not help.  If insomnia is mild, changes in behavior (good sleep hygiene), such as following a regular sleep schedule, may be all that is needed.  If changes in behavior are ineffective, cognitive-behavioral therapy is usually the next step, and, if needed, short-term use of a sleep aid (up to a few weeks) may be considered.  Sleep aids are more likely to cause problems in older people and can increase the risk of falls.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:44:35"}

Physical examination of the hand involves Inspection Palpation Range of motion and strength testing Tests for impingement The overall appearance of the hand is assessed.  The hand is observed first in the position of function, or rest position; normally, the fingers are flexed uniformly and are not parallel to each other.  Instead, they converge and point to a single point on the wrist.  The hand is next observed with the fingers straight and flexed 90° at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints; normally, the fingernails should all be parallel in the same plane when viewed end-on. \n【1】 The hand is inspected for gross deformity, redness, and swelling, particularly at the MCP and interphalangeal joints.  Lesions of the skin and nails are noted, as is muscular atrophy on the dorsum of the hand between the metacarpals, and on the palm, particularly the thenar eminence and hypothenar eminence.  The hand is gently palpated for increased warmth, then is systematically palpated bimanually for tenderness over each of the bones and joints.  Use of only one finger to palpate can help isolate a tender area.  Overall range of motion and strength is tested by having the patient first make a tight fist around the examiner's 1st and 2nd fingers and then fully extending and spreading all the patient's fingers against squeezing resistance by the examiner's thumb and index finger.  Range of motion and strength of each digit is assessed, starting with the thumb individually and its ability to remain opposed to (pinched tightly against) each of the fingertips, as the examiner's index finger tries to pull through the pinch.  Each of the fingers is assessed: The posterior interosseus nerve is tested by having the patient abduct the index finger against resistance, and then the thumb.  The profundus flexor tendons are each isolated by holding the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in place and having the patient flex the fingertip (ie, distal interphalangeal [DIP] joint).  The superficialis flexor tendons flex the PIP joints.  Trigger finger Digital Flexor Tendinitis and Tenosynovitis (Trigger Finger) Digital flexor tendinitis and tenosynovitis are inflammation, sometimes with subsequent fibrosis, of tendons and tendon sheaths of the digits. \n【2】 Stability of the ulnar collateral ligament (in patients with thumb injury) is detected by stabilizing the MCP joint of the thumb with one hand and applying radial force to the tip of the thumb with the other hand.  Comparison to the unaffected side may be necessary. \n【3】 Impingement is assessed: Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.  Symptoms include pain and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution. \n【4】 In the Tinel test, tapping over the carpal tunnel causes paresthesias in the fingers innervated by the median nerve.  In the Phalen test, having the patient hold the wrist flexed at 90° for 1 minute causes paresthesias in the fingers innervated by the median nerve.  Cubital tunnel syndrome is compression or traction of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.ulnar nerve impingement in the cubital tunnel, in patients with numbness or paresthesias of the little finger, is tested for by tapping on the cubital tunnel, which will cause paresthesias in the little and ring fingers.  The cubital tunnel is between the medial epicondyle and olecranon at the elbow.  Digital nerve injury can be assessed by testing two-point discrimination at the fingertips.  A calipers or a bent paper clip is used.  The test is first demonstrated to the patient and then is done with the patient's eyes shut.  A wide gap of the calipers that the patient can clearly distinguish is used first.  Touching on the side of the fingertip, sometimes with one point only, and sometimes with two points simultaneously, the gap is gradually narrowed until the patient cannot discriminate one point from two.  The shortest distance that the patient can discriminate is measured.  The examination is repeated on the unaffected side.

Manifestations may include hyperviscosity, bleeding, recurring infections, generalized adenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Diagnosis requires bone marrow examination and demonstration of M-protein.  Treatment includes plasma exchange as needed for hyperviscosity, and systemic therapy with alkylating drugs, corticosteroids, nucleoside analogs, ibrutinib or monoclonal antibodies.   Macroglobulinemia, an uncommon B-cell cancer, is clinically more similar to a lymphomatous disease than to multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin and invade and destroy adjacent bone tissue. \n【1】 Cause is unknown, although certain gene mutations have been associated with the disorder.  Men are affected more often than women; median age is 65.  After myeloma, macroglobulinemia is the 2nd most common malignant disorder associated with a monoclonal gammopathy.  Excessive amounts of IgM M-proteins (monoclonal immunoglobulin protein, which may consist of both heavy and light chains or of only one type of chain) can also accumulate in other disorders, causing manifestations similar to macroglobulinemia. \n【2】 Additionally, IgM M-proteins are occasionally present in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by progressive accumulation of phenotypically mature malignant B lymphocytes. \n【3】 Clinical manifestations of macroglobulinemia include bleeding, recurrent infections, generalized adenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Less commonly, patients develop hyperviscosity due to the large amounts of high molecular weight monoclonal IgM proteins circulating in plasma, but most patients do not develop problems related to high IgM levels.  Some of these proteins are antibodies directed toward autologous IgG (rheumatoid factors) or I antigens (cold agglutinins).  About 10% are cryoglobulins.  Amyloidosis is any of a group of disparate conditions characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrils composed of misaggregated proteins. \n【4】 Symptoms and Signs Most patients are asymptomatic, but some present with anemia or manifestations of hyperviscosity syndrome: fatigue, weakness, skin deposits, skin and mucosal bleeding, visual disturbances, headache, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, and other changing neurologic manifestations.  An increased plasma volume can precipitate heart failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. \n【5】 Examination may disclose lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and purpura (which rarely can be the first manifestation).  Marked engorgement and localized narrowing of retinal veins, which resemble sausage links, suggests a hyperviscosity syndrome.  Retinal hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms, and papilledema occur in late stages.  Pearls & Pitfalls Marked engorgement and localized narrowing of retinal veins, which resemble sausage links, suggest a hyperviscosity syndrome.  Diagnosis Complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, red blood cell indices, and a peripheral blood smear Serum protein electrophoresis followed by serum and urine immunofixation, quantitative immunoglobulin levels, and serum free light chain levels Plasma viscosity assay Bone marrow examination, including tests for specific mutations such as MYD88 and CXCR4 Sometimes a lymph node biopsy Macroglobulinemia is suspected in patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity or other typical symptoms, particularly if anemia is present.  However, it is often diagnosed incidentally when protein electrophoresis reveals an M-protein that proves to be IgM by immunofixation.  Laboratory evaluation includes tests used to evaluate plasma cell disorders  as well as measurement of cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, and cold agglutinins; coagulation studies; and a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test.  Moderate normocytic, normochromic anemia, marked rouleau formation, and a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may occur.  Leukopenia, relative lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia are occasionally found.  Cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, or cold agglutinins may be present.  If cold agglutinins are present, the direct Coombs test usually is positive.  Various coagulation and platelet function abnormalities may occur.  Results of routine blood studies may be spurious if cold agglutinins, cryoglobulinemia, or marked hyperviscosity is present.  Normal immunoglobulins are decreased in half of the patients.  Immunofixation electrophoresis of concentrated urine frequently shows a monoclonal light chain (more often kappa [κ]), but gross Bence Jones proteinuria is unusual.  Bone marrow studies show a variable increase in plasma cells, lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and mast cells.  Periodic acid-Schiff–positive material may be present in lymphoid cells.  Lymph node biopsy, done if bone marrow examination is normal, is frequently interpreted as diffuse well-differentiated or plasmacytic lymphocytic lymphoma.  Plasma viscosity is measured to confirm suspected hyperviscosity and when present it is usually > 4. 0 (normal, 1. 4 to 1. 8 milliPascal-second).  Treatment Plasma exchange (only when hyperviscosity is present or prior to rituximab for patients with high IgM levels) Corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, nucleoside analogs, monoclonal antibodies (especially rituximab) Chemotherapy, especially the alkylating agent bendamustine in combination with rituximab Other drugs, including proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib or carfilzomib), and immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, pomalidomide, or lenalidomide), Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (eg, ibrutinib) alone or in combination with rituximab, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3) inhibitors (eg, idelasib), or a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (eg, everolimus) The course is variable, with a median survival of 7 to 10 years.  Age > 60 years, anemia, and cryoglobulinemia predict shorter survival .  Often, patients require no treatment for many years  Treatment references Macroglobulinemia is a malignant plasma cell disorder in which B cells produce excessive amounts of IgM M-proteins. \n【6】 If hyperviscosity is present, initial treatment is plasma exchange Apheresis refers to the process of separating the cellular and soluble components of blood using a machine. \n【7】 Plasma exchange often needs to be repeated.  Corticosteroids may be effective in reducing the tumor load.  Treatment with oral alkylating drugs may be indicated for palliation, but bone marrow toxicity can occur.  Nucleoside analogs (fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) produce responses in large numbers of newly diagnosed patients but have been associated with a high risk of myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia.  Rituximab can reduce tumor burden without suppressing normal hematopoiesis.  However, during the first several months, IgM levels may increase, requiring plasma exchange.  The combination of this monoclonal antibody with bendamustine is highly effective.  The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib or carfilzomib and the immunomodulating agents thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide are also effective in this cancer.  Recently, ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, and idelalisib, a PI3K inhibitor, have been shown to be highly effective for treating these patients.  The combination of ibrutinib with rituximab is especially effective as initial therapy.  Newer analogs of ibrutinib such as acalibrutinib and zanubrutinib have shown promise, decreasing disease activity and possibly causing less toxicity.  Two other classes of drugs, PI3 kinase inhibitors such as idelalisib, and mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus, have been used effectively for previously treated patients. \n【8】 Gertz MA: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia: 2021 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.

Symptoms include itching, lacrimation, discharge, and conjunctival hyperemia.  Diagnosis is clinical.  Treatment is with topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.   Etiology of Allergic Conjunctivitis is due to a type I hypersensitivity reaction Type I Allergic (including atopic) and other hypersensitivity disorders are inappropriate or exaggerated immune reactions to foreign antigens. \n【1】 Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (hay fever conjunctivitis) is caused by airborne mold spores or pollen of trees, grasses, or weeds.  It tends to peak during the spring, late summer, or early fall and disappear during the winter months—corresponding to the life cycle of the causative plant.  Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (atopic conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis) is caused by dust mites, animal dander, and other nonseasonal allergens.  These allergens, particularly those in the home, tend to cause symptoms year-round.  Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a more severe type of conjunctivitis most likely allergic in origin. \n【2】 Vernal keratoconjunctivitis typically reappears each spring and subsides in the fall and winter.  Many children outgrow the condition by early adulthood.  Symptoms and Signs of Allergic Conjunctivitis General Patients with allergic conjunctivitis report having Bilateral mild to intense ocular itching Conjunctival hyperemia Photosensitivity (photophobia in severe cases) Eyelid edema Watery or stringy discharge Concomitant rhinitis is common. \n【3】 Findings characteristically include conjunctival edema and hyperemia and a discharge.  The bulbar conjunctiva may appear translucent, bluish, and thickened.  Chemosis and a characteristic dermatoblepharitis with hyperemia, edema and lichenification of the medial upper first and then lower eyelid, are common.  Chronic itching can lead to chronic eyelid rubbing, periocular hyperpigmentation, and dermatoblepharitis.  Seasonal and perennial conjunctivitis In people with seasonal and perennial conjunctivitis, fine papillae on the upper tarsal conjunctiva give it a velvety appearance.  In more severe forms, larger tarsal conjunctival papillae, conjunctival scarring, corneal neovascularization, and corneal scarring with variable loss of visual acuity can occur.  Vernal keratoconjunctivitis Usually, the palpebral conjunctiva of the upper eyelid is involved, but the bulbar conjunctiva is sometimes affected.  In the palpebral form, square, hard, flattened, closely packed, pale pink to grayish cobblestone papillae are present in the upper tarsal conjunctiva.  The uninvolved bulbar conjunctiva is milky white.  In the bulbar (limbal) form, the circumcorneal conjunctiva becomes hypertrophied and grayish.  Discharge may be tenacious and mucoid, containing numerous eosinophils.  In 3 to 11% of patients, a corneal ulcer A corneal ulcer is a corneal epithelial defect with underlying inflammation usually due to invasion by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or Acanthamoeba. \n【4】 Other corneal changes (eg, central plaques) and white limbal deposits of eosinophils (Horner-Trantas dots) may be seen.  Diagnosis of Allergic Conjunctivitis Diagnosis of conjunctivitis and differentiation between bacterial Acute Bacterial Conjunctivitis Acute conjunctivitis can be caused by numerous bacteria.  Symptoms are hyperemia, lacrimation, irritation, and discharge. \n【5】 Symptoms include irritation, photophobia, and watery discharge. \n【6】 In allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophils are present in conjunctival scrapings, which may be taken from the lower or upper tarsal conjunctiva; however, such testing is rarely indicated.   Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis Symptomatic measures Topical antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, mast cell stabilizers, or a combination Topical corticosteroids or cyclosporine for recalcitrant cases Sometimes, oral antihistamines Avoidance of known allergens and use of cold compresses and tear supplements can reduce symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis; antigen desensitization is occasionally helpful.  Topical over-the-counter antihistamines (eg, ketotifen) are useful for mild cases.  If these drugs are insufficient, topical prescription antihistamines (eg, olopatadine, bepotastine, azelastine, cetirizine), mast cell stabilizers (eg, nedocromil, cromolyn), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ketorolac) can be used separately or in combination.  Topical corticosteroids (eg, loteprednol, fluorometholone 0. 1%, prednisolone acetate 0. 12% to 1% drops 3 times a day) can be useful in recalcitrant cases or when quick relief of symptoms is important.  Because topical corticosteroids can lead to a flare-up of latent ocular herpes simplex virus infections Herpes Simplex Keratitis is corneal infection with herpes simplex virus.  It may involve the iris. \n【7】 The main symptom is gradual, painless vision blurring.  Diagnosis is by ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination. \n【8】 Topical cyclosporine drops may be helpful. \n【9】 Oral antihistamines (eg, fexofenadine, cetirizine, or hydroxyzine) can be helpful, especially when patients experience other allergic symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea).  Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is less likely to require multiple drugs or intermittent topical corticosteroids.  Key Points Allergic conjunctivitis is usually caused by airborne allergens and can be seasonal or perennial.  Symptoms tend to include itching, eyelid edema, stringy or watery discharge, and sometimes a history of seasonal recurrence.  Treatment includes tear supplements and topical drugs (usually antihistamines, vasoconstrictors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, mast cell stabilizers, or a combination).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-16 23:55:11"}

Sugar-tong ankle splints, also called U-shaped splints, are typically used for injuries that benefit from immobilization but do not require casting.  Commercial immobilizer air-inflatable stirrups or boots may be an alternative where available.  Unlike boots, sugar-tong ankle splints are generally not designed to bear weight or be removed and replaced (eg, for bathing).  Indications Ankle sprain that should not bear weight and requires immobilization Stable fractures of distal tibia or fibula (eg, minimally displaced fractures of the distal tibia and/or fibula) Ankle dislocations (for postreduction stabilization) Selected foot fractures Contraindications Absolute contraindications None Relative contraindications Injuries (eg, certain mild sprains) in which immediate range of motion and/or weight-bearing is desirable Injuries in which a cast is preferable* * The indications for sugar-tong splints and casts overlap.   Even if casting is the definitive treatment, initial splinting is often recommended for some injuries until swelling subsides.  A cast may be preferred when weight-bearing is permitted and when the ankle clearly must be immobilized for > 1 to 2 weeks.  Conversely, immobilization boots may be preferred when continual immobilization is not required.  Complications Thermal injury (caused by the exothermic reaction of plaster and fiberglass hardening) Excessive pressure causing skin sores and/or ischemic injury Compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia.  The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury. \n【1】(4-inch) width Lukewarm water and bucket or other container for water Nonsterile gloves * Fiberglass and plaster are usually supplied as single-layer rolls, but there are also commercially available rolls of pre-constructed splints that include multiple layers of fiberglass/plaster as well as padding.  Additional Considerations Because it covers both malleoli, a sugar-tong splint may limit inversion and eversion better than a posterior splint How To Apply a Posterior Ankle Splint Ankle splints are rigid devices fastened to the ankle and used to maintain stability of the ankle joint. \n【2】 A sugar-tong splint may also prevent plantar flexion more effectively than a posterior splint.  For unstable ankle injuries, combining an ankle stirrup and posterior ankle splint can increase the stability of immobilization.  Relevant Anatomy Lateral malleolus Medial malleolus Calcaneus Bones of the ankle and foot Positioning The patient should lie prone with the knee flexed or sit with the lower leg dangling over the edge of the bed.  Maintain the ankle at 90° of flexion.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Wear nonsterile gloves.  Give the patient adequate analgesia.  Apply stockinette, covering the area from the fibular head to the midfoot.  Measure the splinting material to extend from the lateral aspect of the lower leg just below the fibular head to and around the plantar surface of the foot and back up the medial aspect of the lower leg to form a U-shaped splint.  Wrap the padding from midfoot to mid-calf, slightly beyond the area to be covered by the splint, overlap each turn by half the width of the padding, and periodically tear the wrapping across its width to decrease the risk of tissue compression.  Smooth the padding as necessary.  Consider additional padding over bony prominences (eg, medial and lateral malleoli).  Lay out a length of splint material to extend from the lateral aspect of the lower leg at mid-calf to and around the plantar surface of the foot and back up the medial aspect of the lower leg to form a U-shaped splint—it should be just shorter than the area covered by the padding.  Unroll additional splint material, folding it back and forth along the first length until there are 6 to 8 layers (when using single-layer rolls).  Immerse the splinting material in lukewarm water.  Squeeze excess water from the splinting material (do not wring out plaster).  Apply the splint material to the lateral aspect of the leg at mid-calf to and around the plantar surface of the foot and back up the medial aspect of the lower leg.  Smooth out the splinting material using your palms rather than your fingertips to conform to the contour of the lower leg and ankle and fill in the interstices in the plaster.  Wrap the elastic wrap over the splinting material distally to proximally and overlap each revolution by half the width of the elastic wrap.  Fold the extra stockinette and cotton padding over the raw edges of the splinting material.  Maintain the ankle at 90° of flexion until the splinting material hardens.  Check for distal neurovascular status (eg, capillary refill, sensation, toe flexion and extension).  Aftercare Provide crutches and training in their use.  Advise the patient to keep the splint dry.  Arrange or recommend appropriate follow-up.  Have the patient elevate the injured limb above the heart while seated or at rest.  Instruct the patient to seek further care if pain cannot be controlled with oral drugs at home.  Educate the patient about the symptoms of compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia. \n【3】 Warnings and Common Errors Do not wrap the padding or elastic too tightly (ie, neither should cause indentations in the skin).  Be sure not to let the ankle joint relax while the splint hardens so that the 90° flexion angle is lost.  Avoid irregular contours and potential pressure spots by using the palms of your hands rather than the fingertips to smooth out the splinting material.  Tips and Tricks Warm water makes plaster set quicker, so if you are unfamiliar with applying splints use cooler water to increase your working time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:27:42"}

This can make existing pain seem worse and sometimes cause pain from something that isn't usually painful.  Sometimes doctors don't know what causes someone's chronic pain.  What are the symptoms of chronic pain? You may have other symptoms along with the pain, such as: Tiredness Trouble sleeping Loss of appetite and weight Lack of interest in sex and other activities you enjoy Depression Anxiety Chronic pain can make it hard to work and do normal daily activities.  How do doctors treat chronic pain? If doctors find a cause for your pain, they treat the cause.  Doctors also treat chronic pain using: Pain medicines Pain medicine Chronic pain is pain that lasts a long time or keeps coming back for months or years. \n【2】 In hypnotherapy (hypnosis), people are guided into an advanced state of relaxation and heightened attention. \n【3】 It may include gradually going out more socially and doing more physical activities.  It may also include asking your family or co-workers to avoid things that keep you focused on the pain, such as constantly asking about your health or insisting you shouldn't do chores.  Pain medicine Depending on how severe your pain is, medicines may include: NSAIDs What are NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)? Pain is an unpleasant feeling that tells your body you might be injured.  Injuries, such as cuts, burns, fractures, sprains, and bruises, activate pain receptors around the injury. \n【4】 Pain is an unpleasant feeling that tells your body you might be injured. \n【5】 Doctors may change the doses and the times you take your medicines to help with the pain.  Opioids usually treat moderate to severe pain from cancer or injuries such as a broken bone.  They can have serious side effects, so your doctor may try other medicines first.  If your doctor prescribes opioids, your doctor will check you often to make sure you're taking them safely.  Opioids often don't work for the long term.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:26:30"}

Sometimes doctors and the mother know she has an infection, but sometimes they do not.  The mother's infection is passed to the fetus through the placenta.  Common infections that are passed on via the placenta include rubella in Newborns Rubella is a typically mild childhood viral infection that may, however, have devastating consequences for infants infected before birth.

Serum IgG4 level is often but not always elevated.  Symptoms depend on which organs are affected.  Diagnosis typically requires biopsy.  Treatment is with corticosteroids and sometimes rituximab.  IgG4 is the least common of the 4 subtypes of IgG.  Its function likely varies with the context; in allergic disease, it is thought to have an immune-inhibitory role in preventing anaphylactic reactions to allergens.  It has also been reported to have a role in autoimmunity and malignancy, but its function in these contexts is less well established.  IgG4-RD has a wide range of manifestations that are unified by their histopathologic findings and response to treatment.  Most patients are middle-aged to older men, but the disorder can affect people of any age and sex.  Pathophysiology of IgG4-Related Disease The clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD are usually tumor-like masses or organ enlargement, which result from dense tissue infiltration by immune cells and expansion of the extra-cellular matrix.  One or more organs are affected; the 11 organs considered typical of IgG4-RD include the pancreas, bile ducts, lacrimal glands, orbital tissues, salivary glands, lungs, kidneys, retroperitoneal tissues, aorta, meninges, and the thyroid gland.  Most patients have multiorgan involvement at the time of diagnosis but tend to have one dominant phenotype.  A 2019 study  identified approximately equal proportions of the following clinical phenotypes.  Pancreato-hepato-biliary disease Pancreatic involvement commonly manifests as autoimmune pancreatitis (type 1, IgG4-related) and may take the form of An obstructive pancreatic mass, with painless jaundice and diffuse pancreatic enlargement Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).  The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake. \n【1】 This combination is highly suggestive of IgG4-RD.  Retroperitoneal fibrosis and/or aortitis IgG4-RD likely accounts for most cases of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.  Fibrosis is usually circumferential around the aorta (periaortitis) or over only the anterolateral portion.  Fibrosis may extend inferiorly to the iliac vessels.  The main complication is ureteral compression causing hydronephrosis.  IgG4-RD can also cause noninfectious aortitis is inflammation of the aorta, sometimes causing aneurysm or occlusion.  Aortitis is rare, but potentially life threatening.  Its reported incidence is 1 to 3 per one million/year. \n【2】 Aortitis is occasionally complicated by aortic aneurysm Overview of Aortic Aneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries caused by weakening of the arterial wall. \n【3】 Head- and neck-limited disease Major salivary (eg, parotid and/or submandibular) and lacrimal glands are commonly affected.  Glands are painlessly enlarged bilaterally, but usually their function is not impaired.  Elevated IgG4 levels and characteristic histopathology help differentiate IgG4-RD of these organs from conditions such as Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【4】 The orbits can be affected.  IgG4-RD accounts for about 25 to 50% of cases of inflammatory orbital disease is a benign space-occupying inflammation involving orbital tissues. \n【5】 IgG4-RD can also cause orbital myositis.  Classic Mikulicz syndrome with systemic involvement IgG4-related Mikulicz syndrome is combined involvement of the lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands.  When paired with an elevated serum IgG4 level, this presentation is essentially diagnostic of IgG4-RD.  Other phenotypes Lungs and pleura may be involved, sometimes with hilar adenopathy and lung nodules that can resemble sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder resulting in noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown. \n【6】 Histopathology is essential for distinguishing these disorders. \n【7】 Renal involvement most often manifests as tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal function. \n【8】 Proteinuria, sometimes in the nephrotic range, may occur, reflecting an associated glomerulopathy, but cellular casts and/or hematuria are infrequent.  Multiple renal masses and hypocomplementemia are usually present.  Many other tissues may be involved, including the skin, prostate, meninges, and sinuses.  There is limited evidence of involvement of the brain, luminal gastrointestinal tract, spleen, bone marrow, or peripheral nerves. \n【9】 Pathology of IgG4-Related Disease IgG4-RD is characterized by a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate composed of CD3+ T cells, activated B-cells, and plasma cells with a disproportionate number expressing IgG4 (usually > 40% of all IgG expressing cells) .  Classically, inflammation progresses over time to fibrosis with a characteristic \"storiform\" or whorled pattern.  Additional features include obliterative phlebitis and a mild eosinophilic infiltrate.  Importantly, the eosinophilic component should not be more prominent than the lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.  The histopathology may differ slightly among tissues, for instance, typical storiform fibrosis is less commonly observed in lacrimal gland, parotid gland, and lung biopsies.  Most patients also have elevated serum IgG4 levels, but some have normal levels. \n【10】 Symptoms and Signs of IgG4-Related Disease Common general manifestations of IgG4-RD include lymphadenopathy is palpable enlargement of ≥ 1 lymph nodes.  Diagnosis is clinical.  Treatment is of the causative disorder. \n【11】 Weight loss is particularly common when there is multiple organ involvement and/or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  Fever is highly uncommon in IgG4-RD and should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses.  Other manifestations are specific to the affected organs.  Pancreatic involvement may be painless, sometimes with jaundice if there is an obstructing pancreatic mass, or may cause abdominal pain and nausea if acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues). \n【12】 Retroperitoneal fibrosis most often manifests with flank or back pain but is often asymptomatic and identified incidentally on abdominal imaging.  Aortitis is almost always asymptomatic and identified only incidentally by imaging or postoperatively after aortic resection.  Salivary and lacrimal gland involvement usually causes painless, bilateral enlargement but may be asymmetric.  Dry mouth and/or eyes is uncommon. \n【13】 Proptosis is protrusion of the eyeball. \n【14】 Pulmonary involvement may be asymptomatic, or cause cough, dyspnea, or pleurisy. \n【15】 The following other causes of similar manifestations must be considered: Salivary and lacrimal gland involvement: Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【16】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【17】 Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both clinically and histologically. \n【18】 Aortic involvement: Giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteries. \n【19】 Although these criteria are not designed for diagnostic purposes, they do offer a framework for thinking about the disease, including suggested testing and interpretation of the results.  Although the diagnosis of IgG4-RD can be made without biopsy in a subset of patients in the appropriate clinical context (eg, Mikulicz syndrome) when paired with an elevated serum IgG4 level, biopsy is usually needed to distinguish IgG4-RD from other causes of tumor-like lesions and/or lymphadenopathy.  Immunostaining with IgG4 and IgG should be done only if there are at least 2 of the following 3 histopathologic findings: dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis.  An increased number of IgG4+ plasma cells on biopsy, on its own, is non-specific and must be paired with other findings to diagnose IgG4-RD.  Cross-sectional imaging (CT, MRI) should be done of clinically affected areas (eg, of orbits, chest, abdomen and pelvis).  Imaging of other areas is often done to screen for asymptomatic manifestations (eg, retroperitoneal fibrosis).  Serum IgG4 levels are elevated in only 60 to 70% of patients with IgG4-RD; elevations are not diagnostic and must be interpreted with caution.  Chronic allergic conditions are a frequent cause of mild serum IgG4 elevation.  Other testing that may be helpful includes Urinalysis, complete metabolic panel: Renal involvement Serum amylase and lipase, hemoglobin A1c, stool elastase: Pancreatic involvement Serum C3 and C4 complement levels: Low in IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis and some other phenotypes Total IgG and total IgE levels An elevated total IgG level (hypergammaglobulinemia) or an elevated globulin to albumin ratio indicates the activation of antibody secreting cells that is typical of but not specific to IgG4-RD.  The elevation in total IgG likely reflects the accumulation of auto-antibodies.  Marked elevations of the total IgE level (often 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal) are common in patients with IgG4-RD.  These values are often markedly higher than the IgE level in patients with asthma or chronic atopic disease; their relationship to the pathophysiology of IgG4-RD remains unknown although high total IgE level is an independent predictor of relapsing IgG4-RD . \n【20】 Prognosis for IgG4-Related Disease Like most immune-mediated conditions, there is no cure, but IgG4-RD is very treatable.  Much of the organ damage in this disease results from delays in diagnosis and insidious development of organ involvement and damage following treatment-induced remission.  Treatment of IgG4-Related Disease Corticosteroids B-cell targeted therapy with rituximab Treatment of IgG4-RD aims to reduce inflammation, induce remission, and preserve organ function.  Typically, tumor-like masses or organ enlargement should normalize following treatment.  When organs fail to normalize in response to high-dose corticosteroids or B-cell-depleting therapy, this usually indicates irreversible fibrosis, which is common in patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis, longstanding organ involvement , or an incorrect diagnosis.  Initial treatment is with an oral corticosteroid (eg, prednisone 30 to 40 mg once daily), administered for 2 to 4 weeks then tapered over the course of 2 to 3 months.  Rituximab is often used as a steroid-sparing option when patients are poor candidates for corticosteroids (eg, those with uncontrolled diabetes), and can be used to induce or maintain remission when patients do not tolerate corticosteroid tapering, or experience disease recurrence within 12 months of stopping corticosteroids.  Rituximab is nearly universally effective in treating active IgG4-RD .  Some patients require surgical procedures, such as stenting, to relieve mechanical obstruction of the ureters or bile ducts. \n【21】 Key Points IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that often manifests with multiorgan involvement and tumor-like masses most often affecting the pancreas, bile ducts, lacrimal glands, orbital tissues, salivary glands, lungs, kidneys, retroperitoneal tissues, aorta, meninges, and the thyroid gland.  IgG4-RD does not cause fever and typically manifests insidiously.  Serum IgG4 levels are usually elevated, but this finding is neither highly sensitive nor specific.  Diagnosis is most often based on a combination of clinical, radiologic, histopathologic, and immunostaining findings with emphasis on tissue sampling.  Treatment includes corticosteroids and often rituximab.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:10", "update_time": "2024-04-17 17:55:47"}

Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.  Treatment is with cognitive-behavioral therapy.   In schizoid personality disorder, the ability to relate to others meaningfully is limited.  About 3. 1 to 4. 9% of the general US population have schizoid personality disorder.  It is slightly more common among men.  Schizoid personality disorder may be more common among people with a family history of schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder.  Comorbidities are common.  Up to half of patients have had at least one episode of major depressive disorder Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【1】 Etiology of ScPD Having caregivers who were emotionally cold, neglectful, and detached during childhood may contribute to the development of schizoid personality disorder by fueling the child's feeling that interpersonal relationships are not satisfying.  Symptoms and Signs of ScPD Patients with schizoid personality disorder seem to have no desire for close relationships with other people, including relatives.  They have no close friends or confidants, except sometimes a 1st-degree relative.  They rarely date and often do not marry.  They prefer being by themselves, choosing activities and hobbies that do not require interaction with others (eg, computer games).  Sexual activity with others is of little, if any, interest to them.  They also seem to experience less enjoyment from sensory and bodily experiences (eg, walking on the beach).  These patients do not seem bothered by what others think of them—whether good or bad.  Because they do not notice normal clues of social interaction, they may seem socially inept, aloof, or self-absorbed.  They rarely react (eg, by smiling or nodding) or show emotion in social situations.  They have difficulty expressing anger, even when they are provoked.  They do not react appropriately to important life events and may seem passive in response to changes in circumstances.  As a result, they may seem to have no direction to their life.  Rarely, when these patients feel comfortable revealing themselves, they admit that they feel pain, especially in social interactions.  Symptoms of schizoid personality disorder tend to remain stable over time, more so than those of other personality disorders.  Diagnosis of ScPD Clinical criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-5]) For a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder, patients must have a persistent pattern of Detachment from and general disinterest in social relationships Limited expression of emotions in interpersonal interactions This pattern is shown by the presence of ≥ 4 of the following: No desire for or enjoyment of close relationships, including those with family members Strong preference for solitary activities Little, if any, interest in sexual activity with another person Enjoyment of few, if any, activities Lack of close friends or confidants, except possibly 1st-degree relatives Apparent indifference to the praise or criticism of others Emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affect Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood. \n【2】 Avoidant personality disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation. \n【3】 Treatment of ScPD Social skills training General treatment Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment. \n【4】 No controlled studies have been published about psychotherapies or drug therapy for schizoid personality disorder.  Generally, efforts to share interest in impersonal topics (eg, possessions, collections, hobbies) that appeal to people who prefer solitary pursuits can help establish a relationship with a patient and perhaps facilitate a therapeutic interaction.  Cognitive-behavioral approaches that focus on acquiring social skills may also help patients change.

If it is severe, the risk and severity of bacterial and fungal infections increase.  Focal symptoms of infection may be muted, but fever is present during most serious infections.  Diagnosis is by white blood cell count with differential, and evaluation requires identification of the cause.  If fever is present, infection is presumed, and immediate, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary, especially if the neutropenia is severe.  Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is sometimes helpful.  Neutrophils The immune system consists of cellular components and molecular components that work together to destroy antigens. \n【1】 When neutropenia is present, the inflammatory response to such infections is ineffective.  The normal lower limit of the neutrophil count (total white blood cell count × % neutrophils and bands) is 1500/mcL (1. 5 × 109/L) in whites and is somewhat lower in blacks ,about 1200/mcL [1. 2 × 109/L).  Neutrophil counts are not as stable as other cell counts and may vary considerably over short periods, depending on many factors such as activity status, anxiety, infections, and drugs.  Thus, several measurements may be needed when determining the severity of neutropenia.  Severity of neutropenia relates to the relative risk of infection and is classified as follows: Mild: 1000 to 1500/mcL (1 to 1. 5 × 109/L) Moderate: 500 to 1000/mcL (0. 5 to 1 × 109/L) Severe: < 500/mcL (< 0. 5 × 109/L) When neutrophil counts fall to < 500/mcL, endogenous microbial flora (eg, in the mouth or gut) can cause infections.  If the count falls to < 200/mcL (< 0. 2 × 109/L), the inflammatory response may be muted and the usual inflammatory findings of leukocytosis or white blood cells in the urine or at the site of infection may not occur.  Acute, severe neutropenia, particularly if another factor (eg, cancer) is present, significantly impairs the immune system and can lead to rapidly fatal infections.  The integrity of the skin and mucous membranes, the vascular supply to tissue, and the nutritional status of the patient also influence the risk of infections.  The most frequently occurring infections in patients with profound neutropenia are Cellulitis is acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue most often caused by streptococci or staphylococci. \n【2】 Stomatitis Oral inflammation and ulcers, known as stomatitis, may be mild and localized or severe and widespread.  They are invariably painful. \n【3】 Acute paronychia causes redness, warmth, and pain along the nail margin.  Diagnosis is by inspection. \n【4】 Patients with prolonged neutropenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy and patients receiving high doses of corticosteroids are predisposed to fungal infections.  Etiology of Neutropenia Acute neutropenia (occurring over hours to a few days) can develop as a result of Rapid neutrophil use or destruction Impaired production Chronic neutropenia (lasting months to years) usually arises as a result of Reduced production Excessive splenic sequestration Neutropenia also may be classified as Primary due to an intrinsic defect in marrow myeloid cells Secondary due to factors extrinsic to marrow myeloid cells See also the table Classification of Neutropenias .   Neutropenia caused by intrinsic defects in myeloid cells or their precursors is uncommon, but when present, the most common causes include Chronic idiopathic neutropenia Congenital neutropenia Chronic benign neutropenia is a type of chronic idiopathic neutropenia in which the rest of the immune system appears to remain intact; even with neutrophil counts < 200/mcL (< 0. 2 × 109/L), serious infections usually do not occur, probably because neutrophils are sometimes produced in adequate quantities in response to infection.  It is more common in women.  Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN, or Kostmann syndrome) is a heterogenous group of rare disorders that are characterized by an arrest in myeloid maturation at the promyelocyte stage in the bone marrow, resulting in an absolute neutrophil count of < 200/mcL and significant infections starting in infancy.  SCN can be autosomal dominant or recessive, X-linked, or sporadic.  Several genetic abnormalities that cause SCN have been identified, including mutations affecting neutrophil elastase (ELANE/ELA2), HAX1, GFI1, and the G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) receptor (CSF3R). \n【5】 Cyclic neutropenia is a rare congenital granulocytopoietic disorder, usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and usually caused by a mutation in the gene for neutrophil elastase (ELANE/ELA2), resulting in abnormal apoptosis.  It is characterized by regular, periodic oscillations in the number of peripheral neutrophils.  The mean oscillatory period is 21 ± 3 days.  Cycling of other blood cells is also evident in most cases.  Benign ethnic neutropenia occurs in members of some ethnic groups (eg, some people of African, Middle Eastern, and Jewish descent).  They normally have lower neutrophil counts but do not have increased risk of infection.  In some cases this finding has been linked to the Duffy red blood cell antigen; some experts think neutropenia in these populations is related to protection from malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. \n【6】 Neutropenia can also result from bone marrow failure due to rare congenital syndromes . \n【7】 Secondary neutropenia can result from use of certain drugs, bone marrow infiltration or replacement, certain infections, or immune reactions.  The most common causes include Drugs Infections and immune reactions Marrow infiltrative processes Drug-induced neutropenia is one of the most common causes of neutropenia.  Drugs can decrease neutrophil production through toxic, idiosyncratic, or hypersensitivity mechanisms; or they can increase peripheral neutrophil destruction through immune mechanisms.  Only the toxic mechanism (eg, with phenothiazines) causes dose-related neutropenia.  Severe dose-related neutropenia occurs predictably after cytotoxic cancer drugs or radiation therapy due to suppression of bone marrow production.  Idiosyncratic reactions are unpredictable and occur with a wide variety of drugs, including alternative medicine preparations or extracts, and toxins.  Hypersensitivity reactions Drug Hypersensitivity is an immune-mediated reaction to a drug.  Symptoms range from mild to severe and include rash, anaphylaxis, and serum sickness. \n【8】 These reactions may last for only a few days or for months or years.  Often, hepatitis Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. \n【9】 Immune-mediated drug-induced neutropenia, thought to arise from drugs that act as haptens to stimulate antibody formation, usually persists for about 1 week after the drug is stopped.  It may result from aminopyrine, clozapine, propylthiouracil and other antithyroid drugs, penicillin, or other antibiotics.  Neutropenia due to ineffective bone marrow production can occur in megaloblastic anemias Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias Megaloblastic anemias result most often from deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate.  Ineffective hematopoiesis affects all cell lines but particularly red blood cells. \n【10】 Usually, macrocytic anemia and sometimes mild thrombocytopenia develop simultaneously. \n【11】 Tumor-induced myelofibrosis may further exacerbate neutropenia.  Myelofibrosis can also occur due to granulomatous infections, Gaucher disease, and radiation therapy.  Hypersplenism Splenomegaly is abnormal enlargement of the spleen.   Splenomegaly is almost always secondary to other disorders. \n【12】 Infections can cause neutropenia by impairing neutrophil production or by inducing immune destruction or rapid turnover of neutrophils.  Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【13】 Neutropenia that occurs with common childhood viral diseases develops during the first 1 to 2 days of illness and may persist for 3 to 8 days.  Transient neutropenia may also result from virus- or endotoxemia-induced redistribution of neutrophils from the circulating to the marginal pool.  Alcohol may contribute to neutropenia by inhibiting the neutrophilic chemotactic response of the marrow during some infections (eg, pneumococcal pneumonia).  Immune defects can cause neutropenia.  Neonatal isoimmune neutropenia can occur with fetal/maternal neutrophil antigen incompatibility associated with transplacental transfer of IgG antibodies against the newborn’s neutrophils (most commonly to HNA-1 antigens).  Autoimmune neutropenia can occur at any age and may be operative in many cases of idiopathic chronic neutropenia.  Testing for antineutrophil antibodies (immunofluorescence, agglutination, or flow cytometry) is not always available or reliable. \n【14】 Autoimmune neutropenias may be acute, chronic, or episodic.  They may involve antibodies directed against circulating neutrophils or neutrophil precursor cells.  They may also involve cytokines (eg, gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor) that can cause neutrophil apoptosis.  Most patients with autoimmune neutropenia have an underlying autoimmune disorder or lymphoproliferative disorder .  Symptoms and Signs of Neutropenia is asymptomatic until infection develops.  Fever is often the only indication of infection.  If neutropenia is severe, typical signs of focal inflammation (erythema, swelling, pain, infiltrates) may be muted or absent.  Focal symptoms (eg, oral ulcers) may develop but are often subtle.  Patients with drug-induced neutropenia due to hypersensitivity may have a fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy as a result of the hypersensitivity.  Some patients with chronic benign neutropenia and neutrophil counts < 200/mcL (< 0. 2 × 109/L) do not experience many serious infections.  Patients with cyclic neutropenia or severe congenital neutropenia tend to have episodes of oral ulcers, stomatitis, or pharyngitis and lymph node enlargement during severe neutropenia.  Pneumonias and septicemia often occur.  Diagnosis of Neutropenia Clinical suspicion (repeated or unusual infections) Confirmatory complete blood count (CBC) with differential Evaluation for infection with cultures and imaging Identification of mechanism and cause of neutropenia is suspected in patients with frequent, severe, or unusual infections or in patients at risk (eg, those receiving cytotoxic drugs or radiation therapy).  Confirmation is by CBC with differential.  Evaluation for infection The first priority is to determine whether an infection is present.  Because infection may be subtle, physical examination systematically assesses the most common primary sites of infection: mucosal surfaces, such as the alimentary tract (gums, pharynx, anus); lungs; abdomen; urinary tract; skin and fingernails; venipuncture sites; and vascular catheters.  If neutropenia is acute or severe, laboratory evaluation must proceed rapidly.  Cultures are the mainstay of evaluation.  At least 2 sets of bacterial and fungal blood cultures are obtained from all febrile patients; if an indwelling IV catheter is present, cultures are drawn from the catheter and from a separate peripheral vein.  Persistent or chronic drainage material is also cultured for bacteria, fungi, and atypical mycobacteria.  Mucosal ulcers are swabbed and cultured for herpes virus and Candida.  Skin lesions are aspirated or biopsied for cytology and culture.  Samples for urinalysis and urine cultures are obtained from all patients.  If diarrhea is present, stool is evaluated for enteric bacterial pathogens and Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile toxins.  Sputum cultures are obtained to evaluate for pulmonary infections.  Imaging studies are helpful.  Chest x-rays are done on all patients.  A chest CT may also be necessary in immunosuppressed patients.  CT of the paranasal sinuses may be helpful if symptoms or signs of sinusitis (eg, positional headache, upper tooth or maxillary pain, facial swelling, nasal discharge) are present.  CT scan of the abdomen is usually done if symptoms (eg, pain) or history (eg, recent surgery) suggests an intra-abdominal infection.  Identification of cause Next, mechanism and cause of neutropenia are determined.  The history addresses family history, presence of other disorders, all drugs, other preparations, and possible toxin exposure or ingestion.  Physical examination addresses the presence of splenomegaly is abnormal enlargement of the spleen. \n【15】 If no obvious cause is identified (eg, chemotherapy), the most important test is Bone marrow examination determines whether neutropenia is due to decreased marrow production or is secondary to increased cell destruction (determined by normal or increased production of the myeloid cells).  Bone marrow examination may also indicate the specific cause of the neutropenia .  Additional marrow studies (eg, cytogenetic analysis; special stains and flow cytometry for detecting leukemia, other malignant disorders, and infections) are done.  Further testing, such as flow cytometry and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement for the LGL syndrome, may be needed to determine the cause of neutropenia, depending on the diagnoses suspected.  In patients at risk of nutritional deficiencies, levels of copper Acquired Copper Deficiency Copper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body’s copper is bound to copper proteins.  Copper deficiency may be acquired or inherited. \n【16】 Testing for the presence of antineutrophil antibodies is done if immune neutropenia is suspected.  Differentiation between neutropenia caused by certain antibiotics and infection can sometimes be difficult.  The white blood cell count just before the start of antibiotic treatment usually reflects the change in blood count due to the infection.  Patients who have had chronic neutropenia since infancy and a history of recurrent fevers and chronic gingivitis should have white cell counts with differential done 3 times/week for 6 weeks, so that periodicity suggestive of cyclic neutropenia can be evaluated.  Platelet and reticulocyte counts are done simultaneously.  In patients with cyclic neutropenia, eosinophils, reticulocytes, and platelets frequently cycle synchronously with the neutrophils, whereas monocytes and lymphocytes may cycle out of phase.  Molecular genetic testing for ELANE and other genes is appropriate when congenital causes are considered.  Treatment of Neutropenia Treatment of associated conditions (eg, infections, stomatitis) Sometimes antibiotic prophylaxis Myeloid growth factors Discontinuation of suspected etiologic agent (eg, drug) Sometimes corticosteroids Acute neutropenia Suspected infections are always treated immediately.  If fever or hypotension is present, serious infection is assumed, and empiric, high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given IV.  Regimen selection is based on the most likely infecting organisms, the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens at that particular institution, and the regimen’s potential toxicity.  Because of the risk of creating resistant organisms, vancomycin is used only if gram-positive organisms resistant to other drugs are suspected.  Indwelling vascular catheters can usually remain in place even if bacteremia is suspected or documented, but removal is considered if infections involve S.  aureus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, or Candida or another fungus or if blood cultures are persistently positive despite appropriate antibiotics.  Infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci generally resolve with antimicrobial therapy alone.  Indwelling Foley catheters can also predispose to infections in neutropenic patients, and change or removal of the catheter should be considered for persistent urinary infections.  If cultures are positive, antibiotic therapy is adjusted to the results of sensitivity tests.  If a patient defervesces within 72 hours, antibiotics are continued for at least 7 days and until the patient has no symptoms or signs of infection.  When neutropenia is transient (such as that following myelosuppressive chemotherapy), antibiotic therapy is usually continued until the neutrophil count is > 500/mcL (> 0. 5 × 109/L); however, stopping antimicrobials can be considered in selected patients with persistent neutropenia, especially those in whom symptoms and signs of inflammation have resolved, if cultures remain negative.  Fever that persists > 72 hours despite antibiotic therapy suggests A nonbacterial cause Infection with a resistant species Superinfection with a 2nd bacterial species Inadequate serum or tissue levels of the antibiotics Localized infection, such as an abscess Neutropenic patients with persistent fever are reassessed every 2 to 4 days with physical examination, cultures, and chest x-ray.  If the patient is well except for the presence of fever, the initial antibiotic regimen can be continued, and drug-induced fever should be considered.  If the patient is deteriorating, alteration of the antimicrobial regimen is considered.  Fungal infections Overview of Fungal Infections are often classified as either Opportunistic Primary Opportunistic infections are those that develop mainly in immunocompromised hosts. \n【17】 Antifungal therapy is added empirically if unexplained fever persists after 3 to 4 days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.  Selection of the specific antifungal drug (eg, fluconazole, caspofungin, voriconazole, posaconazole) depends on the type of risk (eg, duration and severity of neutropenia, past history of fungal infection, persistent fever despite use of narrower spectrum antifungal drug) and should be guided by an infectious disease specialist.  If fever persists after 3 weeks of empiric therapy (including 2 weeks of antifungal therapy) and the neutropenia has resolved, then stopping all antimicrobials can be considered and the cause of fever reevaluated.  For afebrile patients with neutropenia, antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered although alterations in the bacterial microbiome may slow bone marrow recovery .  Treatment with fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) is used in some centers for patients who receive chemotherapy regimens that commonly result in neutrophils ≤ 100/mcL (≤ 0. 1 × 109/L) for > 7 days.  Prophylaxis is usually started by the treating oncologist.  Antibiotics are continued until the neutrophil count increases to > 1500/mcL ,> 1. \n【18】 Selection of the specific antifungal drug should be guided by an infectious disease specialist.  Antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for afebrile neutropenic patients without risk factors who are anticipated to remain neutropenic for < 7 days on the basis of their specific chemotherapy regimen.  Myeloid growth factors (ie, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) are widely used to increase the neutrophil count and to prevent infections in patients with severe neutropenia (eg, after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and intensive cancer chemotherapy).  They are expensive.  However, if the risk of febrile neutropenia is ≥ 30% (as assessed by neutrophil count < 500 mcL [< 0. 5 × 109/L], presence of infection during a previous cycle of chemotherapy, associated comorbid disease, or age > 75), growth factors are indicated.  In general, most clinical benefit occurs when the growth factor is administered beginning about 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy.  Patients with neutropenia caused by an idiosyncratic drug reaction may also benefit from myeloid growth factors, particularly if a delayed recovery is anticipated.  The dose for G-CSF (filgrastim) is 5 to 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously once a day, and the dose for pegylated G-CSF (pegfilgrastim) is 6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.  Glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, and vitamins do not stimulate neutrophil production but can affect distribution and destruction.  If acute neutropenia is suspected to be drug- or toxin-induced, all potentially etiologic agents are stopped.  If neutropenia develops during treatment with a drug known to induce low counts (eg, chloramphenicol), then switching to an alternative antibiotic may be helpful.  Saline or hydrogen peroxide gargles every few hours, liquid oral rinses (containing viscous lidocaine, diphenhydramine, and liquid antacid), anesthetic lozenges (benzocaine 15 mg every 3 or 4 hours), or chlorhexidine mouth rinses (1% solution) twice a day or 3 times a day may relieve the discomfort of stomatitis with oropharyngeal ulcerations.  Oral or esophageal candidiasis is treated with nystatin (400,000 to 600,000 units oral rinse 4 times a day; swallowed if esophagitis is present), clotrimazole troche (10 mg slowly dissolved in the mouth 5 times a day), or systemic antifungal drugs (eg, fluconazole).  A semisolid or liquid diet may be necessary during acute stomatitis or esophagitis, and topical analgesics (eg,viscous lidocaine) may be needed to minimize discomfort.  Chronic neutropenia Neutrophil production in congenital neutropenia caused by intrinsic defects in myeloid cells or their precursors , cyclic neutropenia caused by intrinsic defects in myeloid cells or their precursors , and idiopathic neutropenia caused by intrinsic defects in myeloid cells or their precursors can be increased with administration of G-CSF 1 to 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously once a day.  Effectiveness can be maintained with daily or intermittent G-CSF for months or years.  Long-term G-CSF has also been used in other patients with chronic neutropenia, including those with myelodysplasia, HIV infection, and autoimmune disorders.  In general, neutrophil counts increase, although clinical benefits are less clear, especially for patients who do not have severe neutropenia.  For patients with autoimmune disorders such as some patients who have the LGL syndrome or who have had an organ transplant, cyclosporine can also be beneficial.  In some patients with accelerated neutrophil destruction caused by autoimmune disorders, corticosteroids (generally, prednisone 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/kg orally once a day) can increase blood neutrophils.  This increase often can be maintained with alternate-day G-CSF therapy.  Splenectomy has been used in the past to increase the neutrophil count in some patients with splenomegaly and splenic sequestration of neutrophils (eg, Felty syndrome); however, because growth factors and other newer therapies are often effective, splenectomy should be avoided in most patients.  Splenectomy can be considered for patients with persistent painful splenomegaly or with severe neutropenia (ie, < 500/mcL [< 0. 5 × 109/L]) and serious problems with infections in whom other treatments have failed.  Patients should be vaccinated against infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae before splenectomy because splenectomy predisposes patients to infection by encapsulated organisms. \n【19】 Key Points Neutropenia predisposes to bacterial and fungal infections.  The risk of infection is proportional to the severity of neutropenia; patients with neutrophil counts < 500/mcL (< 0. 5 × 109/L) are at greatest risk.  Because the inflammatory response is limited, clinical findings may be muted, although fever is usually present.  Febrile neutropenic patients are treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics pending definitive identification of infection.

Procedures that most often injure the ureter include ureteroscopy, hysterectomy, low anterior colon resection, and open abdominal aneurysm repair.  Mechanisms include ligation, transection, avulsion, crush, devascularization, kinking, and electrocoagulation.  Noniatrogenic ureteral injuries account for only about 1 to 3% of all genitourinary trauma.  They usually result from gunshot wounds and rarely from stab wounds.  In children, avulsion injuries are more common and occur at the ureteropelvic junction.  Complications include peritoneal or retroperitoneal urinary leakage; perinephric abscess; fistula formation (eg, ureterovaginal, ureterocutaneous); and ureteral stricture, obstruction, or both.

It occurs most commonly after abdominal surgery, particularly when the intestines have been manipulated. \n【1】 Intraoperative findings suggestive of a ureteral injury include urinary leakage, ureteral bruising, or decreased peristalsis.  The diagnosis can be further aided by injecting dye (eg, indigo carmine, methylene blue) intravenously or intraureterally.  Treatment of Ureteral Trauma For minor injuries, percutaneous nephrostomy tube or ureteral stent For major injuries, surgical repair All ureteral injuries require intervention.  A diverting percutaneous nephrostomy tube and/or placement of a ureteral stent (retrograde or antegrade) is often sufficient for minor injuries (eg, contusions or partial transections).  Minor iatrogenic intraoperative ureteral injuries such as a partial laceration can be managed with primary closure.  In the case of unintended ligation with a suture, suture removal may be adequate.  All repairs should be stented.  Major injuries (eg, complete transection or avulsion injuries) typically require reconstructive techniques, either open or laparoscopic, depending on their location and extent.  These techniques include ureteral reimplantation, primary ureteral anastomosis, anterior (Boari) bladder flap, transureteroureterostomy, ileal interposition, and as a last resort, autotransplantation.

Pancreatitis that starts suddenly is called Acute Pancreatitis is inflammation (swelling) of your pancreas. \n【1】 Getting acute pancreatitis over and over again can cause chronic pancreatitis.  Chronic pancreatitis causes belly pain The pain may be constant or may come and go The pancreas stops making juices that help you digest your food Sometimes chronic pancreatitis damages cells that make insulin and you get diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar (glucose) levels are too high.  You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working right. \n【2】 Causes of chronic pancreatitis include: Heavy, long term alcohol abuse Alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【3】 It makes body fluids thick and sticky.  These sticky fluids clog up the lungs, digestive system, and many other organs. \n【4】 What are the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis? The main symptom is: Pain in your upper belly (the area below your breastbone) The pain may follow one of several patterns: Pain that goes away or gets better but keeps coming back Severe pain that lasts for several hours or up to several days You may also have other symptoms such as: Bulky, unusually stinky, light-colored stool Weight loss and malnutrition High blood sugar caused by diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar (glucose) levels are too high. \n【5】 Your pancreas also releases insulin and other hormones that help control your blood sugar. \n【6】 Doctors treat pain caused by chronic pancreatitis by: Asking you to fast, which means not eating or drinking for a certain amount of time to rest your pancreas and intestine Giving you fluids in a vein Giving you pain medicine People with severe pancreatitis may have to stay in the hospital.

During labor the muscles of your womb (uterus) squeeze again and again to push your baby out.  These squeezes are called contractions.  Delivery includes the second and third stages of childbirth.  Delivery of the baby is the second stage.  Delivery of the afterbirth (placenta) is the third stage.  During these stages, the baby and then the afterbirth pass through your birth canal and come out.  A cesarean delivery  is when doctors deliver your baby through a cut made in your belly.  Most of the time, delivery goes well, but doctors will watch you for possible complications Introduction to Complications of Labor and Delivery Usually, labor and delivery occur without any problems.

What happens when I give birth? When you're about to give birth, doctors and nurses may help you move into a partial sitting position, between lying down and sitting up.  This position: Helps the baby move slowly down toward your vagina Is less likely to hurt your back or pelvis Some women prefer to give birth lying down or in other positions.  During delivery, your doctor or midwife will: Check your vagina to find your baby’s head Ask you to bear down and push with each contraction Support your baby’s head as it comes out of your vagina, to try to prevent tearing Turn your baby’s body sideways so that the shoulders come out one at a time Catch the baby After your baby is born, your doctor or midwife will: Suction fluid and mucus out of your baby’s nose and mouth Put a clamp on the umbilical cord and cut it—this doesn't hurt you or your baby Dry off your baby and wrap him or her in a blanket Place your baby in a bassinet or in your arms What can help with delivery? Sometimes a doctor speeds up a delivery because the baby or mother needs medical help.  How is the placenta delivered? Your placenta is the afterbirth.  It's a plate-sized piece of tissue attached to your uterus that provides oxygen and nutrients to your baby.  It's attached to your baby with the umbilical cord.  Usually, the placenta comes out on its own within 30 minutes after your baby is born The doctor or midwife may massage your belly and give you medicine called oxytocin to help your uterus contract and push out the placenta If the placenta doesn't come out or only part of it comes out, the doctor may need to reach into your uterus to remove the placenta.

The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury. \n【1】 Measurement of compartment pressure is a hospital-based procedure that requires considerable technical skill; an orthopedic or general surgeon is typically consulted.  Compartment pressures can be measured in the 4 compartments of the lower leg (anterior, deep posterior, lateral, and superficial posterior).  The Stryker® system, a commercially available instrument, is used here.  Know what equipment is available at your particular institution.   Indications Suspected compartment syndrome is suggested by worsening pain of the lower leg that is disproportionate to the severity of the apparent injury and exacerbated by passive stretching of compartment muscles.  On palpation, the compartment may be swollen and tense.  Contraindications Absolute contraindications None Relative contraindications Infection of skin or deeper tissues at the anticipated site of needle insertion: If possible, use an alternate, uninfected site.  Bleeding diathesis, which may need to be corrected before compartment pressure measurement Complications Erroneously high or low pressure measurements may be due to poorly placed or obstructed needles, faulty or inaccurately calibrated devices, patient agitation, or excess test saline injected into the compartment.  These measurement errors can lead to incorrect treatment.  Infection, bleeding, or tissue damage resulting from needle insertion may occur. \n【2】 Maintain a low threshold for measuring compartment pressure in at-risk patients because deep compartments may not feel tense or grossly swollen, pain is nonspecific, and, in obtunded patients, symptoms may be absent.  Diagnosis must be made and treatment started before pallor or pulselessness develops.  Relevant Anatomy The lower leg has 4 compartments: Anterior compartment: Includes the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus muscles, the deep peroneal nerve, and the anterior tibial artery Deep posterior compartment: Includes the tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus muscles, the tibial nerve, and the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries Lateral compartment: Includes the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles and the superficial peroneal nerve Superficial posterior compartment: Includes the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles The anterior compartment and deep posterior compartment are most commonly affected by compartment syndrome.  Positioning Position the patient with the affected leg at heart level and so that the needle can enter the skin at an angle perpendicular to the compartment being measured.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Prepare the equipment Open the Stryker® system and remove the contents onto a sterile field.  Place the needle firmly onto the tapered stem of the diaphragm chamber.  Remove the cap on the pre-filled syringe and attach it to the stem on the opposite side.  Open the cover of the monitor and place the chamber into the pressure monitor with the black surface down.  Carefully push it until it is seated in place.  Snap the cover of the monitor closed.  Hold the needle at a 45° angle upward and depress the plunger to purge the system of air.  Do not allow saline to trickle down the needle into the transducer well.  Turn on the monitor and check for a numeric reading to appear in the display window.  Calibrate the device: Hold the device at the intended angle of insertion.  Press the \"zero\" button and ensure that, after a few seconds, the display reads “00. ” The display must read “00” before continuing.  For each additional measurement, the unit must be recalibrated to “00. ” General steps for all compartments Do a pre-procedure neurovascular examination of the affected lower leg.  Prepare the skin overlying the area with an antiseptic cleanser such as chlorhexidine.  Drape the area.  Using a 25-gauge needle, place a wheal of local anesthetic over the needle entry site.  Avoid injecting anesthetic into the deeper tissues of the muscle and fascia.  Doing so may falsely elevate the compartment pressure measurement.  Hold the assembled and calibrated pressure monitor perpendicular to the compartment being measured and insert the needle as gently as possible through the skin to a depth appropriate for the target compartment.  Slowly inject 0. 3 mL of saline into the compartment.  Wait for the display window to show that equilibrium has been reached and record the resultant pressure.  For each additional measurement, recalibrate the unit to \"00\" and repeat the process.  A measured pressure of more than about 30 mm Hg or within about 30 mm Hg of diastolic blood pressure supports the diagnosis of compartment syndrome and indicates consideration for immediate fasciotomy.  Compartment syndrome is possible even if compartment pressure is not elevated; if suspected based on clinical findings, the diagnosis should be presumed and compartment pressures should be measured serially.  Specific steps for the anterior compartment Position the patient supine.  Palpate the anterior border of the tibia at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the lower leg.  Insert the needle 1 cm lateral to the anterior border of the tibia (the most lateral part of the tibia), perpendicular to the skin.  Advance the needle to a depth that allows a rise in pressure when you press with your finger over the anterior compartment just proximal or distal to the needle insertion site, or with plantarflexion of the foot or dorsiflexion of the foot.  Specific steps for the deep posterior compartment Position the patient supine with the lower leg slightly elevated if the clinical situation permits.  Palpate the medial border of the tibia at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the lower leg.  Insert the needle just posterior to the medial border of the tibia.  Advance the needle perpendicularly to the skin toward the posterior border of the fibula to a depth of 2 to 4 cm.  Confirm proper needle placement by observing a rise in pressure during toe extension and ankle eversion.  Specific steps for the lateral compartment Position the patient, usually supine, on the stretcher.  Elevate the lower leg slightly.  Insert the needle just anterior to the posterior border of the fibula, on the lateral aspect of the leg. 5 cm.  If the needle contacts bone, withdraw it 0.  Confirm proper needle placement by observing a rise in pressure when you press with your finger over the lateral compartment just inferior or superior to the needle entry site and with inversion of the foot and ankle.  Specific steps for the superficial posterior compartment Position the patient prone.  Visualize a transverse line at the level of the junction between the proximal and the middle thirds of the lower leg.  Insert the needle at this level, 3 to 5 cm on either side of the anatomic midline of the lower leg.  Advance the needle perpendicular to the skin and direct it toward the center of the lower leg to a depth of 2 to 4 cm. \n【3】 Aftercare Apply sterile dressings to all needle entry sites.  Repeat the neurovascular examination of the leg.  Warnings and Common Errors Compartment syndrome is a clinical, often difficult, diagnosis to make.  Presence of distal pulses and capillary refill and even normal compartment pressures do not rule out compartment syndrome.

Miscarriage is when you lose your baby before 20 weeks of pregnancy.  Most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Bleeding and cramping are common signs of miscarriage If you were pregnant and didn't know it yet, you can have a miscarriage and think it was just your period To tell if you’ve had a miscarriage, doctors will check your cervix (the lower part of your uterus) Doctors will also do an ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.  Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays). \n【1】 Doctors don't always know what causes you to miscarry.  Miscarriage is not caused by a sudden emotional shock, such as getting bad news.  Also, minor injuries like slipping and falling do not cause miscarriage.  However, major injuries like a bad car crash can cause miscarriage.  Causes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy A problem with your baby, such as a birth defect or an inherited disorder Sometimes the baby has a defect that is so severe that the baby (fetus) can't live more than a month or two inside you.  A severe defect causes most miscarriages in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Causes in weeks 13 through 20 of pregnancy Often, doctors never figure out the cause of miscarriage at this stage.  But sometimes they can pinpoint one of these as the cause: Problems with your reproductive organs, such as fibroids A fibroid is a tumor in a woman's uterus (womb).  The uterus is the organ where babies grow before they are born. \n【2】 You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working right. \n【3】 Your thyroid releases thyroid hormones.  The hormones control how fast your body’s chemical functions work (metabolic rate). \n【4】 Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.  Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteries. \n【5】 A miscarriage early in pregnancy may just seem like a normal period.  If you didn't know you were pregnant, you probably wouldn't think you were having a miscarriage.  Other times there are obvious symptoms: Bright or dark red blood Cramping Passing large clots and bits of tissue At first you may have only a small amount of bleeding, similar to having your period.  As the miscarriage continues, the bleeding usually gets worse.  The blood may be bright or dark red.  Sometimes you'll also pass blood clots.  You'll have cramps that may get worse as your uterus (womb) pushes out bits and pieces of the pregnancy.  Call your doctor right away if you have any bleeding during your pregnancy.  Not all bleeding during pregnancy means you're having a miscarriage.  About half the time, the pregnancy continues just fine.  However, your doctor needs to check to see whether you had a miscarriage or not.  If you pass large clots or bits of tissue, put them in a container or wrap them in a towel for the doctor to look at.  How can doctors tell if I've had a miscarriage? If you've had bleeding or cramping during the first 20 weeks of your pregnancy, doctors will: Do a pelvic exam: They look inside your vagina (birth canal) to check your cervix (the lower part of your uterus where your baby comes out)—if your cervix is open, a miscarriage is likely Do an ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body. \n【6】 If the fetus and the placenta (the organ that feeds your unborn baby) are no longer in your body, you won't need any treatment.  The bleeding and cramps will stop soon.  If bits and pieces of the pregnancy are still in your body, doctors might: Watch to see if your uterus will empty itself, as long as you don’t have a fever or seem sick Do a procedure to remove the rest of the pregnancy If doctors need to remove pieces of your pregnancy from your uterus, they'll give you medicine to make you sleepy.  The procedure you have depends on how far along the pregnancy is: In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy: Remove pieces using a suction instrument put into your uterus through your vagina Between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy: Remove pieces using surgical instruments put into your uterus through your vagina If close to 20 weeks of pregnancy: You may be given a medicine to start labor to pass the rest of the pregnancy How can I prevent a miscarriage? You can't really prevent a miscarriage.  If you've had some bleeding or cramping during the first 20 weeks of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to avoid too much physical activity and stay off your feet.  But there's no proof these things help.  How can I feel better after a miscarriage?

These disorders occur when the body does not recycle old bone cells.  Typical symptoms include impaired bone growth and thick bones that easily break.  The diagnosis is based on symptoms and x-rays.  Osteopetrosis that occurs in infancy may be fatal if not treated.  There is no cure, but some treatments can help relieve problems caused by the disorders.   Osteopetroses result from abnormalities in certain genes.  These abnormal genes are hereditary.  That is, they may be passed down from parent to child.  Bone cells constantly but slowly form, live for a period, and then are reabsorbed, a recycling process.  In osteopetrosis, the body does not recycle old bone cells.  The result is increased density or thickness of the bones and an alteration in how the bones are shaped.  These changes make bones weaker than normal.  The dense bone tissue also crowds out the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.  Osteopetroses range from mild to severe and can even be life threatening.  Symptoms of osteopetroses may begin in infancy (early onset) or later in life (delayed onset).  Symptoms of Osteopetroses Although osteopetroses comprise a range of different disorders, many of the same symptoms develop in most of them.  Bone growth is usually impaired.  Bones thicken and break easily.  Formation of blood cells may be impaired because there is less bone marrow, leading to anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. \n【1】 An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause pressure in the skull to increase; compress nerves, causing facial paralysis or loss of vision or hearing; and can distort the face and teeth.  The bones in the fingers and feet, the long bones of the arms and legs, the spine, and the pelvis may be affected.  Diagnosis of Osteopetroses X-rays Doctors usually base the diagnosis of osteopetroses on symptoms and x-rays Plain X-Rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).  In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease. \n【2】 When the person has no symptoms, osteopetrosis is sometimes detected only by chance, after a doctor sees very dense bones on x-rays taken for an unrelated purpose.  Prognosis for Osteopetroses Early-onset osteopetrosis that is not treated with stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. \n【3】 Death usually results from anemia, infection, or bleeding.  Late-onset osteopetrosis is often very mild.  Treatment of Osteopetroses Corticosteroids Sometimes stem cell transplantation Sometimes surgery There is no definitive cure for osteopetrosis.  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, decrease the formation of new bone cells and may increase the rate of removal of old bone cells, strengthening bones.  Corticosteroids may also help relieve bone pain and improve muscle strength.  Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. \n【4】 However, the long-term prognosis after transplantation is unknown.  Fractures, anemia, bleeding, and infection require treatment.  If nerves going through the skull are compressed, surgery may be required to take pressure off the nerves.  Surgery may also be needed to relieve increased pressure in the skull.  Plastic surgery may be done to correct severe deformities of the face and jaw.

Symptoms usually begin with pain along the affected dermatome, followed within 2 to 3 days by a vesicular eruption that is usually diagnostic.  Treatment is with antiviral drugs, ideally given within 72 hours after skin lesions appear.   Chickenpox is an acute, systemic, usually childhood infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus type 3). \n【1】 Herpes zoster inflames the sensory root ganglia, the skin of the associated dermatome, and sometimes the posterior and anterior horns of the gray matter, meninges, and dorsal and ventral roots.  Herpes zoster frequently occurs in older and HIV-infected patients and is more frequent and severe in immunocompromised patients because cell-mediated immunity in these patients is decreased.  There are no clear-cut precipitants.  Symptoms and Signs of Herpes Zoster Lancinating, dysesthetic, or other pain develops in the involved site, typically followed within 2 to 3 days by a rash, usually crops of vesicles on an erythematous base.  The site is usually one or more adjacent dermatomes in the thoracic or lumbar region, although a few satellite lesions may also appear.  Lesions are typically unilateral and do not cross the midline of the body.  The site is usually hyperesthetic, and pain may be severe.  Lesions usually continue to form for about 3 to 5 days.  Herpes zoster may disseminate to other regions of the skin and to visceral organs, especially in immunocompromised patients.  Geniculate zoster  results from involvement of the geniculate ganglion.  Ear pain, facial paralysis, and sometimes vertigo occur.  Vesicles erupt in the external auditory canal, and taste may be lost in the anterior two thirds of the tongue.  Ophthalmic herpes zoster Ophthalmicus Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a reactivated latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection ( shingles) involving the eye. \n【2】 Ocular disease can be severe.  Vesicles on the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign) indicate involvement of the nasociliary branch and a higher risk of severe ocular disease.  However, the eye may be involved in the absence of lesions on the tip of the nose.  Intraoral zoster is uncommon but may produce a sharp unilateral distribution of lesions.  No intraoral prodromal symptoms occur.  Postherpetic neuralgia Fewer than 4% of patients with herpes zoster experience another outbreak.  However, many patients, particularly older patients, have localized pain with variable intensity lasting > 3 months from the last crusted lesion in the involved distribution (postherpetic neuralgia).  Pearls & Pitfalls Fewer than 4% of patients with herpes zoster experience another outbreak.  The pain of postherpetic neuralgia may be sharp and intermittent or constant and may be debilitating.  It may persist for months or years or permanently.  Diagnosis of Herpes Zoster Clinical evaluation Herpes zoster is suspected in patients with the characteristic rash and sometimes even before the rash appears if patients have typical pain in a dermatomal distribution.  Diagnosis is usually based on the virtually pathognomonic rash.  If the diagnosis is equivocal, detecting multinucleate giant cells with a Tzanck test can confirm infection, but the Tzanck test is positive with herpes zoster or herpes simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex viruses (human herpesviruses types 1 and 2) commonly cause recurrent infection affecting the skin, mouth, lips, eyes, and genitals. \n【3】 Herpes simplex virus (HSV) may cause nearly identical lesions, but unlike herpes zoster, HSV tends to recur and is not dermatomal.  Viruses can be differentiated by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Antigen detection from a biopsy sample can also be used to detect herpes zoster.  Treatment of Herpes Zoster Symptomatic treatment Antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir), especially for immunocompromised patients Wet compresses are soothing, but systemic analgesics are often necessary.  For treatment of ophthalmic herpes zoster Treatment Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a reactivated latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection ( shingles) involving the eye. \n【4】 For treatment of otic herpes zoster Treatment Herpes zoster oticus is an uncommon manifestation of herpes zoster that affects the 8th cranial nerve ganglia and the geniculate ganglion of the 7th (facial) cranial nerve. \n【5】 Antiviral therapy Treatment with oral antivirals decreases the severity and duration of the acute eruption and decreases the rate of serious complications in immunocompromised patients; it may decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.  In immunocompetent patients, antiviral therapy is often reserved for those who are ≥ 50 years.  Treatment is also indicated in patients with severe pain, facial rash especially around the eye, and in immunocompromised patients.  Treatment of herpes zoster should start as soon as possible, ideally during the prodrome, and is less likely to be effective if given > 72 hours after skin lesions appear, especially in the absence of newly forming lesions.  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day for 7 days and valacyclovir 1 g 3 times a day for 7 days have better bioavailability with oral dosing than acyclovir, and therefore for herpes zoster, they are generally preferred to oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times a day for 7 to 10 days.  Corticosteroids do not decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.  For less severely immunocompromised patients, oral famciclovir, valacyclovir, or acyclovir  is a reasonable option; famciclovir and valacyclovir are preferred.  For severely immunocompromised patients, acyclovir is recommended at a dosage of 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days for adults and 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7 days for children < 12 years.  Some experts recommend treatment beyond 7 to 10 days, lasting until all lesions are crusted, for immunocompromised patients.  Although data concerning the safety of acyclovir and valacyclovir during pregnancy are reassuring, the safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy is not firmly established.  Because congenital varicella can result from maternal varicella but rarely results from maternal zoster, the potential benefit of treatment of pregnant patients should outweigh possible risks to the fetus.  Pregnant patients with severe rash, severe pain, or ophthalmic zoster can be treated, preferably with acyclovir, because there is longer experience with its use in pregnancy as compared to other drugs, although valacyclovir remains an option.  There are little data regarding the safety of famciclovir in pregnancy, so it is not generally recommended in pregnant women.  Management of postherpetic neuralgia can be particularly difficult.  Treatments include gabapentin, pregabalin, cyclic antidepressants, topical capsaicin or lidocaine ointment, and botulinum toxin injection.  Opioid analgesics may be necessary.  Intrathecal methylprednisolone may be of benefit.  Prevention of Herpes Zoster A recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years whether they have had herpes zoster or been given the older, live-attenuated vaccine or not; 2 doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine are given 2 to 6 months apart and at least 2 months after the live-attenuated vaccine . \n【6】 The older, live-attenuated vaccine is no longer available in the US, but remains available in many other nations.  The newer, recombinant vaccine appears to provide much better and longer-lasting protection than the older, single-dose, live-attenuated zoster vaccine (which is a higher-dose version of the varicella vaccine).  In a large clinical trial, the recombinant zoster vaccine was 90 to 97% effective at preventing herpes zoster.  For immunocompetent adults ≥ 60 years, the recombinant vaccine or the live-attenuated vaccine is recommended, but the recombinant vaccine is preferred.  A postmarketing observational study observed an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive but self-limited inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. \n【7】 Data regarding the efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in immunocompromised patients are emerging, and there are currently no recommendations for its use in immunocompromised patients.  The live-attenuated vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients. \n【8】 Key Points Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (the cause of chickenpox) from its latent phase.  A painful rash, usually crops of vesicles on an erythematous base, develops on one or more adjacent dermatomes.  Fewer than 4% of patients have another outbreak of zoster, but many, particularly older patients, have persistent or recurrent pain for months or years (postherpetic neuralgia).  Antivirals (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) are beneficial, especially for immunocompromised patients.  Analgesics are often necessary.  Immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years should be given recombinant zoster vaccine whether they have had herpes zoster or not.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:21:51"}

Ischemic stroke usually results when an artery to the brain is blocked, often by a blood clot and/or a fatty deposit due to atherosclerosis.  Symptoms occur suddenly and may include muscle weakness, paralysis, lost or abnormal sensation on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, confusion, problems with vision, dizziness, and loss of balance and coordination.  Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and results of a physical examination and brain imaging.  Other imaging tests (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and blood tests are done to identify the cause of the stroke.  Treatment may include drugs to break up blood clots or to make blood less likely to clot and procedures to physically remove blood clots, followed by rehabilitation.  Preventive measures include control of risk factors, drugs to make blood less likely to clot, and sometimes surgery or angioplasty to open blocked arteries.  About one third of people recover all or most of normal function after an ischemic stroke.   Causes of Ischemic Stroke An ischemic stroke typically results from blockage of an artery that supplies blood to the brain, most commonly a branch of one of the internal carotid arteries.  As a result, brain cells are deprived of blood.  Most brain cells die if they are deprived of blood for 4. 5 hours.  Supplying the Brain With Blood is supplied to the brain through two pairs of large arteries: Internal carotid arteries, which carry blood from the heart along the front of the neck Vertebral arteries, which carry blood from the heart along the back of the neck In the skull, the vertebral arteries unite to form the basilar artery (at the back of the head).  The internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery divide into several branches, including the cerebral arteries.  Some branches join to form a circle of arteries (circle of Willis) that connect the vertebral and internal carotid arteries.  Other arteries branch off from the circle of Willis like roads from a traffic circle.  The branches carry blood to all parts of the brain.  When the large arteries that supply the brain are blocked, some people have no symptoms or have only a small stroke.  But others with the same sort of blockage have a massive ischemic stroke.  Why? Part of the explanation is collateral arteries.  Collateral arteries run between other arteries, providing extra connections.  These arteries include the circle of Willis and connections between the arteries that branch off from the circle.  Some people are born with large collateral arteries, which can protect them from strokes.  Then when one artery is blocked, blood flow continues through a collateral artery, sometimes preventing a stroke.  Other people are born with small collateral arteries.  Small collateral arteries may be unable to pass enough blood to the affected area, so a stroke results.  The body can also protect itself against strokes by growing new arteries.  When blockages develop slowly and gradually (as occurs in atherosclerosis), new arteries may grow in time to keep the affected area of the brain supplied with blood and thus prevent a stroke.  If a stroke has already occurred, growing new arteries can help prevent a second stroke (but cannot reverse damage that has been done). \n【1】 Such blockages often occur in the following ways: By forming in and blocking an artery: An atheroma in the wall of an artery may continue to accumulate fatty material and become large enough to block the artery.  Even if the artery is not completely blocked, the atheroma narrows the artery and slows blood flow through it, like a clogged pipe slows the flow of water.  Slow-moving blood is more likely to clot.  A large clot can block enough blood flowing through the narrowed artery that brain cells supplied by that artery die.  Or if an atheroma splits open (ruptures), the material in it can trigger formation of a blood clot that can block the artery .  By traveling from another artery to an artery in the brain: A piece of an atheroma or a blood clot in the wall of an artery can break off and travel through the bloodstream (becoming an embolus).  The embolus may then lodge in an artery that supplies the brain and block blood flow there.  (Embolism refers to blockage of arteries by materials that travel through the bloodstream to another part of the body. ) Such blockages are more likely to occur where arteries are already narrowed by fatty deposits.  By traveling from the heart to the brain: Blood clots may form in the heart or on a heart valve, particularly artificial valves and valves that have been damaged by infection of the heart's lining (endocarditis).  These clots may break off and travel as emboli and block an artery to the brain. \n【2】 Clogs and Clots: Causes of Ischemic Stroke When an artery that carries blood to the brain becomes clogged or blocked, an ischemic stroke can occur.  Arteries may be blocked by fatty deposits (atheromas, or plaques) due to atherosclerosis.  Arteries in the neck, particularly the internal carotid arteries, are a common site for atheromas.  Arteries may also be blocked by a blood clot (thrombus).  Blood clots may form on an atheroma in an artery.  Clots may also form in the heart of people with a heart disorder.  Part of a clot may break off and travel through the bloodstream (becoming an embolus).  It may then block an artery that supplies blood to the brain, such as one of the cerebral arteries.  Blood clots in a brain artery do not always cause a stroke.  If the clot breaks up spontaneously within less than 15 to 30 minutes, brain cells do not die and people's symptoms resolve.  Such events are called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a disturbance in brain function that typically lasts less than 1 hour and results from a temporary blockage of the brain’s blood supply. \n【3】 If an artery narrows very gradually, other arteries  sometimes enlarge to supply blood to the parts of the brain normally supplied by the clogged artery.  Thus, if a clot occurs in an artery that has developed collateral arteries, people may not have symptoms.  Lacunar infarction refers to tiny ischemic strokes, typically no larger than about a third of an inch (1 centimeter).  In lacunar infarction, one of the small arteries deep in the brain becomes blocked when part of its wall deteriorates and is replaced by a mixture of fat and connective tissue—a disorder called lipohyalinosis.  Lipohyalinosis is different from atherosclerosis, but both disorders can cause arteries to be blocked.  Lacunar infarction tends to occur in older people with diabetes or poorly controlled high blood pressure.  Only a small part of the brain is damaged in lacunar infarction, and the prognosis is usually good.  However, over time, many small lacunar infarcts may develop and cause problems, including problems with thinking and other mental functions (cognitive impairment).  Other causes Several conditions besides rupture of an atheroma can trigger or promote the formation of blood clots, increasing the risk of blockage by a blood clot.  They include the following: Blood disorders: Some disorders, such as an excess of red blood cells , antiphospholipid syndrome, and a high homocysteine level in the blood , make blood more likely to clot. \n【4】 An ischemic stroke can also result from any disorder that reduces the amount of blood supplied to the brain.  For example, An ischemic stroke can occur if inflammation of blood vessels  or infection  narrows blood vessels that supply the brain. \n【5】 A clot may break loose, then travel to an artery in the brain, and block it.  Sometimes the layers of the walls of an artery that carries blood to the brain (such as arteries in the neck) separate from each other (called dissection) and interfere with blood flow to the brain.  Migraine headaches or drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines can cause spasm of the arteries, which can narrow the arteries supplying the brain long enough to cause a stroke.  Rarely, a stroke results from a general decrease in blood flow, as occurs when people lose a lot of blood, become severely dehydrated, or have very low blood pressure.  This type of stroke often occurs when narrowed arteries supplying the brain are narrowed but had not previously caused any symptoms and had not been detected.  Occasionally, an ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is normal but the blood does not contain enough oxygen.  Disorders that reduce the oxygen content of blood include a severe deficiency of red blood cells , suffocation, and carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced when many materials are burned and can be toxic when breathed in large amounts Carbon monoxide poisoning is common. \n【6】 Usually, brain damage in such cases is widespread (diffuse), and coma results.  Sometimes a blood clot in a leg vein  or, rarely, small pieces of fat from the marrow of a broken leg bone move into the bloodstream.  Usually, these blood clots and pieces of fat travel to the heart and block an artery in the lungs (called pulmonary embolism ).  However, some people have an abnormal opening between the right and left upper chambers of the heart (called a patent foramen ovale).  In such people, the blood clots and pieces of fat may go through the opening and thus bypass the lungs and enter the aorta (the largest artery in the body).  If they travel to arteries in the brain, a stroke can result.  Risk factors Some risk factors for ischemic stroke can be controlled or modified to some extent—for example, by treating the disorder that increases risk. \n【7】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. \n【8】 Smoking increases the risk of heart attack, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other disorders. \n【9】 Obesity is influenced by a combination of factors, which usually results in consuming more calories than the body needs. \n【10】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful. \n【11】 Inherited and acquired disorders can increase blood clotting.  Clots cause legs or arms to swell. \n【12】 Then, most strokes become stable, causing little or no further damage.  Strokes that remain stable for 2 to 3 days are called completed strokes.  Sudden blockage by an embolus is most likely to cause this kind of stroke.  In about 10 to 15% of strokes, damage continues to occur and symptoms continue to worsen for up to 2 days, as a steadily enlarging area of brain tissue dies.  Such strokes are called evolving strokes.  In some people, symptoms affect one arm, then spread to other areas on the same side of the body.  The progression of symptoms and damage usually occurs in steps, interrupted by somewhat stable periods.  During these periods, the area temporarily stops enlarging or some improvement occurs.  Such strokes are usually due to the formation of clots in a narrowed artery.  Strokes caused by an embolus often occur during the day, and a headache may be the first symptom.  Strokes caused by a blood clot in a narrowed artery often occur at night and are first noticed when the person wakes up.  Many different symptoms can occur, depending on which artery is blocked and thus which part of the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen .  When the arteries that branch from the internal carotid artery (which carry blood along the front of the neck to the brain) are affected, the following are most common: Blindness in one eye Loss of vision on the same side of both eyes (either the left or right side of both eyes) Abnormal sensations, weakness, or paralysis in one arm or leg or on one side of the body When the arteries that branch from the vertebral arteries (which carry blood along the back of the neck to the brain) are affected, the following are most common: Dizziness and vertigo Double vision or loss of vision in both eyes Generalized weakness on one or both sides of the body Many other symptoms, such as difficulty speaking (for example, slurred speech), impaired consciousness (such as confusion), loss of coordination, and urinary incontinence, can occur.  Severe strokes may lead to stupor or coma.  In addition, strokes, even milder ones, can cause depression or an inability to control emotions.  For example, people may cry or laugh inappropriately.  Some people have a seizure when the stroke begins.  Seizures may also occur months to years later.  Late seizures result from scarring or materials that are deposited from blood in the damaged brain tissue.  Occasionally, fever develops.  It may be caused by the stroke or another disorder.  If symptoms, particularly impaired consciousness, worsen during the first 2 to 3 days, the cause is often swelling due to excess fluid (edema) in the brain.  In large strokes, the swelling in the brain is typically at its worst about 3 days after the stroke begins.  Symptoms usually lessen within a few days, as the fluid is absorbed.  Nonetheless, the swelling is particularly dangerous because the skull does not expand.  The resulting increase in pressure can cause the brain to shift, further impairing brain function, even if the area directly damaged by the stroke does not enlarge.  If the pressure becomes very high, the brain may be forced sideways and downward in the skull, through the rigid structures that separate the brain into compartments.  The resulting disorder is called herniation: The Brain Under Pressure , which can be fatal.  Complications of stroke Strokes can lead to other problems (complications): If swallowing is difficult, people may not eat enough and become malnourished and dehydrated.  Food, saliva, or vomit may be inhaled (aspirated) into the lungs, resulting in aspiration pneumonia and Chemical Pneumonitis Aspiration pneumonia is lung infection caused by inhaling mouth secretions, stomach contents, or both. \n【13】 Being in one position too long can result in pressure sores are areas of skin damage resulting from a lack of blood flow due to prolonged pressure. \n【14】 Not being able to move the legs can result in the formation of blood clots in deep veins of the legs and groin . \n【15】 People may have difficulty sleeping.  The losses and problems resulting from the stroke may make people depressed.  Diagnosis of Ischemic Stroke A doctor's evaluation Computed tomography and sometimes magnetic resonance imaging Laboratory tests, including those to measure blood sugar Doctors can usually diagnose an ischemic stroke based on the history of events and results of a physical examination.  Doctors can usually identify which artery in the brain is blocked based on symptoms.  For example, weakness or paralysis of the left leg suggests blockage of the artery supplying the area on the right side of the brain that controls the left leg’s muscle movements.  When Specific Areas of the Brain Are Damaged Different areas of the brain control specific functions.  Consequently, where the brain is damaged determines which function is lost.  Computed tomography (CT) is usually done first.  CT helps distinguish an ischemic stroke from a hemorrhagic stroke, a brain tumor, an abscess, and other structural abnormalities.  Doctors also measure the blood sugar level to rule out a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia), which can cause similar symptoms.  If available, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging Diffusion-weighted MRI In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images. \n【16】 As soon as possible, doctors may also do imaging tests ,CT angiography In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【17】 Prompt treatment of these blockages can sometimes limit the amount of brain damage caused by the stroke.  Tests to identify the cause Identifying the precise cause of an ischemic stroke is important.  If the blockage is a blood clot, another stroke may occur unless the underlying disorder is corrected.  For example, if blood clots result from an abnormal heart rhythm, treating that disorder can prevent new clots from forming and causing another stroke.  Tests for causes may include the following: Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded. \n【18】 It uses no x-rays. \n【19】 Such information helps determine which treatments are needed.  For cerebral angiography, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery, usually in the groin, and threaded through the aorta to an artery in the neck.  Then, a substance that can be seen on x-rays (radiopaque contrast agent) is injected to outline the artery.  Thus, this test is more invasive than other tests that provide images of the brain’s blood supply.  However, it provides more information.  Cerebral angiography is done before atheromas are surgically removed from the neck  and before any endovascular procedure that uses a catheter to treat a blocked or narrowed arteries.  Cerebral angiography is also done when vasculitis Overview of Vasculitis Vasculitic disorders are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis).  Vasculitis can be triggered by certain infections or drugs or can occur for unknown reasons. \n【20】 Because CT angiography is less invasive, it has largely replaced cerebral angiography done with a catheter.  The exceptions are endovascular procedures ,such as mechanical thrombectomy An ischemic stroke is death of an area of brain tissue (cerebral infarction) resulting from an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the brain due to blockage of an artery. \n【21】 Prognosis of Ischemic Stroke The sooner a stroke is treated with a drug that breaks up blood clots (thrombolytic drug), the less severe brain damage is likely to be and the better the chances for recovery.  During the first few days after an ischemic stroke, doctors usually cannot predict whether a person will improve or worsen.  Younger people and people who start improving quickly are likely to recover more fully.  About 50% of people with one-sided paralysis and most of those with less severe symptoms recover some function by the time they leave the hospital, and they can eventually take care of their basic needs.  They can think clearly and walk adequately, although use of the affected arm or leg may be limited.  Use of an arm is more often limited than use of a leg.  About 10% of people who have an ischemic stroke recover all normal function.  Some people are physically and mentally devastated and unable to move, speak, or eat normally.  About 20% of people who have an ischemic stroke die in the hospital.  The proportion is higher among older people.  About 25% of people who recover from a first stroke have another stroke within 5 years.  Subsequent strokes impair function further.  Most impairments still present after 12 months are permanent.  Treatment of Ischemic Stroke Measures to support vital functions, such as breathing Drugs to break up blood clots or make blood less likely to clot Sometimes surgery to remove a blockage or angioplasty with a stent Measures to manage problems that stroke can cause, such as difficulty swallowing Measures to prevent blood clots in the legs Rehabilitation When a stroke occurs, minutes matter.  The longer blood flow to the brain is reduced or stopped, the more brain damage there will be.  People who have any symptom suggesting an ischemic stroke should immediately call 911 and go to an emergency department.  Treatment to remove or break up clots is most effective when done as soon as possible.  For such drug treatments to be effective, they must be started within 4. 5 hours of when the stroke began.  Procedures to remove clots through a catheter (mechanical thrombectomy) can be effective up to 6 hours after a stroke began and sometimes even later.  Starting treatment as soon as possible is crucial because the earlier blood flow is restored to the brain, the less brain damage there is and the better are the chances for recovery.  Thus, doctors try to rapidly determine when the stroke began and confirm that the stroke is an ischemic stroke, not a hemorrhagic stroke, which is treated differently.  Another priority is to restore the person’s breathing, heart rate, blood pressure (if low), and temperature to normal.  An intravenous line is inserted to provide drugs and fluids when needed.  If the person has a fever, it may be lowered using acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or a cooling blanket because brain damage is worse when body temperature is elevated.  Generally, doctors do not immediately treat high blood pressure Treatment High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【22】 However, very high blood pressure can injure the heart, kidneys, and eyes and must be lowered.  If a stroke is very severe and affects a large area of the brain, drugs such as mannitol may be given to reduce swelling and the increased pressure in the brain.  Some people need a ventilator to breathe adequately.  Specific treatment of stroke may include drugs to break up blood clots (thrombolytic drugs) and drugs to make blood less likely to clot (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants), followed by rehabilitation.  At some specialized centers, blood clots are physically removed from arteries (called mechanical thrombectomy).  Measures are taken to prevent problems that stroke can cause, such as blood clots in the legs and pressure sores.  Measures to prevent another stroke include control of risk factors (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels), use of drugs that make blood less likely to clot, and sometimes surgery or angioplasty to open blocked arteries.  Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) drugs In certain circumstances, a drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is given intravenously to break up clots and help restore blood flow to the brain.  Because tPA can cause bleeding in the brain and elsewhere, it usually should not be given to people with certain conditions, such as the following: A past occurrence of a hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding within the brain, or a brain tumor Bleeding within the brain or a very large area of dead brain tissue detected by CT or MRI A suspected hemorrhagic stroke, even if CT does not detect evidence of one A tendency to bleed (indicated by a low platelet count or abnormal results of other blood tests) Bleeding (hemorrhage) in the gastrointestinal tract within the past 21 days A recent stroke or head injury (within the past 3 months) A very low blood sugar level A heart infection (such as bacterial endocarditis) Use of an anticoagulant (such as warfarin or heparin) within the past 24 hours A large ischemic stroke Blood pressure that remains high after treatment with an antihypertensive drug Brain or spinal surgery within the past 3 months Sometimes symptoms that are resolving quickly Sometimes a seizure when the stroke began Sometimes major surgery or a serious injury within the past 14 days Sometimes bleeding in the urinary tract within the past 21 days Sometimes pregnancy Sometimes a heart attack in the past 3 months Possibly insertion of a needle in an artery in the past 7 days if the artery cannot be compressed to control bleeding Before tPA is given, CT is done to rule out bleeding in the brain.  To be effective and safe, tPA, given intravenously, must be started within 3 hours of the beginning of an ischemic stroke.  Some experts recommend using tPA up to 4. 5 hours after an ischemic stroke begins.  But when tPA is given between 3 and 4. 5 hours, additional conditions may prohibit its use.  These conditions include Being over age 80 Taking an anticoagulant by mouth (regardless of its effect on clotting) Having a severe stroke that resulted in substantial loss of function Having a history of both stroke and diabetes mellitus After 4. 5 hours, giving tPA intravenously has no benefit.  Pinpointing when the stroke began may be difficult.  So doctors assume that the stroke began the last time a person was known to be well.  For example, if a person awakens with symptoms of a stroke, doctors assume the stroke began when the person was last seen awake and well.  Thus, tPA can be used in only a few people who have had a stroke.  If people arrive at the hospital up to 6 hours (occasionally, up to 24 hours) after a stroke due to a blockage in a large artery began, they may be given tPA, with or without additional invasive treatment.  In these situations, a drug or device must be inserted through a catheter and placed directly in the blocked artery.  For this treatment (called thrombectomy), doctors make an incision in the skin, usually in the groin, and insert a catheter into an artery.  The catheter is then threaded through the aorta and other arteries to the clot.  The clot is partly broken up with the wire on the catheter and may be injected with tPA.  This treatment is usually available only at specialized stroke centers.  Mechanical thrombectomy For mechanical thrombectomy, doctors use a device to physically remove the blood clot.  This procedure is often done when people have had a severe stroke and have been ineffectively treated with tPA, given intravenously or by catheter.  New evidence suggests that mechanical thrombectomy can effectively treat people who have a stroke, regardless of its severity.  Mechanical thrombectomy is usually done within 6 hours of when symptoms began.  The procedure can be done up to 24 hours after symptoms began if imaging tests show undamaged brain tissue.  Thus, at some stroke centers, doctors are starting to use a special type of MRI  and other imaging tests to determine how much a stroke has progressed, rather than going strictly by time.  These tests can show how much blood flow has been reduced and indicate how much brain tissue may be saved.  This approach (based on brain tissue status, not time) is especially useful when doctors are unsure of when the stroke began—for example, when people wake up in the morning and have symptoms of a stroke.  If imaging tests show that blood flow is only somewhat reduced, treatment with mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours after symptoms start may still be able to save brain tissue.  But if blood flow has been greatly reduced or has stopped, treatment after only 1 hour may be unable to save any brain tissue.  Different types of devices can be used.  For example, the stent retriever may be used.  It resembles a tiny wire cage.  It can be attached to a catheter, which is inserted through an incision, often in the groin, and threaded to the clot.  The cage is opened up, then closed around the clot, which is drawn out through a larger catheter.  If done within 6 hours of the stroke's start, mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever can dramatically improve outcomes in people with a large blockage.  Devices can restore blood flow in 90 to 100% of people.  Mechanical thrombectomy is done only in stroke centers.  Antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants If a thrombolytic drug cannot be used, most people are given aspirin (an antiplatelet drug) as soon as they get to the hospital.  Antiplatelet drugs make platelets less likely to clump and form clots.  (Platelets are tiny cell-like particles in the blood that help it clot in response to damaged blood vessels. ) If symptoms seem to be worsening despite other treatments, anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin are used.  They may also be used to treat specific types of strokes (such as those due to a blood clot in a vein in the brain, or atrial fibrillation, or dissection of an artery in the neck).  Anticoagulants inhibit proteins in blood that help it to clot (clotting factors).  If people have been given a thrombolytic drug, doctors usually wait at least 24 hours before antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants are started because these drugs add to the already increased risk of bleeding in the brain.  Anticoagulants are not given to people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure or who have had a hemorrhagic stroke.  Long-term treatment of stroke usually consists of aspirin or another antiplatelet drug to reduce the risk of blood clots and thus of subsequent strokes.  Clopidogrel (another antiplatelet drug) is used instead of aspirin if people are allergic to aspirin.  People who have had a minor stroke may be given clopidogrel plus aspirin.  This combination, given within 24 hours of when symptoms began, may be more effective than aspirin alone for reducing the risk of stroke, but only during the first 3 months after the stroke.  After that, the combination has no advantage over taking aspirin alone.  Also, taking clopidogrel plus aspirin increases the risk of bleeding by a small amount.  People who have atrial fibrillation or a heart valve disorder are given anticoagulants (such as warfarin) instead of antiplatelet drugs, which do not seem to prevent blood clots from forming in the heart.  Occasionally, people at high risk of another stroke are given both aspirin and an anticoagulant.  Dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban are new anticoagulants that are sometimes used instead of warfarin.  These newer anticoagulants are more convenient to use because they, unlike warfarin, do not require regular monitoring with blood tests to determine how long it takes blood to clot.  Also, they are not affected by foods and are unlikely to interact with other drugs.  The new anticoagulants have some disadvantages.  Dabigatran and apixaban must be taken twice a day.  (Warfarin is taken once a day. ) Also, people must not miss any doses of the newer drugs for the drugs to be effective, and these drugs are significantly more expensive than warfarin.  Surgery Once an ischemic stroke is completed, surgical removal of fatty deposits (atheromas, or plaques) due to atherosclerosis or clots in an internal carotid artery may be done .  This procedure, called carotid endarterectomy, can help if all of the following are present: The stroke resulted from narrowing of a carotid artery by more than 70% (more than 60% in people who have been having transient ischemic attacks).  Some brain tissue supplied by the affected artery still functions after the stroke.  The person’s life expectancy is at least 5 years.  In such people, carotid endarterectomy may reduce the risk of subsequent strokes.  This procedure also reestablishes the blood supply to the affected area, but it cannot restore lost function because some brain tissue is dead.  For carotid endarterectomy, a general anesthetic is used.  The surgeon makes an incision in the neck over the area of the artery that contains the blockage and an incision in the artery.  The blockage is removed, and the incisions are closed.  For a few days afterwards, the neck may hurt, and swallowing may be difficult.  Most people stay in the hospital 1 or 2 days.  Heavy lifting should be avoided for about 3 weeks.  After several weeks, people can resume their usual activities.  Carotid endarterectomy can trigger a stroke because the operation may dislodge clots or other material that can then travel through the bloodstream and block an artery.  However, after the operation, the risk of stroke is lower than it is when drugs are used, and this risk is lower for several years.  The procedure can result in a heart attack because people who have this procedure often have risk factors for coronary artery disease.  People should find a surgeon who is experienced doing this operation and who has a low rate of serious complications (such as heart attack, stroke, and death) after the operation.  If people cannot find such a surgeon, the risks of endarterectomy may outweigh its expected benefits.  Stents If endarterectomy is too risky or cannot be done because of the artery's anatomy, a less invasive procedure can be done.  A catheter may be used to place a wire mesh tube (stent) with an umbrella filter at its tip in the partly blocked carotid artery.  Once in place the stent is expanded to help keep the artery open.  The filter catches any debris that may break off during the procedure.  The filter is removed once the stent is in place.  After a local anesthetic is given, the catheter is inserted through a small incision into a large artery near the groin or in the arm and is threaded to the internal carotid artery in the neck.  A substance that can be seen on x-rays (radiopaque contrast agent) is injected, and x-rays are taken so that the narrowed area can be located.  After the stent is placed, the filter and catheter are removed.  People remain awake for the procedure, which usually takes 1 to 2 hours.  Placement of a stent appears to be as safe as endarterectomy and as effective in preventing strokes and death.  A similar procedure can be done for other types of large blocked arteries .  Long-term treatment of strokes Long-term treatment of stroke includes measures to do the following: Control problems that can make the effects of stroke worse Prevent or treat problems caused by strokes Prevent future strokes Treat any disorders that are also present During the recovery period, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and fever can make brain damage worse after a stroke.  Lowering them limits the damage and results in better functioning.  Before people who have had a stroke start to eat, drink, or take drugs by mouth, they are checked for problems with swallowing.  Problems with swallowing can lead to aspiration pneumonia and Chemical Pneumonitis Aspiration pneumonia is lung infection caused by inhaling mouth secretions, stomach contents, or both. \n【23】 Measures to prevent this problem are started early.  If problems are detected, a therapist can teach people how to swallow safely.  Sometimes people need to be fed through a tube .  If people cannot move on their own or have difficulty moving, they are at risk of developing blood clots in their legs  and pressure sores Prevention Pressure sores are areas of skin damage resulting from a lack of blood flow due to prolonged pressure. \n【24】 Pneumatic compression stockings may be used to prevent blood clots.  Powered by an electric pump, these stockings repeatedly squeeze the calves and move blood into and through the veins.  People at high risk of developing blood clots may also be given an anticoagulant (such as heparin), injected under the skin of the abdomen or arm.  Sometimes an anticoagulant pill is given by mouth.  Measures to prevent pressure sores Prevention Pressure sores are areas of skin damage resulting from a lack of blood flow due to prolonged pressure. \n【25】 For example, staff members periodically change the person's position in bed to help prevent pressure sores from forming.  They also regularly inspect the skin for any sign of pressure sores.  Controlling or treating risk factors for stroke (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, consumption of too much alcohol, high cholesterol levels, and obesity) can help prevent future strokes.  Statins Lipid-lowering drugs Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. \n【26】 They are often given when strokes result from the buildup of fatty deposits in an artery .  Such therapy can help prevent strokes from recurring.  Antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), taken by mouth may be used to prevent strokes due to atherosclerosis.  These drugs include aspirin, a combination tablet of low-dose aspirin plus dipyridamole, clopidogrel, or clopidogrel plus aspirin.  Clopidogrel is indicated for people who are allergic to aspirin.  Taking clopidogrel plus aspirin appears to reduce the risk of future strokes more than taking aspirin alone, but only for the first 3 months after a stroke.  Usually, antiplatelet drugs are not given to people who are taking warfarin because antiplatelet drugs add to the risk of bleeding.  but occasionally, there are exceptions.  Anticoagulants (such as warfarin), taken by mouth, may be used to prevent strokes due to blood clots.  But the new anticoagulants have some disadvantages.  Also, people must not miss any doses of the newer drugs for the drugs to be effective.  Also, these drugs are significantly more expensive than warfarin.  If other disorders such as heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms, and lung infections are present, they must be treated.  Because a stroke often causes mood changes, especially depression, family members or friends should inform the doctor if the person seems depressed.

The main reason to insert a bladder catheter in female children is to Collect a sterile urine sample for testing in very young children who cannot void on command Less common reasons include Relief of acute or chronic urinary retention  Intermittent catheterization of a neurogenic bladder is bladder dysfunction (flaccid or spastic) caused by neurologic damage.  Symptoms can include overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retention. \n【2】 Relative contraindications Known major abnormalities of the lower urinary tract History of urethral strictures Urethral Stricture is scarring that obstructs the anterior urethral lumen. \n【3】 Most major urethral injuries are due to blunt trauma. \n【4】 Ensure the patient is not allergic to latex or povidone iodine.  If doing multiple procedures, do bladder catheterization first, as the child may void during the other procedures.  Relevant Anatomy The pediatric female anatomy is similar to the adult's, with a difference in size.  The female urethral meatus is the first opening below the clitoris and is located above the vaginal opening.  It can be difficult to visualize if it appears closed.  Also, young girls may have labial adhesions, which can make visualization of the meatus more difficult.  The urethra is short and straight and thus easy to catheterize.  Positioning Place the patient in a supine, frog position (hips and knees partially flexed, heels on the bed, hips comfortably abducted).  An assistant should hold the legs or knees.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure The in-and-out insertion of a catheter will be described here.  Allow one or both parents or caretakers to remain present to comfort the child.  Having them hold the child's hand, provide a stuffed animal for the child to play with, or engage in other distraction techniques can help.  Occasionally sedation is needed.  Place all equipment within easy reach on an uncontaminated sterile field on a bedside tray.  Open the prepackaged kit, taking care not to contaminate the contents.  Place the absorbent underpad with the plastic side down beneath the buttocks.  Remove diaper if present and clean the area with a wet washcloth using soap and water.  Dry the area with a dry towel.  Then wash your hands with soap and water.  Put on gloves using sterile technique.  Apply the sterile lubricant to the end of the catheter and place on the sterile field.  Saturate the application sticks, cotton balls, or gauze with antiseptic solution (eg, povidone iodine).  Place the sterile fenestrated drape over the pelvis so that the vulva is exposed.  With your nondominant hand, separate the labia to expose the meatus.  Cleanse the area around the meatus with each application stick, gauze pad, or cotton ball saturated in povidone iodine.  Clean the area with an anterior-to-posterior motion.  Discard or set aside the newly contaminated application stick, gauze pad, or cotton balls.  If using povidone iodine, clean 3 times then allow the area to dry.  Hold the catheter in your dominant free hand.  Separate the labia with your nondominant hand.  If the meatus is difficult to see, gently pull the vaginal introitus mucosa downward.  Advance the catheter gently through the urethra just until urine is obtained.  Do not poke repeatedly or force the catheter.  Urine should flow freely.  If the catheter has entered the vagina, leave that catheter in place as a landmark and obtain another catheter.  Collect urine in the specimen container.  If the volume is insufficient, gently massage the lower abdomen over the bladder (suprapubic area).  Remove the catheter by pulling out gently.  Remove all remaining povidone iodine with a wet washcloth.  Aftercare Remove the drapes. \n【5】 To prevent causing blind passages and urethral injury, do not use excessive force during insertion.  Tips and Tricks Do not proceed with continued attempts at catheter placement if significant resistance is met or if the catheter feels as if it is buckling inside and not advancing.  If the catheter appears to be in the correct position but urine does not return, lubricant may be obstructing the drainage of urine.  With the catheter held in the current position, flush the catheter with normal saline to dislodge the lubricant and see if urine returns prior to proceeding with the remaining steps.  If the catheter appears to be in the correct position but urine does not return and there is the possibility of anuria due to dehydration, consider providing hydration (appropriate to the patient's clinical condition) before the procedure is attempted again.  Consult a urologist for any issues with catheter placement or guidance on catheter size and style in select clinical scenarios.

Moderate or severe right-sided heart failure increases central venous pressure, which is transmitted to the liver via the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins.  Chronic congestion leads to atrophy of hepatocytes, distention of sinusoids, and centrizonal fibrosis, which, if severe, progresses to cirrhosis (cardiac cirrhosis).  The basis for liver cell death is probably sinusoidal thrombosis that propagates to the central veins and branches of the portal vein, causing ischemia.  Symptoms and Signs of Congestive Hepatopathy Most patients are asymptomatic.  However, moderate congestion causes right upper quadrant discomfort (due to stretching of the liver capsule) and tender hepatomegaly.  Severe congestion leads to massive hepatomegaly and jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia. \n【1】 Ascites is free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.

Having hepatitis B or hepatitis C Overview of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver.   Hepatitis is common throughout the world. \n【1】 People may have abdominal pain, lose weight, and feel a large mass in the upper right part of the abdomen.  Doctors base the diagnosis on results of a blood test and imaging tests.  This cancer is usually fatal unless it is diagnosed early.  ,See also Overview of Liver Tumors may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).  Cancerous liver tumors are classified as primary (originating in the liver) or metastatic  Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of cancer originating in the liver.  It usually occurs in people who have severe scarring of the liver .  In certain areas of Africa and East Asia, hepatocellular carcinoma is more common than it is in the United States and is a common cause of death.  In these areas, many people have chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus Overview of Chronic Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that lasts at least 6 months.  Common causes include hepatitis B and C viruses and certain drugs. \n【2】 The presence of this virus in the body increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma more than 100-fold.  Hepatitis B can cause cirrhosis, but it can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma whether cirrhosis develops or not.  Cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C, Chronic hepatitis C is inflammation of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis C virus and that has lasted more than 6 months. \n【3】 Having hemochromatosis is a hereditary disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron, causing iron to build up in the body and damage organs. \n【4】 Iron may accumulate in the liver and damage it.  Hepatocellular carcinoma sometimes results from exposure to certain cancer-causing substances (carcinogens).  In subtropical regions where hepatocellular carcinoma is common, food is often contaminated by carcinogens called aflatoxins, substances that are produced by certain types of fungi.  In North America, Europe, and other geographic areas where hepatocellular carcinoma is less common, the most common cause is chronic hepatitis C.  Cirrhosis, most commonly long-standing cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis C, fatty liver disease Fatty Liver is an abnormal accumulation of certain fats (triglycerides) inside liver cells. \n【5】 The risk is lower with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is inflammation with progressive scarring of the bile ducts in the liver.  Symptoms of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Usually, the first symptoms are abdominal pain, weight loss, and a large mass that can be felt in the upper right part of the abdomen.  People who have had cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【6】 A fever may occur.  Occasionally, the first symptoms are sudden abdominal pain and shock (dangerously low blood pressure) caused by rupture or bleeding of the cancer.  Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Physical examination Blood and imaging tests Detecting hepatocellular carcinoma early is difficult because at first, the symptoms do not provide many clues.  If a doctor feels an enlarged liver or if an imaging test detects a mass in the upper right part of the abdomen during an examination done for other purposes, the doctor may suspect this cancer, especially in people with long-standing cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【7】 However, screening programs often enable doctors to detect this cancer before symptoms develop.  If hepatocellular carcinoma is suspected, the following are done: Blood tests to measure levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): This protein is normally produced by the fetus, and levels decrease markedly by age 1 year.  Levels are high in about half the people with hepatocellular carcinoma.  Physical examination: Doctors feel the upper right part of the abdomen to check for an enlarged liver or mass.  They may place a stethoscope over the liver to check for sounds caused by the cancer.  For example, they occasionally hear rushing sounds (hepatic bruits, which are due to blood rushing through blood vessels inside the cancer) or scratchy sounds (friction rubs, which are due to the cancer rubbing against the liver surface and surrounding structures). \n【8】 CT and MRI tend to be more accurate than ultrasonography.  Before CT or MRI is done, a contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents During imaging tests, contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail. \n【9】 The contrast agent helps make abnormalities, if present, easier to see.  If the diagnosis is still unclear, a liver biopsy of the Liver Doctors can obtain a sample of liver tissue during exploratory surgery, but more often they obtain a sample by inserting a hollow needle through the person's skin and into the liver. \n【10】 To improve the chances of obtaining cancerous tissue, doctors often use ultrasonography or CT to guide the placement of the biopsy needle.  The risk of bleeding or other injury during a liver biopsy is usually low.  Staging If cancer is diagnosed, doctors determine how large the cancer is and whether it has spread to nearby structures or other parts of the body.  The imaging tests used for diagnosis can provide some of this information.  The cancer is classified ranging from stage I (a single tumor that has not spread) to stage IV (spread to distant parts of the body).  Staging helps doctors decide on treatment and estimate survival.  Screening In some areas where the hepatitis B, Chronic hepatitis B is inflammation of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis B virus and that has lasted more than 6 months. \n【11】 Doctors periodically screen people with cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【12】 Screening usually involves ultrasonography every 6 or 12 months and, sometimes, measurement of the AFP level.  Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Most people with hepatocellular carcinoma do not live for more than a few years because the cancer is detected at a late stage.  Screening and early detection result in a better prognosis.  If the cancer is small and has not spread and liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. \n【13】 Prevention of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Use of the vaccine against hepatitis B virus Hepatitis B Vaccine The hepatitis B vaccine helps protect against hepatitis B and its complications ( chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer). \n【14】 Preventing the development of cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【15】 For example, treating chronic hepatitis B, Chronic hepatitis B is inflammation of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis B virus and that has lasted more than 6 months. \n【16】 Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surgery or liver transplantation Radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolization, or internal radiation therapy Chemotherapy and immunotherapy Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma depends on the extent of the cancer.  Small tumors limited to the liver can be treated with liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. \n【17】 Only liver transplantation or surgical removal of the cancer offers any hope of cure.  However, when the cancer is surgically removed, it often recurs.  Also, removing the cancer in people who have cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【18】 When transplantation or surgery is not possible or when people are waiting for a liver transplant, treatments that focus on the tumor and areas around it can be used.  These treatments may help slow the cancer's growth and relieve symptoms.  For example, doctors may inject a chemical that destroys cancer cells into blood vessels to the cancer.  Or they may use treatments that apply energy to cancer cells and thus destroy them.  Three such treatments are Radiofrequency ablation (which uses electrical energy) Chemoembolization (which uses chemotherapy) Selective internal radiation therapy (which uses radiation) However, these treatments do not destroy all the cancer cells.  Chemotherapy drugs can be injected into a blood vessel that supplies a tumor (called chemoembolization).  For example, drugs can be injected into a vein or into the hepatic artery.  Injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the hepatic artery delivers a large amount of the drugs directly to the cancer cells in the liver.  The chemotherapy drug sorafenib is effective against hepatocellular carcinoma.  Other chemotherapy drugs (for example, lenvatinib and regorafenib) and immunotherapy drugs (for example, nivolumab) are now being used in some people with this cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义重复#5#17#cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver’s internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue  重复出现过多次", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:47:17"}

Placental function is normal, but trophoblastic invasion extends beyond the normal boundary (called Nitabuch layer).  In such cases, manual removal of the placenta, unless scrupulously done, results in massive postpartum hemorrhage.  Prenatal diagnosis is by ultrasonography.  Treatment is usually with scheduled cesarean hysterectomy.  In placenta accreta, the placental villi are not contained by uterine decidual cells, as occurs normally, but extend to the myometrium.  Related abnormalities include Placenta increta (invasion of chorionic villi into the myometrium) Placenta percreta (penetration of chorionic villi into or through the uterine serosa) All three abnormalities cause similar problems.  Etiology The main risk factor for placenta accreta is Prior uterine surgery In the US, placenta accreta most commonly occurs in women who Have placenta previa is implantation of the placenta over or near the internal os of the cervix. \n【1】 For women without placenta previa, having had a previous cesarean delivery increases risk very slightly (< 1% for up to 4 cesarean deliveries). \n【2】 Symptoms and Signs Usually, vaginal bleeding is profuse during manual separation of the placenta after delivery of the fetus.  However, bleeding may be minimal or absent, but the placenta may not be delivered within 30 minutes after delivery of the fetus.  Diagnosis Ultrasonography for women at risk Thorough evaluation of the uteroplacental interface by ultrasonography (transvaginal or transabdominal) is warranted in women at risk; it can be done periodically, beginning at 20 to 24 weeks gestation.  If B-mode (gray-scale) ultrasonography is inconclusive, MRI or Doppler flow studies may help.  During delivery, placenta accreta is suspected if The placenta has not been delivered within 30 minutes of the infant's delivery.  Attempts at manual removal cannot create a plane of separation.  Placental traction causes large-volume hemorrhage.  When placenta accreta is suspected, laparotomy with preparation for large-volume hemorrhage is required.  Treatment Scheduled cesarean hysterectomy If placenta accreta is suspected, clinicians should consider referring the woman to a center with expertise in managing this disorder.  Preparation for delivery is best.  Usually, unless the woman objects, cesarean hysterectomy is done at 34 weeks; this approach tends to result in the best balance of maternal and fetal outcomes.  If cesarean hysterectomy is done (preferably by an experienced pelvic surgeon), a fundal incision followed by immediate clamping of the cord after delivery can help minimize blood loss.  The placenta is left in situ while hysterectomy is done.  Balloon occlusion of the aorta or internal iliac vessels may be done preoperatively but requires a skilled angiographer and may cause serious thromboembolic complications.  Rarely (eg, when placenta accreta is focal, fundal, or posterior), clinicians can attempt to save the uterus, but only if acute hemorrhage is absent.  For example, the uterus can be left in place, and a high dose of methotrexate can be given to dissolve the placenta; this procedure is done only in certain centers.  Uterine artery embolization, arterial ligation, and balloon tamponade are also sometimes used.  Key Points In the US, placenta accreta is becoming increasingly common, occurring most often in women who have placenta previa and have had a cesarean delivery in a previous pregnancy.  Consider using periodic ultrasonography to screen women who are > 35 years of age or are multiparous (particularly if placenta previa developed previously or they have had a prior cesarean delivery), who have submucosal fibroids or endometrial lesions, or who have had prior uterine surgery.  Suspect placenta accreta if the placenta has not been delivered within 30 minutes of the infant's delivery, if attempts at manual removal cannot create a plane of separation, or if placental traction causes large-volume hemorrhage.  If placenta accreta is diagnosed, do cesarean hysterectomy at 34 weeks, unless the woman objects.

Normally, where the bladder and the ureter join, the ureter tunnels slightly sideways through the bladder wall.  The muscles of the bladder wall help keep the end of the ureter shut so that urine flows in only one direction—from the ureter into the bladder.  Some people are born with abnormalities of the junction between the ureter and bladder that allow the urine to flow backward during urination—from the bladder into the ureters.  This condition is called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).  It can occur in one or both ureters.  The backward flow of urine makes urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present.  About 30 to 45% of children and about 1% of newborns who have a UTI that causes a fever have VUR.  VUR sometimes tends to run in families and is less common among Black people.  Children usually outgrow VUR by about age 5 years.  VUR causes no symptoms, but children with VUR tend to have repeated UTIs.  Reflux nephropathy causes no symptoms.  Occasionally, children with reflux nephropathy develop chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【1】 Diagnosis Imaging tests Doctors suspect vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the following children: Those with a UTI at age 3 years or younger Those with UTI and fever at age 5 years or younger Those with repeated UTIs Boys at any age with a UTI Doctors sometimes also suspect VUR in children with close relatives who have the disorder and in children or adults who have repeated urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present. \n【2】 Doctors may suspect that a fetus has VUR if routine prenatal ultrasonography shows a swollen kidney (called hydronephrosis).

The heart, a hollow muscular organ, is located in the center of the chest.  The heart has two sides, right and left.  The right and left sides of the heart each have an Atrium: Upper chamber that collects blood and pumps it to the lower chamber Ventricle: Lower chamber, which pumps blood out of the heart To ensure that blood flows in only one direction, each ventricle has an \"in\" (inlet) valve and an \"out\" (outlet) valve.  In the left ventricle, the inlet valve is the mitral valve, and the outlet valve is the aortic valve.  In the right ventricle, the inlet valve is the tricuspid valve, and the outlet valve is the pulmonic (pulmonary) valve.  Each valve consists of flaps (cusps or leaflets), which open and close like one-way swinging doors.  The mitral valve has two cusps.  The other valves (tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonic) have three.  The large inlet valves (mitral and tricuspid) have tethers—consisting of the papillary muscles and cords of tissue—which prevent the valves from swinging backward into the atria.  If a papillary muscle is damaged , the valve may then swing backward and start leaking Overview of Heart Valve Disorders Heart valves regulate the flow of blood through the heart's four chambers—two small, round upper chambers (atria) and two larger, cone-shaped lower chambers (ventricles). \n【2】 If a valve opening is narrowed Overview of Heart Valve Disorders Heart valves regulate the flow of blood through the heart's four chambers—two small, round upper chambers (atria) and two larger, cone-shaped lower chambers (ventricles). \n【3】 Both leaking and narrowing may occur in the same valve.  The heartbeats are evidence that the heart is pumping.  Doctors often describe the sound of the heartbeat as lub-dub.  When doctors listen to the heartbeat with a stethoscope, the first sound they hear (the lub of lub-dub) is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing.  The second sound (the dub) is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing.  Each heartbeat has two parts: Systole: During systole, the ventricles contract and pump blood out of the heart, and the atria relax and begin filling with blood again.  Diastole: During diastole, the ventricles relax and fill with blood.  Then the atria contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles.  Function of the Heart's only function is to pump blood.  The right side of the heart: Pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed The left side of the heart: Pumps blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen and nutrients are delivered to tissues and waste products (such as carbon dioxide) are transferred to the blood for removal by other organs (such as the lungs and kidneys) A Look Into the Heart This cross-sectional view of the heart shows the direction of normal blood flow.  Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins—the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, known collectively as the venae cavae—into the right atrium.  When the right ventricle relaxes, blood in the right atrium pours through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.  When the right ventricle is nearly full, the right atrium contracts, propelling additional blood into the right ventricle, which then contracts.  This contraction closes the tricuspid valve and propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs.  In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs.  Here, the blood absorbs oxygen and gives up carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled.  Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.  When the left ventricle relaxes, the blood in the left atrium pours through the mitral valve into the left ventricle.  When the left ventricle is nearly full, the left atrium contracts, propelling additional blood into the left ventricle, which then contracts.  (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important. ) The contraction of the left ventricle closes the mitral valve and propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body.  This blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.  The pulmonary circulation is the circuit through the right side of the heart, the lungs, and the left atrium.  The systemic circulation is the circuit through the left side of the heart, most of the body, and the right atrium.  Blood Supply of the Heart Like all organs, the heart needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.  Even though the heart chambers are full of blood, the heart muscle needs its own dedicated blood supply which is called the Coronary circulation is the system of arteries and veins that supplies the heart muscle (myocardium) with oxygen-rich blood and then returns oxygen-depleted blood to the right atrium.  The right coronary artery and the left coronary artery branch off the aorta (just after it leaves the heart) to deliver oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.  These two arteries branch into other arteries that also supply blood to the heart.  The cardiac veins collect blood from the heart muscle and empty it into a large vein on the back surface of the heart called the coronary sinus, which returns the blood to the right atrium.  Because of the great pressure exerted in the heart as it contracts, most blood flows through the coronary circulation only while the ventricles are relaxing between beats (during diastole).  Supplying the Heart With Blood Like any other tissue in the body, the muscle of the heart must receive oxygen-rich blood and have waste products removed by the blood.  The right coronary artery branches into the marginal artery and the posterior interventricular artery, located on the back surface of the heart.  The left coronary artery (typically called the left main coronary artery) branches into the circumflex and the left anterior descending artery.  The cardiac veins collect blood containing waste products from the heart muscle and empty it into a large vein on the back surface of the heart called the coronary sinus, which returns the blood to the right atrium.  Regulation of the Heart The contraction of the muscle fibers in the heart is very organized and highly controlled.  Every heart muscle fiber does not contract at exactly the same time.  Instead, the fibers contract in a sequence that best pumps blood out of each heart chamber.  The contraction sequence is controlled by rhythmic electrical impulses (discharges) that flow through the heart in a precise manner along distinct pathways and at a controlled speed.  The impulses originate in the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinus or sinoatrial node—a small mass of tissue in the wall of the right atrium), which generates a tiny electrical current.  Tracing the Heart’s Electrical Pathway The sinoatrial (sinus) node  initiates an electrical impulse that flows through the right and left atria , making them contract.  When the electrical impulse reaches the atrioventricular node , it is delayed slightly.  The impulse then travels down the bundle of His , which divides into the right bundle branch for the right ventricle  and the left bundle branch for the left ventricle .  The impulse then spreads through the ventricles, making them contract.  The heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times the heart beats within a minute.  The heart rate goes up when the body needs more oxygen (such as during exercise).  The heart rate goes down when the body needs less oxygen (such as during rest).  The rate at which the sinus node sends out its impulses governs the heart rate.  The sinus node has its own rate of sending out impulses. \n【4】 The sympathetic division works through a network of nerves called the sympathetic plexus and through the hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which are released by the adrenal glands and the nerve endings.  The parasympathetic division works through a single nerve—the vagus nerve—which releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:39:32"}

However, newer potent and less toxic triazoles and echinocandins are now often recommended as first-line drugs for many invasive fungal infections.  These drugs have markedly changed the approach to antifungal therapy, sometimes even allowing oral treatment of chronic mycoses.   \n【1】 Amphotericin B has been the mainstay of antifungal therapy for invasive and serious mycoses, but other antifungals (eg, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, the echinocandins) are now considered first-line drugs for many of these infections.  Although amphotericin B does not have good cerebrospinal fluid penetration, it is still effective for certain mycoses such as cryptococcal meningitis Subacute meningitis develops over days to a few weeks.  Chronic meningitis lasts ≥ 4 weeks. \n【2】 For chronic mycoses, amphotericin B deoxycholate is usually started at ≥ 0. 3 mg/kg IV once a day, increased as tolerated to the desired dose (0. 4 to 1. 0 mg/kg; generally not > 50 mg/day); many patients tolerate the target dose on the first day.  For acute, life-threatening mycoses, amphotericin B deoxycholate may be started at 0. 6 to 1. 0 mg/kg IV once a day.  Formulations There are 2 formulations of amphotericin: Deoxycholate (standard) Lipid-based The standard formulation, amphotericin B deoxycholate, must always be given in 5% D/W because salts can precipitate the drug.  It is usually given over 2 to 3 hours, although more rapid infusions over 20 to 60 minutes can be used in selected patients.  However, more rapid infusions usually have no advantage.  Many patients have chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and, occasionally, hypotension during and for several hours after an infusion.  Amphotericin B may also cause chemical thrombophlebitis when given via peripheral veins; a central venous catheter may be preferable.  Pretreatment with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is often used; if these drugs are ineffective, hydrocortisone 25 to 50 mg or diphenhydramine 25 mg is sometimes added to the infusion or given as a separate IV bolus.  Often, hydrocortisone can be tapered and omitted during extended therapy.  Severe chills and rigors can be relieved or prevented by meperidine 50 to 75 mg IV.  Several lipid vehicles reduce the toxicity of amphotericin B (particularly nephrotoxicity and infusion-related symptoms).  Two preparations are available: Amphotericin B lipid complex Liposomal amphotericin B Lipid formulations are preferred over conventional amphotericin B because they cause fewer infusion-related symptoms and less nephrotoxicity.  Adverse effects The main adverse effects of amphotericin B are Nephrotoxicity (most common) Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Bone marrow suppression Renal impairment is the major toxic risk of amphotericin B therapy.  Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) should be monitored before treatment and at regular intervals during treatment: several times/week for the first 2 to 3 weeks, then 1 to 4 times/month as clinically indicated.  Amphotericin B is unique among nephrotoxic antimicrobial drugs because it is not eliminated appreciably via the kidneys and does not accumulate as renal failure worsens.  Nevertheless, dosages should be lowered or a lipid formulation should be used instead if serum creatinine rises to > 2. 0 to 2. 5 mg/dL (> 177 to 221 micromol/L) or BUN rises to > 50 mg/dL (> 18 millimole/L).  Acute nephrotoxicity can be reduced by aggressive IV hydration with saline before amphotericin B infusion; at least 1 L of normal saline should be given before amphotericin infusion.  Mild to moderate renal function abnormalities induced by amphotericin B usually resolve gradually after therapy is completed.  Permanent damage occurs primarily after prolonged treatment; after > 4 g total dose, about 75% of patients have persistent renal insufficiency.  Amphotericin B also frequently suppresses bone marrow function, manifested primarily by anemia.  Hepatotoxicity or other untoward effects are unusual.  Azole Antifungals Azoles block the synthesis of ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell membrane.  They can be given orally to treat chronic mycoses.  The first such oral drug, ketoconazole, has been supplanted by more effective, less toxic triazole derivatives, such as fluconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole.  Drug interactions can occur with all azoles but are less likely with fluconazole.  The drug interactions mentioned below are not intended as a complete listing; clinicians should refer to a specific drug interaction reference before using azole antifungal drugs.  Pearls & Pitfalls Drug interactions are common with azole antifungals; review all concurrent drug use before prescribing them.  Fluconazole This water-soluble drug is absorbed almost completely after an oral dose.  Fluconazole is excreted largely unchanged in urine and has a half-life of > 24 hours, allowing single daily doses.  It has high penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (≥ 70% of serum levels) and has been especially useful in treating cryptococcal meningitis Subacute meningitis develops over days to a few weeks. \n【3】 It is also one of the first-line drugs for treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients.  Doses range from 200 to 400 mg orally once a day to as high as 800 mg once a day in some seriously ill patients and in patients infected with Candida glabrata or other Candida species (not C.  albicans or C.  krusei); daily doses of ≥ 1000 mg have been given and had acceptable toxicity.  Adverse effects that occur most commonly with fluconazole are gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and rash.  More severe toxicity is unusual, but the following have occurred: hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis, alopecia, and, when taken for long periods of time during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, congenital fetal anomalies.  Drug interactions occur less often with fluconazole than with other azoles.  However, fluconazole sometimes elevates serum levels of calcium channel blockers, cyclosporine, rifabutin, phenytoin, tacrolimus, warfarin-type oral anticoagulants, sulfonylurea drugs (eg, tolbutamide), and zidovudine.  Rifampin may lower fluconazole blood levels. \n【4】 It is available as an IV formulation as well as an oral capsule.  No drug level monitoring is required.  Adverse effects of isavuconazole include GI upset and hepatitis; the QT interval may decrease.  Drug interactions occur with many drugs.  Itraconazole has become the standard treatment for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis is a cutaneous infection caused by the saprophytic mold Sporothrix schenckii.  Pulmonary and hematogenous involvement is uncommon. \n【5】 Symptoms are ulcerating nodules on exposed body parts. \n【6】 Despite poor CSF penetration, itraconazole can be used to treat some types of fungal meningitis, but it is not the drug of choice.  Because of its high lipid solubility and protein binding, itraconazole blood levels tend to be low, but tissue levels are typically high.  Drug levels are negligible in urine and CSF.  Use of itraconazole has declined as use of voriconazole and posaconazole has increased.  Adverse effects of itraconazole with doses of up to 400 mg/day most commonly are GI, but a few men have reported erectile dysfunction, and higher doses may cause hypokalemia, hypertension, and edema.  Other reported adverse effects include allergic rash, hepatitis, and hallucinations.  A U. S.  Food and Drug Administration black box warning for heart failure has been issued, particularly with a total daily dose of 400 mg.  Drug and food interactions can be significant.  When the capsule form is used, acidic drinks (eg, cola, acidic fruit juices) or foods (especially high-fat foods) improve absorption of itraconazole from the GI tract.  However, absorption may be reduced if itraconazole is taken with prescription or over-the-counter drugs used to lower gastric acidity.  Several drugs, including rifampin, rifabutin, didanosine, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, may decrease serum itraconazole levels.  Itraconazole also inhibits metabolic degradation of other drugs, elevating blood levels with potentially serious consequences.  Serious, even fatal cardiac arrhythmias may occur if itraconazole is used with cisapride (not available in the US) or some antihistamines (eg, terfenadine, astemizole, perhaps loratadine).  Rhabdomyolysis has been associated with itraconazole-induced elevations in blood levels of cyclosporine or statins.  Blood levels of some drugs (eg, digoxin, tacrolimus, oral anticoagulants, sulfonylureas) may increase when these drugs are used with itraconazole.  A new formulation of itraconazole (SUBA-itraconazole, for SUper BioAvailable) has improved bioavailability without the need for an acidic environment in the stomach.  SUBA-itraconazole is taken with food and is approved for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis.  Its dosage is different from other forms of itraconazole .  Posaconazole The triazole posaconazole is available as an oral suspension, a tablet, and an IV formulation.  This drug is highly active against yeasts and molds and effectively treats various opportunistic mold infections, such as those due to dematiaceous (dark-walled) fungi (eg, Cladophialophora species).  It is effective against many of the species that cause mucormycosis refers to infection caused by diverse fungal organisms in the order Mucorales, including those in the genera Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, and Mucor. \n【7】 Posaconazole can also be used as fungal prophylaxis in neutropenic patients with various cancers and in bone marrow transplant recipients.  Adverse effects of posaconazole, as for other triazoles, include a prolonged QT interval and hepatitis.  Drug interactions occur with many drugs, including rifabutin, rifampin, statins, various immunosuppressants, and barbiturates.  Voriconazole This broad-spectrum triazole is available as a tablet and an IV formulation.  It is considered the treatment of choice for Aspergillus infections  in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.  Voriconazole can also be used to treat Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium infections.  Additionally, the drug is effective in candidal esophagitis and invasive candidiasis (Invasive) Candidiasis is infection by Candida species (most often C.  albicans), manifested by mucocutaneous lesions, fungemia, and sometimes focal infection of multiple sites. \n【8】 Adverse effects that must be monitored for include hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances (common), hallucinations, and dermatologic reactions.  Voriconazole can prolong the QT interval.  Drug interactions are numerous, notably with certain immunosuppressants used after organ transplantation.  Echinocandins are water-soluble lipopeptides that inhibit glucan synthase.  They are available only in an IV formulation.  Their mechanism of action is unique among antifungal drugs; echinocandins target the fungal cell wall, making them attractive because they lack cross-resistance with other drugs and their target is fungal and has no mammalian counterpart.  Drug levels in urine and CSF are not significant.  Echinocandins available in the US are anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin.  There is little evidence to suggest that one is better than the other, but anidulafungin appears to interact with fewer drugs than the other two.  These drugs are potently fungicidal against most clinically important Candida species  but are considered fungistatic against Aspergillus.  Adverse effects of echinocandins include hepatitis and rash.  Flucytosine, a nucleic acid analog, is water soluble and well-absorbed after oral administration.  Preexisting or emerging resistance is common, so it is almost always used with another antifungal, usually amphotericin B.  Flucytosine plus amphotericin B is used primarily to treat cryptococcosis is a pulmonary or disseminated infection acquired by inhalation of soil contaminated with the encapsulated yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans or C.  gattii. \n【9】 Flucytosine plus antifungal azoles may be beneficial in treating cryptococcal meningitis Subacute meningitis develops over days to a few weeks. \n【10】 The usual dose (12. 5 to 37. 5 mg/kg orally 4 times a day) leads to high drug levels in serum, urine, and CSF.  Major adverse effects of flucytosine are bone marrow suppression (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), hepatotoxicity, and enterocolitis; the degree of bone marrow suppression is proportional to serum levels.  Because flucytosine is cleared primarily by the kidneys, blood levels rise if nephrotoxicity develops during concomitant use with amphotericin B, particularly when amphotericin B is used in doses > 0. 4 mg/kg/day.  Flucytosine serum levels should be monitored, and the dosage should be adjusted to keep levels between 40 and 90 mcg/mL.  Complete blood count and renal and liver tests should be done twice/week.  If blood levels are unavailable, therapy is begun at 25 mg/kg 4 times a day, and dosage is decreased if renal function deteriorates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:31:25"}

Hashimoto thyroiditis results when antibodies in the body attacks the cells of the thyroid gland—an autoimmune reaction.  At first, the thyroid gland may function normally, be underactive (hypothyroidism) or, rarely, overactive (hyperthyroidism) Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism.  People with hypothyroidism usually feel tired and cannot tolerate cold.  The diagnosis is based on results of a physical examination and blood tests.  People with hypothyroidism need to take thyroid hormone for the rest of their life.   Thyroiditis refers to any inflammation of the thyroid gland.  Inflammation of the thyroid may be caused by a viral infection or an autoimmune disorder.  Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common type of thyroiditis and the most common cause of hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions. \n【1】 For unknown reasons, the body turns against itself . \n【2】 In about 50% of people with Hashimoto thyroiditis, the thyroid is underactive initially.  In most of the rest, the thyroid is normal at first (although in a small number of people, the gland initially becomes overactive), after which it usually becomes underactive.  Some people with Hashimoto thyroiditis have other endocrine disorders, such as diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【3】 Hashimoto thyroiditis is most common among women, particularly older women, and tends to run in families.  The condition occurs more frequently among people with certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) Down syndrome is a chromosome disorder caused by an extra chromosome 21 that results in intellectual disability and physical abnormalities. \n【4】 Symptoms of Hashimoto Thyroiditis often begins with a painless, firm enlargement of the thyroid gland or a feeling of fullness in the neck.  The gland usually has a rubbery texture and sometimes feels lumpy.  If the thyroid is underactive, people may feel tired and intolerant of cold and have other symptoms of hypothyroidism Symptoms Hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions. \n【5】 The few who have an overactive thyroid Hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions. \n【6】 Diagnosis of Hashimoto Thyroiditis Thyroid function tests (TSH and T4; T3 if hyperthyroidism is suspected) Thyroid antibodies Sometimes a thyroid ultrasound Doctors do an examination of the thyroid.  An ultrasound of the thyroid may be done if the thyroid feels like it has bump (nodules).

They also do a blood test for antibodies that can attack the thyroid gland.  Treatment of Hashimoto Thyroiditis Usually thyroid hormone replacement when the patient is clinically hypothyroid and the TSH level is elevated in the blood Avoidance of excess iodine in food or nutritional supplements Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism and then must take thyroid hormone replacement Treatment Hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions. \n【7】 Thyroid hormone may also be useful in reducing the size of the enlarged thyroid gland.

Specialized techniques can be used to increase the chances of identifying the eggs.  When stool analysis does not identify a cause for persistent diarrhea, doctors may use a flexible viewing tube  to examine the upper part of digestive tract.  Doctors may use this procedure to obtain a sample of tissue to be examined and analyzed (biopsied).  Cystoisospora, if present, can be seen in a biopsy sample from the intestine.  Prevention of Cystoisosporiasis When traveling to tropical and subtropical areas where the infection is common, people should avoid eating uncooked foods, including salads and vegetables, and should avoid consuming potentially contaminated water and ice.  Hand washing with soap and water is important.  Drinking water that has been boiled is safe.  Filtering water through a 0. 1 or 0. 4 micron filter can remove cysts of Cystoisospora and other parasites, as well as bacteria that cause diseases.  Treatment of Cystoisosporiasis Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Infected people who have symptoms can be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) taken by mouth.  In people with AIDS More severe symptoms Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【3】 Such treatment can strengthen the weakened immune system, which usually helps control the diarrhea and other symptoms.  People with AIDS may need a higher dose of TMP/SMX and a longer course of treatment.  Sometimes long-term TMP/SMX maintenance therapy is needed in people with HIV/AIDS.  For cystoisosporiasis, people who are allergic to (or intolerant of) TMP/SMX can be treated with pyrimethamine.  Leucovorin is given concurrently to prevent anemia and low white blood count, which are side effects of pyrimethamine.  Ciprofloxacin has been used to treat cystoisosporiasis, but it is less effective than TMP/SMX.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:25:00"}

People always have anemia and sometimes jaundice.  Worsening anemia, fever, and shortness of breath with pain in the long bones, abdomen, and chest can indicate sickle cell crisis.  A special blood test called electrophoresis can be used to determine whether people have sickle cell disease.  Avoiding activities that may cause crises and treating infections and other disorders quickly can help prevent crises.   Sickle cell disease affects people with African or Black American ancestry almost exclusively.  About 10% of people with such ancestry in the United States have one copy of the gene for sickle cell disease (that is, they have sickle cell trait).  People who have sickle cell trait do not develop sickle cell disease, but they do have increased risks of some complications such as blood in their urine.  About 0. 3% of people with African or Black American ancestry have two copies of the gene.  These people develop the disease.  Red Blood Cell Shapes Normal red blood cells are flexible and disk-shaped, thicker at the edges than in the middle.  In several hereditary disorders, red blood cells become spherical (in hereditary spherocytosis), oval (in hereditary elliptocytosis), or sickle-shaped (in sickle cell disease).  In sickle cell disease, the red blood cells contain an abnormal form of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen).  The abnormal form of hemoglobin is called hemoglobin S.  When red blood cells contain a large amount of hemoglobin S, they can become deformed into a sickle shape and less flexible.  Not every red blood cell is sickle-shaped.  The sickle-shaped cells become more numerous when people have infections or low levels of oxygen in the blood.  The sickle cells are fragile and break apart easily.  Because the sickle cells are stiff, they have difficulty traveling through the smallest blood vessels (capillaries), blocking blood flow and reducing oxygen supply to tissues in areas where capillaries are blocked.  The blockage of blood flow can cause pain and, over time, cause damage to the spleen, kidneys, brain, bones, and other organs.  Kidney failure Chronic Kidney Disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood.  Symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease People who have sickle cell disease always have some degree of anemia (often causing fatigue, weakness, and paleness) and may have mild jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.  Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. \n【1】 Some people have few other symptoms.  Others have severe, recurring symptoms that cause enormous disability and early death.  Sickle cell trait In people with sickle cell trait, red blood cells are not fragile and do not break easily.  Sickle cell trait does not cause painful crises, but rarely, people die suddenly while undergoing very strenuous exercise that causes severe dehydration, such as during military or athletic training.  People with sickle cell trait are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【2】 Rarely, they may notice blood in their urine.  People with sickle cell trait are also at risk for an extremely rare form of kidney cancer.  Sickle cell crisis Anything that reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood, such as vigorous exercise, mountain climbing, flying at high altitudes without sufficient oxygen, or an illness, may bring on a sickle cell crisis (also called an exacerbation).  A sickle cell pain (vaso-occlusive) crisis is an episode of increased symptoms and can consist of a sudden worsening of anemia, pain (often in the abdomen or long bones of the arms and legs), fever, and sometimes shortness of breath.  Abdominal pain may be severe, and vomiting may occur.  Sometimes, additional complications occur with a pain crisis, including Aplastic crisis: Production of red blood cells in the bone marrow stops during infection with some viruses Acute chest syndrome: Caused by blockage of capillaries in the lungs Acute splenic or hepatic (liver) sequestration (a large accumulation of cells in an organ): Rapid enlargement of the spleen or liver Acute chest syndrome can occur in people of all ages, but it is most common among children.  It is usually characterized by severe pain and difficulty breathing.  Acute chest syndrome can be fatal.  In children, acute sequestration of sickled cells in the spleen (sequestration crisis) may occur causing an enlarged spleen and worsening anemia.  Acute hepatic (liver) sequestration is less common and can occur at any age.  Complications Most people who have sickle cell disease develop an enlarged spleen An enlarged spleen is not a disease in itself but the result of an underlying disorder.  Many disorders can make the spleen enlarge. \n【3】 By the time the person reaches adolescence, the spleen is often so badly injured that it shrinks and no longer functions.  Because the spleen helps fight infection, people with sickle cell disease are more likely to develop pneumococcal pneumonia Pneumococcal Infections are caused by the gram-positive, sphere-shaped (coccal) bacteria  Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). \n【4】 Viral infections, in particular, can decrease red blood cell production, so anemia becomes more severe.  The liver can become progressively larger throughout life (causing upper abdominal fullness), and gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder. \n【5】 Heart murmurs are common.  Children who have sickle cell disease often have a relatively short torso but long arms, legs, fingers, and toes.  Changes in the bones and bone marrow may cause bone pain, especially in the hands and feet.  Episodes of joint pain with fever may occur, and the hip joint may become so damaged that it eventually needs to be replaced.  Poor circulation to the skin may cause sores on the legs, especially at the ankles.  Young men may develop persistent, often painful erections .  Episodes of priapism may permanently damage the penis so that the man can no longer have erections.  Blocked blood vessels may cause strokes that damage the nervous system.  In older people, lung and kidney function may deteriorate.  Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease Blood tests Hemoglobin electrophoresis Prenatal testing Doctors recognize anemia, stomach and bone pain, and nausea in a young person with African or Black American ancestry as possible signs of a sickle cell crisis.  When doctors suspect sickle cell disease, they do blood tests.  Sickle-shaped red blood cells and fragments of destroyed red blood cells can be seen in a blood sample examined under a microscope.  Hemoglobin electrophoresis, another blood test, is also done.  In electrophoresis, an electrical current is used to separate the different types of hemoglobin and thus detect abnormal hemoglobin.  Further testing may be needed, depending on the specific symptoms the person experiences during the crisis.  For example, if the person has difficulty breathing or a fever, a chest x-ray may be done.  Screening Blood tests are done on relatives of people with the disorder because they also may have sickle cell disease or trait.  Discovering the trait in people may be important for family planning, to determine their risk of having a child with sickle cell disease.  In the United States, newborns are routinely screened with a blood test.  Tests can be done during early pregnancy to screen the fetus and allow prenatal counseling Carrier Screening for couples who are at risk of having a child with sickle cell disease. \n【6】 Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease Treatments aimed at preventing crises Treatment of crises and conditions that cause them Treatment is aimed at Preventing crises Controlling the anemia Relieving symptoms Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. \n【7】 Bone marrow or stem cells from a family member or other donor who does not have the sickle cell gene may be transplanted in a person with the disease.  Although such transplantation may be curative, it is risky and so it is not often done.  Recipients must take drugs that suppress the immune system for the rest of their life.  Gene therapy, a technique in which normal genes are implanted in precursor cells (cells that produce blood cells), is being studied.  Preventing sickle cell crisis People who have sickle cell disease should try to avoid activities that reduce the amount of oxygen in their blood and should seek prompt medical attention for even minor illnesses, such as viral infections.  Because people are at increased risk of infection, they should receive vaccines for pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). \n【8】 These infections may be serious in children. \n【9】 Children typically take penicillin by mouth from age 4 months until age 6 years.  Drugs can help control sickle cell disease.  For example, hydroxyurea increases the production of a form of hemoglobin found predominantly in fetuses, which decreases the number of red blood cells becoming sickle-shaped.  Therefore, it reduces the frequency of sickle cell crises and acute chest syndrome.  New drugs that help control the symptoms and complications of sickle cell disease are L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor.  Controlling anemia People are given folic acid, a vitamin that helps the body make new red blood cells.  Blood transfusions Overview of Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or a blood component from one healthy person (a donor) to a sick person (a recipient). \n【10】 Treating sickle cell crisis may require hospitalization.  People are given oxygen, fluid by vein (intravenously), and drugs to relieve pain. \n【11】 Conditions that may have caused the crisis, such as an infection, are treated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 18:54:07"}

Plain X-Rays Without Contrast Abdominal x-rays without radiopaque contrast agents may be done to check for positioning of ureteral stents or to monitor position and growth of kidney stones.  However, for initial diagnosis of urolithiasis Urinary Calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.  They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【1】 X-Rays With Use of Contrast Images taken after administration of water-soluble contrast agents highlight the kidneys and urinary collecting system.  Nonionic iso-osmolal agents (eg, iohexol, iopamidol) are now widely used; they have fewer adverse effects than older hyperosmolal agents but still pose a risk of acute kidney injury .  In urography, an x-ray is taken after IV, percutaneous antegrade or retrograde, or cystoscopic retrograde administration of a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity.  Most contrast agents are iodine based. \n【2】 Primary contraindications for all patients are iodine allergy and risk factors for contrast nephropathy.  IV urography (IVU) IVU (sometimes called IVP, for intravenous pyelography) has been largely superseded by rapid multidimensional CT and MRI with or without a contrast agent.  When IVU is done, abdominal compression may improve visualization of the renal pelvis and proximal ureters (with application) and distal ureters (after release).  Additional x-rays at 12 and 24 hours after contrast administration may be indicated for detection of postrenal obstruction or hydronephrosis.  Percutaneous antegrade urography For percutaneous antegrade urography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【3】 Occasionally, a ureterostomy or an ileal conduit can be used.  Antegrade urography is used in the following circumstances: When retrograde urography is unsuccessful (eg, because of tumor obstruction at the bladder level) When large kidney calculi requiring percutaneous surgery must be evaluated When transitional cell carcinoma of the upper collecting system is suspected When patients cannot tolerate general anesthesia or the degree of sedation required for retrograde urography Complications relate to puncture and placement of the catheter in the genitourinary tract and include bleeding, infection, injury to the lungs or colon, hematuria Isolated Hematuria is red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, specifically > 3 RBCs per high-power field on urine sediment examination. \n【4】 Retrograde urography uses cystoscopy and ureteral catheterization to introduce a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【5】 Sedation or general anesthesia is required.  This technique can be used when CT and MRI with IV contrast agents are contraindicated  or unavailable or when results are equivocal (eg, in renal insufficiency).  It is also useful for detailed examination of the pelvicaliceal collecting system and ureters to check for injury, stricture, or fistula.  Overdistention and backflow from a kidney into the venous system may distort calyces and obscure details.  Risk of infection is higher than that with other types of urography.  Acute ureteral edema and secondary stricture formation are rare complications.  Cystourethrography For cystourethrography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【6】 This technique provides more details than other imaging studies for evaluation of the following: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【7】 The disorder is greatly underrecognized and underreported. \n【8】 No patient preparation is necessary.  Adverse effects include UTIs and urosepsis.  Angiography Conventional catheter angiography has been largely replaced by noninvasive vascular imaging (eg, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning).  Remaining indications include renal vein renin imaging and, among patients with renal artery stenosis, angioplasty and stent placement.  Arteriography is also rarely used for evaluation and treatment of renal hemorrhage and before kidney-sparing surgery.  Digital subtraction angiography is no longer used when rapid-sequence multidimensional CT or helical (spiral) CT is available.  Ultrasonography can provide useful images of many genitourinary structures without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Images are interpreted as they are acquired, so the technician can focus on concerning areas and obtain additional information if necessary.  Its main disadvantages are the need for a skilled operator and the time required.  A full bladder helps provide better images of certain structures but no other preparation is needed.  Structures that can be imaged and common indications include the following: Kidneys: For hydronephrosis, stones Urinary Calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. \n【9】 Conventional or helical scanners are used for most purposes with or without IV contrast agents Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【10】 Use of contrast agents with either technique resembles IV urography (IVU) but provides additional detail.  Previously, in trauma patients, there was concern that use of contrast would make it difficult to distinguish abdominal hemorrhage from urinary tract disruption, but with modern imaging techniques and protocols, this distinction can be made.  Helical CT without a contrast agent is the study of choice for imaging of calculi; dual-energy scanners may provide additional information that can help determine stone composition.  The main disadvantage of CT is that it exposes patients to a relatively large dose of ionizing radiation.  CT angiography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle disease. \n【11】 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Compared with CT, MRI is safer for patients at risk of contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary. \n【12】 Magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated in patients with ferromagnetic metal (ie, containing iron) implants and magnetically activated or electronically controlled devices (eg, cardiac pacemakers).  See also the MRI safety web site.  Also, due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, MRI with gadolinium contrast is contraindicated in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min.  Urologic application of MRI includes the evaluation of renal cysts and small renal masses.  MRI is also helpful in imaging blood vessels , and its use is increasing as MRI becomes more widely available.  Multiparametric MRI is now the imaging study of choice for staging prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma.  Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain. \n【13】 A multiparametric MRI examination includes paramagnetic contrast and consists of 3 separate imaging techniques (parameters): T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.  A technique known as MRI fusion biopsy is sometimes used during a prostate biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【14】 An MRI of the prostate is obtained prior to ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, during which the MRI image is digitally combined (fused) with the ultrasound image to better identify lesions that need to be biopsied.  Radionuclide Scanning Cortical tracers that bind to proximal tubular cells (eg, technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc DMSA]) are used to image the renal parenchyma.  Excretory tracers that are rapidly filtered and excreted into urine (eg, iodine-125 iothalmate, 99mTc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA], 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 [MAG3]) are used to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and overall renal perfusion.  Radionuclide scanning can be used to evaluate renal function.  It also has the benefit of not requiring IV contrast and may be used safely in patients at risk for contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary. \n【15】 Radionuclide scanning also provides more information than does IV urography or cross-sectional imaging about the following: Segmental renal emboli Renal parenchymal scarring due to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【16】 Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally. \n【17】 No patient preparation is necessary for radionuclide scanning, but patients should be asked about known allergies to the tracer.  Newly available nuclear positron emission tomographic (PET) agents can detect metastatic prostate cancer.  Routine FDG PET scans are not very useful for most cases of prostate cancer but can be useful for other genitourinary tumors such as kidney or testicular cancer.

The esophageal-tracheal double lumen tube (Combitube) and the King laryngeal tube are twin-lumen tubes that have fundamental similarities: A large proximal balloon cuff seals the hypopharynx A ventilating, proximal lumen terminates at side ports overlying the laryngeal inlet A distal lumen and its smaller balloon cuff terminate in and seal the upper esophagus (in > 90% of insertions) Supraglottic airways are useful for providing rescue ventilation to unconscious patients or patients without a gag reflex and are also used in some elective settings.  The esophageal-tracheal double lumen tube and King laryngeal tube have some advantages over other methods of ventilation: Unlike endotracheal tubes, they can be successfully inserted blindly and by operators with only basic training. \n【1】 Indications for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion Apnea, severe respiratory failure Overview of Respiratory Failure Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening impairment of oxygenation, carbon dioxide elimination, or both. \n【2】  Additional Considerations for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion The balloon cuffs of the Combitube are inflated individually.  The balloon cuffs of the King laryngeal tube share a single pilot tube and inflate simultaneously.  An estimated 1 to 5% of Combitube insertions enter the trachea; in these cases, if the misplacement is recognized, the cuffed distal lumen can be used to function as an endotracheal tube.  Probably at least 10% of insertions done with newer King laryngeal tubes enter the trachea; ventilation may be possible through the distal lumen in these cases.  Older King tubes are contoured such that virtually all insertions enter the esophagus.  The ventilating lumen of the King tube is suitable for stylet insertion to facilitate conversion of the King tube to an endotracheal tube.  However, visualization of the glottis through this lumen is often impossible.  Relevant Anatomy for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion Aligning the ear with the sternal notch may help open the upper airway and establishes the best position to view the airway if endotracheal intubation becomes necessary.  The degree of head elevation that best aligns the ear and sternal notch varies depending on the patient's age and body habitus.  Positioning for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion Optimal position for tube insertion is the sniffing position, but Combitube or King tube insertion can be done with the patient’s neck in a neutral position.  The operator stands at the head of the stretcher.  An assistant may stand at the side.  The sniffing position is used only in the absence of cervical spine injury: Position the patient supine on the stretcher.  Place folded towels or other materials under the head, neck, and shoulders, flexing the neck so as to elevate the head until the external auditory meatus lies in the same horizontal plane as the sternal notch.  Then, tilt the head so that the face aligns on a parallel horizontal plane; this second plane will be above the first.  In patients with obesity, many folded towels or a commercial ramp device may be needed to sufficiently elevate the shoulders and neck .  Head and neck positioning to open the airway A: The head is flat on the stretcher; the airway is constricted.  B: Establishing the sniffing position, the ear and sternal notch are aligned, with the face parallel to the ceiling, opening the airway.  \n【3】 If cervical spine injury is a possibility: Position the patient supine or at a slight incline on the stretcher.  Clear the oropharynx, as necessary, of obstructing secretions, vomitus, or foreign material. \n【4】 Select the appropriately sized Combitube or King laryngeal tube and note the appropriate cuff inflation volume for King tubes.  This information is on the tube packaging and the cuff of the tube itself.  Inflate and deflate the cuffs to check that there are no leaks.  Apply a small amount of sterile, water-soluble lubricant to the deflated cuffs.  Lift the chin and tongue with your non-dominant hand.  Grasp the tongue and chin between your thumb inside the mouth and your fingers on the underside of the chin, and lift up.  Insert the Combitube or King tube into the mouth.  Insert the Combitube with a midline orientation.  Insert the King tube initially at the corner of the mouth 45 to 90 degrees of rotation off-center, and then rotate it to midline position when the tip of the tube is past the tongue.  Do not force either tube; you may cause soft tissue damage.  If resistance is encountered, pull back somewhat and re-advance the tube, trying to follow the posterior pharyngeal wall.  You may need to remove the tube, alter its curvature, and then reinsert it.  At the proper distance of insertion (as confirmed by markings on the tube), the proximal (ventilating) lumen will open over the laryngeal opening, and the distal lumen will have entered the esophagus (in most cases).  Release your hand from the tube before inflating the cuffs.  Inflate the cuffs.  When using a King laryngeal tube, use the manufacturer’s recommended volume.  When using a Combitube, inflate the distal balloon first using 10 to 15 mL, then inflate the proximal (pharyngeal, blue) balloon using 50 to 85 mL.  Connect a bag-valve apparatus to the ventilating lumen (on the Combitube, the blue [pharyngeal] lumen).  Begin ventilation (8 to 10 breaths/minute, each about 500 mL and lasting about 1 second).  Assess lung ventilation by auscultation and chest rise.  Check end-tidal carbon dioxide to confirm tube placement.  Auscultation for Combitube placement is often difficult and unreliable, so rely more on capnometry.  However, during cardiac arrest, capnometry may not reliably indicate proper tube placement.  If assessment suggests inadvertent tracheal placement of a Combitube, try ventilating through the distal cuff.  Aftercare for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion Fix the tube in place with tape or ties, as appropriate.  The Combitube or King laryngeal tube, after several hours at most, must be removed or be replaced by a definitive airway, such as an endotracheal tube or surgical airway (cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy).  Warnings and Common Errors for Combitube or King Laryngeal Tube Insertion In about 5% of Combitube insertions, the distal tube will enter the trachea; in this case, ventilation can be done through the distal tube.  In up to 10% of insertions of newer King tubes, the distal tube will enter the trachea; adequate ventilation may be possible through the distal tube.  Generally, supraglottic airways should be inserted only in patients who are unresponsive; otherwise, aspiration is a risk.  Do not allow a patient to awaken during insertion or ventilation with a supraglottic airway.  If necessary, prevent the patient from waking up or gagging (using paralytics, adequate analgesia, and sedation), or remove the airway as clinically indicated.  Placing the dual lumen tubes too deeply may cause the balloon to obstruct the tracheal opening and inhibit ventilation.  Obstruction can be remedied by pulling the airway back a few centimeters.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 01:27:23"}

Joint inflammation is usually accompanied by warmth, swelling (due to intra-articular fluid, or effusion), and uncommonly erythema.  Pain may occur only with use or also at rest.  Sometimes what is described by patients as joint pain can have an extra-articular source (eg, a periarticular structure or bone).  Polyarticular pain (polyarthralgia) involves multiple joints .  Polyarticular joint disorders may affect different joints at different times.  When multiple joints are affected, the following distinction can be useful in differentiating among different disorders, particularly arthritides: Oligoarticular: Involving ≤ 4 joints Polyarticular: Involving > 4 joints Pathophysiology of Pain in Multiple Joints Articular sources of pain originate within the joint.  Periarticular sources of pain originate in structures surrounding the joint (eg, tendons, ligaments, bursae, muscles).  Polyarticular pain caused by articular sources may result from the following: Inflammation  Mechanical or other noninflammatory disorders  The synovium and joint capsule are major sources of pain within a joint.  The synovial membrane is the main site affected by inflammation (synovitis).  Pain affecting multiple joints in the absence of inflammation may be due to increased joint laxity with excessive trauma, as in benign hypermobility syndrome.  Polyarthritis may involve peripheral joints, axial joints (eg, sacroiliac, apophyseal, discovertebral, costovertebral), or both.  Etiology of Pain in Multiple Joints Peripheral oligoarticular arthritis and polyarticular arthritis are more commonly associated with a systemic infection (eg, viral) or systemic inflammatory disorder  than is monoarticular arthritis.  A specific cause can usually be determined ; however, sometimes the arthritis is transient and resolves before a diagnosis can be clearly established.  Axial involvement suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy Overview of Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies (seronegative spondyloarthritides) share certain clinical characteristics (eg, inflammatory back pain, uveitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, rashes). \n【1】 Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【2】 Chronic polyarticular arthralgia in children is most often due to the following: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a group of rheumatic diseases that begins by age 16.  Arthritis, fever, rash, adenopathy, splenomegaly, and iridocyclitis are typical of some forms. \n【3】 Extra-articular symptoms and findings, which may suggest specific systemic inflammatory disorders, should also be sought and evaluated, particularly if there is joint inflammation.  History of present illness should identify characteristics of joint pain, associated joint symptoms, and systemic symptoms.  Among important joint symptom characteristics are the acuity of onset (eg, abrupt, gradual), temporal patterns (eg, diurnal variation, persistent vs intermittent), duration (eg, acute vs chronic), and exacerbating and mitigating factors (eg, rest, activity).  Patients should be specifically asked about unprotected sexual contact (indicating risk of infectious bacterial arthritis with disseminated gonococcal infection) and tick bites or residence in or travel to a Lyme-endemic area.  Review of systems should be complete in order to identify extra-articular symptoms that may suggest specific disorders .  Past medical history and family history should identify known systemic inflammatory disorders and other conditions capable of causing joint symptoms .  Some systemic inflammatory disorders are more prevalent in families with specific genetic profiles.  Physical examination The physical examination should be reasonably complete, evaluating all major organ systems (eg, skin and nails, eyes, genitals, mucosal surfaces, heart, lungs, abdomen, nose, neck, lymph nodes, and neurologic system) as well as the musculoskeletal system.  Vital signs are reviewed for fever.  Examination of the head should note any signs of eye inflammation (eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis) and nasal or oral lesions.  Skin should be inspected for rashes and lesions (eg, ecchymoses, skin ulcers, psoriatic plaques, purpura, malar rash).  The patient is also evaluated for lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.  Cardiopulmonary examination should note any signs that suggest pleuritis, pericarditis, or valve abnormalities (eg, murmur, pericardial rub, muffled heart sounds, bibasilar dullness consistent with pleural effusion).  Genital examination should note any discharge, ulcers, or other findings consistent with sexually transmitted infections.  Musculoskeletal examination should start by distinguishing articular from periarticular or other connective tissue or muscular tenderness.  Joint examination begins with inspection for deformities, erythema, swelling, or effusion and then proceeds to palpation for joint effusions, warmth, and point tenderness.  Passive and active range of motion should be evaluated.  Crepitus may be felt during joint flexion and/or extension.  Comparison with the contralateral unaffected joint often helps detect more subtle changes.  Examination should note whether the distribution of affected joints is symmetric or asymmetric.  Painful joints can also be compressed without flexing or extending them.  Periarticular structures also should be examined for involvement of tendons, bursae, or ligaments, such as discrete, soft swelling at the site of a bursa (bursitis) or point tenderness at the insertion of a tendon (tendinitis).  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Joint warmth, swelling, tenderness, and erythema Any extra-articular symptoms (eg, fever, rigors, rash, chills, skin plaques or nail pitting, mucosal ulcers, conjunctivitis, uveitis, murmur, purpura, weight loss) Interpretation of findings An important initial determination, based mainly on carefully done physical examination, is whether pain originates in the joints, in other adjacent structures (eg, bones, tendons, bursae, muscles), both (eg, as in gout), or other structures.  Tenderness or swelling at only one side of a joint, or away from the joint line, suggests an extra-articular origin (eg, tendons or bursae); localized joint line tenderness or more diffuse involvement of the joint suggests an intra-articular cause.  Compressing the joint without flexing or extending it is not particularly painful in patients with tendinitis and Tenosynovitis Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, often developing after degeneration (tendinopathy).  Tenosynovitis is tendinitis with inflammation of the tendon sheath lining. \n【4】 The cause is usually unknown, but trauma, repetitive or acute, may contribute, as may infection and crystal-induced disease. \n【5】 Pain that worsens with active but not passive joint motion may indicate tendinitis or bursitis (extra-articular); intra-articular inflammation generally restricts active and passive range of joint motion significantly.  Another important determination is whether joints are inflamed.  Pain during rest and on initiating activity suggests joint inflammation, whereas pain worsened by movement and relieved by rest suggests mechanical or noninflammatory disorders .  Increased warmth and erythema also suggest inflammation, but these findings are often insensitive, so their absence does not rule out inflammation.  Clinical findings of prolonged morning stiffness, stiffness after prolonged inactivity (gel phenomenon), nontraumatic joint swelling, and fever or unintentional weight loss suggest a systemic inflammatory disorder involving the joints. \n【6】 The pattern of joint involvement helps establish a diagnosis.  Symmetry of joint involvement can also be a clue.  Involvement tends to be symmetric in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【7】 Examination of the hand joints may yield other clues  that help differentiate osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis  or that may suggest other disorders.  Spinal pain in the presence of peripheral arthritis suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy Overview of Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies (seronegative spondyloarthritides) share certain clinical characteristics (eg, inflammatory back pain, uveitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, rashes). \n【8】 New-onset oligoarthritis plus spinal pain is particularly likely to be a seronegative spondyloarthropathy if the patient has a family history of the same disorder.  Eye redness and pain and low back pain suggest ankylosing spondylitis.  Prior plaque psoriasis in a patient with new onset of oligoarthritis strongly suggests psoriatic arthritis.   Testing The following tests are particularly important: Arthrocentesis Usually erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein Serologic testing In chronic arthritis, x-rays and/or ultrasonography Arthrocentesis is mandatory in most patients with a new effusion to rule out infection and identify crystals ,see How to Do Arthrocentesis How To Do Ankle Arthrocentesis of the ankle is the process of puncturing the tibiotalar joint with a needle to withdraw synovial fluid.  The anteromedial approach is described. It can also help distinguish between an inflammatory and a noninflammatory process.  Synovial fluid examination includes white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, Gram stain and cultures, and microscopic examination for crystals using polarized light.  Finding crystals in synovial fluid confirms crystal-induced arthritis but does not rule out coexisting infection.  A noninflammatory synovial fluid (eg, WBC count of < 1000/mcL [< 1 × 109/L]) is more suggestive of osteoarthritis or trauma.  Hemorrhagic fluid is consistent with hemarthrosis.  Synovial fluid WBC counts can be very high (eg, > 50,000/mcL [> 50 × 109/L]) in both infectious and crystal-induced arthritis.  Synovial fluid WBC counts in systemic inflammatory disorders causing polyarthritis are most often between about 1,000 and 50,000/mcL (1 and 50 × 109/L).  If the specific diagnosis cannot be established based on the history and examination, additional tests may be needed.  ESR and C-reactive protein can be done to help determine whether the arthritis is inflammatory.  Elevated ESR and C-reactive protein levels suggest inflammation but are nonspecific, particularly in older adults.  Findings are more specific if values are high during inflammatory flare-ups and normal between flare-ups.  Once a diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory disorder is clinically suspected, supportive serologic testing for antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may assist in making the diagnosis.  Specific tests should only be ordered to provide support for a specific diagnosis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA-associated vasculitis, or rheumatoid arthritis.  If arthritis is chronic, x-rays and/or ultrasonography are typically done to look for signs of joint damage.  Joint ultrasonography has many advantages over x-rays, including allowing for better identification of fluid around the joints, visualization of tendons and other periarticular structures during the physical exam, and guidance for arthrocentesis and joint injections.  Other tests may be needed to identify specific disorders .  Treatment of Pain in Multiple Joints In patients with joint pain, the underlying disorder is treated whenever possible.  Systemic inflammatory diseases may require either immunosuppression or antibiotics as determined by the diagnosis.  Joint inflammation is usually treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs).  Pain without inflammation is usually more safely treated with acetaminophen.  Joint immobilization with a splint or sling can sometimes relieve pain.  Heat or cold therapy may be analgesic in inflammatory joint diseases.  Because chronic polyarthritis can lead to inactivity and secondary muscle atrophy, continued physical activity should be encouraged.  Geriatrics Essentials: Joint Pain Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation). \n【9】 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints. \n【10】 Because cancers can cause paraneoplastic polyarthritis, cancer should be considered in older adults in whom new-onset rheumatoid arthritis is suspected, particularly if the onset is acute, if the lower extremities are predominantly affected, or if there is bone tenderness.  Polymyalgia rheumatica is a syndrome closely associated with giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis). \n【11】 Key Points The differential diagnosis of polyarticular joint pain can be narrowed by considering which and how many joints are affected, whether inflammation is present, whether joint distribution is symmetric, and whether any extra-articular symptoms or signs are present.  Chronic polyarthritis is most often caused by juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and chronic polyarthralgia is most often caused by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in adults.  Acute polyarticular arthritis is most often due to infection, gout, or a flare of a systemic inflammatory disease.  Arthrocentesis is mandatory in most cases of a new effusion to rule out infection, diagnose crystal-induced arthropathy, and help distinguish between an inflammatory and noninflammatory process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 18:56:52"}

There are 3 types of parasites: Single-cell organisms (protozoa, microsporidia) Multicellular helminths (worms) Ectoparasites such as scabies and lice Parasitic infections due to protozoa and helminths are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide.  They are prevalent in Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.  They are much less common in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and the US.  By far, the greatest impact is on residents of impoverished tropical areas with poor sanitation, but parasitic infections are encountered in developed countries among immigrants and travelers returning from endemic regions and, on occasion, even among residents who have not traveled, particularly those with AIDS or other conditions that cause immunodeficiency.  Some parasites have adapted to living in the lumen of the intestine or vagina where conditions are anaerobic; others reside in blood or tissues in aerobic conditions.  Many intestinal parasitic infections are spread through fecal contamination of food or water.  They are most frequent in areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor.  Some parasites, such as hookworms, can enter the skin during contact with contaminated dirt or, in the case of schistosomes, with freshwater.  Others, such as malaria, are transmitted by arthropod vectors.  Rarely, parasites are transmitted via blood transfusions or shared needles or congenitally from mother to fetus.  Some parasites are endemic in the US and other developed countries.  Examples are the pinworm Enterobius vermicularis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Toxoplasma gondii, and enteric parasites such as Giardia intestinalis (also known as G.  duodenalis or G.  lamblia) and Cryptosporidium species.  The characteristics of protozoan and helminthic infections vary in important ways.  Protozoa are single-celled organisms that multiply by simple binary division .  Protozoa can multiply in their human hosts, increasing in number to cause overwhelming infection.  With rare exceptions, protozoan infections do not cause eosinophilia.  Microsporidia Microsporidiosis is infection with microsporidia. \n【1】 Human disease is mainly limited to people who have AIDS or another severe immunocompromising condition.  The clinical manifestations depend on the infecting species and include gastroenteritis, involvement of the eyes, or disseminated infection.  Helminths are multicellular and have complex organ systems.  Helminths can be further divided into Roundworms (nematodes) Flatworms (platyhelminthes), which include tapeworms ,cestodes Overview of Tapeworm Infections Tapeworms (cestodes) are flat, parasitic worms. \n【2】 Most helminths have complex life cycles that involve substantial time outside their human hosts.  A few, including Strongyloides stercoralis, Capillaria philippinensis, and Hymenolepis nana, can increase in number because of autoinfection (offspring reinfect the same host rather than being shed to infect another host).  In strongyloidiasis is infection with Strongyloides stercoralis.  Findings include abdominal pain and diarrhea, rash, pulmonary symptoms (including cough and wheezing), and eosinophilia. \n【3】 The severity of helminthic infections usually correlates with the worm burden, but there are exceptions as when a single ascaris Ascariasis is infection with Ascaris lumbricoides or occasionally Ascaris suum (a closely related parasite of pigs).  Light infections may be asymptomatic. \n【4】 The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake. \n【5】 The worm burden depends on the degree of environmental exposure, parasite factors, and the host’s genetically determined immune responses.  If a person moves from an endemic area, the number of adult worms diminishes over time.  Although a few parasites (eg, Clonorchis sinensis) can survive for decades in humans, many species have life spans of only a few years or less.  Nematodes are nonsegmented cylindric worms ranging from 1 mm to 1 m in length.  Nematodes have a body cavity, distinguishing them from tapeworms and flukes.  Depending on the species, different stages in the life cycle are infectious to humans.  Hundreds of millions of humans are infected with nematodes that live in the intestines and are transmitted by ova or larvae in feces; the most common are Ascaris , hookworms Hookworm Infection Ancylostomiasis is infection with the hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus. \n【6】 Cestodes ,tapeworms Overview of Tapeworm Infections Tapeworms (cestodes) are flat, parasitic worms. \n【7】 In the host’s digestive tract, adult tapeworms can become large, up to 40 m for one species.  Tapeworms that infect humans include the fish tapeworm Diphyllobothriasis (Fish Tapeworm Infection) Diphyllobothriasis is infection with intestinal tapeworms of the family Diphyllobothriidae.  They are acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish. \n【8】 It is treated with praziquantel or niclosamide. \n【9】 Trematodes  are nonsegmented flatworms that infect the blood vessels, liver, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract.  They are usually no more than a few centimeters in length; however, some are only 1 mm, and some are as large as 7 cm.  In humans, most fluke infections are caused by Schistosoma species , liver flukes including Fasciola hepatica  and Clonorchis sinensis , and lung flukes including certain Paragonimus species .  Diagnosis of Parasitic Infections Microscopic examination Antigen and DNA tests Methods used to diagnose specific parasitic diseases are summarized in the table Collecting and Handling Specimens for Microscopic Diagnosis of Parasitic Infections .   Parasitic infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clinical syndromes in residents of or travelers to areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor or where vector-borne diseases are endemic.  For example, fever in a traveler returning from an endemic area suggests the possibility of malaria.  Experience indicates that people who have immigrated from endemic areas to developed countries and who return home to visit friends and relatives are at particular risk.  They frequently do not seek or cannot afford pretravel vaccines, medications, and advice on disease prevention and are more likely to enter high-risk settings than tourists who stay at resort facilities.  Although less frequent, the possibility of locally acquired parasitic infection must also be considered in residents of developed countries who present with suggestive clinical syndromes, even if they have not traveled; some parasites are endemic in developed countries and others (mainly those transmissible by the fecal-oral route) may be acquired from infected travelers.  Historical information, physical findings, and laboratory data may also suggest specific parasitic infections.  For example, eosinophilia is common when helminths migrate through tissue and suggests a parasitic infection in an immigrant or returning traveler.  The diagnosis of parasitic infections was once based on the identification of ova, larvae, or adult parasites in stool, blood, tissue or other samples or the presence of antibodies in serum, but diagnosis is being increasingly based on identification of parasite antigens or molecular tests for parasite DNA.  Physicians with expertise in parasitic infections and tropical medicine are available for consultation at many major medical centers, travel clinics, and public health facilities. \n【10】 Gastrointestinal tract parasites Various stages of protozoa and helminths that infect the gastrointestinal tract are typically shed in the stool.  Routine detection requires examination of stool specimens, preferably 3 collected on different days, because shedding can vary.  Sensitivity of stool examination for ova and parasites is low enough that when clinical suspicion is strong, empirical treatment should be considered.  Sensitive and specific assays are now available to detect antigens of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica in stool.  Although expensive, molecular tests also are available for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E.  histolytica, and Cyclospora.  Tests for one or more of these organisms are typically included in multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screens for enteric bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens in stool samples .  Freshly passed stools uncontaminated with urine, water, dirt, or disinfectants should be sent to the laboratory within 1 hour; unformed or watery stools are most likely to contain motile trophozoites.  If not examined immediately, stools should be refrigerated, but not frozen.  Portions of fresh stools should also be emulsified in fixative to preserve gastrointestinal protozoa.  Concentration techniques can be used to improve sensitivity.  Anal cellophane tape or swabs may collect pinworm or tapeworm eggs. \n【11】 Antibiotics, x-ray contrast material, purgatives, and antacids can hinder detection of ova and parasites for several weeks.  Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be considered when routine stool examinations are negative and amebiasis is infection with Entamoeba histolytica.  It is acquired by fecal-oral transmission. \n【12】 Sigmoidoscopic specimens should be collected with a curet or spoon (cotton swabs are not suitable) and processed immediately for microscopy.  Duodenal aspirates or small-bowel biopsy specimens may be necessary for diagnosis of such infections as cryptosporidiosis is infection with the protozoan Cryptosporidium.  The primary symptom is watery diarrhea, often with other signs of gastrointestinal distress. \n【13】 Serologic testing for parasitic infections Some parasites can be detected by serologic tests .   Treatment of Parasitic Infections Various treatments, depending on the specific infection See under specific infections in THE MANUAL.  Advice for treating parasitic infections also is available from experts at major medical and public health centers and travel clinics, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) web site, in textbooks of infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and in summary form from The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics.  Some drugs that are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for parasitic infections can be obtained from the CDC Drug Service.  Prevention of Parasitic Infections Despite substantial investment and research, no vaccines are yet available for prevention of human parasitic infections.  Prevention is based on avoidance strategies.  Transmission of most intestinal parasites can be prevented by Sanitary disposal of feces Handwashing Adequate cooking of food Provision of purified water For the international traveler, the best advice is “cook it, boil it, peel it, or forget it. ” When followed, these measures reduce but do not eliminate the risk of intestinal parasitic infections as well as the risk of bacterial and viral gastroenteritis.  Handwashing is very important after use of bathrooms and latrines and prior to food preparation.  Meat, particularly pork, and fish, especially freshwater varieties, should be thoroughly cooked before ingestion.  Other safety measures include removing cat litter boxes from areas where food is prepared to prevent toxoplasmosis.  People should not swim in freshwater lakes, streams, or rivers in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic or walk barefoot or sit bare-bottom in areas where hookworms are found.  Prevention of malaria Prevention Malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. \n【14】 In Africa, travelers should avoid bright-colored clothing and wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to avoid tsetse flies in regions where African sleeping sickness Prevention Human African trypanosomiasis is infection with protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly. \n【15】 Country-specific recommendations for travel are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Travelers' Health and from the CDC Yellow Book 2020.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type3": "无关文本#15#15#内容与正文无关"}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-16 23:53:56"}

Many chest injuries cause death during the first minutes or hours after trauma; they can frequently be treated at the bedside with definitive or temporizing measures that do not require advanced surgical training.  Etiology of Thoracic Trauma Chest injuries can result from blunt or penetrating trauma.  The most important chest injuries include the following: Aortic disruption (Traumatic) The aorta can rupture completely or incompletely after blunt or penetrating chest trauma. \n【1】  Pulmonary contusion is trauma-induced lung hemorrhage and edema without laceration. \n【2】 Bone injuries are common, typically involving the ribs Rib Fracture One or more ribs can be fractured due to blunt chest injury.   This x-ray of the chest shows multiple fractures to the right ribs . \n【3】 Diagnosis is by plain x-ray.  Most types are treated with a sling. \n【4】 The esophagus and diaphragm  also can be damaged by chest trauma.  Because the diaphragm can be as high as the nipple line during exhalation, penetrating trauma to the chest at or below nipple level can also cause intra-abdominal injuries.  Pathophysiology of Thoracic Trauma Most morbidity and mortality due to chest trauma occurs because injuries interfere with respiration, circulation, or both.  Respiration can be compromised by Direct damage to the lungs or airways Altered mechanics of breathing Injuries that directly damage the lung or airways include pulmonary contusion and tracheobronchial disruption.  Injuries that alter the mechanics of breathing include hemothorax is accumulation of blood in the pleural space. \n【5】 Injury to the lung, tracheobronchial tree, or rarely esophagus may allow air to enter the soft tissues of the chest and/or neck (subcutaneous emphysema) or mediastinum .  This air itself rarely has significant physiologic consequence; the underlying injury is the problem.  Tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【6】 Circulation can be impaired by Bleeding Decreased venous return Direct cardiac injury Bleeding, as occurs in hemothorax, can be massive, causing shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. \n【7】 Decreased venous return impairs cardiac filling, causing hypotension.  Decreased venous return can occur due to increased intrathoracic pressure in tension pneumothorax or to increased intrapericardial pressure in cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. \n【8】 Heart failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. \n【9】 Complications Because chest wall injuries typically make breathing very painful, patients often limit inspiration (splinting).  A common complication of splinting is atelectasis is collapse of lung tissue with loss of volume.  Patients may have dyspnea or respiratory failure if atelectasis is extensive.  They may also develop pneumonia. \n【10】 Patients treated with tube thoracostomy Thoracotomy is surgical opening of the chest.  It is done to evaluate and treat pulmonary problems when noninvasive procedures are nondiagnostic or unlikely to be definitive. \n【11】 Symptoms and Signs of Thoracic Trauma Symptoms include pain, which usually worsens with breathing if the chest wall is injured, and sometimes shortness of breath.  Common findings include chest tenderness, ecchymoses, and respiratory distress; hypotension or shock may be present.  Neck vein distention can occur in tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【12】 Decreased breath sounds can result from pneumothorax or hemothorax is accumulation of blood in the pleural space. \n【13】 The trachea can deviate away from the side of a tension pneumothorax. \n【14】 Subcutaneous emphysema causes a crackling or crunch when palpated.  Findings may be localized to a small area or involve a large portion of the chest wall and/or extend to the neck.  Most often, pneumothorax is the cause; when extensive, injury to the tracheobronchial tree or upper airway should be considered.  Air in the mediastinum may produce a characteristic crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat (Hamman sign or Hamman crunch).  Hamman sign suggests pneumomediastinum is air in mediastinal interstices. \n【15】 Diagnosis of Thoracic Trauma Clinical evaluation Chest x-ray Sometimes other imaging studies (eg, CT, ultrasonography, aortic imaging studies) Clinical evaluation Five conditions are immediately life threatening and rapidly correctable: Massive hemothorax Tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【16】 Depth and symmetry of chest wall excursion are assessed, the lungs are auscultated, and the entire chest wall and neck are inspected and palpated.  Patients in respiratory distress should be monitored with serial assessments of clinical status and of oxygenation plus ventilation (eg, with pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas tests, capnometry if intubated).  Penetrating chest wounds should not be probed.  However, their location helps predict risk of injury.  High-risk wounds are those medial to the nipples or scapulae and those that traverse the chest from side to side (ie, entering one hemithorax and exiting the other).  Such wounds may injure the hilar or great vessels, heart, tracheobronchial tree, or rarely the esophagus.  Patients with symptoms of partial or complete airway obstruction following blunt trauma should be immediately intubated to control the airway.  In patients with difficulty breathing, severe injuries to consider during the primary survey include the following: Tension pneumothorax Open pneumothorax Massive hemothorax Flail chest There is a simplified, rapid approach to help differentiate these injuries .  A simplified, rapid assessment of patients with thoracic trauma and respiratory distress during the primary survey In patients with thoracic trauma and impaired circulation , severe injuries to consider during the primary survey include the following: Massive hemothorax Tension pneumothorax Cardiac tamponade Other chest injuries (eg, blunt cardiac injury, aortic disruption) may cause shock but are not treated during the primary survey.  Simplified, rapid approaches can help differentiate among rapidly correctable causes of shock due to chest injuries . A simple, rapid assessment for chest injuries in patients with shock during the primary survey .  However, hemorrhage should be excluded in all patients who have shock after major trauma, regardless of whether a chest injury that could cause shock is identified.  A simplified, rapid assessment for chest injuries in patients with shock during the primary survey * Hemorrhage should be excluded in all patients who are in shock after major trauma, regardless of whether a chest injury that could cause shock is identified Neck vein distention may be absent in patients with hypovolemic shock.  Treatment of injuries affecting the airway, breathing, or circulation begins during the primary survey.  After the primary survey, patients are clinically assessed in more detail for other severe chest injuries as well as less severe manifestations of the injuries considered during the primary survey.  Imaging studies are typically required in patients with significant chest trauma.  Chest x-ray is virtually always done.  Results are usually diagnostic of certain injuries (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax, moderate or severe pulmonary contusion, clavicle fracture, some rib fractures) and suggestive for others (eg, aortic disruption, diaphragmatic rupture).  However, findings may evolve over hours .  Plain x-rays of the scapula or sternum are sometimes done when there is tenderness over those structures. \n【17】 CT of the chest is often done when aortic injury Aortic Disruption (Traumatic) The aorta can rupture completely or incompletely after blunt or penetrating chest trauma. \n【18】 Other tests for aortic injury include aortography Uses of Angiography is sometimes called conventional angiography to distinguish it from CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). \n【19】 Laboratory and other testing Complete blood count is often done but is mainly valuable as a baseline for detecting ongoing hemorrhage.  Arterial blood gas results help monitor patients with hypoxia or respiratory distress.  Cardiac markers (eg, troponin, creatine phosphokinase muscle band isoenzyme [CPK-MB]) can help exclude blunt cardiac injury.  ECG is typically done for chest trauma that is severe or compatible with cardiac injury.  Cardiac injury may cause arrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, ST segment abnormalities, or a combination.  Treatment of Thoracic Trauma Supportive care Treatment of specific injuries Immediately life-threatening injuries are treated at the bedside at the time of diagnosis: Respiratory distress with suspected tension pneumothorax (Tension) Tension pneumothorax is accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure, compressing the lungs and decreasing venous return to the heart. \n【20】 In the absence of any of these criteria, resuscitative thoracotomy is contraindicated because the procedure has significant risks (eg, transmission of blood-borne diseases, injury to clinician) and costs.

It includes the cranial nerves and spinal nerves from their origin to their end.  The anterior horn cells, although technically part of the central nervous system (CNS), are sometimes discussed with the peripheral nervous system because they are part of the motor unit.  Motor neuron dysfunction results in muscle weakness or paralysis.  Sensory neuron dysfunction results in abnormal or lost sensation.  Some disorders are progressive and fatal.  Anatomy A motor unit consists of An anterior horn cell Its motor axon The muscle fibers it innervates The connection between them (neuromuscular junction) The anterior horn cells are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord and thus are technically part of the CNS.  In contrast to the motor system, the cell bodies of the afferent sensory fibers lie outside the spinal cord, in dorsal root ganglia.  Nerve fibers outside the spinal cord join to form anterior (ventral) motor nerve roots and posterior (dorsal) sensory nerve roots.  The ventral and dorsal roots combine to form a spinal nerve.  Thirty of the 31 pairs of spinal nerves have dorsal and ventral roots; C1 has no sensory root .  Spinal nerve The spinal nerves exit the vertebral column via an intervertebral foramen.  Because the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column, the more caudal the spinal nerve, the further the foramen is from the corresponding cord segment.  Thus, in the lumbosacral region, nerve roots from lower cord segments descend within the spinal column in a near-vertical sheaf, forming the cauda equina.  Just beyond the intervertebral foramen, spinal nerves branch into several parts.  Branches of the cervical and lumbosacral spinal nerves anastomose peripherally into plexuses, then branch into nerve trunks that terminate up to 1 m away in peripheral structures .  The intercostal nerves are segmental.  Plexuses The term peripheral nerve refers to the part of a spinal nerve distal to the root and plexus.  Peripheral nerves are bundles of nerve fibers.  They range in diameter from 0. 3 to 22 mcm (1 mcm equals 1000 circular mils).  Schwann cells form a thin cytoplasmic tube around each fiber and further wrap larger fibers in a multilayered insulating membrane (myelin sheath).  Physiology The myelin sheath enhances impulse conduction.  The largest and most heavily myelinated fibers conduct quickly; they convey motor, touch, and proprioceptive impulses.  The less myelinated and unmyelinated fibers conduct more slowly; they convey pain, temperature, and autonomic impulses.  Because nerves are metabolically active tissues, they require nutrients, supplied by blood vessels called the vasa nervorum.  Etiology Peripheral nerve disorders can result from damage to or dysfunction of the one of the following: Cell body Myelin sheath Axons Neuromuscular junction Disorders can be genetic or acquired . \n【1】 Peripheral neuropathies may affect One nerve  Several discrete nerves ,multiple mononeuropathy Multiple mononeuropathies are characterized by sensory disturbances and weakness in the distribution of ≥ 2 affected peripheral nerves.   Multiple nerves diffusely  A plexus  A nerve root  More than one site can be affected; eg, in the most common variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive but self-limited inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. \n【2】  Pathophysiology Because sensory and motor cell bodies are in different locations, a nerve cell body disorder typically affects either the sensory or motor component but rarely both.  Damage to the myelin sheath  slows nerve conduction.  Demyelination affects mainly heavily myelinated fibers, causing large-fiber sensory dysfunction (buzzing and tingling sensations), motor weakness, and diminished reflexes.  The hallmark of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy is severe motor weakness with minimal atrophy.  Because the vasa nervorum do not reach the center of a nerve, centrally located fascicles are most vulnerable to vascular disorders (eg, vasculitis, ischemia).  These disorders result in small-fiber sensory dysfunction (sharp pain and burning sensations, decreased temperature sensation), motor weakness proportional to atrophy, and less severe reflex abnormalities than in other nerve disorders.  The distal two thirds of a limb is affected most.  Initially, deficits tend to be asymmetric because the vasculitic or ischemic process is random.  However, multiple infarcts may later coalesce, causing symmetric deficits ,polyneuropathy Multiple Mononeuropathy Multiple mononeuropathies are characterized by sensory disturbances and weakness in the distribution of ≥ 2 affected peripheral nerves. Toxic-metabolic or genetic disorders usually begin symmetrically.  Immune-mediated processes may be symmetric or, early in rapidly evolving processes, asymmetric.  Damage to the axon transport system for cellular constituents, especially microtubules and microfilaments, causes significant axon dysfunction.  First affected are the smaller fibers (because they have greater metabolic requirements) at the most distal part of the nerve.  Then, axonal degeneration slowly ascends, producing the characteristic distal-to-proximal pattern of symptoms (stocking-glove sensory loss, followed by weakness).  Recovery Damage to the myelin sheath  can often be repaired by surviving Schwann cells in about 6 to 12 weeks.  After axonal damage, the fiber regrows within the Schwann cell tube at about 1 mm/day once the pathologic process ends.  However, regrowth may be misdirected, causing aberrant innervation (eg, of fibers in the wrong muscle, of a touch receptor at the wrong site, or of a temperature instead of a touch receptor).  Regeneration is impossible when the cell body dies and is unlikely when the axon is completely lost.  Evaluation Deficits defined by history and examination Attention to clinical clues to peripheral nervous system disorders Usually nerve conduction studies and electromyography Sometimes nerve or skin punch biopsy Genetic testing (for hereditary neuropathies) Clinical evaluation History should focus on type of symptom, onset, progression, and location, as well as information about potential causes (eg, family history, toxic exposures, past medical disorders).  Physical and neurologic examination Introduction to the Neurologic Examination begins with careful observation of the patient entering the examination area and continues during history taking. \n【3】 Regulation occurs without conscious control, ie, autonomously. \n【4】 These disorders are also suspected in patients with mixed sensory and motor deficits, with multiple foci, or with a focus that is incompatible with a single anatomic site in the CNS.  Physicians should also suspect peripheral nervous system disorders in patients with generalized or diffuse weakness but no sensory deficits; in these cases, peripheral nervous system disorders may be overlooked because they are not the most likely cause of such symptoms.  Clues that a peripheral nervous system disorder may be the cause of generalized weakness include the following: Patterns of generalized weakness that suggest a specific cause  Symptoms and signs other than weakness that suggest a specific disorder or group of disorders ,eg, cholinergic effects, which suggest organophosphate poisoning and Carbamate Poisoning Organophosphates and carbamates are common insecticide ingredients that inhibit cholinesterase activity, causing acute muscarinic manifestations  Deficits in a stocking-glove distribution, which suggest diffuse axonal disorders or polyneuropathy A polyneuropathy is a diffuse peripheral nerve disorder that is not confined to the distribution of a single nerve or a single limb and typically is relatively symmetrical bilaterally. \n【5】 Hyporeflexia is consistent with peripheral nervous system deficits but is nonspecific.  For example, acute cervical transverse myelitis can mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive but self-limited inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. \n【6】 Although many exceptions are possible, certain clinical clues may also suggest possible causes of peripheral nervous system deficits .   Clinical assessment narrows diagnostic possibilities and guides further testing.  Testing Usually, nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies When determining whether weakness is due to a nerve, muscle, or neuromuscular junction disorder is clinically difficult, these studies can identify the affected nerves and muscles. \n【7】 These tests help do the following: Differentiate peripheral nervous system disorders from neuromuscular junction and muscle disorders Localize site of peripheral nervous system dysfunction (eg, root, plexus, peripheral nerve) Distinguish demyelinating disorders (very slow conduction) from axonal disorders Patients with weakness but no sensory deficits can be evaluated with electrodiagnostic testing.  Other testing, such as imaging, depends on whether a CNS lesion must be ruled out (eg, MRI if all limbs are affected, to rule out cervical spinal cord compression).  Nerve biopsy is occasionally done to help differentiate demyelinating from vasculitic large-fiber neuropathies.  If vasculitis is a consideration, the biopsy specimen should include skin and muscle to increase the likelihood of a definitive diagnosis.  If a small-fiber neuropathy is suspected, skin punch biopsy can be done; loss of nerve endings supports that diagnosis.  Pearls & Pitfalls If clinical findings and electrodiagnostic test results are inconclusive, do a biopsy (nerve biopsy for suspected large-fiber neuropathy or skin punch biopsy for suspected small-fiber neuropathy).  If all limbs are affected, consider MRI to rule out cervical spinal cord compression.  Genetic testing is indicated if a hereditary neuropathy is suspected.  Treatment of underlying disorder Supportive care, often by a multidisciplinary team Treatment of a peripheral nerve disorder is directed at the underlying disorder when possible.  Otherwise, treatment is supportive.  A multidisciplinary team approach helps patients cope with progressive neurologic disability: Physical therapists may help patients maintain muscle function.  Occupational therapists can recommend adaptive braces and walking devices to help with activities of daily living.  Speech and language therapists may provide alternative communication devices.  If pharyngeal weakness develops, a speech therapist or a multidisciplinary team that specializes in swallowing problems can help assess risk of aspiration and recommend measures for prevention (eg, precautions for oral feeding and/or need for tube feedings).  A gastroenterologist may recommend percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.  If respiratory weakness develops, forced vital capacity is measured, and pulmonary or intensive care specialists help assess whether intensive care, noninvasive respiratory support (eg, bilevel positive airway pressure), and tracheostomy with full ventilatory support are needed.  Early in fatal disorders, health care practitioners must talk frankly with patients, family members, and caregivers to determine the level of intervention acceptable.  Patients are encouraged to put their decisions in writing  before they become incapacitated.  These decisions should be reviewed and confirmed at various stages of the disorder.  Key Points Peripheral nervous system disorders are often suspected based on clinical findings (eg, stocking-glove distribution, hyporeflexia, distal muscle weakness and wasting, localization to a peripheral nerve distribution).  If patients have profound motor weakness with minimal atrophy and areflexia, consider acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy.  If patients have abnormal pain and temperature sensation and atrophy in proportion to weakness (sometimes with disproportionate preservation of reflexes), consider a vasculitic or ischemic neuropathy.  If patients have chronic progressive muscle weakness, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and no sensory deficits, consider motor neuron disease.  Nerve conduction studies and electromyography help identify level of involvement (root, plexus, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle fiber) and help distinguish demyelinating from axonal disorders.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type4": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 21:44:34"}

The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.  Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic; the first symptom of cervical cancer is usually irregular, often postcoital vaginal bleeding.  Diagnosis is by a cervical Papanicolaou test and biopsy.  Staging is clinical, combined with imaging and pathology results when available.  Treatment usually involves surgical resection for early-stage disease or radiation therapy plus chemotherapy for locally advanced disease.  If the cancer has widely metastasized, chemotherapy is often used alone.  Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common gynecologic cancer and the 8th most common cancer among women in the US.  Mean age at diagnosis is 50; it is frequently diagnosed in women aged 35 to 44 years.  The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2021, there were 14,480 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and 4290 deaths (1 Arteries of the heart ).  Worldwide, cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher in low- or middle-income countries; rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa.  Among females, it is the most common cancer in 23 countries and the leading cause of cancer death in 36 countries (2 Arteries of the heart ).  Risk factors associated with cervical cancer include Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells. \n【1】 The great majority of cases of CIN and invasive cervical cancer are caused by persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) Infection Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells. \n【2】 Most (70%) of precancerous and invasive disease can be directly attributed to HPV types 16 or 18; however, 99% of cervical cancer specimens contain DNA from a high-risk HPV genotype (3 Arteries of the heart , 4 Arteries of the heart ).  The incidence of cervical cancer has decreased steadily over the past several decades because of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and treatment of CIN. \n【3】 Pathology of Cervical Cancer The cervix is composed of stroma and epithelium.  The ectocervix protrudes into the vagina and is lined with squamous epithelium.  The endocervix (a canal that passes from the internal os to the external os) is lined with columnar epithelium.  Nearly all cervical carcinomas originate in the transformation zone, which surrounds the external os; the transformation zone is an area of squamous metaplasia between the original and current squamocolumnar junction .  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is graded as 1: Mild cervical dysplasia 2: Moderate dysplasia 3: Severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ CIN 3 is unlikely to regress spontaneously; if untreated, it may, over months or years, penetrate the basement membrane, becoming invasive carcinoma.  About 80 to 85% of all cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinoma; most of the rest are adenocarcinomas.  Sarcomas and small cell neuroendocrine tumors are rare.  Invasive cervical cancer usually spreads by direct extension into surrounding tissues or via the lymphatics to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes.  Hematogenous spread is possible but rare.  If cervical cancer spreads to the pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes, the prognosis is worse, and the location and size of the radiation therapy field is affected. \n【4】 Symptoms and Signs of Cervical Cancer Early cervical cancer can be asymptomatic.  When symptoms occur, they usually include irregular vaginal bleeding, which is most often postcoital, but may occur spontaneously between menses.  Larger cancers are more likely to bleed spontaneously and may cause a foul-smelling vaginal discharge or pelvic pain.  More widespread cancer may cause obstructive uropathy, back pain, and leg swelling due to venous or lymphatic obstruction.  Pelvic examination may detect an exophytic necrotic cervical tumor; however, most cervical cancers cannot be seen without magnification.  Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer Papanicolaou (Pap) test (cervical cytology) Biopsy Cervical cancer may be suspected during a routine gynecologic examination.  It is considered in women with Visible cervical lesion Abnormal vaginal bleeding Cervical cancer is usually diagnosed when cervical cytology and/or HPV testing detects abnormalities.  Reporting of cervical cytology results is standardized .  Further evaluation with screening tests or colposcopy is indicated if atypical or cancerous cells are found and/or HPV testing is positive.  Colposcopy (examination of the vagina and cervix with a magnifying lens) is used to identify areas that require biopsy; endocervical curettage is also often performed.  Cone biopsy (conization) is required if the diagnosis is uncertain and high-grade CIN or invasive cancer is suspected; a cone of tissue is removed using a loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), laser, or scalpel (cold knife).   Staging Cervical cancer staging underwent a major revision in 2018.  The previous FIGO 2009 staging system allowed only clinical examination, cervical biopsy, and a few additional tests to assign the stage.  The FIGO 2018 staging system allows, when available, cross-sectional imaging (eg, ultrasonography, CT, MRI, positron emission tomography [PET], PET-CT, MRI-PET) and surgical pathology results to supplement clinical findings in all stages.  Imaging and pathology results are optional because they may be not available in low- and middle-income countries, where cervical cancer is more common .  Other changes in the 2018 staging system include the following: Horizontal spread of the tumor is no longer considered part of stage IA1 and IA2.  Stage I is subdivided into 3 subgroups according to tumor size (IB1 < 2 cm, IB2 2 to < 4 cm, and IB3 ≥ 4 cm) instead of 2 subgroups (stages IB1 and IB2, which used only 4 cm as a cutoff value).  Lymph node status is now part of the staging system.  Positive pelvic nodes are now stage IIIC1 and positive paraortic nodes are stage IIIC2.  Micrometastases in the lymph nodes are considered positive; however, these isolated tumor cells do not change the stage to III, but they should be recorded.  If lymph nodes are classified as positive by imaging studies, an \"r\" is added to the stage (eg, IIIC1r, IIIC2r); if they are classified as positive by pathology results, a \"p\" is added.  If the stage is > IA2, CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis is typically done to better determine tumor size, parametrial involvement, vaginal compromise, and nodal metastases.  PET with CT (PET/CT) is often used to check for spread beyond the cervix.  If PET/CT, MRI, or CT is not available, cystoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, chest x-ray, and IV urography, when clinically indicated, may be used for staging.   When imaging tests suggest that pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes are grossly enlarged (> 2 cm), surgical exploration, typically with a retroperitoneal approach, may be indicated.  Its sole purpose is to remove enlarged lymph nodes so that radiation therapy can be more precisely targeted and more effective. \n【5】 Prognosis for Cervical Cancer The most common histologic types of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) usually metastasize to distant sites only when the cancer is locally advanced or recurrent.  The 5-year survival rates are as follows: Stage I: 80 to 90% Stage II: 60 to 75% Stage III: 30 to 40% Stage IV: 0 to 15% Nearly 80% of recurrences manifest within 2 years.  Adverse prognostic factors include Lymph node involvement Large tumor size and volume Deep cervical stromal invasion Parametrial invasion Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) Nonsquamous histology Treatment of Cervical Cancer Surgery alone for microinvasive disease Surgery or curative radiation therapy if there is no spread to parametria or beyond Radiation therapy and chemotherapy (chemoradiation) if there is spread to parametria or beyond Chemotherapy for metastatic and recurrent cancer Treatment of cervical cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.  If radical hysterectomy is indicated but patients are not ideal candidates for it, chemoradiation is used and has similar oncologic outcomes.  Stage IA1 (no lymphovascular space invasion) Treatment of stage IA1 involves Conization or simple hysterectomy Microinvasive cervical cancer, defined as FIGO stage IA1 with no lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), has a < 1% risk of lymph node metastases and may be managed conservatively with conization using LEEP, laser, or cold knife.  Conization is indicated for patients who are interested in preserving fertility (to obtain, if possible, a nonfragmented specimen with a 3-mm margin).  A cold knife preserves the margins for pathology evaluation but cannot always be used.  Simple hysterectomy should be done if patients are not interested in preserving fertility or if margins are positive after conization.  If margins are positive, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping should be considered, and if patients are interested in preserving fertility, repeat conization is an alternative.  Sentinel lymph node mapping for cervical cancer Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an alternative to full pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with early-stage (IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion, IB1, IB2, or IIA1) cervical cancer  because only 15 to 20% of these patients have positive nodes.  SLN mapping therefore decreases the number of full pelvic lymphadenectomies, which can have adverse effects (eg, lymphedema, nerve damage).  For SLN mapping, blue dye, technetium-99 (99Tc), or indocyanine green (ICG) is directly injected into the cervix, usually at 3 and 9 o’clock.  During surgery, SLNs are identified by direct visualization of blue dye, by a camera to detect the fluorescence of ICG, or by a gamma probe to detect 99Tc.  SLNs are commonly located medial to the external iliac vessels, ventral to the hypogastric vessels, or in the superior part of the obturator space.  Ultrastaging of all SLNs is done to detect micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells (low-volume disease).  Any grossly suspicious node must be removed regardless of mapping.  If there is no mapping on a hemipelvis, a side-specific lymphadenectomy is done.  In the 2018 FIGO staging system, only macrometastases and micrometastases are considered when classifying cases as IIIC; isolated tumor cells do not change the stage, they are considered pN0.  Detection rates for SLN mapping are best for tumors < 2 cm.  Stage IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion) and stage IA2 For stage IA1 with LVSI or stage IA2, recommended treatments include Modified radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without SLN mapping) External pelvic radiation therapy with brachytherapy Criteria for radiation therapy after radical hysterectomy Criteria used to determine whether pelvic radiation with concurrent chemotherapy should be done after radical hysterectomy include the following : Presence of lymphovascular space invasion Depth of invasion Tumor size Patients with a combination of risk factors, such as large tumor size (> 4 cm), deep (> 1/3) stromal invasion, and/or lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), have a risk of recurrence and death of up to 30% after surgery alone .  Risk factors such as positive margins and/or pathologically confirmed positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium are considered higher risk.  In a randomized trial, the estimated 4-year survival rates for patients with stage IB cervical cancer and high-risk factors were 81% for those treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy and 71% for those treated with radiation therapy alone .   Stages IB1, IB2, and IIA1 For stages IB1, IB2, and IIA1, the standard recommendation is Open radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without SLN mapping) Radical hysterectomy includes resection of the uterus (including the cervix), parts of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, the upper 1 to 2 cm of the vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes and parametrium.  The Querleu & Morrow classification system describes four types of radical hysterectomy based on the lateral extent of resection; a few subtypes take nerve preservation and paracervical lymphadenectomy into account .  Results from a randomized trial  showed that minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy or robot-assisted laparoscopy) resulted in a lower overall survival rate and a higher recurrence rate than total abdominal radical hysterectomy.  Therefore, open radical hysterectomy is recommended as the appropriate approach.  When patients are not considered ideal candidates for surgery because of comorbidities, another valid option is external pelvic radiation therapy and brachytherapy with or without concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy.  Another treatment option is radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy), sometimes with adjuvant radiation therapy .  If extracervical spread is noted during radical hysterectomy, the procedure should be aborted, and postoperative radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy is recommended to prevent local recurrence .  Stages IB3, IIA2, IIB, III, and IVA The standard therapy for stages IB3, IIA2, IIB, III, and IVA cancer is External pelvic radiation therapy with brachytherapy and concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy To determine the extent of the radiation field, clinicians may evaluate spread to para-aortic lymph nodes clinically (abdominal CT and/or MRI) or surgically (pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy).  In a randomized trial, oncologic outcomes did not differ significantly in patients with stage IIB through IVA staged clinically compared with those staged surgically before chemoradiation.  In this study, laparoscopic staging appeared to be safe, did not delay primary treatment, and resulted in upstaging in 33% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer .  When cancer is limited to the cervix and/or pelvic lymph nodes, the standard recommendation is External beam radiation therapy, followed by brachytherapy (local radioactive implants, usually using cesium) to the cervix Radiation therapy may cause acute complications (eg, radiation proctitis and cystitis) and, occasionally, late complications (eg, vaginal stenosis, intestinal obstruction, rectovaginal and vesicovaginal fistula formation).  Chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) is usually given with radiation therapy, often to sensitize the tumor to radiation.  Although stage IVA cancers are usually treated with radiation therapy initially, pelvic exenteration (excision of all pelvic organs) may be considered.  If after radiation therapy, cancer remains but is confined to the central pelvis, exenteration is indicated and cures up to 40% of patients.  The procedure may include continent or incontinent urostomy, low anterior rectal anastomosis without colostomy or with an end-descending colostomy, omental carpet to close the pelvic floor (J-flap), and vaginal reconstruction with gracilis or rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps.  Stage IVB and recurrent cancer Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for stage IVB cervical cancer.  Response rates are about 48%.  Adding bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy (cisplatin plus paclitaxel or topotecan plus paclitaxel) resulted in an improvement of 3. 7 months in median overall survival in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer .  Metastases outside the radiation field appear to respond better to chemotherapy than does previously irradiated cancer or metastases in the pelvis.  Clinicians should consider testing for mismatch repair (MMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI), PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1) expression, and/or NTRK gene fusion if patients have recurrent, progressive, or metastatic cervical cancer.  Results can help predict responses to immunotherapies such as PD-L1 inhibitors.  In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy, improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer .  Fertility-sparing surgery In some patients who have early-stage cervical cancer (IA1 with LVSI, IA2, IB1, some cases of IB2) and who wish to preserve fertility, fertility-sparing surgery is an option.  Surgical treatment of cervical cancer does not include oophorectomy unless ovaries appear abnormal.  In young patients having surgery, ovarian preservation is particular important to avoid premature menopause.  Before pelvic radiation, ovaries may be moved outside the radiation field (oophoropexy) to avoid toxic exposure.  Patients should be counseled about the benefit of preserving ovary function versus the risk of potential ovarian metastases.  In a study of 3471 patients who had stage Ib through IIb cervical cancer treated with a radical hysterectomy, the cancer metastasized to the ovaries in 1. 5% of patients .  Ovarian metastasis was more common among patients with adenocarcinoma (5. 31%) than among those with squamous cell carcinoma (0. 79%).  Surgical options for uterine conservation include Radical trachelectomy with nodal evaluation Cervical conization Radical trachelectomy is removal of the cervix, parametria immediately adjacent to the cervix, upper 2 cm of the vagina, and pelvic lymph nodes.  The uterus is conserved and is reattached to the upper vagina, preserving the potential for fertility.  Candidates for this procedure are patients with the following: Histologic subtypes such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma (not neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma or sarcoma) Stage IA1/grade 2 or 3 with lymphovascular space invasion Stage IA2 Stage IB1 Invasion of the upper cervix and lower uterine segment should be excluded by MRI before surgery.  Rates of recurrence and death are similar to those after radical hysterectomy.  If patients who have this procedure plan to have children, delivery must be cesarean.  After a radical trachelectomy, fertility rates range from 50 to 70%, and the recurrence rate is about 5 to 10%.  Radical trachelectomy can be performed via vaginal surgery, laparotomy, laparoscopy, or robotic-assisted surgery.  There has been concern about the safety of radical trachelectomy using minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopy or robotic-assisted surgery) compared with laparotomy.  In one retrospective study of patients with early-stage cervical cancer (≤ 2 cm), laparotomy compared with minimally invasive approaches had comparable 4. 5-year disease-free survival rates .  For patients with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer, conization with pelvic nodal evaluation may be an alternative to radical trachelectomy.  In a single-arm, prospective study, conservative surgery (cervical conization or simple hysterectomy with nodal evaluation) appeared to be safe and feasible in women with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer; the 2-year recurrence rate was 3. 5% .  Studies to determine the optimal treatment for patients with early-stage cervical cancer are ongoing.  An ongoing prospective study (CONTESSA) is evaluating the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by fertility-sparing surgery in patients who have tumors 2 to 4 cm and who wish to preserve fertility. \n【6】 Prevention of Cervical Cancer Screening tests Routine cervical cancer screening effectively detects preinvasive and early-stage disease and decreases cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.  Two types of screening tests for cervical abnormalities are used: Tests for high-risk HPV genotypes Pap test (cervical cytology) If Pap and HPV tests are not available (eg, in resource-limited settings), visual inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid or Lugol iodine is an alternative screening method.  In 2020, the American Cancer Society guidelines (ACS) issued new guidelines for cervical cancer screening as follows : Screening should begin at age 25, rather than age 21.  If primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is available, it should be started at age 25 years, rather than at age 30 and done every 5 years; cytology (eg, Pap tests) is not needed.  If primary HPV testing is not available, co-testing with Pap and HPV tests should be done every 5 years or a Pap test should be done every 3 years.  For those over age 65, guidance remains the same: Testing is stopped if an adequate series of previous tests have been normal during the preceding 10 years; testing should be continued if women have not had adequate normal test results or started if they have not been screened previously.  If women have had a hysterectomy for a disorder other than cancer and have not had abnormal Pap test results, screening is not indicated.   HPV testing is the preferred method of follow-up evaluation for all women with ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), an inconclusive finding detected by Pap tests.  If HPV testing shows that the woman does not have HPV, screening should continue at the routinely scheduled intervals.  If HPV is present, colposcopy should be done.  HPV vaccine  Several preventive HPV vaccines Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease.  HPV can cause skin warts, genital warts, or certain cancers, depending on the type of HPV. \n【7】 The vaccines aim to prevent cervical cancer but do not treat it.  All three vaccines are most effective if given before first sexual activity and potential exposure to HPV.  The HPV vaccine is recommended for all people, ideally before they become sexually active.  The standard recommendation is to vaccinate beginning at age 11 to 12 years, but vaccination may begin at age 9. \n【8】 Key Points Consider cervical cancer if women have abnormal cervical cancer screening (HPV or Pap test) results, visible cervical lesions, or abnormal, particularly postcoital, vaginal bleeding.  Do a colposcopy and/or biopsy to further evaluate and confirm the diagnosis.

Depression, anxiety, stress, relationship problems, past experiences, disorders, drugs, and, sometimes, hormonal changes can reduce a woman's interest in sex.  Doctors diagnose sexual interest/arousal disorder based on the woman's description of the problem and specific criteria.  Improving the relationship and the setting for sexual activity and identifying what stimulates the woman sexually can help.  Psychologic therapies, particularly mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, or sometimes estrogen therapy may be recommended.   A temporary reduction in sexual interest is common, often caused by temporary conditions, such as fatigue.  In contrast, sexual interest/arousal disorder causes interest in sexual activity and response to sexual stimulation to be decreased or absent for a longer period of time and to decrease more than would be expected for a woman’s age and the length of the sexual relationship.  Lack of sexual interest and inability to be sexually aroused are considered a disorder only if they distress the woman and if interest is absent throughout the sexual experience.  Usually, when women are sexually stimulated, they feel sexually excited mentally and emotionally.  They may also be aware of certain physical changes.  For example, the vagina releases secretions that provide lubrication (causing wetness).  Blood flow to the genitals increases, causing the tissues around the vaginal opening (labia) and the clitoris (which corresponds to the penis in men) to swell, the breasts swell slightly, and these areas may tingle.  In sexual interest/arousal disorder, all or some of these responses are absent or significantly decreased.  Sexual interest/arousal disorder is classified as follows: Subjective: Women do not feel aroused by any type of sexual stimulation, including, kissing, dancing, watching an erotic video, and physical stimulation of the genital area.  However, women with subjective sexual interest/arousal disorder may have a physical response to sexual stimulation.  For example, blood flow to the clitoris increases (causing it to swell), and the increased blood flow causes vaginal secretions to increase.  Genital: Women feel aroused in response to stimulation that does not involve the genitals (such as an erotic video), but they do not respond to physical stimulation of the genitals.  Vaginal secretions and/or sensitivity of the genitals is reduced.  Combined: Women feel little or no aroused in response to any type of sexual stimulation.  The physical response (increased blood flow to the genitals and production of vaginal secretions) is minimal or absent.  Women may report that they need external lubricants and that the clitoris no longer swells.  Causes Common causes of sexual interest/arousal disorder are Psychologic factors, such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, stress, distractions, lack of communication between partners, and other relationship problems Unrewarding sexual experiences, which may occur because one or both partners lack skill or because the woman does not communicate her sexual needs Physical factors, such as certain chronic disorders, genitourinary syndrome of menopause Symptoms after menopause , changes in the skin of the vulva (the area around the vagina's opening), changes in sex hormone levels, certain drugs, fatigue, and debility Certain chronic disorders ,such as diabetes Types of Diabetes Complications People with diabetes mellitus have many serious long-term complications that affect many areas of the body, particularly the blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys.   can damage nerves, reducing blood flow to and/or sensation in the genital area.  Use of certain drugs, including antidepressants Drug Treatment for Depression Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【1】 It often does not cause symptoms; however, high blood pressure can increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. \n【2】 Because levels of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone decrease with age, sexual desire might be expected to similarly decrease with age.  However, overall, sexual interest/arousal disorder is as common among young healthy women as it is among older women.  Still, changes in sex hormones sometimes cause lack of interest.  For example, in young healthy women, sudden drops in levels of sex hormones, as may occur during the first few weeks after childbirth Postpartum and Pregnancy-Related Sexual Dysfunction Several factors (physical and psychologic) related to pregnancy and childbirth can make sexual dysfunction more likely. \n【3】 In middle-aged and older women, sexual desire may decrease, but a connection between the decrease and hormones has not been proved.  The decrease in estrogen that occurs at menopause can cause genitourinary syndrome of menopause (which causes symptoms affecting the vagina, vulva, and urinary tract).  In this syndrome, the tissues of the vagina can become thin, dry, and inelastic.  As a result, intercourse can be uncomfortable or painful.  Women with this syndrome may also feel a compelling need to urinate (urinary urgency) and have frequent urinary tract infections.  These symptoms make women less interested in sex.  As women age, levels of testosterone decrease, possibly contributing to a decrease in the libido (sex drive).  In younger women, removal of both ovaries causes a very sudden drop in sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone), as well as infertility.  Also, the cause for removal may be ovarian cancer.  All of these effects may decrease their interest in sex.  Even when these women take estrogen, interest in sex may be minimal.  Inadequate sexual stimulation or the wrong setting for sexual activity (for example, not private enough) can also contribute to sexual interest/arousal disorder.  ung healthy women are as likely to have sexual interest/arousal disorder as older women.  Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation based on specific criteria Doctors base the diagnosis of sexual interest/arousal disorder on the woman’s history and description of the problem and on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.  These criteria require a lack of or decrease in at least three of the following: Interest in sexual activity Initiation of sexual activity and responsiveness to a partner's initiation Excitement or pleasure during almost all sexual activity Sexual or erotic fantasies or thoughts Physical sensations in the genital area or elsewhere during sexual activity Interest or arousal in response to sexual stimuli—written, spoken, or visual These symptoms must have been present for at least 6 months and must cause significant distress in the woman. \n【4】 Treatment General measures Psychologic therapies Treatment of the cause Hormone therapy Care for women with sexual interest/arousal disorder is best managed by a team of several types of health care practitioners (a multidisciplinary team).  The multidisciplinary team may include sex counselors, pain specialists, psychotherapists, and physical therapists.  One of the most helpful measures for sexual interest/arousal disorder is for women to identify and tell their partner which things stimulate them.  Women may need to remind their partner that they need preparatory activities—which may involve touching or not—to get ready for sexual activity.  For example, they may want to talk intimately, watch a romantic or erotic video, or dance.  Women may want to kiss, hug, or cuddle.  They may want their partner to touch various parts of their body, then the breasts or genitals (foreplay) before moving to sexual intercourse or other sexual activity that involves penetration.  Couples may experiment with different techniques or activities (including fantasy and sex toys) to find effective stimuli.  Measures recommended to treat sexual dysfunction in general Treatment can also help increase interest in sex.  For example, eliminating distractions (such as a television in the bedroom) and taking measures to improve privacy and a sense of security can help.  Doctors may recommend using intensely erotic stimuli (such as videos) and fantasizing.  Treatment often focuses on factors that contribute to a lack of interest in sex and lack of response to sexual stimulation, such as depression, low self-esteem, and problems in a relationship.  Mindfulness involves focusing on what is happening in the moment.  MCBT, usually done in small groups, combines mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy.  It can help with arousal, orgasm, and the desire for sexual activity.  Doctors may refer women with sexual interest/arousal disorder to a sex counselor or therapist or a psychotherapist.  Other treatments depend on the cause.  For example, if drugs may be contributing, they are stopped if possible.  Estrogen therapy Hormone Therapy for Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【5】 Estrogen taken by mouth or applied as a patch or gel to an arm or a leg may be recommended.  These forms of estrogen affect the whole body and can thus help improve mood, lessen hot flashes and sleep problems, keep the vagina healthy, and maintain adequate lubrication for sexual intercourse.  All of these effects may make women more likely to be interested in sex.  Estrogen patches or gels are preferred over pills taken by mouth for postmenopausal women.  If women who have a uterus (that is, they have not had a hysterectomy) take estrogen by mouth or in a patch or gel, they are also given a progestogen (a version of the hormone progesterone) because taking estrogen alone increases the risk of cancer of the lining of the uterus Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer.  Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause. \n【6】 Low doses of estrogen are used.  Estrogen therapy may be started at menopause or within the next few years.  However, doctors usually recommend that postmenopausal women use forms of estrogen that affect mainly the vagina.  For example, estrogen may be inserted into the vagina as a cream (with a plastic applicator), as a tablet, or in a ring (similar to a diaphragm).  These forms of estrogen can keep the vagina healthy but do not help with mood, hot flashes, or related sleep problems.  When these forms contain a low dose of estrogen, women who have a uterus do not need to take a progestogen.  But when these forms contain a high dose of estrogen, women with a uterus need to take a progestogen.  Estrogen has risks as well as benefits, so women should talk to their doctor about its risks and benefits before starting to take it.  Testosterone therapy Little is known about the long-term effectiveness and safety of testosterone (taken by mouth or in a patch).  When taken for a short time, a testosterone patch can be effective in postmenopausal women with sexual interest/arousal disorder.  Testosterone is occasionally prescribed in addition to estrogen therapy if all other measures are ineffective.  However, doctors must regularly check women for side effects such as acne, excess hair growth , and development of masculine characteristics ,virilization is the development of exaggerated masculine characteristics, usually in women, often as a result of the adrenal glands overproducing androgens .  Testosterone can also be applied directly to the area around the vagina's opening and the vagina.  These forms may have no side effects.  Testosterone taken by mouth is not recommended.  If testosterone is prescribed, doctors explain the uncertainty of effectiveness and the risks of such therapy.  They do blood tests to check kidney and liver function and measure lipid levels before testosterone is started.  Testosterone is not prescribed if these test results indicate that the woman is at risk for liver problems or dyslipidemia (for example, too high a level of LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol).  If testosterone is prescribed, doctors schedule regular follow-up visits to check for side effects such as acne, hirsutism Hairiness In men, the amount of body hair varies greatly , but very few men are concerned enough about excess hair to see a doctor. \n【7】 Other therapies In postmenopausal women, a synthetic form of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) called prasterone, inserted into the vagina, can relieve dryness due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause Symptoms after menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【8】 Relieving these symptoms may increase a woman's interest is sex and in her ability to be aroused.  Prasterone may also make the genital area more responsive to stimulation and improve orgasm.  Flibanserin can be used to treat premenopausal women with female sexual interest/arousal disorder.  However, there is little evidence for its effectiveness and safety.  Devices such as vibrators or clitoral suction stimulators may help, but there is little evidence to support their effectiveness.

Diplopia may be monocular or binocular.  Monocular diplopia is present when only one eye is open.  Binocular diplopia disappears when either eye is closed.  Etiology of Diplopia Monocular diplopia can occur when something distorts light transmission through the eye to the retina.  There may be > 2 images.  One of the images is of normal quality (eg, brightness, contrast, clarity); the rest are of inferior quality.  The most common causes of monocular diplopia are Cataract A cataract is a congenital or degenerative opacity of the lens.  The main symptom is gradual, painless vision blurring.  Diagnosis is by ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination. \n【1】 Complaints also may represent malingering.  Binocular diplopia suggests disconjugate alignment of the eyes.  There are only 2 images, and they are of equal quality.  There are many possible causes of binocular diplopia .  The most common are Cranial nerve (3rd, 4th, or 6th) palsy Myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors. \n【2】 These palsies may be isolated and idiopathic or the result of various disorders involving the cranial nerve nuclei or the infranuclear nerve or nerves.  Whether pain is present depends on the disorder.  Other causes involve mechanical interference with ocular motion (which often cause pain) or a generalized disorder of neuromuscular transmission (which typically do not cause pain).   Evaluation of Diplopia History of present illness should determine whether diplopia involves one or both eyes, whether diplopia is intermittent or constant, and whether the images are separated vertically, horizontally, or both.  Any associated pain is noted, as well as whether it occurs with or without eye movement.  Review of systems should seek symptoms of other cranial nerve dysfunction, such as vision abnormalities (2nd cranial nerve); numbness of forehead and cheek (5th cranial nerve); facial weakness (7th cranial nerve); dizziness, hearing loss, or gait difficulties (8th cranial nerve); and swallowing or speech difficulties (9th and 12th cranial nerves).  Other neurologic symptoms, such as weakness and sensory abnormalities, should be sought, noting whether these are intermittent or constant.  Nonneurologic symptoms of potential causes are ascertained.  They include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (botulism); palpitations, heat sensitivity, and weight loss ; and difficulty with bladder control . \n【3】 Physical examination begins with a review of vital signs for fever and general appearance for signs of toxicity (eg, prostration, confusion).  Eye examination begins with noting the initial position of the eyes, followed by measuring visual acuity (with correction) in each eye and both together, which also helps determine whether diplopia is monocular or binocular.  Eye examination should note presence of bulging of one or both eyes, eyelid droop, pupillary abnormalities, and disconjugate eye movement and nystagmus during ocular motility testing.  Ophthalmoscopy should be done, particularly noting any abnormalities of the lens (eg, cataract, displacement) and retina (eg, detachment).  Ocular motility is tested by having the patient hold the head steady and track the examiner’s finger, which is moved to extreme gaze to the right, left, upward, downward, diagonally to either side, and finally inward toward the patient’s nose (convergence).  However, mild paresis of ocular motility sufficient to cause diplopia may escape detection by such examination.  If diplopia occurs in one direction of gaze, the eye that produces each image can be determined by repeating the examination with a red glass placed over one of the patient’s eyes. \n【4】 If a red glass is not available, the paretic eye can sometimes be identified by having the patient close each eye.  The paretic eye is the eye that when closed eliminates the more peripheral image.  The cover test and cover-uncover test can also be used to determine whether a deviation or strabismus is present with both eyes open (manifest/tropia), or only when one eye is open (latent/phoria).  Both tests are done on both eyes.  For the cover test, the patient is asked to fixate on an object with both eyes open, and one eye is covered.  The other eye is observed for a refixation movement, which would indicate it had previously been misaligned, indicating a manifest deviation or tropia.  The cover-uncover test is conducted similarly, except the eye being tested is covered for a few seconds and then the cover is removed.  The same eye is observed for a refixation movement, which would indicate a latent deviation or phoria.  The patient may also see the object \"jumping\" with the refixation movement during either test.  The other cranial nerves are tested, and the remainder of the neurologic examination, including strength, sensation, reflexes, cerebellar function, and observation of gait, is completed.  Relevant nonneurophthalmologic components of the examination include palpation of the neck for goiter and inspection of the shins for pretibial myxedema .  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: More than one cranial nerve deficit Pupillary involvement of any degree Any neurologic symptoms or signs besides diplopia Pain Proptosis Interpretation of findings sometimes suggest which cranial nerve is involved.  3rd: Eyelid droop, eye deviated laterally and down, sometimes pupillary dilation 4th: Vertical diplopia worse on downward gaze (patient tilts head to improve vision) 6th: Eye deviated medially, diplopia worse on lateral gaze (patient turns head to improve vision) Other findings help suggest a cause .  Intermittent diplopia suggests a waxing and waning neurologic disorder, such as myasthenia gravis or multiple sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. \n【5】 Patients with latent phoria do not have any other neurologic manifestations.  Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is characterized by paresis of ipsilateral eye adduction in horizontal gaze but not in convergence.  It can be unilateral or bilateral. \n【6】 INO manifests on horizontal gaze testing with diplopia, weak adduction on the affected side (usually cannot adduct eye past midline), and nystagmus of the contralateral eye.  However, the affected eye adducts normally on convergence testing (which does not require an intact MLF).  Pain suggests a compressive lesion or inflammatory disorder.  Testing Patients with monocular diplopia are referred to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of ocular pathology; no other tests are required beforehand.  For binocular diplopia, patients with a unilateral, single cranial nerve palsy, a normal pupillary light response, and no other symptoms or signs can usually be observed without testing for a few weeks.  Many cases resolve spontaneously.  Ophthalmologic evaluation is recommended to monitor the patient and help further delineate the deficit, particularly for a third nerve palsy, because it can also progress to involve the pupil.  Most other patients require neuroimaging with MRI to detect orbital, cranial, or central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities.  CT may be substituted if there is concern about a metallic intraocular foreign body or if MRI is otherwise contraindicated or unavailable.  Imaging should be done immediately if findings suggest infection, aneurysm, or acute stroke.  Patients with manifestations of Graves disease Etiology Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones. \n【7】 Testing for myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. \n【8】 Treatment of Diplopia Treatment is management of the underlying disorder.

Many anomalies are asymptomatic and diagnosed via prenatal ultrasonography or part of a routine evaluation for other congenital anomalies.  Other anomalies are diagnosed during evaluation of urinary tract obstruction Obstructive Uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy).See also Congenital Renal Cystic Dysplasia is a broad category of congenital malformations involving metanephric malformation or congenital obstructive uropathies.   Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Incidence of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is about 1/10,000 to 1/20,000 births; it is caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene, located in chromosome 6p21.  In contrast, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder of renal cyst formation causing gradual enlargement of both kidneys, sometimes with progression to renal failure. \n【1】 Symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are usually not present until adulthood.  Rarely, symptoms manifest in infancy in the more aggressive form.  Children may be diagnosed earlier when a cyst is found incidentally or via family history.  Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease affects the Kidneys Liver The kidneys are usually greatly enlarged and contain small cysts; renal failure is common in childhood.  The liver is enlarged and has periportal fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and scattered cysts; the remainder of the hepatic parenchyma is normal.  Fibrosis causes portal hypertension by age 5 to 10 years, but hepatic function is normal or minimally impaired.  Disease severity and progression vary.  Severe disease may manifest prenatally or soon after birth or in early childhood with renal-related symptoms; less severely affected patients present in late childhood or adolescence with hepatic-related symptoms.  Affected neonates have a protuberant abdomen with huge, firm, smooth, symmetric kidneys.  Severely affected neonates commonly have pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to the in utero effects of renal dysfunction and oligohydramnios.  In patients aged 5 to 10 years, signs of portal hypertension is elevated pressure in the portal vein.  It is caused most often by cirrhosis (in North America), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. \n【2】 If the patient presents in adolescence, nephromegaly is less marked, renal insufficiency may be mild to moderate, and the major symptoms are those related to portal hypertension.  Diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease may be difficult, especially without a family history.  Ultrasonography may show renal or hepatic cysts; definitive diagnosis may require biopsy.  Ultrasonography in late pregnancy usually allows presumptive in utero diagnosis.  If postnatal ultrasonography is not definitive, MRI or CT may be diagnostic.  If needed, molecular testing for PKHD1 can be done when clinical criteria is not met.  Many neonates die in the first few days or weeks of life from pulmonary insufficiency.  Most who survive develop progressive renal failure often requiring renal replacement therapy.  Experience with renal transplantation with or without hepatic transplantation is limited.  When transplantation is done, hypersplenism is cytopenia caused by splenomegaly. \n【3】 Portal hypertension may be treated by portacaval or splenorenal shunts, which reduce morbidity but not mortality.  Duplication anomalies Supernumerary collecting systems may be unilateral or bilateral and may involve the renal pelvis and ureters (accessory renal pelvis, double or triple pelvis and ureter), calyx, or ureteral orifice.  Duplex kidneys have a single renal unit with more than one collecting system.  This anomaly differs from fused kidneys, which involves fusion of two renal parenchymal units maintaining their respective individual collecting systems.  Some duplication anomalies have ureteral ectopy with or without ureterocele Ureteral anomalies frequently occur with renal anomalies but may occur independently. \n【4】 Management depends on the anatomy and function of each separately drained segment.  Surgery may be necessary to correct obstruction or VUR.  Fusion anomalies With fusion anomalies, the kidneys are joined, but the ureters enter the bladder on each side.  These anomalies increase the risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【5】 Horseshoe kidney, the most common fusion anomaly, occurs when renal parenchyma on each side of the vertebral column is joined at the corresponding (usually lower) poles; an isthmus of renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue joins at the midline.  The ureters course medially and anteriorly over this isthmus and generally drain well.  Obstruction, if present, is usually secondary to insertion of the ureters high in the renal pelvis.  Pyeloplasty relieves the obstruction and can be done without resecting the isthmus.  Crossed fused renal ectopia is the second most common fusion anomaly.  The renal parenchyma (representing both kidneys) is on one side of the vertebral column.  One of the ureters crosses the midline and enters the bladder on the side opposite the fused kidneys.  When ureteropelvic junction obstruction is present, pyeloplasty is the treatment of choice.  Fused pelvic kidney (pancake kidney) is much less common.  A single pelvic kidney is served by two collecting systems and ureters.  If obstruction is present, reconstruction is needed.  Malrotation is usually of little clinical significance.  Ultrasonography often shows hydronephrosis.  Further evaluation with a magnetic resonance urogram or renal scan may be done when clinicians are concerned about possible obstruction.  Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) In this condition, there is a nonfunctioning renal unit consisting of noncommunicating cysts with intervening solid tissue composed of fibrosis, primitive tubules, and foci of cartilage.  Usually, ureteral atresia is also present.  The contralateral kidney is usually normal, but up to 10% of patients may have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【6】 Frequently, the kidney progressively involutes and eventually is no longer visible on ultrasonography.  Development of tumors, infection, and/or hypertension is rare.  Most experts recommend observation to monitor for involution.  Nephrectomy may be considered for the presence of solid tissue, progressive enlargement, or rarely hypertension or a ruptured cyst that is causing pain.  Renal agenesis Bilateral renal agenesis as part of a syndrome of oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and extremity and facial anomalies (classic Potter syndrome) is fatal within minutes to hours because of the pulmonary hypoplasia and subsequent respiratory distress.  Fetal demise is common.  Unilateral renal agenesis accounts for about 5% of renal anomalies.  Many cases result from complete involution in utero of a multicystic dysplastic kidney.  It usually is accompanied by ureteral agenesis with absence of the ipsilateral trigone and ureteral orifice.  However, the ipsilateral adrenal gland is unaffected.  No treatment is necessary; compensatory hypertrophy of the solitary kidney maintains normal renal function.  Because the kidneys share a common embryologic origin with the vas deferens and uterus, boys may have agenesis of the vas deferens and girls may have uterine anomalies.  Renal dysplasia In renal dysplasia (a histologic diagnosis), the renal vasculature, tubules, collecting ducts, or drainage apparatus develops abnormally.  Diagnosis of renal dysplasia is by biopsy.  If dysplasia is segmental, treatment of renal dysplasia is often unnecessary.  If dysplasia is extensive, renal dysfunction may necessitate nephrologic care, including renal replacement therapy.  Renal ectopia (abnormal renal location) usually results when a kidney fails to ascend from its origin in the true pelvis; a rare exception occurs with a superiorly ascended (thoracic) kidney.  Pelvic ectopia increases the incidence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【7】 Obstruction and severe reflux may be corrected surgically when indicated (if causing hypertension, recurrent infections, or renal growth retardation).  Renal hypoplasia usually occurs because inadequate ureteral bud branching causes an underdeveloped, small kidney with histologically normal nephrons.  If hypoplasia is segmental, hypertension can occur, and ablative surgery may be needed.

Etiology of Knee Pain There are many causes of pain in or around the knee in athletes, particularly runners, including Subluxation of the patella when bending the knee Chondromalacia of the undersurface of the patella Chondromalacia Patellae is softening of the cartilage underneath the patella. \n【1】 Diagnosis of Knee Pain History and physical examination Sometimes imaging tests Diagnosis requires a thorough review of the injured athlete’s training program, including a history of symptom onset and aggravating factors, and a complete lower-extremity examination .  Mechanical symptoms, such as locking or catching, suggest an internal derangement of the knee such as a meniscal tear.  Instability symptoms, such as giving way and loss of confidence in the extremity when twisting or turning on the knee, suggest ligamentous injury or subluxation of the patella.  Chondromalacia is suggested by anterior knee pain after running, especially on hills, as well as pain and stiffness after sitting for any length of time (positive movie sign).  On examination, pain is typically reproduced by compression of the patella against the femur.  Pain that becomes worse with weight-bearing suggests a stress fracture.  Treatment of Knee Pain Quadriceps-strengthening exercises Sometimes stabilizing pads, supports, or braces Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Treatment is tailored to the specific cause of the pain.  Treatment of chondromalacia includes quadriceps-strengthening exercises with balanced strengthening exercises for the hamstrings, use of arch supports if excessive pronation is a possible contributor, and use of NSAIDs.  For patellar subluxation, use of patella-stabilizing pads or braces may be necessary, especially in sports that require rapid, agile movements in various planes (eg, basketball, tennis).  If there is excessive pronation of the foot, and all other possible causes of knee pain have been excluded, use of an orthotic insert is sometimes useful.  Stress fractures require rest and cessation of weight-bearing activity.  Intra-articular pathology often requires surgery.  Exercises to Strengthen the Knee Straight Leg Raise 1.  Lie on back with uninvolved knee bent so foot is on the floor/table.  2.  Contract quadriceps muscle on the involved side then raise straight leg to thigh level of uninvolved leg.  3.  Return to starting position slowly to control the lowering phase.  4.  Perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions, 1 time a day.   Quadriceps Set 1.  Sit with involved leg extended.  Contract quadriceps muscle on the front of the leg to push back of knee down to the floor/table.  Hold exercise for 10 seconds.  Perform 1 set of 10 repetitions, every hour.  5.  Special Instructions a.  Do not hold your breath during the exercise.   Prone Resisted Knee Flexion 1.  Once the inflammatory phase has subsided and the patient is able to perform knee flexion without pain: 2.  Lie on stomach.  Begin with knee straight.  Bend knee through available range that is pain free.  Slowly return to starting position.  6.  7.  Start with least resistance, adding weight as tolerated.  Band resistance can also be used.  b.  Focus on eccentric lowering phase with a count of 4 to lower and extend knee to starting position and a count of 2 for knee flexion.   Prone Hip Extension 1.  Lie on stomach, keep knee straight on involved side.  Perform abdominal contraction.  Lift involved leg up off the floor/table.  Return to starting position.  Keep the knee straight and abdominals contracted through the repetition.   Prone Quadriceps Stretch 1.  Bend involved knee and loop towel or band around the ankle.  Gently pull towel or band to stretch muscle on front of thigh pulling ankle toward buttocks.  Repeat on the other leg.  For added stretch, place a towel roll just above the knee to place the hip in slight extension.   Standing Iliotibial Band Stretch 1.  Stand about a foot away from the wall with the involved leg closest to the wall.  Place the uninvolved leg in front of the involved leg.  Keep the involved knee straight.  Lean trunk away from the wall so the hip on the involved side goes toward the wall.  Be sure not to lean forward at the waist.   Supine Active Hamstring Stretch 1.  Lie on back, hold behind the involved knee to pull it gently toward the chest.  Gently extend the knee to straighten the leg.   Side-Lying Hip External Rotation (Clamshell Exercise) 1.  Lie on involved side.  Keep shoulders and hips in line with ankles slightly behind the body with the knees bent approximately 90°.  Keep feet together while lifting left knee up toward the ceiling.  Lower and repeat.  Repeat exercise lying on the uninvolved side.  For added resistance, place a band around the knees, start with the least resistance.   Squats 1.  Stand with feet about hip width apart.  Toes should point forward to stay aligned with the knees.  Keeping core tight, move buttocks backward, similar to beginning to sit in a chair, and squat down until the thighs are almost parallel with the floor.  Keep weight on outside of foot and heels.  Start with a partial squat and increase as you become familiar with the movement.  c.  Add weight only as tolerated.  Start with 1 to 2 pounds (0. 5 to 1 kg [ie, a soup can]).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:07:49"}

A knee sprain is a tear in or painful stretch of one or more of the ligaments that hold your knee in place.  Ligaments are short, tough bands of tissue that hold your bones together at a joint.  Knee sprains: Usually happen when you twist your leg Can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on whether the ligament is stretched, partly, or fully torn Often involve more than one ligament Cause pain and swelling Don't show up on x-rays, but doctors may do an MRI Are treated by Protecting the area, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation (\"PRICE\") Often require a knee brace Sometimes require surgery The cartilage \"shock absorber pads\" inside your knee may also be injured.  See a doctor if you're unable to stand or walk.  Holding the Knee Together The collateral ligaments, one on either side of the knee, prevent the knee from moving from side to side too much.  The cruciate ligaments inside the joint prevent the knee from moving forward or backward too much.  The menisci are cartilage \"shock absorber pads\" between the thighbone (femur) and larger lower leg bone (tibia), which form part of the knee joint.  What causes a knee sprain? Knee sprains usually happen when your knee is twisted or bent too far the wrong way.  Common causes of sprained knees include: A forceful hit to the side of the knee Twisting the knee while making a sudden change in direction What are the symptoms of a sprained knee? Symptoms include: You hear or feel a pop in your knee when the injury happens Your knee is painful and swollen Your knee feels unstable, as if it will buckle Your knee won’t bend or can bend only a little How do doctors tell if I have a sprained knee? Doctors can usually tell if you have a knee sprain by examining you and gently moving your knee in different directions.  If your knee is very swollen and painful, doctors may do: X-ray Plain X-Rays A plain x-ray is an imaging test that takes a picture of the inside of your body.  It uses a low dose of x-ray radiation.  X-rays show body parts according to how dense (solid) they are. \n【1】 A computer records changes in the magnetic field around your body. \n【2】 Treatment depends on how bad the sprain is.  Mild or moderate knee sprains don’t need special treatment.  In the first 24 hours after a sprain, doctors have you do a treatment called PRICE, which stands for: Protect your knee with a brace Rest your knee by not walking on it and using a crutch Ice your knee with an ice pack wrapped in a towel Compress (wrap) your knee with an elastic bandage to keep it from swelling Elevate your leg to keep it from swelling You may need to wear a splint or a device that supports the knee and keeps it from bending (knee immobilizer).  Doctors may have you do exercises to strengthen your knee.  For severe knee sprains, doctors may: Have you wear a knee brace that will keep your knee bent for 4 to 6 weeks or more Do surgery With a severe sprain, don't exercise your knee until your doctor tells you to.

The substances involved tend to be members of the 10 classes of drug that typically cause substance-related disorders: Alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【1】 When inhaled, the gas can cause a state of intoxication and long-term nerve and organ damage. \n【2】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful. \n【3】 The common terms \"addiction,\" \"abuse,\" and \"dependence\" are too loosely and variably defined to be very useful in systematic diagnosis; \"substance use disorder\" is more comprehensive and has fewer negative connotations.  Physiologic Effects of Substance Use These substances all directly activate the brain's reward system and produce feelings of pleasure.  The activation may be so strong that people intensely crave the substance.  They may neglect normal activities to obtain and use the drug.  These substances also have direct physiologic effects, including Intoxication Withdrawal Substance-induced mental health disorders Intoxication refers to the immediate and temporary effects of a specific drug.  Intoxication impairs the person's mental function and judgment and may alter mood.  Depending on the drug, the person may feel a sense of excitement or an exaggerated feeling of well-being (or euphoria), or the person may feel calmer, more relaxed, and sleepier than usual.  Many drugs impair physical functioning and coordination, leading to falls and vehicle crashes.  Some drugs trigger aggressive behavior, leading to fighting.  As larger amounts of the drug are used (called an overdose), adverse effects become more obvious, with serious complications and sometimes risk of death.  Tolerance means that people need more and more of the drug to feel the effects originally produced by a smaller amount.  People can develop tremendous tolerance to drugs such as opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse. \n【4】 Withdrawal refers to symptoms that develop when people stop taking a substance or take significantly less than usual.  Withdrawal causes various unpleasant symptoms that differ depending on the substance involved.  Withdrawal from some drugs ,such as alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【5】 Most people who experience withdrawal know that taking more of the substance will reduce their symptoms.  Whether withdrawal occurs depends only on the substance and how long it is used, not whether the person has a substance use disorder Substance Use Disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【6】 Some prescription drugs, particularly opioids, sedatives, and stimulants, can result in withdrawal symptoms even when taken as prescribed for legitimate medical reasons and for relatively brief periods (less than 1 week for opioids).  People who have withdrawal symptoms were previously termed physically dependent upon the substance.  However, \"dependence\" has negative connotations suggesting illicit drug use, so doctors prefer to avoid this terminology.  Substance-Induced Mental Health Disorders are mental changes produced by substance use or withdrawal that resemble psychiatric disorders such as depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【7】 For a mental health disorder to be considered substance induced, the substance involved must be known to be capable of causing the disorder.  Substances can be members of the 10 classes of drug that typically cause substance-related disorders: Alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【8】 Common examples include anticholinergic drugs Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? and corticosteroids, which may cause temporary symptoms of psychosis.  In addition, the mental health disorder should Appear within 1 month of intoxication with or withdrawal from the substance Cause significant distress or impair functioning Not have been present before use of the substance Not occur only during acute delirium is a sudden, fluctuating, and usually reversible disturbance of mental function. \n【9】 Medical Care for Recreational and Illicit Substance Use of illegal drugs, although problematic from a legal standpoint, does not always involve a substance use disorder.  On the other hand, legal substances, such as alcohol and prescription drugs (and marijuana in an increasing number of states in the United States), may be involved in a substance use disorder.  Problems caused by use of prescription and illegal drugs cut across all socioeconomic groups.  Recreational drug use has existed in one form or another for centuries.  People have used drugs for a variety of reasons, including To alter or enhance mood As part of religious ceremonies To gain spiritual enlightenment To enhance performance People who take drugs recreationally may take them occasionally in relatively small doses, often without doing themselves harm.  That is, users do not develop drug withdrawal Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【10】 Drugs usually considered recreational include opium, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, caffeine, hallucinogenic mushrooms Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that cause profound distortions in people's perceptions. \n【11】 Many recreational drugs are considered \"natural\" because they are close to their plant origin.  They contain a mixture of low-concentration psychoactive ingredients rather than an isolated, more concentrated psychoactive compound.  Recreational drugs are can be taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.  Causes of Substance Use Disorders People usually progress from experimentation to occasional use and then to heavy use and sometimes to a substance use disorder.  This progression is complex and only partially understood.  The process depends on interactions between the drug, user, and setting.  Drug Drugs in the 10 classes vary in how likely they are to cause a substance use disorder.  The likelihood is termed addiction liability.  Addiction liability depends upon a combination of factors including How the drug is used How strongly the drug stimulates the brain's reward pathway How quickly the drug works The drug's ability to induce tolerance Intoxication and/or symptoms of withdrawal Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【12】 As people continue to use a substance, they often see less risk in using it and may begin to increase their use and/or experiment with other substances.  People's perception of risk also may be influenced by the social and legal consequences of use.  During treatment of medical illness or following surgical or dental procedures, people are routinely prescribed opioids.  If people do not take the whole amount prescribed, the drugs sometimes end up in the hands of people who wish to use them recreationally.  Because the use of these drugs for nonmedical purposes has become such a large problem, many health care providers have responded by Prescribing lower amounts of opioid drugs Encouraging people to safely store or dispose of any leftover drugs Expanding prescription take-back programs User Factors in users that may predispose to a substance use disorder include Psychologic characteristics Circumstances and disorders Psychologic characteristics are not clearly a strong factor, although people with low levels of self-control (impulsivity) or high levels of risk-taking and novelty-seeking behaviors may have an increased risk of developing a substance use disorder.  However, there is little scientific evidence to support the concept of the \"addictive personality\" that has been described by some behavioral scientists.  A number of circumstances and coexisting disorders appear to increase the risk of a substance use disorder.  For example, People who are sad, emotionally distressed, or socially alienated may find temporary relief from drug use, which can lead to increased use and sometimes to a substance use disorder.  People with other, unrelated mental health disorders such as anxiety and Stress-Related Disorders or depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【13】 (Doctors use the term \"dual diagnosis\" to refer to people who have both a mental health disorder and a substance use disorder. ) People with chronic pain is pain that lasts or recurs for months or years. \n【14】 Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks. \n【15】 Some of these people later develop a substance use disorder.  However, in many of these people, nonopioid drugs Nonopioid Pain Relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【16】 Addiction likely has many causes, some of which are genetic and other of which are epigenetic (effects of behaviors and the environment carried with the genes).  Research into specific genetic abnormalities varies by the specific substance.  Researchers have found few biochemical or metabolic differences between people who do and do not develop substance use disorder.  Setting Cultural and social factors are very important in initiating and maintaining (or relapsing to) substance use.  Watching family members (eg, parents, older siblings) and peers using substances increases the risk that people will begin using substances.  Peers are a particularly powerful influence among adolescents .  People who are trying to stop using a substance find it much more difficult if they are around others who also use that substance.  Doctors may inadvertently contribute to harmful use of psychoactive drugs by overzealously prescribing them to relieve stress.  Many social factors, including mass media, contribute to the expectation that drugs should be used to relieve all distress.  Diagnosis of Substance Use Disorders A doctor's evaluation Sometimes a substance use disorder is diagnosed when people go to a health care practitioner because they want help stopping use of a drug.  Other people try to hide their drug use, and doctors may suspect problems with drug use only when they notice changes in a person's mood or behavior.  Sometimes doctors discover signs of substance use during a physical examination.  For example, they may discover track marks caused by repeatedly injecting drugs intravenously.  Track marks are lines of tiny, dark dots (needle punctures) surrounded by an area of darkened or discolored skin.  Injecting drugs under the skin causes circular scars or ulcers.  People may claim other reasons for the marks, such as frequent blood donations, bug bites, or other injuries.  Health care practitioners also use other methods (such as questionnaires) to identify a substance use disorder.  Urine and sometimes blood tests may be done under certain circumstances to check for the presence of drugs.  Criteria for diagnosis The criteria for diagnosing a substance use disorder fall into four categories.  People who have 2 or more of these criteria within a 12-month period are considered to have a substance use disorder: The person cannot control use of the substance.  The person's ability to meet social obligations is compromised by use of the substance.  The person uses the substance in physically dangerous situations.  The person shows physical signs of use and/or dependence.  Inability to control use The person takes the substance in larger amounts or for a longer time than originally planned.  The person desires to stop or cut down use of the substance.  The person spends a lot of time obtaining, using, or recovering from the effects of the substance.  The person craves the substance.  Social impairment The person fails to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.  The person continues to use the substance even though it causes (or worsens) social or interpersonal problems.  The person gives up or reduces important social, occupational, or recreational activity because of substance use.  Risky use The person uses the substance in physically hazardous situations (eg, when driving or in dangerous social circumstances).  The person continues to use the substance despite knowing it is worsening a medical or psychologic problem.  Physical symptoms Tolerance Intoxication : The person needs to use increasingly more of the substance to feel the desired effect.  Withdrawal Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【17】 Note that some drugs, particularly opioids, sedative/hypnotics, and stimulants, can result in tolerance and/or withdrawal symptoms even when taken as prescribed for legitimate medical reasons and for relatively brief periods (less than 1 week for opioids).  Withdrawal symptoms that develop following appropriate medical use do not warrant the diagnosis of a substance use disorder.  For example, when people with severe pain due to advanced cancer become dependent (psychologically and physically) on an opioid such as morphine, their withdrawal symptoms are not considered evidence of a substance use disorder.  The severity of the substance use disorder is determined by the number of criteria met: Mild: 2 to 3 criteria Moderate: 4 to 5 criteria Severe: ≥ 6 criteria Treatment of Substance Use Disorders Varies depending on substance and circumstances Specific treatment depends on the drug being used, but it typically involves counseling and sometimes involves use of other drugs.  Family support and support groups help people remain committed to stopping use of the drug.  Substance use disorders have become widespread and have resulted in a rising number of deaths.  In response to this growing epidemic, many organizations have established harm-reduction programs to provide education, counseling, and referral for treatment.  Their purpose is to reduce the harm of drug use in users who cannot stop.  Some provide national telephone helplines.  Because sharing needles is a common cause of HIV infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【18】  Hepatitis is common throughout the world. \n【19】 This strategy helps reduce the spread (and the cost to society) of these infections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#18#18#内容与正文无关联", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 19:14:09"}

Actinic keratoses are precancerous changes in skin cells (keratinocytes) that are a frequent consequence of many years of sun exposure. \n【2】 Actinic keratoses may be pink, red, or, less commonly, gray or brown, and may feel rough and scaly.  Seborrheic keratoses are superficial, often pigmented, epithelial lesions that are usually warty but may occur as smooth papules. \n【3】 They may appear on areas of the skin that are not exposed to sunlight but are not precancerous.  Skin cancers The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of epidermal keratinocytes that invades the dermis; this cancer usually occurs in sun-exposed areas. \n【4】 Such lesions are especially common among people who were extensively exposed to sunlight as children and adolescents and among those who are chronically exposed to the sun as part of their profession or recreational activities (eg, athletes, farmers, ranchers, sailors, frequent sunbathers).  Sun exposure also substantially increases the risk of malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).  Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【5】 Treatment Minimization of UV light exposure Topical treatments for photoaged skin Treatment begins with preventive efforts Prevention The skin may respond to sunlight with chronic (eg, dermatoheliosis [photoaging], actinic keratosis) or acute (eg, photosensitivity, sunburn) changes. \n【6】 Photoaging Various combination therapies, including chemical peels, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), topical alpha-hydroxy acids, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, and tretinoin, have been used to reduce precancerous changes and improve the cosmetic appearance of chronically sun-damaged skin.  These therapies are often effective in ameliorating superficial skin changes (eg, fine wrinkles, irregular pigmentation, sallowness, roughness, minor laxity) but have a much less pronounced effect on deeper changes (eg, telangiectasias).  Many ingredients are used in over-the-counter cosmetic products without significant evidence that they improve chronic changes of the skin caused by sunlight.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:53:15"}

Achilles tendinitis is very common among running athletes.  The calf muscles attach to the calcaneus via the Achilles tendon.  During running, the calf muscles help with the lift-off phase of gait.  Repetitive forces from running combined with insufficient recovery time can initially cause inflammation in the tendon paratenon (fatty areolar tissue that surrounds the tendon).  A complete tear of the Achilles tendon Tears Achilles tendon tears (ruptures) most often result from ankle dorsiflexion, particularly when the tendon is taut.  Diagnosis is by examination and sometimes MRI. \n【1】 Tendon tears can occur with minimal exertion in people who have taken fluoroquinolone antibiotics.  Symptoms and Signs of Achilles Tendinitis The primary symptom of Achilles tendon inflammation is pain in the back of the heel, which initially increases when exercise is begun and often lessens as exercise continues. \n【2】 Diagnosis of Achilles Tendinitis Clinical evaluation On examination, an inflamed or partially torn Achilles tendon is tender when squeezed between the fingers.  Treatment of Achilles Tendinitis Ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and stretches Modification of activities Sometimes a heel lift Tendon inflammation should initially be treated with ice, gentle calf muscle stretching, and use of NSAIDs.  A heel lift can be placed in the shoes to take tension off the tendon.  Athletes should be instructed to avoid uphill and downhill running until the tendon is not painful and to engage in cross-training aerobic conditioning.  Most clinicians treat complete tears of the Achilles tendon with surgical repair.  However, some recent studies  have shown that nonoperative management (including highly structured rehabilitation activities) gives similar long-term results in strength, range of motion, and ability to do pre-injury activity.  Data are still being evaluated, but a reasonable approach is to do surgical repair for athletes and highly active people and consider nonoperative management as an effective alternative for older and/or less active patients.

Glands make and release hormones.  Hormones stimulate other cells or tissues into action.  The thyroid makes thyroid hormones.  Locating the Thyroid Gland What are thyroid hormones? Thyroid hormones control how fast your body’s chemical functions work (your metabolic rate).  Almost every cell in your body needs thyroid hormones.  Among many other things, thyroid hormones help control: How fast you burn calories How fast your heart beats Your body temperature There are 2 thyroid hormones: T3 T4 Iodine is needed by your thyroid gland in order to make thyroid hormones.  You need only a tiny amount of iodine.  But if your thyroid gland doesn't get iodine, it won't make enough thyroid hormones .  What controls thyroid hormones? The pituitary gland Overview of the Pituitary Gland is a pea-sized bit of tissue at the bottom of your brain.  Glands are organs that make and release hormones into your blood. \n【1】 TSH tells your thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones If your pituitary gland detects too little thyroid hormone in your blood, it puts out more TSH to stimulate your thyroid gland to make more thyroid hormones.  If there's too much thyroid hormone in your blood, your pituitary puts out less TSH.  Then your thyroid gland makes less thyroid hormone.  How do doctors test your thyroid gland? The main tests of your thyroid gland are: Blood tests Imaging tests Blood tests for the thyroid measure the level of: Thyroid hormones TSH A high TSH level usually means you don't have enough thyroid hormones.  And a very low TSH level usually means you have too much.  Imaging tests include: Ultrasound, to tell whether your thyroid is enlarged Nuclear scans In a nuclear scan, doctors give you a tiny amount of radioactive iodine.  Because your thyroid gland needs iodine, it collects the radioactive iodine.  Doctors detect the radioactive iodine with a special camera.

Many bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause pneumonia.  The most common symptom of pneumonia is a cough that produces sputum, but chest pain, chills, fever, and shortness of breath are also common.  Doctors diagnose community-acquired pneumonia by listening to the lungs with a stethoscope and by reading x-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest.  Antibiotics, antiviral drugs, or antifungal drugs are used depending on which organism doctors believe has caused the pneumonia.   Causes of Community-Acquired Pneumonia Many organisms cause community-acquired pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.  In most cases, the specific microorganism causing the pneumonia is not identified.  However, doctors can usually predict which microorganisms are most likely to be causing the pneumonia based on the person’s age and other factors, such as whether the person also has other diseases.  Community-acquired pneumonia can develop in people whose immune systems are normal (also called competent) or in people whose immune systems are impaired (also called immunocompromised people).  However, when doctors use the term community-acquired pneumonia, they are generally referring to people whose immune systems are normal.  Pneumonia in immunocompromised people is discussed separately.  \"Walking pneumonia\" is a nonmedical term used to describe a mild case of community-acquired pneumonia that does not require bedrest or hospitalization.  Some people even feel well enough to go to work and participate in other daily activities.  The cause is often a viral lung infection or a bacterial infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumoniae.  Bacterial causes of pneumonia The most common bacterial causes of community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcal Infections are caused by any one of several species of Streptococcus. \n【1】 There are over 90 types of pneumococci, but most serious disease is caused by only a small number of types.  Pneumococcal pneumonia can be very severe, particularly in young children and older people.  Haemophilus influenzae Infections Haemophilus influenzae are gram-negative bacteria that can cause infection in the respiratory tract, which can spread to other organs. \n【2】 However, childhood infection has become much less common since children have been routinely vaccinated against H.  influenzae.  H.  influenzae pneumonia is more common among adults who have underlying chronic lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders. \n【3】 Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chlamydia and Other Nongonococcal Infections Chlamydial infections include sexually transmitted infections of the urethra, cervix, and rectum that are caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. \n【4】 C.  pneumoniae is commonly responsible for outbreaks of respiratory infection within families, in college dormitories, and in military training camps.  It causes a pneumonia that is rarely severe and infrequently requires hospitalization.  Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia (psittacosis: An Unusual Type of Pneumonia ) is a rare infection caused by a different strain of chlamydia and occurs in people who own or are often exposed to birds.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia and Other Nongonococcal Infections Chlamydial infections include sexually transmitted infections of the urethra, cervix, and rectum that are caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. \n【5】 M.  pneumoniae pneumonia is more common among older children and adults younger than 40, especially those living in crowded environments, such as schools, college dormitories, and military barracks.  Although the illness is rarely severe, symptoms can last for weeks or even months.  Legionella pneumophila Legionella Infections are caused by the gram-negative bacteria Legionella pneumophila and most often affect the lungs, causing pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. \n【6】 It accounts for about 1 to 8% of all pneumonias and about 4% of fatal pneumonias acquired in hospitals.  Legionella bacteria live in water, and outbreaks have occurred primarily in hotels and hospitals when the organism has spread through the air conditioning systems or water supplies, such as showers.  No cases have been identified in which one person directly infected another.  Staphylococcus aureus Infections Staphylococcus aureus is the most dangerous of all of the many common staphylococcal bacteria. \n【7】 This bacteria is known as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), and it can cause severe pneumonia, primarily in young adults.  Since the year 2000, the number of cases of community-acquired pneumonia caused by S.  aureus has increased, but the infection is still uncommon. \n【8】 Viral causes of pneumonia Common viruses that can cause community-acquired pneumonia include SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Coronaviruses and Acute Respiratory Syndromes (MERS and SARS) Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to fatal pneumonia.  There are many different coronaviruses. \n【9】 The virus is spread through kissing. \n【10】 Hantavirus Infection is a viral disease that is spread from rodents to people. \n【11】 Sometimes a bacterial pneumonia can occur after a lung infection caused by a virus.  Fungal causes of pneumonia Fungal causes of community-acquired pneumonia include Histoplasma capsulatum  Coccidioides immitis  Less common fungal causes of pneumonia include Blastomyces dermatitidis  and Paracoccidioides braziliensis .  Pneumocystis jirovecii commonly causes pneumonia in people who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【12】 Pneumonia in people whose immune system is weakened or impaired .  Parasites that cause pneumonia Parasites that cause community-acquired pneumonia in people who live in higher income countries include Toxocara canis or T.  catis  Dirofilaria immitis  Paragonimus westermani  Psittacosis: An Unusual Type of Pneumonia Psittacosis (parrot fever) is a rare pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci, a bacterium present mainly in birds such as parrots, macaws, parakeets, and lovebirds.  It is also present in other birds, such as pigeons, finches, chickens, and turkeys.  Usually, people are infected by inhaling dust from the feathers or the waste of infected birds.  The organism also may be transmitted by a bite from an infected bird and, rarely, from person to person in cough droplets.  Psittacosis mainly occurs in bird fanciers or in people who work in pet shops or on poultry farms.  About 1 to 3 weeks after being infected, a person develops a fever, chills, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  A cough develops, which is initially dry but later brings up greenish sputum (thick or discolored mucus).  Fever persists for 2 to 3 weeks and then slowly subsides.  The disease may be mild or severe, depending on the person’s age and the extent of lung tissue involved.  Blood tests to determine whether the person has a certain type of antibody, suggesting recent infection with Chlamydia psittaci, are the most reliable method for confirming the diagnosis, but doctors usually suspect the infection in people who have a history of exposure to birds.  Bird breeders and owners can protect themselves by avoiding dust from the feathers and cages of sick birds.  Importers are required to treat susceptible birds with a 45-day course of tetracycline, which generally gets rid of the organism.  People with psittacosis are treated with tetracycline taken by mouth for at least 10 days.  Recovery may take a long time, especially in severe cases.  The death rate may reach 30% in people with severe untreated psittacosis, although with appropriate treatment most people recover.  Symptoms of Community-Acquired Pneumonia include A general feeling of weakness (malaise) Cough Shortness of breath Fever Chills Chest pain Cough typically produces sputum (thick or discolored mucus) in older children and adults, but the cough is dry in infants, young children, and older people.  Shortness of breath usually is mild and occurs mainly during activity.  Chest pain is typically worse when breathing in or coughing.  Sometimes people have upper abdominal pain.  Symptoms vary at the extremes of age.  Symptoms of pneumonia in infants and toddlers may include irritability and restlessness.  Older people may be confused or have a decreased level of consciousness.  Older people and young children may be unable to communicate chest pain and shortness of breath.  Fever is common but may not occur in older people.  Diagnosis of Community-Acquired Pneumonia Usually a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest No matter what type of pneumonia is suspected, doctors listen to a person’s chest with a stethoscope to make a diagnosis.  Chest x-rays or CT scans are usually also done to confirm the diagnosis.  Doctors usually do not need to do additional tests to determine what organism is causing the pneumonia, because most organisms are effectively treated by standard treatment and identifying the organism does not make a difference in treatment success.  However, if doctors do need to identify the organism, they usually try to grow or identify parts of the organism from a specimen of sputum, blood, or urine.  Even when such testing is done, the organism is identified less than half the time.  Sometimes the person's symptoms or risk factors may suggest the cause of the pneumonia.  For example, a bird fancier may have psittacosis.  So doctors may ask detailed questions about a person's work, hobbies, or recent travel.  Certain combinations of risk factors and symptoms may suggest Legionella infection.  In people who have first had symptoms typical of influenza Symptoms Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses. \n【13】 However, sometimes influenza and chickenpox cause pneumonia directly.  Prognosis for Community-Acquired Pneumonia Most people with community-acquired pneumonia recover.  However, pneumonia can be fatal, most often in infants and in older people.  The death rate is higher in Legionella infections, possibly because people who develop the disease are less healthy even before they become sick.  Prevention of Community-Acquired Pneumonia Stopping smoking Cessation While often very challenging, quitting smoking is one of the most important things smokers can do for their health. \n【14】 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【15】 Some pneumonias can be prevented by vaccination Vaccines to prevent pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. \n【16】 Unvaccinated people who are at high risk of severe pneumonia and who are in close contact with a person who has influenza can be given the antiviral drugs oseltamivir or zanamivir to prevent influenza.  Treatment of Community-Acquired Pneumonia Antibiotics Sometimes antiviral drugs or antifungal drugs Doctors evaluate many factors to determine whether people can be safely treated at home or whether they should be hospitalized because of high risk of complications.  Some of the factors include the following: Age Whether another disorder, such as cancer or a liver, heart, or lung disorder, is also present Whether there are worrisome findings on physical examination or testing Whether people are able to care for themselves or have someone to help them Antibiotics are started as soon as possible.  Doctors may prescribe antibiotics based on the severity of the infection and the risk of complications .  People are also given fluids, drugs to relieve fever and pain, and oxygen if needed.  Because the causative organism is difficult to identify, doctors choose antibiotics based on the organisms that are most likely to be causing pneumonia and the severity of illness.  With antibiotic treatment, most people with bacterial pneumonia improve.  In people who do not improve, doctors look for an alternative diagnosis, unusual organisms, resistance to the antibiotic used for treatment, infection with a second organism, spread of the infection beyond the lung (for example, into the lining of the lung [pleura]), or some other disorder (such as a problem with the immune system or a blocked (obstructed) airway) that is delaying recovery.  To treat influenza pneumonia, the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, zanamivir, or baloxavir can be given.  To treat chickenpox pneumonia, acyclovir is given.  If a person with a presumed viral pneumonia is very sick or does not improve within a few days after beginning treatment, doctors may prescribe antibiotics in case bacteria have also infected the lung.  To treat fungal pneumonia, antifungal drugs may be given.  Sometimes doctors do follow-up chest x-rays about 6 weeks after treatment to make sure that any abnormal findings on chest x-ray have resolved.  Follow-up may be more important in people who smoke and in older people to ensure that the abnormal findings seen on chest x-ray represent pneumonia only rather than an underlying cancer with pneumonia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 23:02:40"}

Typically, events caused by acute disorders (eg, stroke, seizure) or overwhelming environmental hazards (eg, being struck by a moving object) are not considered falls.  Annually, 30 to 40% of older people living in the community fall; 50% of nursing home residents fall.  In the United States, falls are the leading cause of accidental death and the 7th leading cause of death in people ≥ 65.  In 2018, there were 32,522 fall deaths in people ≥ 65 versus 4,933 in those younger; thus 85% of deaths caused by falls occur in the 13% of the population who are ≥ 65 .  In addition, falls were responsible for over 3 million emergency department visits in older people.  Medical costs for nonfatal fall injuries were about $50 billion in 2018 and will surely increase .  Falls threaten the independence of older people and cause a cascade of individual and socioeconomic consequences.  However, physicians are often unaware of falls in patients who do not present with an injury because a routine history and physical examination typically do not include a specific evaluation for falls.  Many older people are reluctant to report a fall because they attribute falling to the aging process or because they fear being subsequently restricted in their activities or institutionalized.  References 1.  National Safety Council: Older Adult Falls 2.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Costs of Older Adult Falls Etiology of Falls The best predictor of falling is a previous fall.  However, falls in older people rarely have a single cause or risk factor.  A fall is usually caused by a complex interaction among the following: Intrinsic factors (age-related decline in function, disorders, and adverse drug effects) Extrinsic factors (environmental hazards) Situational factors (related to the activity being done, eg, rushing to the bathroom) Intrinsic factors Age-related changes can impair systems involved in maintaining balance and stability (eg, while standing, walking, or sitting) and increase the risk of falls.  Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and dark adaptation decline.  Changes in muscle activation patterns and ability to generate sufficient muscle power and velocity may impair the ability to maintain or recover balance in response to perturbations (eg, stepping onto an uneven surface, being bumped).  In fact, muscle weakness of any type is a major predictor of falls.  Chronic and acute disorders  and use of drugs  are major risk factors for falls.  The risk of falls increases with the number of drugs taken.  Psychoactive drugs are the drugs most commonly reported as increasing the risk of falls and fall-related injuries.  Extrinsic factors Environmental factors can increase the risk of falls independently or, more importantly, by interacting with intrinsic factors.  Risk is highest when the environment requires greater postural control and mobility (eg, when walking on a slippery surface) and when the environment is unfamiliar (eg, when relocated to a new home).  Situational factors Certain activities or decisions may increase the risk of falls and fall-related injuries.  Examples are walking while talking or being distracted by multitasking and then failing to notice an environmental hazard (eg, a curb or step), rushing to the bathroom (especially at night when not fully awake or when lighting may be inadequate), and rushing to answer the telephone.  Complications Falling, particularly falling repeatedly, increases risk of injury, hospitalization, and death, particularly in older people who are frail and have preexisting disease comorbidities (eg, osteoporosis) and deficits in activities of daily living (eg, incontinence).  Longer-term complications can include decreased physical function, fear of falling, and institutionalization.  Falls reportedly contribute to > 40% of nursing home admissions.  Over 50% of falls among older people result in an injury.  Although most injuries are not serious (eg, contusions, abrasions), fall-related injuries account for about 5% of hospitalizations in patients ≥ 65.  About 5% of falls result in fractures of the humerus, wrist, or pelvis.  About 2% of falls result in a hip fracture.  Other serious injuries (eg, head and internal injuries, lacerations) occur in about 10% of falls.  Some fall-related injuries are fatal.  About 5% of older people with hip fractures die while hospitalized.  Overall mortality in the 12 months after a hip fracture ranges from 18 to 33%.  About half of older people who fall cannot get up without help.  Remaining on the floor for > 2 hours after a fall increases risk of dehydration, pressure ulcers, rhabdomyolysis, hypothermia, and pneumonia.  Function and quality of life may deteriorate drastically after a fall; at least 50% of older people who were ambulatory before fracturing a hip do not recover their previous level of mobility.  After falling, older people may fear falling again, so mobility is sometimes reduced because confidence is lost.  Some people may even avoid certain activities (eg, shopping, cleaning) because of this fear.  Decreased activity can increase joint stiffness and weakness, further reducing mobility.   Evaluation of Falls Clinical evaluation Performance testing Sometimes laboratory testing After treatment of acute injuries, assessment aims to identify risk factors and appropriate interventions, thus decreasing the risk of future falls and fall-related injuries .  Some falls are promptly recognized because of an obvious fall-related injury or concern about a possible injury.  However, because older people often do not report falls, they should be asked about falls or mobility problems at least once per year.  Patients who report a single fall should be evaluated for a balance or gait problem using the basic Get-Up-and-Go Test.  For the test, patients are observed as they rise from a standard armchair, walk 3 meters (about 10 feet) in a straight line, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit back down.  Observation may detect lower-extremity weakness, imbalance while standing or sitting, or an unsteady gait.  Sometimes the test is timed.  A time of > 12 seconds indicates a significantly increased risk of falls.  Patients who require a more complete assessment of risk factors for falls include Those who have difficulty during the Get-Up-and-Go Test Those who report multiple falls during screening Those who are being evaluated after a recent fall (after acute injuries are identified and treated) History and physical examination When a more complete assessment of fall risk factors is needed, the focus is on identifying intrinsic, extrinsic, and situational factors that can be reduced by interventions targeted at them.  Patients are asked open-ended questions about the most recent fall or falls, followed by more specific questions about when and where a fall occurred and what they were doing.  Witnesses are asked the same questions.  Patients should be asked whether they had premonitory or associated symptoms (eg, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, vertigo, light-headedness) and whether consciousness was lost.  Patients should also be asked whether any obvious extrinsic or situational factors may have been involved.  The history should include questions about past and present medical problems, use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and use of alcohol.  Because eliminating all risk of future falls may be impossible, patients should be asked whether they were able to get back up without help after falling and whether any injuries occurred; the goal is reducing the risk of complications due to future falls.  The physical examination should be comprehensive enough to exclude obvious intrinsic causes of falls.  If the fall occurred recently, temperature should be measured to determine whether fever was a factor.  Heart rate and rhythm should be assessed to identify obvious bradycardia, resting tachycardia, or irregular rhythms.  Blood pressure should be measured with patients supine and after patients stand for 1 and 3 minutes to rule out orthostatic hypotension.  Auscultation can detect many types of valvular heart disorders.  Visual acuity should be evaluated with patients wearing their usual corrective lenses if needed.  Abnormalities in visual acuity should trigger a more detailed visual examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.  The neck, spine, and extremities (especially the legs and feet) should be evaluated for weakness, deformities, pain, and limitation in range of motion.  A neurologic examination Introduction to the Neurologic Examination begins with careful observation of the patient entering the examination area and continues during history taking. \n【1】 Basic postural control and the proprioceptive and vestibular systems are evaluated using the Romberg test (in which patients stand with feet together and eyes both open and closed).  Tests to establish high-level balance function include the one-legged stance and tandem gait.  If patients can stand on one leg for 10 seconds with their eyes open and have an accurate 3-meter (10-feet) tandem gait, any intrinsic postural control deficit is likely to be minimal.  Physicians should evaluate positional vestibular function  and mental status How to Assess Mental Status The patient’s attention span is assessed first; an inattentive patient cannot cooperate fully and hinders testing. \n【2】 Performance tests The Performance-Oriented Assessment of Mobility or the Timed Get-Up-and-Go test can identify problems with balance and stability during walking and other movements that may indicate increased risk of falls.  These tests are especially helpful if the patient had difficulty doing the basic Get-Up-and-Go test.  The Performance-Oriented Assessment of Mobility test includes quantitative scoring of various aspects of balance and gait and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to do.  Low scores predict increased risk of falls .  Laboratory tests There is no standard diagnostic evaluation to determine the exact cause of a fall.  Testing should be based on the history and examination and helps rule out various causes: A complete blood count (CBC) for anemia or leukocytosis Blood glucose measurement for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia Electrolyte measurement for dehydration Tests such as electrocardiography (ECG), ambulatory cardiac monitoring, and echocardiography are recommended only when a cardiac cause is suspected.  Carotid massage under controlled conditions (IV access and cardiac monitoring) has been proposed to determine carotid hypersensitivity and ultimately who might respond to pacemaker treatment.  Spinal x-rays and cranial computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are indicated only when the history and physical examination detect new neurologic abnormalities.  Evaluation reference 1.  U. S.  Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF): Final Recommendation Statement: Falls Prevention in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Interventions.  Prevention of Falls The focus should be on preventing or reducing the number of future falls and fall-related injuries and complications while maintaining as much of the patient’s function and independence as possible.  In the periodic physical or wellness examination, patients should be asked about falls in the past year and difficulty with balance or ambulation .  Patients who report a single fall and who do not have problems with balance or gait on the Get-Up-and-Go Test or a similar test should be given general information about reducing risk of falls.  It should include how to use drugs safely and reduce environmental hazards .  Patients who report more than one fall or a problem with balance or gait should receive a fall evaluation A fall is defined as a person coming to rest on the ground or another lower level; sometimes a body part strikes against an object that breaks the fall. \n【3】  Physical therapy and exercise Patients who have fallen more than once or who have problems during initial balance and gait testing should be referred to physical therapy or an exercise program.  Physical therapy and exercise programs can be done in the home if patients have limited mobility.  Physical therapists customize exercise programs to improve balance and gait and to correct specific problems contributing to fall risk.  More general exercise programs in health care or community settings can also improve balance and gait.  For example, tai chi may be effective and can be done alone or in groups.  The most effective exercise programs to reduce fall risk are those that Are tailored to the patient’s deficit Are provided by a trained professional Have a sufficient balance challenge component Are provided over the long term (eg, ≥ 4 months) Many senior citizen centers, YMCAs, or other health clubs offer free or low-cost group exercise classes tailored to senior citizens, and these classes can help with accessibility and adherence.  The savings from decreased fall-related expenses exceed the costs of these programs .  Assistive devices Some patients benefit from use of an assistive device Therapeutic and Assistive Devices Orthoses provide support for damaged joints, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and bones.  Most are customized to a patient’s needs and anatomy. \n【4】 Canes may be adequate for patients with minimal unilateral muscle or joint impairment, but walkers, especially wheeled walkers, are more appropriate for patients with increased risk of falls attributable to bilateral leg weakness or impaired coordination (wheeled walkers can be dangerous for patients who cannot control them properly).  Physical therapists can help fit or size the devices and teach patients how to use them.  Medical management Drugs that can increase the risk of falls should be stopped, or the dosage should be adjusted to the lowest effective dose .  Patients should be evaluated for osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure. \n【5】 If any other specific disorder is identified as a risk factor, targeted interventions are required.  For example, drugs and physical therapy may reduce risk for patients with Parkinson disease.  Pain management, physical therapy, and sometimes joint replacement surgery may reduce risk for patients with arthritis.  A change to appropriate lenses (single lenses rather than bifocals or trifocals) or surgery, particularly for removal of cataracts, may help patients with visual impairment.  A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that the use of supplementary vitamin D can significantly reduce the incidence of falls .  Environmental management Correcting environmental hazards in the home may reduce the risk of falls .  Patients should also be advised on how to reduce risk due to situational factors.  For example, footwear should have flat heels, some ankle support, and firm, nonskid midsoles.  Many patients with chronic limited mobility (eg, caused by severe arthritis or paresis) benefit from combined medical, rehabilitative, and environmental strategies.  Wheelchair adaptations (eg, removable foot plates to reduce tripping during transfers, antitip bars to prevent backward tipping), removable belts, and wedge seating may prevent falls in patients with poor sitting balance or severe weakness when they are sitting or transferring.  Restraints may lead to more falls and other complications and should generally not be used.  Surveillance by a caregiver is more effective and safer.  Motion detectors may be used, but a caregiver must be present to respond promptly to the triggered alarm.  Hip protectors (padding sewn into special undergarments) have been shown to reduce hip fractures in high-risk patients in nursing facilities, but are less effective in older people living in the community.  Furthermore, many patients are reluctant to wear protectors indefinitely.  Compliant flooring (eg, firm rubber) can help dissipate the impact force, but a floor that is too compliant (eg, soft foam) may destabilize patients.  Patients should also be taught what to do if they fall and cannot get up.  Useful techniques include turning from the supine position to the prone position, getting on all fours, crawling to a strong support surface, and pulling up.  Having frequent contact with family members or friends, a phone that can be reached from the floor, a remote alarm, or a wearable emergency response system device can decrease the likelihood of lying on the floor for a long time after a fall.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 01:06:05"}

Based on several studies, the epidemiology, virology, transmission, and symptoms and signs of COVID-19 in pregnant women are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.  Early results showed no increased risk compared with nonpregnant patients .  However, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other publications indicate an increased risk of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death in pregnant patients with symptomatic COVID-19, particularly in those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease .  Risk of obstetric complications (eg, preterm labor, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery) may be increased, at least in patients with moderate and severe infection (usually including pneumonia), but whether this risk is increased is not yet confirmed.  Also, whether any such risk differs from the risk conferred by other respiratory virus infections is unknown.  Risk of prenatal vertical transmission appears to be absent or low, possibly near 1% . \n【1】 Diagnosis of COVID-19 During Pregnancy Similar to that for nonpregnant patients Diagnosis of COVID-19 is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients.  Chest x-ray and/or CT, if otherwise indicated, should be done because the fetal radiation doses are low.  The Society for Fetal-Maternal Medicine (SMFM) and the American College of Gynecology (ACOG] have a suggested algorithm for triage and evaluation of pregnant women with possible COVID-19 .  Recommendations in this algorithm are similar to those for evaluation of nonpregnant patients. \n【2】 Acetaminophen is recommended for treatment of fever and mild to moderate pain.  Oxygen saturation should probably be kept > 95% or a PaO2 of > 70 mm Hg.  Prevention of COVID-19 During Pregnancy All pregnant women should be advised to follow the CDC guidelines for preventing COVID-19 and to take precautions to minimize their exposure, including staying at home as much as possible, regular handwashing, and social distancing.  These precautions are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.  All health care workers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).  To decrease exposure to pregnant women, health care practitioners should contact their pregnant patients about consolidating prenatal visits and ultrasound appointments, although consensus about how to schedule such appointments has not yet been determined.  Blood pressure, blood glucose, and fetal monitoring tracings can sometimes be transmitted electronically, and some appointments may be done through telephone or video conferencing.  Separating mother and infant after delivery should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Ending separation may need to wait until risk of transmission to the infant has been thoroughly evaluated.  Evaluation should usually include laboratory testing.  Risk of transmitting the virus in breast milk is low or absent.  If the woman chooses to breastfeed continually despite being separated from her infant, she should express milk to be transported and fed to the infant by a caregiver who is not infected unless COVID-19 has been ruled out in her.  When expressing breast milk, a woman should be advised to practice good hand hygiene (eg, washing her hands before touching the breast pump and bottle parts and before expressing breast milk).  A dedicated breast pump should be used if possible; it and all pump parts that contact the breast or breast milk should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after use.  The pumping area (eg, dials, power switch, counter top) should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes.  If the woman chooses to breastfeed directly, she should wear a face mask and wash her hands before each feeding.  COVID-19 vaccine The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n【3】 Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing.  These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.   Key Points Manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients.  Risk of obstetric complications may be increased, but whether risk is increased is not yet known.  Vertical transmission and transmission in breast milk are unlikely.  Consider separating possibly infected mothers from infants until transmission risks can be thoroughly evaluated.  Consolidate prenatal visits and testing to minimize maternal exposure.

Amphetamines increase alertness, enhance physical performance, and produce euphoria and a sense of well-being.  Amphetamines suppress appetite and some people misuse amphetamines to lose weight.  An overdose can cause extreme agitation, delirium, and a life-threatening high body temperature, heart attack Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. \n【1】 Urine tests can detect most amphetamines.  For an overdose, treatment involves sedatives, blood pressure–lowering medications, and sometimes cooling treatments.   Amphetamines include the drug amphetamine and its many variants such as methamphetamine (speed or crystal meth) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy, or Adam).  Methamphetamine is the most commonly used amphetamine in the United States.  Use of MDMA Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is similar to an amphetamine but has both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. \n【2】 Amphetamines are usually taken by mouth but can be snorted, smoked, or injected. \n【3】 Obesity is influenced by a combination of factors, which usually results in consuming more calories than the body needs. \n【4】 Some amphetamines are not approved for medical use and are manufactured and used illegally. \n【5】 Others use them during high-energy activities.  Amphetamines cause more dopamine to be released in the brain.  (Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a substance that helps nerve cells communicate. ) This effect is the likely cause of mood elevation.  MDMA Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is similar to an amphetamine but has both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. \n【6】 Amphetamine users frequently develop dependence, often referred to as a substance use disorder Substance Use Disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use. \n【7】 gh doses of amphetamines may raise body temperature to dangerous levels.  Symptoms of Amphetamine Use Amphetamines use causes both immediate and long-term symptoms.  Immediate effects The following are some immediate effects of amphetamine use: Increased alertness Reduced fatigue Heightened concentration Decreased appetite Enhanced physical performance Amphetamines may produce a feeling of well-being, euphoria, and loss of inhibitions.  Also, people sweat profusely, and their pupils are dilated.  Binge usage (perhaps over several days) eventually causes extreme exhaustion and a need for sleep.  Overdose High doses (overdose) increase blood pressure and heart rate.  These increases may be life threatening.  People may become extremely paranoid, violent, and out of control.  People may become delirious.  Heart attacks Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. \n【8】 Other effects include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and a life-threatening high body temperature .  Long-term effects People who habitually use amphetamines rapidly develop tolerance as part of dependence.  They need to use more and more to get the same effect.  The amount ultimately used may be more than several times the original dose.  Most people using very high doses over several days or weeks become confused and psychotic because amphetamines can cause severe anxiety, paranoia, and a distorted sense of reality.  Psychotic reactions include hearing and seeing things that are not there (auditory and visual hallucinations) and false beliefs (delusions), such as a feeling of having unlimited power (omnipotence) or of being persecuted (paranoia).  Memory may be affected.  Confusion, memory loss, and delusions may last for months.  Although these effects can occur in any user, people with a mental health disorder, such as schizophrenia and Related Disorders , are more vulnerable to them.  Methamphetamine users have a high rate of teeth grinding (bruxism) and severe tooth decay affecting numerous teeth.  The causes include decreased salivation, corrosive substances in the smoke, and poor oral hygiene—called \"meth mouth. \" Withdrawal symptoms When an amphetamine is suddenly stopped, symptoms vary.  People dependent on amphetamines become tired or sleepy—an effect that may last for 2 or 3 days after stopping the drug.  As a result, they are more likely to be injured.  Some people are extremely anxious and restless, and some, especially those with a tendency toward depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【9】 They may become suicidal but may lack the energy to attempt suicide for several days.  Diagnosis of Amphetamine Use A doctor's evaluation A history of amphetamine use Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms in people known to have taken amphetamines.  If the diagnosis is unclear, urine tests may be done, but the test may not detect methamphetamine and methylphenidate (a stimulant drug related to amphetamines).  Other tests, such as electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded. \n【10】 Treatment of Amphetamine Use After an overdose, treatment may include Observation and monitoring until the person is sober Sedatives Blood pressure–lowering medications Cooling for hyperthermia (dangerously high body temperature) Treatment for depression and suicidal tendencies during withdrawal period Cognitive-behavioral therapy to prevent relapse Benzodiazepines (a group of sedative medications), such as lorazepam, are given intravenously to people with severe symptoms such as high blood pressure, extreme agitation, or seizures.  Medications for high blood pressure, such as labetalol or hydralazine, are given intravenously if blood pressure remains high.  Cooling treatments, such as wetting and blowing air over the person's skin or using special cooling blankets, may be needed for hyperthermia Serotonin Syndrome is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction that tends to cause high body temperature, muscle spasms, and anxiety or delirium. \n【11】 During drug withdrawal, long-term users may need to be hospitalized so that they can be observed for suicidal behavior.  Antidepressants Drug Treatment for Depression Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes. \n【12】 Otherwise, no treatment is generally needed for people experiencing withdrawal.

It causes typical symptoms of viral hepatitis, including anorexia, malaise, and jaundice.  A summary of changes to the 2022 adult immunization schedule is available here.   Preparations of Hepatitis B Vaccine Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine is produced using recombinant DNA technology.  A plasmid containing the gene for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is inserted into common baker’s yeast, which then produces HBsAg.  The HBsAg is harvested and purified.  This vaccine cannot cause hepatitis B virus infection because no potentially infectious viral DNA or complete viral particles are produced during this process.  Several vaccines are available.  Two single-antigen vaccines, Engerix-B and Recombivax HB, are conjugated with aluminum.  A newer formulation, HepB-CpG, uses the immune-stimulating adjuvant, cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN).  A combination formulation that combines hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines (Twinrix) is available.  Indications for Hepatitis B Vaccine HepB vaccine is a routine childhood vaccination .  HepB vaccine also is indicated for all adults aged 19 through 59 years who have not been previously vaccinated.  HepB vaccine also is indicated for adults aged 60 years and older who have not been previously vaccinated and who have any of the following: A desire for protection from hepatitis B A sexually active lifestyle in people who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (eg, > 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months) Need for evaluation or treatment of a sexually transmitted infection Current or recent use of illicit injection drugs Sex between men Employment in which workers may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids (eg, health care, custodial, or public safety workers) Diabetes in people < 60 years (as soon as feasible after diagnosis) and sometimes in those ≥ 60 years (based on shared clinical decision-making between clinician and patient regarding the risk of becoming infected, having severe consequences if infected, and having an adequate immune response to vaccination) End-stage renal disease (eg, being treated with hemodialysis) HIV infection A chronic liver disorder (eg, people with hepatitis C, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level greater than twice the upper limit of normal) Household contact and/or sexual contact with people who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Travel to endemic areas Time spent (as patients, residents, or employees) in correctional facilities or in facilities that provide sexually transmitted infection treatment, HIV testing and treatment, drug abuse treatment and prevention services, services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men, or care for patients with developmental disabilities or with end-stage renal disease (including those receiving long-term hemodialysis) The combination HepA and HepB vaccine can be used in people ≥ 18 years who have indications for either hepatitis A or hepatitis B vaccine and who have not been previously vaccinated with one of the vaccine components.  Contraindications and Precautions of Hepatitis B Vaccine The main contraindication for HepB vaccine is A severe allergic reaction  after previous dose or to baker's yeast or any vaccine component The main precaution with HepB vaccine is Moderate or severe illness with or without a fever (vaccination is postponed until the illness resolves) Dose and Administration of Hepatitis B Vaccine The dose for Engerix-B and Recombivax HB is 0. 5 mL IM up to age 20 years or 1 mL IM for adults (≥ 20 years).  The dose for HepB-CpG is 0. 5 mL IM for adults ≥ 18 years.  The vaccine is typically given to children in a 3-dose series at age 0 months, at 1 to 2 months, and at 6 to 18 months.  Infants who did not receive a dose a birth should begin the series as soon as feasible.  All children not previously vaccinated with HepB vaccine should be vaccinated at age 11 or 12 years.  A 3-dose schedule is used; the first and second doses are separated by ≥ 4 weeks, and the third dose is given 4 to 6 months after the second dose.  However, a 2-dose schedule using Recombivax HB can be used; the second dose is given 4 to 6 months after the first.  Adults age 19 through 59 years who have not been previously vaccinated should complete a 2- or 3-, or 4-dose series.  The usual schedule for adults using Engerix-B or Recombivax HB is a 3-dose series with 2 doses separated by ≥ 4 weeks, and a third dose 4 to 6 months after the second dose.  HepB-CpG is given in 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and can be given as a substitute in a 3-dose series with a different HepB vaccine.  HepB-CpG should not be given during pregnancy because safety data are not available on its use during pregnancy.  Unvaccinated adults who are being treated with hemodialysis or who are immunocompromised should be given 2 doses of Engerix-B 20 mcg/mL given simultaneously in a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.  If people are not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated, the missing doses should be given to complete the 3-dose HepB series.  The second dose is given 1 month after the first dose; the third dose is given ≥ 2 months after the second dose (and ≥ 4 months after the first dose).  If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is used, 3 doses are given at 0, 1, and 6 months, or 4 doses are given on days 0, 7, and 21 to 30, followed by a booster dose at 12 months.  If a person was lost to follow-up before the series was completed, the series does not need to be restarted.  Adverse Effects of Hepatitis B Vaccine Serious adverse effects are very rare and include anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen. \n【1】 Mild effects include pain at the injection site and occasionally an increase in temperature to about 38° C.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:27:27"}

Although this organism may infect the urethra in women, the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are more likely to be infected. \n【2】 Urethritis may also be caused by the bacteria that commonly cause other urinary tract infections, such as Escherichia coli Infections Escherichia coli ,E. \n【3】 Symptoms of Urethritis In both men and women, there is usually pain during urination and a frequent, urgent need to urinate.  Sometimes people have no symptoms. \n【4】 The discharge is often yellowish green and thick when the gonococcal organism is involved and may be clear and thinner when other organisms are involved.  In women, discharge is less common.  Other disorders that cause pain during urination include bladder infection Cystitis is infection of the bladder.  Usually, bacteria are the cause of cystitis.  A frequent need to urinate and pain or burning while urinating are the most common symptoms. \n【5】 Complications of Urethritis Infections of the urethra that are not treated or are inadequately treated may cause a narrowing (stricture) of the urethra.  Urethral Stricture A urethral stricture is scarring that narrows the urethra. \n【6】 An abscess can cause outpouchings from the urethral wall (urethral diverticula), which can also become infected.  If the abscess perforates the skin, the vagina, or the rectum, urine may flow through a newly created abnormal connection (urethral fistula).  Diagnosis of Urethritis Urinalysis Sometimes urethral swab Sometimes urine culture Doctors can usually make a diagnosis of urethritis based on the symptoms and examination.  A sample of the discharge, if present, is collected by inserting a soft-tipped swab into the end of the urethra.  The urethral swab is then sent to a laboratory for analysis so that the infecting organism can be identified. \n【7】 Treatment depends on the cause of the infection.  However, identification of the organism causing urethritis can take days.  Thus, doctors usually begin treatment with antibiotics that cure the most common causes.  For sexually active men, treatment is usually with a ceftriaxone injection for gonorrhea plus oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline for chlamydia.  If tests exclude the possibility of gonorrhea and chlamydia, then the man should be tested for other disorders, such as trichomoniasis.  Women may be treated as if they had cystitis.  Bladder Infection Cystitis is infection of the bladder. \n【8】 If the cause is suspected to be an STI, the person's sex partners should be evaluated for treatment.  Men who receive a diagnosis of urethritis should be tested for HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【9】 Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.

Beta-thalassemia Thalassemias are a group of inherited microcytic, hemolytic anemias characterized by defective hemoglobin synthesis. \n【2】 Beta globin mutations may result in partial loss (beta + allele) or complete loss (beta 0 allele) of beta globin function.  Thus, manifestations of S-beta-thalassemia depend on whether the patient has a beta + or beta 0 allele.  Those with beta + produce varying amounts of beta globin (and thus have varying amounts of Hb A).  Those with beta 0 produce no beta globin and thus have no Hb A.  Clinically, manifestations depend on the amount of Hb A.  Thus, Hb-S-beta 0 thalassemia manifests similarly to sickle cell disease (Hb SS), whereas Hb S–beta+ thalassemia causes symptoms of moderate anemia and some signs of sickle cell disease Symptoms and Signs Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry. \n【3】 Mild to moderate microcytic anemia is usually present along with some sickled red blood cells on stained blood smears.

Symptoms may be absent but often are constitutional or reflect biliary obstruction.  Diagnosis is based on ultrasonography plus CT cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.  Prognosis is grim.  Mechanical bile drainage can often relieve pruritus, recurrent sepsis, and pain due to biliary obstruction.   Cholangiocarcinomas and other bile duct tumors are rare (1 to 2/100,000 people) but are usually malignant.  Cholangiocarcinomas occur predominantly in the extrahepatic bile ducts: 60 to 70% in the perihilar region (Klatskin tumors), about 25% in the distal ducts, and the rest in the liver.  Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is patchy inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of the bile ducts that has no known cause. \n【1】 Gallbladder carcinoma is uncommon (2. 5/100,000).  It is more common among American Indians, patients with large gallstones (> 3 cm), and those with extensive gallbladder calcification due to chronic cholecystitis is long-standing gallbladder inflammation almost always due to gallstones. \n【2】 Nearly all (70 to 90%) patients also have gallstones Cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder.  In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones. \n【3】 Median survival is 3 months.  Cure is possible when cancer is found early (eg, incidentally at cholecystectomy).  Gallbladder polyps are usually asymptomatic benign mucosal projections that develop in the lumen of the gallbladder.  Most are < 10 mm in diameter and composed of cholesterol ester and triglycerides; the presence of such polyps is called cholesterolosis.  They are found in about 5% of people during ultrasonography.  Other, much less common benign polyps include adenomas (causing adenomyomatosis) and inflammatory polyps.  Small gallbladder polyps are incidental findings that do not require treatment.  However, for polyps > 10 mm in diameter, surgery should be considered.  Symptoms and Signs of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Tumors Most patients with cholangiocarcinomas present with pruritus and painless obstructive jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia. \n【4】 Early perihilar tumors may cause only vague abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss.  Other features include fatigue, acholic stool, a palpable mass, hepatomegaly, or a distended gallbladder (Courvoisier sign, with distal cholangiocarcinoma).  Pain may resemble that of biliary colic (reflecting biliary obstruction) or may be constant and progressive.  Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【5】 Manifestations of gallbladder carcinoma may range from incidental findings at cholecystectomy done to relieve biliary pain to cholelithiasis to advanced disease with constant pain, weight loss, and an abdominal mass or obstructive jaundice.  Most gallbladder polyps cause no symptoms.  Diagnosis of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Tumors Ultrasonography (sometimes endoscopic), followed by CT cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (MRCP) Sometimes endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Cholangiocarcinomas and gallbladder carcinomas are suspected when extrahepatic biliary obstruction is unexplained.  Laboratory test results reflect the degree of cholestasis.  In patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is patchy inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of the bile ducts that has no known cause. \n【6】 Diagnosis is based on ultrasonography (or endoscopic ultrasonography), typically followed by MRCP .  CT is sometimes done and may provide more information than ultrasonography, particularly for gallbladder carcinomas.  When these methods are inconclusive or if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected, ERCP Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Imaging is essential for accurately diagnosing biliary tract disorders and is important for detecting focal liver lesions (eg, abscess, tumor). \n【7】 ERCP not only detects the tumor but also, with brushings, can provide a tissue diagnosis, sometimes making ultrasonography- or CT-guided needle biopsy unnecessary.  Contrast-enhanced CT assists in staging.  Open laparotomy is necessary to determine disease extent, which guides treatment.  Treatment of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Tumors For cholangiocarcinomas, stenting (or another bypass procedure) or occasionally resection For gallbladder carcinoma, usually symptomatic treatment For cholangiocarcinoma, stenting or surgically bypassing the obstruction relieves pruritus, jaundice, and perhaps fatigue.  Hilar cholangiocarcinomas with CT evidence of spread are stented via percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) Imaging is essential for accurately diagnosing biliary tract disorders and is important for detecting focal liver lesions (eg, abscess, tumor). \n【8】 Distal duct cholangiocarcinomas are stented endoscopically with ERCP.  If cholangiocarcinoma appears localized, surgical exploration determines resectability by hilar resection or pancreaticoduodenectomy.  Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation. \n【9】 Many gallbladder carcinomas are treated symptomatically.  Key Points Biliary tract cancer (usually cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma) is uncommon.  Suspect cancer if patients have an unexplained extrahepatic biliary obstruction or abdominal mass.  Diagnose cancers by imaging, beginning with ultrasonography, followed by MRCP.  Treat cancers symptomatically (eg, by stenting or bypassing obstructions in cholangiocarcinoma); occasionally, resection is warranted.

Fatigue is normal after physical exertion, prolonged stress, and sleep deprivation.  Fatigue occurs most often as part of a symptom complex, but even when it is the sole or main presenting symptom, fatigue is one of the most common symptoms.  Patients may refer to certain other symptoms as fatigue; differentiating between them and fatigue is usually, but not always, possible with detailed questioning.  Weakness is one of the most common reasons patients present to primary care clinicians. \n【1】 Disorders such as myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors. \n【2】 Dyspnea is unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing.  It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause. \n【3】 Respiratory symptoms usually can be elicited upon careful questioning or develop subsequently.  Somnolence, a symptom of disorders causing sleep deprivation ,eg, allergic rhinitis is seasonal or perennial itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sometimes conjunctivitis, caused by exposure to pollens or other allergens. \n【4】 Yawning and lapsing into sleep during daytime hours are common.  Patients can usually tell the difference between somnolence and fatigue.  However, deprivation of deep nonrapid eye movement sleep can cause muscle aches and fatigue, and many patients with fatigue have disturbed sleep, so differentiating between fatigue and somnolence may be difficult. \n【5】 There are now 2 other terms for chronic fatigue syndrome—myalgic encephalomyelitis and systemic exertion intolerance—although there is no clear delineation between these at this time. \n【6】 Etiology of Fatigue Most serious (and many minor) acute and chronic illnesses produce fatigue.  However, many of these have other more prominent manifestations (eg, pain, cough, fever, jaundice) as the presenting complaint.  This discussion focuses on disorders that can manifest primarily as fatigue.  The most common disorders manifesting predominantly as recent fatigue (lasting < 1 month) are Drug adverse effects Adverse Drug Reactions Adverse drug reaction (ADR, or adverse drug effect) is a broad term referring to unwanted, uncomfortable, or dangerous effects that a drug may have. \n【7】 Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.  Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. \n【8】  Evaluation of Fatigue can be highly subjective.  Patients vary in what they consider to be fatigue and how they describe it.  There are also few ways to objectively confirm fatigue or tell how severe it is.  History and physical examination focus on identifying subtle manifestations of underlying illness (particularly infections, endocrine and rheumatologic disorders, anemia, and depression) that can be used to guide testing.  History of present illness includes open-ended questions about what \"fatigue\" is, listening for descriptions that could suggest dyspnea on exertion, somnolence, or muscle weakness.  The relationships between fatigue, activity, rest, and sleep should be elicited, as should the onset, time course and pattern, and factors that increase or decrease fatigue.  Review of systems should be thorough because potential causes of fatigue are so numerous and diverse.  Among important nonspecific symptoms are fever, weight loss, and night sweats (possibly suggesting cancer, a rheumatologic disorder, or an infection).  Menstrual history is obtained in women of child-bearing age.  Unless a cause is evident, patients should be asked questions from screening questionnaires for psychologic disorders (eg, depression, anxiety, drug use disorder, somatoform disorders, domestic violence).  Past medical history should address known disorders.  Complete drug use history should include prescription, over-the-counter, and recreational drugs.  Social history should elicit descriptions of diet, drug use, and the effect of fatigue on quality of life, employment, and social and family relationships.  Physical examination Vital signs are checked for fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.  General examination should be particularly comprehensive, including general appearance and examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, head and neck, breasts, rectum (including prostate exam and testing for occult blood), genitals, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, joints, and skin.  Neurologic examination should include testing of, at a minimum, mental status, cranial nerves, mood, affect, strength, muscle bulk and tone, reflexes, and gait.  Usually if fatigue is of recent onset, a more focused examination will reveal the cause.  If fatigue is chronic, examination is unlikely to reveal a cause; however, thorough physical examination is an important way to build rapport with the patient and occasionally is diagnostically helpful.  Red flags Chronic weight loss Chronic fever or night sweats Generalized lymphadenopathy Muscle weakness or pain Serious nonfatigue symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, hematemesis, severe dyspnea, ascites, confusion, suicidal ideation) Involvement of > 1 organ system (eg, rash plus arthritis) New or different headache or loss of vision, particularly with muscle pains, in an older adult Interpretation of findings In general, a cause is more likely to be found when fatigue is one of many symptoms than when fatigue is the sole symptom.  Fatigue that worsens with activity and lessens with rest suggests a physical disorder.  Fatigue that is present constantly and does not lessen with rest, particularly with occasional bursts of energy, may indicate a psychologic disorder.  In the absence of red flag findings, a thorough history, physical examination, and routine laboratory testing (plus tests directed at specific findings—see ) should suffice for an initial evaluation.  If test results are negative, watchful waiting is usually appropriate; if fatigue worsens or other symptoms and signs develop, the patient is reevaluated.  Several causes can be considered for patients with prolonged or chronic fatigue and selected other common or specific clinical findings.   Testing is directed at causes suspected based on clinical findings.  If no cause is evident or suspected based on clinical findings, laboratory testing is unlikely to reveal a cause.  Still, many clinicians recommend testing with the following: Complete blood count (CBC) Ferritin Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Chemistries, including electrolytes, glucose, calcium, and renal and liver tests Creatine kinase (CK) is recommended if muscle pain or weakness is present.  HIV testing and testing for tuberculosis with purified protein derivative (PPD) placement or interferon-gamma release assays Diagnosis Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【9】 Chest x-ray is recommended if cough in Adults Cough is an explosive expiratory maneuver that is reflexively or deliberately intended to clear the airways.  It is one of the most common symptoms prompting physician visits. \n【10】 Other testing, such as for infections or immunologic deficiencies, is not recommended unless there are suggestive clinical findings. \n【11】 Treatment of Fatigue Treatment to lessen fatigue is directed at the cause. \n【12】 They should be told clearly that the etiology is presently unknown.  Treatment is more often successful if the practitioner is patient and nonjudgmental and acknowledges the real effects of fatigue.  Potential treatments include physical therapy (eg, graded exercise therapy) and psychologic support (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy).  Focusing on improving sleep and relieving pain may also help.  Goals include returning to work and maintaining normal activity levels.  Geriatrics Essentials: Fatigue is more often the first symptom of a disorder in older patients.  For example, the first symptom of pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection.  Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findings. \n【13】 The first symptom of other disorders, such as giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteries. \n【14】 Because serious illness may become apparent soon after sudden fatigue in older patients, the cause should be determined as quickly as possible.  Fatigue is also somewhat more likely to be caused by giant cell arteritis or another serious physical disorder in older adults.  Key Points Fatigue is a common symptom.  Fatigue caused primarily by a physical disorder usually increases with activity and lessens with rest.  Laboratory testing is low yield in the absence of suggestive clinical findings.  Successful treatment is more likely if the practitioner is patient and understanding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 21:33:59"}

Your heart rate is how fast your heart beats.  Your heart should always have a regular, rhythmic beat, like the ticking of a clock.  Your heart has four chambers.  The atria are the two upper chambers in your heart.  The ventricles are the two lower chambers in your heart.  The atria pump blood into the ventricles.  The ventricles pump blood to your lungs and your body .  Special pacemaker cells in a part of the atria called the SA node (sinoatrial node) send out regular electrical signals to your heart muscle to make it contract.  Your heart's conduction system has tiny strips of tissue sort of like electrical wires.  The conduction system carries the pacemaker signals to the rest of your heart.  The signals must get to all your heart muscle cells at just the right time so your heart gives a good, strong beat that pumps blood properly.  What is ventricular tachycardia? Ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood through your body. \n【1】 In ventricular tachycardia, a very fast heartbeat starts in the ventricles of your heart.  The most common symptom is palpitations are the awareness of heartbeats.  The sensation may feel like pounding, fluttering, racing, or skipping beats. \n【2】 It's quick, painless, and harmless.  The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram. \n【3】 Sustained ventricular tachycardia is when the abnormal rhythm lasts more than 30 seconds.  Sustained ventricular tachycardia can go on for a long time.  What causes ventricular tachycardia? Ventricular tachycardia happens when some of the cells in your ventricle start acting like pacemaker cells.  If they go faster than your normal pacemaker cells, they can take over your heart and make it beat very fast.  Sustained ventricular tachycardia usually happens in older people with heart problems, such as a: Heart attack A heart attack is when blood flow to part of your heart is suddenly blocked and some of your heart muscle dies.  Doctors use the term myocardial infarction to refer to a heart attack. \n【4】 \"Myopathy\" refers to muscle that's not normal.  Cardiomyopathy is a heart disease that directly affects the heart muscle. \n【5】 Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia include: Palpitations Feeling weak and light headed Chest discomfort What are the complications of ventricular tachycardia? Sustained ventricular tachycardia can cause more dangerous problems, such as: Low blood pressure and sometimes fainting because your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should Cardiac arrest and CPR Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops pumping blood and oxygen to the brain and other organs and tissues. \n【6】 Doctors feel your pulse and do: An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. \n【7】 If the ECG shows ventricular tachycardia, doctors usually do: Blood tests to check for abnormal electrolyte levels and signs of heart damage How do doctors treat ventricular tachycardia? Doctors only need to treat ventricular tachycardia if: You have symptoms You have sustained ventricular tachycardia Right away, doctors treat it with: Cardioversion In cardioversion, doctors give a short electrical shock to your heart.  They give the shock through sticky pads on your chest or sometimes paddles they hold against your chest.  The shock stops the tachycardia so your heart can resume its normal rhythm.  You may need several shocks.  Doctors will give you medicine directly into your vein (IV medicine) so you're sleepy and it doesn't hurt.  Certain IV medicines can sometimes stop the tachycardia, but doctors usually prefer cardioversion because it's quicker and safer.  If you keep having ventricular tachycardia, you may need: An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) An ICD is a device implanted under the skin of your chest or stomach.

Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments. \n【1】 Electrolytes carry an electric charge when dissolved in body fluids such as blood.   Most of the body’s sodium is located in blood and in the fluid around cells.  Sodium helps the body keep fluids in a normal balance .  Sodium plays a key role in normal nerve and muscle function.  The body obtains sodium through food and drink and loses it primarily in sweat and urine.  Healthy kidneys maintain a consistent level of sodium in the body by adjusting the amount excreted in the urine.  When sodium consumption and loss are not in balance, the total amount of sodium in the body is affected.  The amount (concentration) of sodium in the blood may be Too low  Too high  Controlling blood volume The total amount of sodium in the body affects the amount of fluid in blood (blood volume) and around cells.  The body continually monitors blood volume and sodium concentration.  When either becomes too high, sensors in the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys detect the increases and stimulate the kidneys to increase sodium excretion, thus returning blood volume to normal.  When blood volume or sodium concentration becomes too low, the sensors trigger mechanisms to increase blood volume.  These mechanisms include the following: The kidneys stimulate the adrenal glands Overview of the Adrenal Glands The body has two adrenal glands, one near the top of each kidney.  They are endocrine glands, which secrete hormones into the bloodstream.  Each adrenal gland has two parts. \n【2】 Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and to excrete potassium.  When sodium is retained, less urine is produced, eventually causing blood volume to increase.  The pituitary gland secretes vasopressin (sometimes called antidiuretic hormone).  Vasopressin causes the kidneys to conserve water.  Maintaining fluid and sodium balance in older people As people age, the body is less able to maintain fluid and sodium balance for several reasons: Decreased thirst: As people age, they sense thirst less quickly or less intensely and thus may not drink fluids when needed.  Changes in the kidneys: Aging kidneys may become less able to reclaim water and electrolytes from the urine (concentrate urine), and, as a result, more water may be excreted in urine.  Less fluid in the body: In older people, the body contains less fluid.  Only 45% of body weight is fluid in older people, compared with 60% in younger people.  This change means that a slight loss of fluid and sodium, as can result from a fever or from not eating and drinking enough (sometimes for only a day or two), can have more serious consequences in older people.  Inability to obtain water: Some older people have physical problems that prevent them from getting something to drink when they are thirsty.  Others may have dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. \n【3】 These people may have to depend on other people to provide them with water.  Drugs: Many older people take drugs for high blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【4】 The above situations can result in losing fluid or not consuming enough fluid and thus can cause a high sodium level in blood  and/or dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body.  Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, burns, kidney failure, and use of diuretics may cause dehydration. \n【5】 Because these situations are more common among older people, hypernatremia is also more common among them.  Hypernatremia is poorly tolerated by older people and can result in confusion, coma, and death if severe. \n【6】 A low sodium level in blood  is more common among older people.  Hyponatremia usually results when the body retains too much fluid, as occurs in heart failure or liver disease.  Hyponatremia also occurs in older people who take certain types of diuretics (thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide), particularly if the kidneys are not functioning normally.  Diuretics, which are sometimes called water pills, are drugs that help the body eliminate excess fluid.

Consequences include atrophic gastritis, B12 malabsorption, and, frequently, pernicious anemia.  Risk of gastric adenocarcinoma increases 3-fold.  Diagnosis is by endoscopy.  Treatment is with parenteral vitamin B12.   Etiology Patients with autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) have antibodies to parietal cells and their components (which include intrinsic factor and the proton pump H+,K+-ATPase).  AMAG is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.  Some patients also develop Hashimoto thyroiditis is chronic autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid with lymphocytic infiltration.  Findings include painless thyroid enlargement and symptoms of hypothyroidism. \n【1】 In some patients, AMAG may be associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection Helicobacter pylori is a common gastric pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and low-grade gastric lymphoma. \n【2】 Gastrectomy and chronic acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors cause similar deficiencies of intrinsic factor secretion.  Complications of AMAG include Vitamin B12 deficiency Gastric adenocarcinoma Carcinoid tumor The lack of intrinsic factor leads to vitamin B12 deficiency Vitamin B12 Deficiency Dietary vitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption, but deficiency can develop in vegans who do not take vitamin supplements. \n【3】 Ineffective hematopoiesis affects all cell lines but particularly red blood cells. \n【4】 The areas of atrophic gastritis in the body and fundus may manifest as metaplasia.  Patients with AMAG have a 3-fold increased relative risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma Stomach Cancer Etiology of stomach cancer is multifactorial, but Helicobacter pylori plays a significant role. \n【5】 Patients with gland atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia distributed multifocally, including to the lesser curvature of the corpus and fundus, have a phenotype called multifocal atrophic gastritis.  Multifocal involvement is considered \"extensive\", in contrast to \"marked,\" which refers to severity at a specific site.  Risk of gastric adenocarcinoma is higher among patients who have multifocal atrophic gastritis.  Hypochlorhydria leads to G-cell hyperplasia and elevated serum gastrin levels (often > 1000 pg/mL [> 481 pmol/L]).  Elevated gastrin levels lead to enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, which occasionally undergoes transformation to a carcinoid tumor Overview of Carcinoid Tumors develop from neuroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract (90%), pancreas, pulmonary bronchi, and rarely the genitourinary tract. \n【6】 Symptoms and Signs Manifestations of autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAG) itself are few and nonspecific, although some patients have upper abdominal discomfort.  Symptoms and signs of B12 deficiency Symptoms and Signs Dietary vitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption, but deficiency can develop in vegans who do not take vitamin supplements. \n【7】 Neurologic manifestations occur independently of the anemia but typically begin with decreased position and vibratory sensation in the extremities, accompanied by mild to moderate weakness and hyporeflexia.  Diagnosis Endoscopic biopsy There are no specific symptoms that point to this disorder.  It is most often discovered when patients undergo endoscopy to evaluate upper abdominal discomfort or unexplained anemia.  Endoscopic biopsy confirms the diagnosis.  Serum B12 levels should be obtained.  Parietal cell antibodies are usually present but are not measured routinely.  The American Gastroenterological Association's 2020 guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia recommend testing for and treating H.  pylori in patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia.  These US guidelines also recommend against routine surveillance endoscopy in patients with autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia.  Patients with atrophic gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia who have an increased risk of gastric cancer may elect to undergo surveillance, but they should be made aware of the low value of surveillance and the potential adverse effects of repeated upper endoscopies.  Factors that increase the risk of gastric cancer include Incomplete metaplasia Extensive metaplasia Family history of gastric cancer Immigration from regions with high incidence of gastric cancer such as Korea, Japan, and South America Routine short-interval (within 1 year) repeat endoscopy and biopsy is not recommended unless the baseline endoscopy was inadequate or showed high-risk histology or unless the patient is at increased risk of gastric cancer.  Again, the decision to repeat the endoscopy within 1 year should be made after patients understand the low value of surveillance and the potential adverse effects of repeated upper endoscopies.  Longer-interval (every 3 to 5 years) surveillance endoscopy among patients with incidentally detected gastric intestinal metaplasia may be reasonable if shared decision-making favors surveillance.  The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group, European Society of Pathology, and Sociedade Portuguesa de Endoscopia Digestiva's 2019 update of the guidelines on management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach emphasizes the use of high-definition endoscopy with chromoendoscopy in endoscopic evaluation of these patients.

This can happen when, for example, you: Fall and hit your head Are in a car or motorcycle crash Get punched in the head or hit on your head with an object Many sports have a risk of concussion .  What are the symptoms of a concussion? If you have a concussion, you may: Be unconscious for a while (usually for less than 15 minutes) Feel dazed, confused, or light-headed Answer questions slowly Have a headache, double vision, or sensitivity to light Be clumsy or have poor balance Have trouble remembering what happened just before or after you got hurt What is post-concussion syndrome? Post-concussion syndrome is when you have symptoms after your concussion.

The splenic artery brings blood to the spleen from the heart.  Blood leaves the spleen through the splenic vein, which drains into a larger vein (the portal vein) that carries the blood to the liver.  The spleen has a covering of fibrous tissue (the splenic capsule) that supports its blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.  The spleen is made up of two basic types of tissue, each with different functions: White pulp Red pulp The white pulp is part of the infection-fighting system . \n【1】 The red pulp filters the blood, removing unwanted material. \n【2】 It also monitors red blood cells, destroying those that are abnormal or too old or damaged to function properly. \n【3】 However, releasing these elements is a minor function of the red pulp.  Viewing the Spleen Asplenia People can live without a spleen (a condition called asplenia).  Asplenia is loss of splenic function due to Absence of the spleen at birth A disease that affects the function of the spleen (functional asplenia) Surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) Absence of the spleen at birth is a rare disorder.  Infants with this disorder often also have a heart defect Overview of Heart Defects About one in 100 babies is born with a heart defect.  Some are severe, but many are not. \n【4】 People with functional asplenia have a spleen that does not function properly.  Functional asplenia can be due to a variety of diseases. \n【5】 Functional asplenia can also occur after injury to the arteries or veins of the spleen.  Splenectomy is surgical removal of the spleen.  It can be done in otherwise healthy people who require splenectomy after a spleen injury Because of the spleen’s position in the upper left side of the abdomen, a severe blow to the stomach area can damage the spleen, tearing its covering, the tissue inside, or both. \n【6】 Many disorders can make the spleen enlarge. \n【7】 When the spleen is removed or does not function, the body loses some of its ability to produce protective antibodies and to remove unwanted microorganisms from the blood.  As a result, the body’s ability to fight infections is impaired.  However, other organs (primarily the liver) compensate for the loss by increasing their infection-fighting ability and by monitoring for and removing red blood cells that are abnormal, too old, or damaged.  People who do not have a spleen are at particularly high risk of infections because of the spleen’s role in fighting certain kinds of bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.  Because of this risk, people receive vaccinations Overview of Immunization (vaccination) helps the body defend itself against diseases caused by certain bacteria or viruses. \n【8】 People should also be sure they receive the influenza vaccine The influenza virus vaccine helps protect against influenza.

Two approaches (infraclavicular and supraclavicular) are used; the infraclavicular approach is described here.  Subclavian vein cannulation is popular. \n【1】 However, the complications resulting from an errant vascular puncture (soft-tissue bleeding, hematoma, hemothorax, and pneumothorax) can be more serious than at other central venous catheter (CVC) sites because the venipuncture site is shielded by the overlying clavicle and thus cannot be monitored or compressed.  Using ultrasonographic guidance has been shown to reduce procedural complications of subclavian vein catheterization but is not yet widely recommended or practiced.   Indications Secure or long-term venous access that is not available using other sites Inability to obtain peripheral venous access Peripheral Vein Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. \n【2】 A subclavian CVC is preferred for long-term venous access in nonbedridden patients (eg, ambulatory patients needing parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, chemotherapy).  Contraindications Absolute contraindications Subclavian vein thrombosis Fracture of the clavicle or proximal ribs Local infection at the insertion site Antibiotic-impregnated catheter in allergic patient Relative contraindications Unilateral lung disease: Cannulate ipsilaterally.  Unilateral anatomic distortion, traumatic or congenital, without pneumothorax: Cannulate contralaterally.  Cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator: Do not cannulate the vein being used for the pacemaker leads.  Gross obesity: Because the axillary vein lies deep and the brachial plexus is nearby, cannulate the axillary vein only in thin patients.  Young children and infants: Subclavian vein cannulation is the least preferred CVC for young children and infants because of unfavorable anatomy, including the vein’s close proximity to the pleura and subclavian artery.  Coagulopathy, including therapeutic anticoagulation* Gross obesity Malignant superior vena cava syndrome Severe cardiorespiratory insufficiency or increased intracranial or intraocular pressure: These patients will be compromised by Trendelenburg (head down) positioning.  History of prior catheterization of the intended central vein Uncooperative patient: Sedate if necessary.  Left bundle branch block: A guidewire or catheter in the right ventricle can induce complete heart block.  * Therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, for pulmonary embolism) increases the risk of bleeding with subclavian vein cannulation, but this must be balanced against the increased risk of thrombosis (eg, stroke) if anticoagulation is reversed.  Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient. \n【3】 Complications include Pneumothorax (increased risk because apical pleura [especially on left side] is close to needle insertion path) Arterial puncture Hematoma (increased risk because clavicle impedes application of external pressure to stop subclavian arterial or venous bleeding) Damage to the vein Hemothorax Air embolism Catheter misplacement* (eg, internal jugular vein or thoracic duct) Arrhythmias or atrial perforation, typically caused by guidewire or catheter Nerve damage Infection Thrombosis (due to the catheter itself) * Rare complications due to catheter misplacement include arterial catheterization, hydrothorax, hydromediastinum, and damage to the tricuspid valve.  Guidewire or catheter embolism also rarely occurs.  To reduce the risk of venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis, CVCs should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.  Equipment Sterile procedure, barrier protection Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, alcohol) Large sterile drapes, towels Sterile head caps, masks, gowns, gloves Face shields Seldinger (catheter-over-guidewire) technique Cardiac monitor Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, about 5 mL) Small anesthetic needle (eg, 25 to 27 gauge, about 1 inch [3 cm] long) Large anesthetic/finder* needle (22 gauge, about 1. 5 inches [4 cm] long) Introducer needle (eg, thin-walled, 18 or 16 gauge, with internally beveled hub, about 2. 5 inches [6 cm] long) 3- and 5-mL syringes (use slip-tip syringes for the finder and introducer needles) Guidewire, J-tipped Scalpel (#11 blade) Dilator Central venous catheter (adult: 8 French or larger, minimum length for subclavian catheter is 20 cm for right side and 24 cm for left side) Sterile gauze (eg, 4 × 4 inch [10 × 10 cm] squares) Sterile saline for flushing catheter port or ports Nonabsorbable nylon or silk suture (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) Chlorhexidine patch, transparent occlusive dressing * A finder needle is a thinner needle used for locating the vein before inserting the introducer needle.  It is optionally used for nonultrasound–guided subclavian vein cannulation.  Having an assistant or two is helpful.  Additional Considerations Cannulation attempts sometimes fail.  Do not exceed 2 or 3 attempts (which increases the risk of complications), and use new equipment with each attempt (ie, do not re-use needles, catheters, or other equipment because they may have become blocked with tissue or blood).  During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood.  If the subclavian artery is errantly cannulated by either the tissue dilator or the CVC, leave the dilator or catheter in place and obtain surgical consultation for possible surgical removal.  Relevant Anatomy Superiorly overlying the first rib, in sequence from anterior to posterior, are the clavicle, subclavian vein, anterior scalene muscle, and subclavian artery.  Just medial to the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle, the subclavian vein is attached by fibrous tissue to both the first rib and the clavicle, stabilizing its position and diameter.  At this site, the size of the subclavian vein is only slightly affected by respiration, the Trendelenburg position, or the Valsalva maneuver.  This region of the vein is the intended target of subclavian venipuncture using the infraclavicular approach.  The infraclavicular approach is most common, and one of two skin insertion sites is used: either 1 to 2 cm inferior to the clavicle at the junction of its medial and middle thirds, or just inferior to the clavicle at its midpoint.  Needles are advanced medially along a coronal (frontal) plane—skirting beneath the clavicle—toward the sternal notch.  At the first site, the underlying first rib offers protection against pneumothorax.  At the second site (clavicular midpoint), less effort is needed to maintain the shallow angle of insertion that keeps the needle in the coronal plane.  Right subclavian cannulation, versus left, is sometimes preferred because it avoids the thoracic duct and because the right pleural apex is lower than the left.  Left cannulation is sometimes preferred (especially for pulmonary arterial catheterization) because it affords a direct, less angular path to the superior vena cava, with less chance of misdirected catheterization of the internal jugular vein.  Positioning Raise the bed to a comfortable height for you (ie, so you may stand straight while doing the procedure).  Place the patient supine or in Trendelenburg position (bed tilted with the head down 10 to 20°) to prevent air embolism.  Keep the patient's arm adducted and the head neutral.  Stand at the side of the bed.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Do a preliminary inspection (nonsterile) to identify the sternal notch, the posterior bend of the clavicle, the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle, and the midpoint of the clavicle.  Attach the cardiac monitor to the patient and turn it on.  Prepare the equipment Place sterile equipment on sterilely covered equipment trays.  Dress in sterile garb and use barrier protection.  Draw the local anesthetic into a syringe.  Optional: Attach a finder needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.  Attach the introducer needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.  Align the bevel of the needle with the volume markings on the syringe.  Pre-flush all lines of the CVC with 3 to 5 mL of sterile saline and then close the ports with caps or syringes.  When flushing a central line, use a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and do not push too hard to avoid rupturing the line.  Prepare the sterile field Swab a broad area of skin with antiseptic solution, encompassing the entire clavicular area, as well as the side of the neck and anterior chest to below the ipsilateral nipple. \n【4】 Allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute.  Place sterile towels around the site.  Place large sterile drapes (eg, a full-body drape) to establish a large sterile field.  Establish the needle insertion path (subclavian vein, infraclavicular approach) Place the tip of your index finger of the hand closest to the head of the bed on the sternal notch and your thumb at the midpoint of the clavicle.  The needle insertion path: Insert procedural needles (local anesthetic, finder, and introducer needles) immediately inferior to the clavicular midpoint (or 1 to 2 cm inferior to the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle), at a shallow angle into the skin, and—skirting the underside of the clavicle—aim toward the sternal notch.  You likely will need to push downward on the skin lateral to the needle insertion point to maintain the required, nearly horizontal, orientation of the syringe and needle.  Anesthetize the cannulation site Place a wheal of anesthetic at the needle entry site and then inject anesthetic into the skin and soft tissues along the anticipated needle insertion path.  Place extra anesthetic in the highly pain-sensitive periosteum on the underside of the clavicle.  Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance to identify intravascular placement and prevent an intravascular injection.  If blood returns into the syringe, stop advancing, hold the syringe in place, and now regard this needle as a finder needle. \n【5】 Insert the introducer needle (or finder needle, optional) Insert the introducer needle (or, optionally, a finder needle), with the bevel facing along the needle insertion path.  Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance the needle.  Stop advancing when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe (you may feel the needle pop through the wall as it enters the lumen).  Hold the syringe motionless in this spot.  Even a slight movement may displace the needle tip from the vein.  If cannulation is difficult, a small towel rolled under the patient's ipsilateral shoulder or caudal traction (5 cm) on the arm may be tried.  If no flash of blood appears in the barrel after 3 to 4 cm of insertion, withdraw the needle slowly.  If the needle had initially passed completely through the vein, a flash may now appear as you withdraw the needle tip back into the lumen.  If a flash still does not appear, withdraw the needle almost to the skin surface, change direction, and try again to advance the needle into the vein.  Do not change direction of the needle while it is fully inserted.  Assess the blood return Continue to hold the syringe motionless.  Securely grasp the needle hub and also hold it motionless.  Remove the syringe from the needle hub and briefly let blood flow out to confirm that the blood is venous (ie, dark red and flowing but not pulsatile).  Then immediately cover the hub with your thumb to stop the blood flow and prevent air embolism.  However, if the blood is bright red and pulsatile (arterial), terminate the procedure.  Remove the needle and use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area to decrease bleeding from the puncture site.  Patients should be closely monitored for the development of hemothorax and hemorrhage (eg, serial vital signs, physical examination, possibly a chest x-ray).  Optional: Use the finder needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle If up to this point you have been inserting a finder needle (or an anesthetic needle that found the vein), now you will use this needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle.  Hold the introducer syringe with the needle bevel facing down.  Use one of two insertion methods: Either remove the finder needle and immediately insert the introducer needle along the same path, or keep the finder needle in place and insert the introducer needle inferiorly alongside it but directed slightly superiorly to aim toward the same venipuncture point as the finder needle.  Stop advancing the introducer needle and hold it motionless when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe.  If the finder needle has not been removed, remove it now. \n【6】 Subclavian venipuncture This figure shows hand position during subclavian venipuncture (infraclavicular approach).  Insert the guidewire Carefully rotate the introducer syringe such that the bevel of the needle now faces inferiorly (ie, away from the internal jugular vein and toward the heart).  Insert the J-curved end of the guidewire into the introducer needle, with the J curve facing inferiorly (ie, in the same direction as the needle bevel).  Advance the guidewire through the needle and into the vein.  Do not force the wire; it should slide smoothly.  Advance the wire 20 cm or until ectopic heartbeats occur (withdraw from this point until ectopy stops).  If you feel any resistance as you advance the guidewire, stop advancing it.  Try to gently withdraw the wire slightly, rotate it slightly, and then readvance it, or try to gently withdraw the wire entirely, reestablish the needle tip within the vein (confirmed by venous blood return), and then reinsert the wire.  However, if you feel any resistance as you withdraw the wire, terminate the procedure and withdraw the needle and guidewire together as a unit (to prevent the needle tip from shearing through the guidewire within the patient).  Then use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.  Once the guidewire has been inserted, continue to hold it securely in place with one hand and maintain control of it throughout the remainder of the procedure.  Remove the introducer needle (after successful guidewire insertion) First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle and pull the needle from the skin.  Then, securely hold the guidewire at the skin surface and slide the needle down the remaining length of the guidewire to remove the needle.  Widen the insertion tract Extend the skin insertion site: Using the scalpel, make a small stab incision (about 4 mm) into the skin insertion site, avoiding contact with the guidewire, to enlarge the site and allow it to accommodate the larger diameters of the tissue dilator and the catheter.  Advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire: First, grasp the guidewire at the skin and slide the dilator down the length of the wire to the skin.  Then grasp the wire just distal to the dilator, hold the dilator near the skin surface, and use a corkscrew motion as needed to stepwise insert the entire length of the dilator.  Maintain your grasp on the wire at all times during the insertion.  Remove the dilator: First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the dilator and pull the dilator from the skin.  When the guidewire is visible at the skin surface, completely remove the dilator by sliding it down the remaining length of the guidewire.  Maintain your grasp on the guidewire at the skin surface.  Place the catheter Advance the catheter over the guidewire to the skin surface: Hold the guidewire fixed at the skin surface, thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire, and slide the catheter down to the skin surface.  The distal end of the guidewire should now be protruding from the port hub.  If the distal end of the guidewire is not protruding from the port hub, inch the guidewire outward from the skin surface while holding the catheter tip close to the surface until the guidewire protrudes.  Continue to advance the catheter into the vein: Grasp and control the guidewire where it protrudes from the hub.  Hold the catheter near its tip and insert the tip through the skin.  Then, in increments of several centimeters and using a corkscrew motion as necessary, stepwise advance the entire length of the subclavian catheter.  If ectopic heartbeats occur, slowly withdraw the catheter until ectopy stops.  Maintain your grasp on both the guidewire and the catheter.  Remove the guidewire: Withdraw the guidewire while holding the catheter securely in place at the skin surface.  Flush each catheter port with saline: First, draw any air from the line and confirm venous blood flow into the hub.  Then, using a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and nonexcessive force, push 20 mL of saline into the line to clear it.  Dress the site If the patient is awake or minimally sedated, use 1% lidocaine to numb the skin at the planned suture locations.  Place a chlorhexidine-impregnated disk on the skin at the catheter insertion point.  Suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter.  To prevent pulling on the insertion site, suture the catheter at a second site so that a curved or looped segment of catheter lies between the two sites.  Apply a sterile occlusive dressing.  Transparent membrane dressings are commonly used.  Aftercare Do a chest x-ray to confirm that the tip of a subclavian (or jugular) CVC lies in the superior vena cava near its junction with the right atrium (the catheter can be advanced or retracted if not in the appropriate position) and to confirm that pneumothorax has not occurred.  Warnings and Common Errors Placing a pillow under the patient's back to facilitate subclavian line placement was once recommended, but doing this may hinder correct placement by narrowing the space between the clavicle and first rib.  The tip of a CVC must never lie in the right atrium because the atrium is thin-walled and easily perforated.  Cardiac ectopy may be induced by a guidewire or catheter in the right atrium or ventricle.  Never lose grasp of the guidewire.  To help prevent air embolism, CVCs should be inserted (and removed) with the vascular cannulation site positioned dependant to the heart.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 17:51:35"}

It receives oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle of the heart and distributes it to all of the body except the lungs (which receive blood from the right ventricle).  Just after the aorta leaves the heart, smaller arteries that carry blood to the head and arms branch off.  The aorta then arches down, with additional smaller arteries branching off along its route from the left ventricle to the lower abdomen at the top of the hipbone (pelvis).  At this point, the aorta divides into the two iliac arteries, which supply blood to the legs.  Disorders of the aorta include Aneurysms: Bulges in weak areas of the walls of the aorta Dissection: Separation of the layers of the wall of the aorta These disorders can be immediately fatal, but they usually take years to develop.  Aneurysms also can develop in other arteries of the trunk, arms, and legs , such as the arteries at the back of the knee (popliteal arteries) and the main arteries of the thighs (femoral arteries).  The arteries supplying the head (carotid arteries), the arteries supplying the brain (cerebral arteries), and the arteries supplying the heart muscle (coronary arteries) may also develop aneurysms. \n【1】 Aortic Aneurysms The pressure of blood inside the artery forces any weak areas in the artery's wall to balloon outward.  If untreated, an aneurysm may rupture, resulting in pain and internal bleeding serious enough to cause shock and sometimes death.  Location Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta.  Three fourths of aortic aneurysms develop in the part that passes through the abdomen , and the rest develop in the part that passes through the chest .  In older people, aneurysms are most likely to occur in areas where arteries branch Aortic Branch Aneurysms are bulges (dilations) in the wall of the major arteries that come directly off of the aorta. \n【2】 Aneurysms may be round (saccular) or tubelike (fusiform).  Most are fusiform.  Where Do Aortic Aneurysms Occur? Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta.  Most develop in the abdominal aorta.  The rest develop in the thoracic aorta, most commonly in the ascending aorta. \n【3】 It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health. \n【4】 High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【5】 In people with Marfan syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder of connective tissue, resulting in abnormalities of the eyes, bones, heart, blood vessels, lungs, and central nervous system. \n【6】 Complications Consequences depend on the size of the rupture.  A large rupture may be rapidly fatal, and a small one (sometimes termed a leak) may cause warning symptoms that allow people to seek medical care.  A blood clot (thrombus) often develops in the aneurysm because blood flow inside the aneurysm is sluggish.  The clot may extend along the entire wall of the aneurysm.  A blood clot may break loose (becoming an embolus), travel through the bloodstream, and block arteries.  Aneurysms in the popliteal arteries are more likely to produce emboli than aneurysms in other arteries.  Occasionally, calcium is gradually deposited in the wall of an aneurysm, making it easier to see on x-rays.  Aortic Dissection An aortic dissection is an often fatal disorder in which the inner layer (lining) of the aortic wall tears and separates from the middle layer of the aortic wall. \n【7】 As a result, a new, false channel forms in the wall of the aorta.  More than 90% of people who have an aortic dissection experience pain—typically sudden, excruciating pain, often described as tearing or ripping.  As the dissection advances further along the aorta, it can close off the points at which one or more arteries branch off from the aorta, blocking blood flow.  The consequences vary depending on which arteries are blocked.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type3": ""}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 18:37:31"}

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction that damages the myelin sheath around nerves.  In this disorder, weakness worsens continually over a period of more than 8 weeks.  Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid can help confirm the diagnosis.  Treatment may include corticosteroids, drugs that inhibit the immune system, and sometimes immune globulin and plasma exchange.  Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy develops in 3 to 10% of people with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is a form of polyneuropathy causing muscle weakness, which usually worsens over a few days to weeks, then slowly improves or returns to normal on its own. \n【1】 Like Guillain-Barré syndrome, it is a polyneuropathy is the simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body. \n【2】 That is, it affects many peripheral nerves Overview of the Peripheral Nervous System refers to the parts of the nervous system that are outside the central nervous system, that is, those outside the brain and spinal cord. \n【3】 What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known. \n【4】 The body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which surrounds the nerve and enables nerve impulses to travel quickly.  Insulating a Nerve Fiber Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.  These layers form the myelin sheath.  Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, the myelin sheath enables nerve signals (electrical impulses) to be conducted along the nerve fiber with speed and accuracy.  When the myelin sheath is damaged (called demyelination), nerves do not conduct electrical impulses normally.  Symptoms of CIDP Symptoms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are similar to those of Guillain-Barré syndrome: Weakness is more prominent than abnormal sensations (numbness and a pins-and-needles sensation).  However, these symptoms worsen for more than 8 weeks.  (In Guillain-Barré syndrome, weakness usually worsens over 3 or 4 weeks, then remains the same or starts to return to normal. ) Symptoms may slowly worsen or may lessen or disappear, then worsen or reappear.  Reflexes are usually absent.  In most people with this disorder, blood pressure fluctuates less, abnormal heart rhythms occur less often, and other internal functions are less impaired than in people with Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Also, weakness may be more irregular, affecting the two sides of the body differently, and weakness may progress more slowly.  Diagnosis of CIDP Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and a spinal tap Doctors suspect chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy based on symptoms.  It can be distinguished from Guillain-Barré syndrome because it progresses for more than 8 weeks.  Electromyography, nerve conduction studies Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【5】 Rarely, a biopsy of the nerve is needed to detect demyelination.  Treatment of CIDP Immune globulin Corticosteroids and/or drugs that inhibit the immune system Plasma exchange Immune globulin (a solution containing many different antibodies collected from a group of donors) may be given by vein (intravenously) or under the skin (subcutaneously).  It can relieve symptoms.  It has fewer side effects than corticosteroids and is easier to use than plasma exchange Plateletpheresis (platelet donation) In addition to normal blood donation and transfusion, special procedures are sometimes used.  In plateletpheresis, a donor gives only platelets rather than whole blood. \n【6】 However, after treatment is stopped, its beneficial effects may not last as long as those of corticosteroids.  Corticosteroids Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints. \n【7】 Drugs that inhibit the immune system  such as azathioprine may also be used.

Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.  Characteristically, peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically inflamed, leading to progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms.  Diagnosis is based on specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging features.  Treatment involves drugs, physical measures, and sometimes surgery.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs can reduce symptoms and slow disease progression.  Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1% of the population.  Women are affected 2 to 3 times more often than men.  Onset may be at any age, most often between 35 years and 50 years, but can be during childhood  or old age.  Etiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis Although rheumatoid arthritis involves autoimmune reactions, the precise cause is unknown; many factors may contribute.  A genetic predisposition has been identified and, in White populations, localized to a shared epitope in the HLA-DRB1 locus of class II histocompatibility antigens.  Unknown or unconfirmed environmental factors (eg, viral infections, cigarette smoking) are thought to play a role in triggering and maintaining joint inflammation. \n【1】 Pathophysiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis Prominent immunologic abnormalities include immune complexes produced by synovial lining cells and in inflamed blood vessels.  Plasma cells produce antibodies (eg, rheumatoid factor [RF], anticyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibody) that contribute to these complexes, but destructive arthritis can occur in their absence.  Macrophages also migrate to diseased synovium in early disease; increased macrophage-derived lining cells are prominent along with vessel inflammation.  Lymphocytes that infiltrate the synovial tissue are primarily CD4+ T cells.  Macrophages and lymphocytes produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], various interleukins, interferon-gamma) in the synovium.  Released inflammatory mediators and various enzymes contribute to the systemic and joint manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, including cartilage and bone destruction .  In seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, accumulating evidence suggests that anti-CCP antibodies appear long before any signs of inflammation .  Additionally, anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies  predict more radiologic progression in anti-CCP–negative rheumatoid arthritis patients.  Progression to rheumatoid arthritis in the preclinical phase depends on autoantibody epitope spreading in which there are immune responses to released self-antigens with subsequent increased inflammation .  In chronically affected joints, the normally thin synovium proliferates, thickens, and develops many villous folds.  The synovial lining cells produce various materials, including collagenase and stromelysin, which contribute to cartilage destruction, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF-alpha, which stimulate cartilage destruction, osteoclast-mediated bone absorption, synovial inflammation, and prostaglandins (which potentiate inflammation).  Fibrin deposition, fibrosis, and necrosis are also present.  Hyperplastic synovial tissue (pannus) releases these inflammatory mediators, which erode cartilage, subchondral bone, articular capsule, and ligaments.  Polymorphonuclear leukocytes on average make up about 60% of white blood cells in the synovial fluid.  Rheumatoid nodules develop in about 30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  They are granulomas consisting of a central necrotic area surrounded by palisaded histiocytic macrophages, all enveloped by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibroblasts.  Nodules can also develop in visceral organs. \n【2】 Symptoms and Signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis Onset of rheumatoid arthritis is usually insidious, often beginning with systemic and joint symptoms.  Systemic symptoms include generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized weakness, and occasionally low-grade fever.  Joint symptoms include pain, swelling, and stiffness.  Occasionally, the disease begins abruptly, mimicking an acute viral syndrome.  The disease progresses most rapidly during the first 6 years, particularly the first year; 80% of patients develop some permanent joint abnormalities within 10 years.  The course is unpredictable in individual patients.  Joint symptoms are characteristically symmetric.  Typically, stiffness lasts > 60 minutes after rising in the morning but may occur after any prolonged inactivity (called gelling).  Involved joints become tender, with erythema, warmth, swelling, and limitation of motion.  The joints primarily involved include the following: Wrists and the index (2nd) and middle (3rd) metacarpophalangeal joints (most commonly involved) Proximal interphalangeal joints Metatarsophalangeal joint Shoulders Elbows Hips Knees Ankles However, virtually any joint, except the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, may be involved.  Initial manifestations include Monoarthritis of knee, wrist, shoulder, or ankle Polymyalgia rheumatica–like presentation predominantly with shoulder and hip girdle involvement, especially in older patients Palindromic rheumatism, characterized by recurrent attacks of joint and tendon sheath pain with swelling Joint swelling without chronic joint damage Robustus rheumatoid arthritis with proliferative synovitis but minimal pain Lower spine involvement is not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, but cervical spine inflammation can result in instability, which can become an emergency.  Synovial thickening and swelling are often detectable.  Joints are often held in flexion to minimize pain, which results from joint capsular distention. \n【3】 Joint instability due to stretching of the joint capsule can also occur.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.  Symptoms include pain and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution. \n【4】 Popliteal (Baker) cysts Baker cysts are enlarged bursae in the popliteal fossa.  They are filled with synovial fluid and usually communicate with the adjacent joint space. \n【5】 Cervical spine involvement is common in longstanding active disease and usually presents as pain and stiffness, sometimes with radicular pain or features of myelopathy with hyperreflexia and occipital headache.  Cricoarytenoid joint arthritis can manifest as voice hoarseness and respiratory stridor.  Examples of Fixed Deformities Swan-Neck Deformity Swan neck deformity is characterized by extension at proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion at distal interphalangeal joint. \n【6】 Boutonnière Deformity in Rheumatoid Arthritis There are multiple boutonnière deformities of the fingers and thumbs in this patient with advanced rheumatoid arthritis.  Boutonnière deformity is characterized by flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint and hyperextension at the distal interphalangeal joint.  There also are multiple rheumatoid nodules over the knuckles and interphalangeal joints.  \n【7】 Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities Extra-articular manifestations Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules are not usually an early sign but eventually develop in up to 30% of patients, usually at sites of pressure and chronic irritation (eg, the extensor surface of the forearm, metacarpophalangeal joints, soles of feet).  Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules can increase in patients taking methotrexate, despite lessening of joint inflammation.  Visceral nodules (eg, pulmonary) are usually asymptomatic and may occur in severe rheumatoid arthritis.  Pulmonary nodules of rheumatoid arthritis cannot be distinguished from pulmonary nodules of other etiology without biopsy.  Other extra-articular signs include vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis refers to vasculitis affecting small- or medium-sized vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue but not the internal organs. \n【8】 Diagnosis is clinical.  Treatment is of the causative disorder. \n【9】 Involvement of the cervical spine can cause atlantoaxial subluxation is misalignment of the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae, which may occur only with neck flexion. \n【10】 Diagnosis is by MRI.  Treatment is directed at relieving compression. \n【11】 Importantly, cervical spine instability is usually asymptomatic.  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for early coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. \n【12】 Examples of Rheumatoid Nodule Rheumatoid Nodules (Ulna) Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules (arrow) commonly form over pressure points as in this patient with olecranon bursitis.  The nodules may be within subcutaneous tissue overlying the bursae or may be subperiosteal to the extensor surface of the ulna.  \n【13】   Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical criteria Serum rheumatoid factor (RF), anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) X-rays Rheumatoid arthritis should be suspected in patients with polyarticular, symmetric arthritis, particularly if the wrists and 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints are involved.  Classification criteria serve as a guide for establishing the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and are helpful in defining standardized treatment populations for study purposes.  Criteria include laboratory test results for RF, anti-CCP, and ESR or CRP .  However, diagnosis requires documented joint inflammation and should not be based on laboratory testing alone.  Other causes of symmetric polyarthritis, particularly hepatitis C, must be excluded.  Obtaining baseline x-rays of affected joints should be considered to help document progression of disease (erosive changes, joint space narrowing) over time.  In patients who have prominent lumbar symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be investigated.   RFs, antibodies to human gamma-globulin, are present in about 70% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  However, RF, often in low titers (levels can vary between laboratories), occurs in patients with other diseases, including Other connective tissue diseases  Granulomatous diseases Chronic infections  Cancers Low RF titers can also occur in 3% of the general population and 20% of older patients.  Very high RF titers can occur in patients with hepatitis C infection and sometimes in patients with other chronic infections.  An RF titer measured by latex agglutination of > 1:80 or a positive anti-CCP test supports the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in the appropriate clinical context, but other causes must be excluded.  Anti-CCP antibodies have high specificity (90%) and sensitivity (about 77 to 86%) for rheumatoid arthritis and, like RF, predict a worse prognosis.  RF and anti-CCP values do not fluctuate with disease activity.  Anti-CCP antibodies are notably absent in patients with hepatitis C who may have a positive RF titer and joint swelling related to the viral infection.  X-rays show only soft-tissue swelling during the first months of disease.  Subsequently, periarticular osteoporosis, joint space (articular cartilage) narrowing, and marginal erosions may become visible.  Erosions often develop within the first year but may occur any time.  MRI seems to be more sensitive and detects earlier articular inflammation and erosions.  In addition, abnormal subchondral bone signals (eg, bone marrow lesions, bone marrow edema) around the knee suggest progressive disease.  If rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed, additional tests help detect complications and unexpected abnormalities.  Complete blood count with differential should be obtained.  A normochromic (or slightly hypochromic)-normocytic anemia occurs in 80%; hemoglobin is usually > 10 g/dL (100 g/L).  If hemoglobin is ≤ 10 g/dL (100 g/L), superimposed iron deficiency or other causes of anemia should be considered.  Neutropenia occurs in 1 to 2% of cases, often with splenomegaly (Felty syndrome).  Acute-phase reactants (eg, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR, elevated CRP) reflect disease activity.  A mild polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia often occurs.  ESR is elevated in 90% of patients with active disease.  Validated measures of disease activity include the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Score DAS-28 and Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Disease Activity Index.  Synovial fluid examination is necessary with any new-onset effusion to rule out other disorders and differentiate rheumatoid arthritis from other inflammatory arthritides (eg, septic and crystal-induced arthritis).  In rheumatoid arthritis, during active joint inflammation, synovial fluid is turbid, yellow, and sterile, and usually has white blood cell counts 10,000 to 50,000/mcL (10. 0 x109/L to 50. 0 x109/L); polymorphonuclear leukocytes typically predominate, but > 50% may be lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells.  Crystals are absent. \n【14】 It is often asymptomatic until manifestations of chronic liver disease occur. \n【15】 Main symptoms are arthritis, weight loss, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. \n【16】 The presence of crystals makes rheumatoid arthritis unlikely, although calcium pyrophosphate crystal disease and rheumatoid arthritis may coexist in the same patient.  Joint involvement and subcutaneous nodules can result from SLE, gout, cholesterol, and amyloidosis is any of a group of disparate conditions characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrils composed of misaggregated proteins. \n【17】 SLE Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women. \n【18】 In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, swan neck and ulnar deviation deformities in SLE are usually reducible. \n【19】 Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder resulting in noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown. \n【20】 Acute rheumatic fever has a migratory pattern of joint involvement and evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection (culture or changing antistreptolysin O titer); in contrast, rheumatoid arthritis tends to involve additional joints over time. \n【21】 Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy and chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis of the skin or nails. \n【22】 Distal interphalangeal joint involvement and severely mutilating arthritis (arthritis mutilans) is strongly suggestive, as is the presence of a diffusely swollen (sausage) digit.  Psoriatic arthritis may involve the sacroiliac joints and lower spine.  Distinguishing between psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is important because response to some specific drugs differs. \n【23】 The HLA-B27 allele is present in 90% of White patients with ankylosing spondylitis.  Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation). \n【24】 Osteoarthritis of the hands most typically involves the DIP joints, bases of the thumbs, and proximal interphalangeal joints and may involve the metacarpophalangeal joints, but typically spares the wrist.  Rheumatoid arthritis does not affect the DIP joints.  Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by clinically apparent, symmetric, small joint inflammation with frequent wrist involvement.  Prognosis for Rheumatoid Arthritis decreases life expectancy by 3 to 7 years, with heart disease, infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding accounting for most excess mortality; drug treatment, cancer, as well as the underlying disease may be responsible.  Disease activity should be controlled to lower cardiovascular disease risk in all patients with rheumatoid arthritis.   At least 10% of patients are eventually severely disabled despite full treatment.  White people and women have a poorer prognosis, as do patients with subcutaneous nodules, advanced age at disease onset, inflammation in ≥ 20 joints, early erosions, cigarette smoking, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and high levels of rheumatoid factor or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).  Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis Nonpharmacological measures: Smoking cessation, healthy, balanced nutrition, physical joint protective measures, quality sleep Pharmacological measures: Medications that modify disease progression and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed for analgesia Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis involves a balance of rest and exercise, adequate nutrition, physical measures, drugs, and sometimes surgery.  Early diagnosis and treatment in rheumatoid arthritis predict improved outcomes.  A treat-to-target approach to achieve full disease remission or minimal disease activity has been recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)  and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)  recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.  Lifestyle measures Complete bed rest is rarely indicated, even for a short time; however, a program including judicious rest should be encouraged.  Quality sleep should be encouraged, because poor sleep increases pain.  An ordinary nutritious diet is appropriate.  Rarely, patients have food-associated exacerbations; no specific foods have reproducibly been shown to exacerbate or lessen the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.  Substituting omega-3 fatty acids (in fish oils) for dietary omega-6 fatty acids (in meats) partially relieves symptoms in some patients by transiently decreasing production of inflammatory prostaglandins and possibly by modifying the gut microbiome.  Smoking cessation can increase life expectancy.  Food and diet misinformation targeting rheumatoid arthritis patients is common, and patients should be directed to reliable sources of information.  Physical measures Joint splinting reduces local inflammation and may relieve severe symptoms of pain or compressive neuropathies.  Cold may be applied to reduce joint pain and swelling.  Orthopedic or athletic shoes with good heel and arch support are frequently helpful; metatarsal supports placed posteriorly (proximal) to painful metatarsophalangeal joints decrease the pain of weight bearing.  Molded shoes may be needed for severe deformities.  Occupational therapy and self-help devices enable many patients with debilitating rheumatoid arthritis to perform activities of daily living.  Exercise should proceed as tolerated.  During acute inflammation, passive range-of-motion exercise helps prevent flexion contractures.  Heat therapy can be applied to help alleviate stiffness.  Range-of-motion exercises done in warm water are helpful because heat improves muscle function by reducing stiffness and muscle spasm.  However, contractures can be prevented and muscle strength can be restored more successfully after inflammation begins to subside; active exercise (including walking and specific exercises for involved joints) to restore muscle mass and preserve range of joint motion are recommended.  Flexion contractures may require intensive exercise, casting, or immobilization (eg, splinting) in progressively more stretched-open positions.  Paraffin baths can warm digits and facilitate finger exercise.  Massage Treatment of pain and inflammation aims to facilitate movement and improve coordination of muscles and joints. \n【25】 Surgery may be considered if drug therapy is unsuccessful.  Surgery must always be considered in terms of the total disease and patient expectations.  For example, deformed hands and arms limit crutch use during rehabilitation; seriously affected knees and feet limit benefit from hip surgery.  Reasonable objectives for each patient must be determined, and function must be considered; straightening ulnar-deviated fingers may not improve hand function.  Surgery may be done while the disease is active.  Arthroplasty with prosthetic joint replacement is indicated if damage severely limits function; total hip and knee replacements are most consistently successful.  Prosthetic hips and knees may limit vigorous activity (eg, competitive athletics).  Excision of subluxed painful metatarsophalangeal joints may greatly aid walking.  Thumb fusions may provide stability for pinch.  Neck fusion may be needed for C1-2 subluxation with severe pain or potential for spinal cord compression.  Arthroscopic or open synovectomy can relieve joint inflammation but only temporarily unless disease activity can be controlled.  Withholding some immunosuppressive medications at the time of arthroplasty should be considered to limit the risk of infection.  Even low-dose prednisone (< 7. 5 mg a day) may increase infectious risk. \n【26】 Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis The goal is to reduce inflammation to prevent erosions, progressive deformity, and loss of joint function.  A treat-to-target approach to achieve full disease remission or minimal disease activity has been suggested .  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used early, often in combination.  Biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists, an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor inhibitor, IL-6 blockers, B-cell depleters, T-cell costimulatory molecule modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, seem to slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are of some help for the pain of rheumatoid arthritis, but they do not prevent erosions or disease progression, may slightly increase cardiovascular risk, and thus should be used as adjunctive therapy.  Low-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone < 7. 5 mg once/day) may be added to control severe polyarticular symptoms, usually with the objective of replacement with a DMARD.  Intra-articular depot corticosteroids can control severe monarticular or even oligoarticular symptoms but with chronic use may have adverse metabolic effects, even in low doses.  Studies indicate infectious and metabolic adverse effects from even low-dose chronic corticosteroid use, thus limitation of use is a treatment priority.  The optimal combinations of drugs are not yet clear.  However, some data suggest that certain combinations of drugs from different classes (eg, methotrexate plus other DMARDs, a rapidly tapered corticosteroid plus a DMARD, methotrexate plus a TNF-alpha antagonist, or a TNF-alpha antagonist plus a DMARD) are more effective than using DMARDs alone sequentially or in combination with other DMARDs.  In general, biologic agents are not given in combination with each other due to increased frequency of infections.  The following is an example of initial therapy: Methotrexate 10 to 15 mg orally once/week (with folic acid 1 mg orally once/day) is given.  If tolerated and not adequate, the dosage of weekly methotrexate is increased at 3- to 5-week intervals to a maximum of 25 mg orally or by injection (oral bioavailability decreases above 15 mg in a single dose).  If response is not adequate, a biologic agent is usually added.  Alternatively, triple therapy with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine is a cost-effective option, but long-term tolerability is challenging.  Leflunomide may be used instead of methotrexate or added to methotrexate with close monitoring of serum transaminase levels and complete blood count.  Methotrexate and leflunomide (and some other medications) must be avoided if pregnancy is anticipated.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Aspirin is no longer used for rheumatoid arthritis because effective doses are often toxic.  Only one NSAID should be given at a time , although patients may also take aspirin at ≤ 325 mg/day for its antiplatelet cardioprotective effect.  Because the maximal response for NSAIDs can take up to 2 weeks, doses should be increased no more frequently than this.  Doses of drugs with flexible dosing can be increased until response is maximal or maximum dosage is reached.  All NSAIDs treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and decrease inflammation but do not alter the course of the disease; thus, they are only used adjunctively.  NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and thus decrease production of prostaglandins.  Some prostaglandins under COX-1 control have important effects in many parts of the body (ie, they protect gastric mucosa and inhibit platelet adhesiveness).  Other prostaglandins are induced by inflammation and are produced by COX-2.  Selective COX-2 inhibitors, also called coxibs (eg, celecoxib), seem to have efficacy similar to nonselective NSAIDs and are slightly less likely to cause gastrointestinal toxicity; however, they are not less likely to cause renal toxicity.  Celecoxib 200 mg orally once/day has a comparable cardiovascular safety profile to nonselective NSAIDs.  It remains unclear whether full-dose celecoxib (200 mg orally 2 times a day ) has cardiovascular risks comparable to the nonselective NSAIDs.  NSAIDs should generally be avoided in patients with previous peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia; gastric acid suppressive therapy should be provided in these patients if an NSAID is used (eg, short term).  Other possible adverse effects of all NSAIDs include headache, confusion and other central nervous system symptoms, increased blood pressure, worsening of hypertension, edema, and decreased platelet function; however, celecoxib has no significant antiplatelet effect.  NSAIDs may increase cardiovascular risk .  Creatinine levels can rise reversibly because of inhibited renal prostaglandins and reduced renal blood flow; rarely, interstitial nephritis can occur.  Patients with urticaria, rhinitis, or asthma caused by aspirin can have the same problems with these other NSAIDs, but celecoxib may not cause these problems.  NSAIDs should be used at the lowest possible dose needed to mitigate their adverse effects.   Traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  DMARDs seem to slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and are indicated for nearly all patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  They differ from each other chemically and pharmacologically.  Many take weeks or months to have an effect.  About two thirds of patients improve overall, and complete remissions are becoming more common.  Many DMARDs result in evidence of decreased damage on imaging studies, presumably reflecting decreased disease activity.  Patients should be fully apprised of the risks of DMARDs and monitored closely for evidence of toxicity.   When choosing DMARDs, the following principles should be considered: Combinations of DMARDs may be more effective than single drugs.  For example, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate together are more effective than methotrexate alone or the other two together.  Combining a DMARD with another drug, such as methotrexate plus a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonist or a rapidly tapered corticosteroid, may be more effective than using DMARDs alone.  Methotrexate is a folate antagonist with immunosuppressive effects at high dose.  It is anti-inflammatory at doses used in rheumatoid arthritis.  It is very effective and has a relatively rapid onset (clinical benefit often within 3 to 4 weeks).  Methotrexate should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with hepatic dysfunction or renal failure.  Alcohol should be avoided.  Supplemental folate, 1 mg orally once/day, reduces the likelihood of adverse effects.  Complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and albumin and creatinine level should be determined about every 8 to 12 weeks.  When used early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis, efficacy may equal the biologic agents.  Rarely, a liver biopsy is needed if liver test findings are persistently twice the upper limit of normal or more and the patient needs to continue to use methotrexate.  Severe relapses of arthritis can occur after withdrawal of methotrexate.  Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules may enlarge with methotrexate therapy.  In rheumatoid arthritis patients with stable parenchymal lung disease, methotrexate can be continued with close monitoring of their respiratory status, if the methotrexate is controlling joint inflammation.  Hydroxychloroquine can also control symptoms of mild rheumatoid arthritis.  Funduscopic examination should be done and visual fields should be assessed before and every 12 months during treatment.  The drug should be stopped if no joint improvement occurs after 9 months.  Sulfasalazine can alleviate symptoms and slow development of joint damage.  It is usually given as enteric-coated tablets.  Benefit should occur within 3 months.  Enteric coating or dose reduction may increase tolerability.  Because neutropenia may occur early, CBCs should be obtained after 1 to 2 weeks and then about every 12 weeks during therapy.  AST and ALT should be obtained at about 6-month intervals and whenever the dose is increased.  In male patients, sulfasalazine may cause reversible oligospermia.  Leflunomide interferes with an enzyme involved with pyrimidine metabolism.  It is about as effective as methotrexate but is less likely to suppress bone marrow, cause abnormal liver function, or cause pneumonitis.  Alopecia and diarrhea are fairly common at the onset of therapy but may resolve with continuation of therapy.  Corticosteroids Systemic corticosteroids decrease inflammation and other symptoms more rapidly and to a greater degree than other drugs.  They may not prevent joint destruction, and their clinical benefit often diminishes with time.  Furthermore, rebound often follows the withdrawal of corticosteroids in active disease.  Because of their long-term adverse effects, some doctors recommend that corticosteroids are given only for short periods of time to maintain function until a DMARD has taken effect.  Corticosteroids may be used for severe joint or systemic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (eg, vasculitis, pleurisy, pericarditis).  Relative contraindications include peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, untreated infections, diabetes mellitus, and glaucoma.  The risk of latent tuberculosis should be considered before corticosteroid therapy is begun.  Intra-articular injections of depot corticosteroids may temporarily help control pain and swelling in particularly painful joints.  Triamcinolone hexacetonide may suppress inflammation for the longest time.  Triamcinolone acetonide and methylprednisolone acetate are also effective.  No single joint should be injected with a corticosteroid more than 3 to 4 times a year, as too-frequent injections may accelerate joint destruction (although there are no specific data from humans to support this effect).  Because injectable corticosteroid esters are crystalline, local inflammation transiently increases within a few hours in < 2% of patients receiving injections.  Although infection occurs in only < 1:40,000 patients, it must be considered if pain occurs > 24 hours after injection.  Immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive drugs Treatment with azathioprine or cyclosporine (an immunomodulatory drug) may provide efficacy similar to DMARDs.  However, these drugs are more toxic and less well studied.  Thus, they are used only for patients in whom treatment with more traditional DMARDs has failed.  They are used infrequently unless there are extra-articular complications.  Biologic agents Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab, and their biosimilars) reduce the progression of erosions and reduce the number of new erosions.  Although not all patients respond, many have a prompt, dramatic feeling of well being, sometimes with the first injection.  Inflammation is often dramatically reduced.  These drugs are often added to methotrexate therapy to increase the effect and possibly prevent the development of drug-neutralizing antibodies.  Recent information suggests safety during pregnancy with TNF inhibitors and anakinra .  TNF-alpha antagonists should probably be stopped before major surgery to decrease the risk of perioperative infection .  Etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab can be used with or without methotrexate.  TNF inhibitors may predispose to heart failure and thus are relatively contraindicated in stage 3 and stage 4 heart failure.  There is a minimal risk of lymphoma in rheumatoid arthritis patients who are being treated with TNF inhibitors.  2015 ACR guidelines conditionally recommended using DMARDs, rituximab, or abatacept instead of TNF inhibitors in patients with history of lymphoma .  Evidence regarding solid tumors in TNF inhibitors is mixed.  Other possible adverse events of TNF inhibitors include injection site reaction, acute and delayed infusion reaction, demyelinating disease, granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, cytopenias (especially neutropenia), cutaneous vasculitis, and rarely antineutrophilic cytoplasmic associated vasculitis.  Sarilumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor.  It is available for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of one or more DMARDs.  Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibitor and has clinical efficacy in patients who have responded incompletely to other biologic agents.  Abatacept, a soluble fusion cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) Ig, is indicated for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to other DMARDs, and conditionally recommended over other biologic DMARDs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease.  Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor.  IL-1 is heavily involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.  Infection and leukopenia can be problems.  It is used less often because it must be given every day.  Rituximab is an anti-CD 20 antibody that depletes B cells.  It can be used in patients refractory to other treatments.  Response is often delayed but may last 6 months.  The course can be repeated after 6 months.  Mild adverse effects are common, and analgesia, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, or a combination may need to be given concomitantly.  Rituximab therapy has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (as have other immunosuppressive drugs), mucocutaneous reactions, delayed leukopenia, and hepatitis B reactivation with hepatic necrosis.  Patients on rituximab may have a blunted immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n【27】 Therefore, rituximab is now generally reserved for patients who did not respond to other biologic DMARDs (including a combined TNF-alpha inhibitor and methotrexate) and to those with lymphoproliferative disorders.  Rituximab therapy might be gradually discontinued if the patient has had low disease activity or been in remission for at least 6 months.  Although there are some differences among agents, the most serious concern with the biologics and targeted DMARDs is infection, particularly with reactivated tuberculosis.  Patients should be screened for tuberculosis Screening for TB Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【28】 Other serious infections can occur, including sepsis, invasive fungal infections, and infections due to other opportunistic organisms. \n【29】 Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are small molecule agents that interfere with the communication between cells that coordinate inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme JAK.  JAK inhibitors include tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib. \n【30】 Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  It is indicated for adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonists.  Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that is given orally with or without concomitant methotrexate to patients who do not respond to methotrexate alone or other biologic agents.  Upadacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that is given orally to adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.  Other JAK inhibitors that may soon become available in the US include filgotinib and peficitinib.  A prospective, randomized, open-label study compared the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib (5 and 10 mg doses) with TNF-alpha antagonists.  After a median follow-up of 4 years, the results showed a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and cancer with tofacitinib than with TNF-alpha antagonists, especially in patients over age 50 years and with at least 1 risk factor for cardiovascular disease . \n【31】 Key Points Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disorder.  The most characteristic manifestation is a symmetric polyarthritis involving peripheral joints such as wrists and metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, often with constitutional symptoms.  Extra-articular findings can include rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis causing leg ulcers or multiple mononeuropathy, pleural or pericardial effusions, pulmonary nodules, pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis, pericarditis, myocarditis, lymphadenopathy, Felty syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, scleromalacia, and episcleritis.  X-rays are helpful, but early diagnosis is primarily by recognizing specific clinical findings and demonstrating abnormal laboratory test results, including autoantibodies (serum rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody) and acute-cell phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein).  Diagnosis requires documented joint inflammation and should not be based on laboratory testing alone.  Rheumatoid arthritis decreases life expectancy by 3 to 7 years (eg, due to gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or coronary heart disease) and causes severe disability in 10% of patients.  Treat almost all patients aggressively early, primarily with drugs that modify disease activity.  Drugs that modify disease activity include traditional DMARDs (particularly methotrexate), biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists or other non-TNF biologic agents, and other drugs that are immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, or immunosuppressive.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 00:49:45"}

Intraamniotic infection increases the risk of problems in the woman and in the fetus.  Women usually have a fever and often have pelvic pain and a vaginal discharge.  Usually, doctors can diagnose the infection by doing a physical examination, but sometimes amniotic fluid must be analyzed.  Women are given antibiotics and drugs to lower body temperature, and delivery is scheduled as soon as possible.  Pregnancy complications, such as intraamniotic infection, are problems that occur only during pregnancy.  They may affect the woman, the fetus, or both and may occur at different times during the pregnancy.  However, most pregnancy complications can be effectively treated.  Risk factors for intraamniotic infection typically develops because bacteria from the vagina enter the uterus and infect the tissues around the fetus.  Normally, mucus in the cervix, the membranes around the fetus, and the placenta prevent bacteria from causing infection.  However, certain conditions can make it easier for bacteria to breach these defenses.  Intraamniotic infection is also more likely if The membranes around the fetus rupture too soon .  There is a long delay between rupture of the membranes and delivery of the baby.  The longer the delay, the more likely intraamniotic infection is to develop.  Labor starts early .  The amniotic fluid contains meconium (the dark green stool that is produced by the fetus before birth and that is usually only expelled after birth).  Bacteria that can cause infections are in the genital tract.  Women may not know that these bacteria are present, particularly if they have not had routine prenatal care, when tests for these bacteria would have been done.  Doctors or midwives do many pelvic examinations in women with ruptured membranes.  Such examinations may introduce bacteria into the vagina and uterus.  Labor lasts a long time. \n【1】 For this procedure, doctors monitor the fetus by inserting an electrode (a small round sensor attached to a wire) through the woman’s vagina and attached to the fetus’s scalp.  Complications of intraamniotic infection can increase the risk of the following problems in the fetus or newborn: Preterm delivery or preterm premature rupture of the membranes (rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks of pregnancy) Too little oxygen in the blood around the time of delivery Infections, such as a bodywide infection , pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.  Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【2】 Intraamniotic infection can increase the risk of the following problems in the woman: A bloodstream infection Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body. \n【3】 In the United States, up to 30% of deliveries are cesarean. \n【4】 An embolus is a blood clot that travels through the bloodstream and blocks an artery. \n【5】 Symptoms of Intraamniotic Infection usually causes fever and often causes abdominal pain and a discharge that can be foul-smelling.  The heart rate of the fetus and the woman may be rapid.  However, some women do not have typical symptoms.  Diagnosis of Intraamniotic Infection A doctor's evaluation A complete blood count Sometimes amniocentesis Doctors do a physical examination and a complete blood count (which includes a white blood cell count).  An intraamniotic infection is suspected when women have a fever and at least one other typical symptom, such as a fast heart rate in the fetus or a foul-smelling discharge or an abnormally high white blood cell count in the woman.  If the diagnosis is still unclear, doctors can remove a sample of the amniotic fluid and analyze it .  If preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes occurs, doctors consider the possibility of infection even if women do not have typical symptoms.  Prevention of Intraamniotic Infection If women have preterm premature rupture of the membranes, doctors do pelvic examinations only if necessary.  Doctors usually also give these women antibiotics intravenously and by mouth to help the pregnancy last longer and reduce the risk of problems in the fetus.  Treatment of Intraamniotic Infection Antibiotics Drugs to lower body temperature Delivery Women with an intraamniotic infection are given antibiotics intravenously.  They are also given drugs (preferably acetaminophen before delivery) to lower body temperature.  Delivery should not be delayed once the diagnosis is made.  If labor has not started, labor may be artificially started .

Ectopic pregnancies cannot be carried to term and eventually rupture or involute.  Early symptoms and signs include pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.  Hemorrhagic shock can occur with rupture.  Diagnosis is by measurement of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and ultrasonography.  Treatment is with laparoscopic or open surgical resection or with methotrexate.  Ectopic pregnancy can cause life-threatening hemorrhage, and if it is suspected, the patient should be evaluated and treated as soon as possible.  Incidence of ectopic pregnancy is about 2/100 diagnosed pregnancies . \n【1】 Etiology of Ectopic Pregnancy Most ectopic pregnancies are located in the fallopian tube, and any history of infection or surgery that increases the risk of tubal adhesions or other abnormalities increases risk of ectopic pregnancy.  Factors that particularly increase risk of ectopic pregnancy include Prior ectopic pregnancy Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, particularly tubal surgery, including tubal ligation Tubal abnormalities Current intrauterine device (IUD) use In vitro fertilization in current pregnancy is much less likely to occur after tubal ligation or IUD placement; however, when pregnancy does occur, risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased (eg, about 5% in current IUD users).  Other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include Current use of estrogen/progestin oral contraceptives History of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur. \n【2】 Pregnancies in the cervix, a cesarean delivery scar, an ovary, or the abdomen are rare.  Heterotopic pregnancy (simultaneous ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies) occurs in only 1/10,000 to 30,000 pregnancies but may be more common among women who have had ovulation induction or used assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) involve manipulation of sperm and ova or embryos in vitro with the goal of producing a pregnancy. \n【3】 The anatomic structure containing the fetus usually ruptures after about 6 to 16 weeks.  Rupture results in bleeding that can be gradual or rapid enough to cause hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. \n【4】 The later in the pregnancy the rupture occurs, the more rapidly blood is lost and the higher the risk of death. \n【5】 Symptoms and Signs of Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy vary and may be absent until rupture occurs.  Most patients have pelvic pain (which can be dull, sharp, or crampy), vaginal bleeding, or both.  Patients who have irregular menses may not be aware that they are pregnant.  Rupture may be heralded by sudden, severe pain, followed by syncope or by symptoms and signs of hemorrhagic shock or peritonitis.  Rapid hemorrhage is more likely in ruptured cornual pregnancies.  Cervical motion tenderness, unilateral or bilateral adnexal tenderness, or an adnexal mass may be present.  Pelvic examination should be done carefully because excessive pressure may rupture the pregnancy.  The uterus may be slightly enlarged (but often less than anticipated based on date of the last menstrual period).  Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy Quantitative serum beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) Pelvic ultrasonography Sometimes laparoscopy Ectopic pregnancy is suspected in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock, regardless of sexual, contraceptive, and menstrual history.  Findings of physical (including pelvic) examination are neither sensitive nor specific.  A ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a surgical emergency because it causes maternal hemorrhage and risk of death; prompt diagnosis is essential.  Pearls & Pitfalls Suspect ectopic pregnancy in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock, regardless of sexual, contraceptive, and menstrual history and examination findings.  The first step is a urine pregnancy test, which is about 99% sensitive for pregnancy (ectopic and otherwise).  If urine beta-hCG is negative and if clinical findings do not strongly suggest ectopic pregnancy, further evaluation is unnecessary unless symptoms recur or worsen.  If urine beta-hCG is positive or if clinical findings strongly suggest ectopic pregnancy and pregnancy may be too early to detect based on urine beta-hCG, quantitative serum beta-hCG and pelvic ultrasonography are indicated.  If ultrasonography detects an intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely except in women who have used assisted reproductive techniques (which increase risk of heterotopic pregnancy, although it is still rare in these patients).  However, cornual and interstitial pregnancies may appear to be intrauterine pregnancies.  Findings diagnostic for an intrauterine pregnancy are a gestational sac with a yolk sac or an embryo (with or without a heartbeat) within the uterine cavity.  In addition to absence of an intrauterine pregnancy, ultrasonographic findings suggesting ectopic pregnancy include a complex (mixed solid and cystic) pelvic mass, particularly in the adnexa, and echogenic free fluid in the cul-de-sac.  If serum beta-hCG is above a certain level (called the discriminatory zone), ultrasonography should detect a gestational sac with a yolk sac in patients with an intrauterine pregnancy.  For transvaginal ultrasonography, this level is may be as high as 3500 mIU/mL, although many institutions use 2000 mIU/mL .  If the beta-hCG level is higher than the discriminatory zone and an intrauterine pregnancy is not detected, an ectopic pregnancy is likely.  If the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone and ultrasonography is unremarkable, patients may have an early intrauterine pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy.  If clinical evaluation suggests ectopic pregnancy with active bleeding or rupture (eg, signs of significant hemorrhage or peritoneal irritation), diagnostic laparoscopy may be necessary for diagnosis and treatment.  If ectopic pregnancy has not been confirmed and patients are stable, serum levels of beta-hCG are measured serially on an outpatient basis (typically every 2 days).  Normally, the level doubles every 1. 4 to 2. 1 days up to 41 days; in ectopic pregnancy (and in potential spontaneous abortions), levels may be lower than expected by dates and usually do not double as rapidly.  If beta-hCG levels do not increase as expected or if they decrease, diagnosis of spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation. \n【6】 Treatment of Ectopic Pregnancy Usually, methotrexate for small, unruptured ectopic pregnancies Surgical resection if rupture is suspected or criteria are not met for methotrexate treatment Rho(D) immune globulin if the woman is Rh-negative Methotrexate Patients with a tubal pregnancy may be treated with methotrexate if all of the following are present: The patient is hemodynamically stable with no signs of current or impending rupture.  Complete blood count and renal and liver function test results are normal and the patient has no other contraindications.  The pregnancy is < 3 to 4 cm in diameter.  No fetal heart activity is detected.  The beta-hCG level is ≤ 5,000 mIU/mL.  The patient is willing and able to comply with posttreatment follow-up.  In a commonly used protocol, beta-hCG is measured on day 1, and the patient is given a single dose of methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IM.  Beta-hCG measurement is repeated on days 4 and 7.  If the beta-hCG level does not decrease by 15% from day 4 to 7, a 2nd dose of methotrexate or surgery is needed.  Alternatively, other protocols can be used.  The beta-hCG level is then measured weekly until it is undetectable.  Success rates with methotrexate are about 87%; 7% of women have serious complications (eg, rupture).  Usually, methotrexate can be used, but surgery is indicated when rupture is suspected, the patient is not able to comply with follow-up after methotrexate therapy, or methotrexate is ineffective.  Surgical resection Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate laparotomy and treatment of hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. \n【7】 For stable patients, surgical treatment is usually laparoscopic surgery; sometimes laparotomy is required.  If possible, salpingotomy is done to conserve the tube, and the ectopic pregnancy is removed.  Salpingectomy is indicated in any of the following cases: The ectopic pregnancy has ruptured.  Hemorrhage continues after salpingotomy.  The tube has been reconstructed.  The ectopic pregnancy represents a failure of a previous sterilization procedure, particularly if the pregnancy is in the blind-ending distal segment in women who have had a previous partial salpingectomy.  Only the irreversibly damaged portion of the tube is removed, maximizing the chance that tubal repair can restore fertility.  The tube may or may not be repaired.  After a cornual pregnancy, the tube and ovary involved can usually be salvaged, but occasionally repair is impossible, making hysterectomy necessary.  All patients who are Rh-negative, whether managed with methotrexate or surgery, are given Rho(D) immune globulin Prevention .  Key Points Ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of a pregnancy in a site other than the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity; the most common site for ectopic pregnancies is a fallopian tube.  Symptoms can include pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding in a pregnant woman, but a women may not be aware she is pregnant and symptoms may be absent until rupture occurs, sometimes with catastrophic results.  Suspect ectopic pregnancy in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive or clinical findings suggest ectopic pregnancy, determine quantitative serum beta-hCG and do pelvic ultrasonography.  Treatment usually involves methotrexate, but surgical resection is done if rupture is suspected or criteria are not met for methotrexate treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 23:13:44"}

The middle ear contains 3 tiny bones that send your eardrum's vibrations to the nerves in your inner ear.  Acute otitis media is a painful type of ear infection in your middle ear.  It happens suddenly and usually gets better quickly.  If the infection doesn't go away or keeps coming back, it's called a chronic ear infection (Chronic Otitis Media) Your middle ear is a hollow space behind your eardrum. \n【1】 Inside the Ear What is an ear infection? Different parts of your ear can get infected, but you're most likely to have an infection in your middle ear.  \"Media\" means middle, and \"otitis\" means inflamed ear, so doctors call this infection otitis media.  It's \"acute\" when it happens quickly and gets better quickly.  Acute ear infections are caused by a virus or bacteria.  Having a common cold or allergies can lead to an ear infection.  The infection fills the middle ear with fluid.  With a bacterial infection, the fluid may be pus.  What are the symptoms of an acute ear infection? The most common symptoms are: Ear pain Hearing loss Infants may be cranky or have difficulty sleeping.  Young children may pull on their ear, have a fever, feel sick to their stomach, throw up, or have diarrhea.  If the infection causes a hole in the eardrum , fluid may drain from the ear.  This often relieves the pain.  What are the complications of an ear infection? Most people don't have complications.  Children who get a lot of ear infections may have: Long-term hearing loss A hole in the eardrum that keeps draining fluid  Very rarely, a bacterial infection can spread into the nearby skull bone or into the brain.  How can doctors tell if I have an ear infection? Doctors will use a handheld light to check if: Your eardrum is bulging or red There's fluid behind your eardrum How do doctors treat acute ear infections? Most acute ear infections go away with no treatment, but doctors may give you: Antibiotics Pain medicine, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen For adults, sometimes decongestant spray or pills For people with allergies, antihistamine pills If the ear pain is severe, doctors may need to drain fluid from your middle ear.  They may make a small hole in the eardrum to drain the fluid or place tubes in the eardrum to keep fluid draining properly.  How can I limit the risk of my children getting ear infections?

Most cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are caused by an inherited genetic defect.  People experience fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations (awareness of irregular heartbeats).  Doctors suspect the diagnosis based on physical examination findings, but they use echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis.  Medications that reduce the force of the heart’s contractions are given.  Cardiomyopathy refers to progressive impairment of the structure and function of the muscular walls of the heart chambers.  There are three main types of cardiomyopathy. \n【1】 The term cardiomyopathy is used only when a disorder directly affects the heart muscle.  Other disorders, such as high blood pressure and abnormal heart valves (such as aortic stenosis), also can eventually cause thickened heart muscle and heart failure.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden death in young athletes Sudden Cardiac Death in Athletes An estimated 1 to 3 per 100,000 apparently healthy young athletes develop an abrupt-onset heart rhythm abnormality and die suddenly during exercise. \n【2】 At least 1 in 500 people is affected.  Causes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is nearly always caused by a genetic defect.  The defect may be a Spontaneous genetic mutation Inherited genetic defect Very rarely, people acquire hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when they have disorders such as acromegaly Gigantism and Acromegaly Overproduction of growth hormone causes excessive growth.  In children, the condition is called gigantism.  In adults, it is called acromegaly. \n【3】 Complications The thick, stiff walls of the ventricles do not relax appropriately to allow the heart chambers to fill with blood.  This difficulty becomes more severe when the heart beats quickly (as during exercise) because there is then even less time for the heart to fill.  Because the heart does not fill properly, it pumps less blood with each beat.  Sometimes the thickened heart walls also interfere with blood flow out of the heart.  This variation is called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  Because the ventricle walls thicken, the mitral valve (the valve that opens between the left atrium and the left ventricle) may be unable to close normally, resulting in leakage of blood back into the left atrium .  This valve leakage and the enlarged ventricular walls typically cause abnormal heart sounds (heart murmurs).  Abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart. \n【4】 Symptoms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptoms are highly variable, but when they occur, they usually develop when people are between ages 20 and 40.  Symptoms first occur during exercise and include Fainting (syncope) Chest pain Shortness of breath Sensation of irregular heartbeats (palpitations) Fainting usually occurs suddenly without any warning symptoms.  Fainting or even sudden death may be the first sign that a person has this condition.  Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Echocardiography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart Doctors usually suspect the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on the person's symptoms, the results of a physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and a chest x-ray.  The heart sounds and any murmurs heard through a stethoscope may be helpful.  Although ECG and echocardiography are not recommended for all young competitive athletes, all such athletes should be evaluated Sudden Cardiac Death in Athletes An estimated 1 to 3 per 100,000 apparently healthy young athletes develop an abrupt-onset heart rhythm abnormality and die suddenly during exercise. \n【5】 Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.  It uses no x-rays. \n【6】 Cardiac catheterization and Coronary Angiography Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are minimally invasive methods of studying the heart and the blood vessels that supply the heart (coronary arteries) without doing surgery. \n【7】 Because hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually caused by a gene mutation, genetic testing may also be done to help identify affected relatives.  Prognosis for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy About 1% of adults with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy die each year.  Children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are more likely to die than adults.  Other factors that suggest a greater risk of death include the following: Family history of sudden death, particularly premature sudden death Unexplained fainting, cardiac arrest, or ventricular tachycardia Occurrence of rapid and abnormal heart rhythms Severity of thickening in the heart muscle Inability of the heart to pump enough blood Characteristic MRI appearance Death is usually sudden, presumably due to an abnormal heart rhythm Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart. \n【8】 People who learn that they have inherited this disorder should have genetic counseling when they plan a family because they have a 50% chance of passing this disorder on to their offspring.  First-degree family members (siblings or children) of people who have this inherited disorder should have their heart evaluated (with either genetic testing and/or routine echocardiography).  Treatment of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Drugs such as a beta-blocker and/or a calcium channel blocker Sometimes a procedure to improve blood flow Sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator If possible, doctors treat the condition causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is aimed primarily at reducing the heart’s resistance to filling with blood between heartbeats.  Drugs for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Beta-blockers and the calcium channel blocker verapamil—taken separately or together—are the main treatment.  Both reduce the force of heart muscle contraction.  As a result, the heart can fill better and, if the thickened muscle was blocking blood flow, blood can flow out of the heart more easily.  Also, beta-blockers and verapamil slow the heart rate, so that the heart has more time to fill.  Sometimes, disopyramide, a drug that decreases the strength of heart contractions, is also used.  Amiodarone is sometimes used to treat abnormal heart rhythms.  Mavacamten seems to relieve symptoms and increase exercise tolerance.  Myectomy Surgery to remove some of the thickened heart muscle (myectomy) can improve the flow of blood from the heart, but surgery is done only when symptoms are incapacitating despite drug therapy.  Myectomy can relieve symptoms, but it does not reduce the risk of death.  When myectomy is done in hospitals that have extensive experience doing the procedure, long-term results are excellent.  Alcohol ablation (controlled destruction of a small area of heart muscle by injecting it with alcohol) is increasingly being used in certain people to improve blood flow from the heart because it can be done during cardiac catheterization and Coronary Angiography Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are minimally invasive methods of studying the heart and the blood vessels that supply the heart (coronary arteries) without doing surgery. \n【9】 Although cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure in which a catheter is threaded into the heart, it has fewer risks in people who are at high risk of complications if they have heart surgery.  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator People who have severe heart muscle thickening, especially thickening of the wall that separates the heart chambers (cardiac septum), have a high risk of developing deadly abnormal heart rhythms which cause sudden death.  Doctors may recommend an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Cardioversion-Defibrillation There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

It also uses them to synthesize hormones and other substances needed for the body’s activities. \n【1】 Lifestyle, genetics, disorders (such as low thyroid hormone levels or kidney disease), drugs, or a combination can contribute.  Atherosclerosis can result, causing angina, heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral arterial disease.  Doctors measure levels of triglycerides and the various types of cholesterol in blood.  Exercise, dietary changes, and drugs can be effective.   Important fats (lipids) in the blood are Cholesterol Triglycerides Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes, of brain and nerve cells, and of bile, which helps the body absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins.  The body uses cholesterol to make vitamin D and various hormones, such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol.  The body can produce all the cholesterol that it needs, but it also obtains cholesterol from food.  Triglycerides, which are contained in fat cells, can be broken down, then used to provide energy for the body’s metabolic processes, including growth.  Triglycerides are produced in the intestine and liver from smaller fats called fatty acids Fats .  Some types of fatty acids are made by the body, but others must be obtained from food.  Lipoproteins: Lipid Carriers are particles of proteins and other substances.  They carry fats, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, which cannot circulate freely in the blood by themselves.  There are different types of lipoproteins , including Chylomicrons High-density lipoproteins (HDL) Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) Levels of lipoproteins and therefore lipids, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increase slightly as people age.  Levels are normally slightly higher in men than in women, but levels increase in women after menopause.  The increase in levels of lipoproteins that occurs with age can result in dyslipidemia. \n【2】 Atherosclerosis can affect the arteries that supply blood to the heart , those that supply blood to the brain , and those that supply the rest of the body .  Therefore, having a high total cholesterol level also increases the risk of having a heart attack Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery. \n【3】 Having a low total cholesterol level is generally considered better than having a high one.  However, having a very low cholesterol level may not be healthy either ,hypolipidemia is abnormally low levels of lipids in the blood .  Although there is no natural cutoff between normal and abnormal cholesterol levels, for adults, a total cholesterol level of less than 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL [< 5. 1 mmol/L]) is desirable.  And many people benefit from keeping the lipid level even lower.  In parts of the world (such as China and Japan) where the average cholesterol level is 150 mg/dL (3. 8 mmol/L), coronary artery disease is less common than it is in countries such as the United States.  The risk of a heart attack more than doubles when the total cholesterol level approaches 300 mg/dL (7. 7 mmol/L).  The total cholesterol level is only a general guide to the risk of atherosclerosis.  Levels of the components of total cholesterol—particularly LDL and HDL cholesterol—are more important.  A high level of LDL (bad) cholesterol increases the risk.  A high level of HDL (good) cholesterol is not usually considered a disorder because it decreases the risk of atherosclerosis.  However, a low level of HDL cholesterol (defined as less than 40 mg/dL [less than 1 mmol/L]) is associated with increased risk.  Experts consider an LDL cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL (2. 6 mmol/L) desirable.  Whether high triglyceride levels increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke is uncertain.  Triglyceride levels higher than 150 mg/dL (1. 7 mmol/L) are considered abnormal, but high levels do not appear to increase risk for everyone.  For people with high triglyceride levels, the risk of heart attack or stroke is increased if they also have a low HDL cholesterol level, diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【4】 A high level of HDL—the good—cholesterol may be beneficial and is not considered a disorder.  A level that is too low increases the risk of atherosclerosis.  Lipoprotein (a) is a combination of LDL with an additional protein attached to it.  Levels higher than about 30 mg/dL (or 75 nmol/L) are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis.  High levels are inherited.  Lipoprotein (a) is not affected by diet or most lipid-lowering drugs.  It usually only needs to be measured once.  Causes of Dyslipidemia Factors that cause dyslipidemia are categorized into Primary: Genetic (hereditary) causes Secondary: Lifestyle and other causes Both primary and secondary causes contribute to dyslipidemia in varying degrees.  For example, a person with a hereditary hyperlipidemia may have even higher lipid levels if the person also has secondary causes of hyperlipidemia.  Primary (hereditary) dyslipidemia Primary causes involve gene mutations that cause the body to produce too much LDL cholesterol or triglycerides or to fail to remove those substances.  Some causes involve underproduction or excessive removal of HDL cholesterol.  Primary causes tend to be inherited and thus to run in families.  Some of the genetic causes of dyslipidemia are discussed here and elsewhere in THE MANUAL Other Rare Hereditary Disorders of Lipid Metabolism disorders are hereditary metabolic disorders.  Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes that cause these disorders on to their children. \n【5】 Cholesterol and triglyceride levels are highest in people with primary dyslipidemias, which interfere with the body’s metabolism and elimination of lipids.  People can also inherit a tendency for HDL cholesterol to be unusually low. \n【6】 Peripheral arterial disease Overview of Peripheral Arterial Disease results in reduced blood flow in the arteries of the trunk, arms, and legs. \n【7】 Very high triglyceride levels can cause pancreatitis Overview of Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas.  The pancreas is a leaf-shaped organ about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) long. \n【8】 In people who have a genetic disorder that causes high triglyceride levels (such as familial hypertriglyceridemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia), certain disorders and substances can increase triglycerides to extremely high levels.  Examples of disorders include poorly controlled diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【9】 Examples of substances include excessive alcohol consumption and use of certain drugs, such as estrogens (taken by mouth), that increase triglyceride levels.  Symptoms can include fatty deposits (eruptive xanthomas) in the skin on the front of the legs and back of the arms, an enlarged spleen and liver, abdominal pain, and a decreased sensitivity to touch due to nerve damage.  These disorders can cause pancreatitis Overview of Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. \n【10】 Limiting fat intake (to less than 50 grams a day) can help prevent nerve damage and pancreatitis.  Losing weight and not drinking alcohol can also help.  Lipid-lowering drugs may be effective.  Familial combined hyperlipidemia In familial combined hyperlipidemia, the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, or both may be high.  This disorder affects about 1 to 2% of people. \n【11】 Treatment of familial combined hyperlipidemia involves limiting intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar as well as exercising and, when applicable, losing weight.  Many people with this disorder need to take lipid-lowering drugs.  Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia In familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and total cholesterol and triglycerides are high.  These levels are high because an unusual form of VLDL accumulates in the blood.  Fatty deposits (xanthomas) may form in the skin over the elbows and knees and in the palms, where they can cause yellow creases.  This uncommon disorder results in the early development of severe atherosclerosis.  By middle age, atherosclerosis often produces blockages in the coronary and peripheral arteries.  Treatment of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia involves achieving and maintaining recommended body weight and limiting intake of cholesterol, saturated fats, and carbohydrates.  A lipid-lowering drug is usually needed.  With treatment, lipid levels can be improved, the progression of atherosclerosis may be slowed, and the fatty deposits in the skin may become smaller or disappear.  Familial hypercholesterolemia In familial hypercholesterolemia, the total cholesterol level is high.  People may have inherited one abnormal gene or they may have inherited two abnormal genes, one from each parent.  People who have two abnormal genes (homozygotes) are more severely affected than people who have only one abnormal gene (heterozygotes).  About 1 in 200 people are heterozygotes, and 1 in 250,000 to 1 in 1 million people are homozygotes.  Affected people may have fatty deposits (xanthomas) in the tendons at the heels, knees, elbows, and fingers.  Rarely, xanthomas appear by age 10.  Familial hypercholesterolemia can result in rapidly progressive atherosclerosis and early death due to coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked.  The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. \n【12】 Children with two abnormal genes may have a heart attack or angina by age 20, and men with one abnormal gene often develop coronary artery disease between ages 30 and 50.  Women with one abnormal gene are also at increased risk, but the risk usually starts about 10 years later than in men.  People who smoke or have high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity may develop atherosclerosis even earlier.  Treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia begins with following a diet that is low in saturated fats and cholesterol.  When applicable, losing weight, stopping smoking, and increasing physical activity are advised.  One or more lipid-lowering drugs are usually needed.  Some people require apheresis Plasma exchange In apheresis, blood is removed from a person and then returned after substances are removed from it. \n【13】 Some people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia may benefit from liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions. \n【14】 Early diagnosis and treatment can decrease the increased risk of heart attack and stroke.  Familial hypertriglyceridemia In familial hypertriglyceridemia, triglyceride levels are high. \n【15】 When applicable, losing weight and limiting alcohol and carbohydrate consumption often lower triglyceride levels to normal.  If these measures are ineffective, use of a lipid-lowering drug can help.  For people who also have diabetes, good control of the diabetes is important.  Hypoalphalipoproteinemia In hypoalphalipoproteinemia, the HDL cholesterol level is low.  A low HDL cholesterol level is often inherited.  Many different genetic abnormalities can cause the low HDL level.  Since drugs that raise HDL cholesterol do not decrease the risk of atherosclerosis, hypoalphalipoproteinemia is treated by lowering LDL cholesterol.  Lipoprotein lipase deficiency and apolipoprotein CII deficiency are rare disorders caused by the lack of certain proteins needed for the removal of triglyceride-containing particles.  In these disorders, the body cannot remove chylomicrons from the bloodstream, resulting in very high triglyceride levels.  Without treatment, levels are often considerably higher than 1,000 mg/dL (11 mmol/L).  Symptoms appear during childhood and young adulthood.  They include recurring bouts of abdominal pain, an enlarged liver and spleen, and pinkish yellow bumps in the skin on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, front of the legs, and back of the arms.  These bumps, called eruptive xanthomas, are deposits of fat.  Eating fats worsens symptoms. \n【16】 People who have this disorder must strictly limit the amount of all types of fat—saturated, unsaturated, and polyunsaturated—in their diet.  People may need to take vitamin supplements to make up for nutrients missing from their diets.  There are some therapies in development for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency and apolipoprotein CII deficiency.  Secondary dyslipidemia Secondary causes contribute to many cases of dyslipidemia.  The most important secondary cause of dyslipidemia is A sedentary lifestyle with excessive dietary intake of total calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats  Some other common secondary causes include the following: Having diabetes mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【17】 One person can eat large amounts of animal fat, and the total cholesterol level does not rise above desirable levels.  Another person can follow a strict low-fat diet, and the total cholesterol does not fall below a high level.  This difference seems to be mostly genetically determined.  A person’s genetic makeup influences the rate at which the body makes, uses, and disposes of these fats.  Also, body type does not always predict levels of cholesterol.  Some overweight people have low cholesterol levels, and some thin people have high levels.  Eating excess calories can result in high triglyceride levels, as can consuming large amounts of alcohol.  dy type does not predict cholesterol levels.  Some disorders cause lipid levels to increase.  Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【18】 Some liver disorders  and an underactive thyroid gland  can cause the total cholesterol level to increase.  Use of drugs such as estrogens (taken by mouth), oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, retinoids, thiazide diuretics (to some extent), cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and antiviral drugs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. \n【19】 Cigarette smoking, HIV infection, poorly controlled diabetes, or kidney disorders (such as nephrotic syndrome) may contribute to a low HDL cholesterol level.  Drugs such as beta-blockers and anabolic steroids can lower the HDL cholesterol level.  Symptoms of Dyslipidemia High lipid levels in the blood usually cause no symptoms.  Occasionally, when levels are particularly high, fat is deposited in the skin and tendons and forms bumps called xanthomas.  Sometimes people develop opaque white or gray rings at the edge of the cornea.  Very high triglyceride levels can cause the liver or spleen to enlarge, a tingling or burning sensation in the hands and feet, difficulty breathing, and confusion and may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis Overview of Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. \n【20】 Pancreatitis can cause severe abdominal pain and is occasionally fatal.  Symptoms of Dyslipidemia Achilles Tendon Xanthomas are diagnostic of familial hypercholesterolemia. \n【21】 Davidson, MD.  Tendon Xanthomas are diagnostic of familial hypercholesterolemia.  Eruptive Xanthoma People who have severe elevations of triglycerides can have eruptive xanthomas over the trunk, back, elbows, buttocks, knees, hands, and feet. \n【22】 Xanthelasma are sometimes present in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia but can also be present in people with normal cholesterol levels.  Xanthelasma (Eyelid) This man has yellowish skin growths on his upper eyelids, which can be a sign of high cholesterol levels. \n【23】MultimediaPopup. LabTest Levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides—the lipid profile—are measured in a blood sample.  Because consuming food or beverages may cause triglyceride levels to increase temporarily, people must fast at least 12 hours before the blood sample is taken.  When lipid levels in the blood are very high, special blood tests are done to identify the specific underlying disorder.  Specific disorders include several hereditary disorders (primary dyslipidemias), which produce different lipid abnormalities and have different risks.  rgarines made primarily from liquid oil (squeeze or tub margarines) and those that contain plant stanols or sterols, unlike stick margarines, are healthier substitutes for butter for people who need to limit their butter.  Screening The fasting lipid profile, is the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol measured after a person fasts for 12 hours.  Doctors usually do this test every 5 years starting at age 20 as part of assessing whether the person is at risk of coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. \n【24】 In addition to measuring lipid levels, doctors also screen for other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【25】 In children and adolescents, screening with a fasting lipid profile is recommended between the ages of 2 and 8 years if the child has risk factors, such as a family member with severe dyslipidemia or one who developed coronary artery disease at a young age.  In children with no risk factors, screening with a non-fasting lipid profile is usually done once before the child reaches puberty (usually between age 9 to 11) and once more between the ages of 17 to 21.  Treatment of Dyslipidemia Lose weight Exercise Decrease saturated fats in the diet Often lipid-lowering drugs Usually, the best treatment for people is to lose weight if they are overweight, stop smoking if they smoke, decrease the total amount of saturated fat and cholesterol in their diet, increase physical activity, and then, if necessary, take a lipid-lowering drug.  Regular physical activity can help lower triglyceride levels and increase the HDL cholesterol level.  An example is walking briskly for at least 30 minutes daily.  Treating children may be challenging.  The American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute recommend treatment for some children with high lipid levels.  Diet changes are recommended.  Lipid-lowering drugs may be given to some children with very high lipid levels who do not respond to changes in diet, particularly children with familial hypercholesterolemia.  Lipid-lowering diet A diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol can lower the LDL cholesterol level.  However, people with high triglyceride levels also need to avoid consuming large amounts of sugar (whether in foods or beverages), refined flour (such as is used in most commercial baked goods), and starchy foods (such as potatoes and rice).  The type of fat consumed is important .  Fats may be saturated, polyunsaturated, or monounsaturated.  Saturated fats increase cholesterol levels more than other forms of fat.  Saturated fats should provide no more than 5 to 7% of total calories consumed each day.  Polyunsaturated fats (which include omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats) may help decrease levels of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol in the blood.  The fat content of most foods is included on the label of the container.  Large amounts of saturated fats occur in meats, egg yolks, full-fat dairy products, some nuts (such as macadamia nuts), and coconut.  Vegetable oils contain smaller amounts of saturated fat, but only some vegetable oils are truly low in saturated fats.  Margarine, which is produced from polyunsaturated vegetable oils, is usually a healthier substitute for butter, which is high in saturated fat (about 60%).  However, stick margarines (and some processed foods) contain trans fats, which may increase LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and lower HDL (good) cholesterol levels.  Margarines made primarily from liquid oil (squeeze or tub margarines) contain less saturated fat than butter, contain no cholesterol, and contain fewer trans fats than stick margarines.  Margarines (and other food products) that contain plant stanols or sterols can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.  ting oat bran, oatmeal, beans, peas, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, strawberries, and apple pulp can help lower cholesterol.  Eating lots of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, which are naturally low in fat and contain no cholesterol, is recommended.  Also recommended are foods rich in soluble fiber, which binds fats in the intestine and helps lower the cholesterol level.  Such foods include oat bran, oatmeal, beans, peas, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, strawberries, and apple pulp.  Psyllium, usually taken to relieve constipation, can also lower the cholesterol level.   Lipid-lowering drugs Treatment with lipid-lowering drugs depends not only on the lipid levels but also on whether coronary artery disease, diabetes, or other major risk factors for coronary artery disease Risk Factors Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked. \n【26】 For people who have coronary artery disease or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke can be decreased by the use of the lipid-lowering drugs called statins.  People who have very high cholesterol levels or who have other high risk factors for heart attack or stroke also may benefit from taking lipid-lowering drugs.  There are different types of lipid-lowering drugs: Statins Cholesterol absorption inhibitors Bile acid binders PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors Fibric acid derivatives Supplements of omega-3 fats Niacin Bempedoic acid Each type lowers lipid levels by a different mechanism.  Consequently, the different types of drugs have different side effects and may affect lipid levels differently.  Following a diet low in saturated fat when drugs are used is recommended.  Lipid-lowering drugs do more than lower lipid levels—they can also prevent coronary artery disease.  In addition, statins have been shown to reduce the risk of early death.  People with very high triglyceride levels and who are at risk of pancreatitis may need both diet changes and triglyceride-lowering drugs, usually a fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids.   Procedures to reduce cholesterol Medical procedures that lower cholesterol levels are reserved for people with very high levels of LDL cholesterol that do not respond to diet and lipid-lowering drugs.  Such people include those with familial hypercholesterolemia.  LDL apheresis is the most commonly done procedure.  LDL apheresis is a non-surgical procedure where blood is drawn from the person and the LDL component is separated from the rest of the blood in a special machine.  The blood (minus the LDL component) is then returned to the person.  Treating causes of elevated cholesterol Any conditions that cause or are risk factors for elevations in cholesterol levels also need to be treated.  So people with diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【27】 Kidney disease, liver disease, and hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions. \n【28】 If a drug is causing the cholesterol elevation, doctors may give the person a lower dose or a different drug instead.  Monitoring treatment Doctors usually do blood tests 2 to 3 months after treatment has started to determine whether lipid levels are decreasing.  Once lipid levels have decreased sufficiently, doctors do blood tests once or twice a year.  Doctors no longer use specific targets for lipid levels.  Instead, doctors try to lower the lipid levels by a certain percentage, typically about 30 to 50%.  Because some lipid-lowering drugs can sometimes cause muscle and liver problems, doctors usually do blood tests when the person starts drug therapy.  Then, if the person develops side effects, initial (baseline) measurements are available for comparison.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义重复#3#26#diabetes mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high  这段话重复出现多次", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-16 23:29:09", "update_time": "2024-04-17 22:43:28"}
