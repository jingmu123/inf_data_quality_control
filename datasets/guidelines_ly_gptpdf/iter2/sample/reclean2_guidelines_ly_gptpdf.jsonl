In considering the decision-making ICERs, the committee accounted for all the confidential discounts for comparator and subsequent treatments. This included the impact of the loss of price exclusivity on the price for lenalidomide. During the second committee meeting, it considered the live interim tender price for lenalidomide as provided by the Cancer Drugs Fund lead. It also considered pricing scenarios including the estimated price discount for generic lenalidomide up to and including a 100% discount (that is, no cost for lenalidomide). During the third committee meeting, the committee considered the nationally available tender price for generic lenalidomide as confirmed by the Commercial Medicines Unit. The prices agreed through the framework are commercial in confidence. The committee noted that the company's and the ERG's base-case probabilistic ICERs (accounting for all the confidential discounts including lenalidomide) for tafasitamab with lenalidomide compared with polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab were higher than the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources for treatments given at the end of life. The exact results cannot be reported here because they include confidential discounts for other treatments. The committee further considered that accepting the appeal panel's conclusion that the short life expectancy criterion is met created an inconsistency.

Postvoid residual volume\n\n【7】There does not seem to be any consensus on what constitutes a significant postvoid residual volume (PVR) in women without neurological disease, and most studies investigating the topic assess mixed populations. The panel therefore suggests the additional use of bladder voiding efficiency (BVE), where BVE = (voided volume/voided volume + PVR) × 100 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[17]</u></u>.

Pad testing\n\n【15】Two SRs assessed the utility of pad testing for UI 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[29,30]</u></u>. It has been shown that 1-h pad tests have high diagnostic accuracy, but variation in standardisation of the parameters used (bladder volume and degree of provocation) reduces their utility in daily clinical practice. Tests of shorter duration (1 h) and tests of longer duration (24–48 h) have comparable diagnostic accuracy 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[10,30]</u></u>. However, lack of evidence on reproducibility of home-based tests with varying activity levels remains difficult. These tests may therefore be more useful in the research setting than in routine practice.\n\n【16】### 3.1.8.

Medial degeneration is a prerequisite for aortic dissection to occur in most if not all patients and likely precedes the acute event by many years. Understanding the complex interplay among morphological, hemodynamic, and biomechanical factors is a prerequisite for developing risk prediction models, for personalizing contemporary treatment options, and for conceiving and developing new treatment strategies.\n\n【2】Originally, chronic aortic dissection was defined as the period after the first 14 days after onset of symptoms because most dissection-related complications occur within this time. A refined, contemporary classification subdivides the phases of aortic dissection into a hyper-acute phase (first 24 hours) within the acute phase (up to 14 days after onset), followed by a subacute phase (15-90 days after onset), and chronic phase (>90 days after onset).\n\n【3】#### Prevalence and Economic Impact\n\n【4】The prevalence of patients living with chronic aortic dissection in the United States is unknown and difficult to ascertain. This is an important gap in our knowledge and limits our ability to estimate the long-term quality of life and cost-effectiveness of evolving, personalized treatment or prevention strategies. In the first postevent year alone, the costs of care for the relatively small population of patients with chronic aortic dissection are substantial compared with the general population. The cumulative expenses for long-term specialty care, rehabilitation, surveillance, and preoperative and postoperative imaging, combined with frequent readmissions for elective or emergency surgical or endovascular repair, are likely to further escalate over time. Unfortunately, actual health care costs data beyond the first year after index hospitalization are not readily available.\n\n【5】A rough approximation of the prevalence of chronic aortic dissection, assuming a conservative incidence rate of 4 to 6 per 100,000 per year and conservatively assuming an average survival of 7 years for all subgroups, suggests a prevalence of 28 to 42 per 100,000 or 92,000 to 138,000 survivors of acute dissection in the United States. This corresponds well to the age-adjusted prevalence of 26 per 100,000 that is based on hospital administrative data in Manitoba, Canada, which has a reported incidence of acute dissections of 3.8 per 100,000 per year. For radiologists and others who routinely interpret vascular computed tomography (CT) studies, these numbers imply that many more CT scans are performed during the chronic than the acute phase of aortic dissection. The much larger proportion of chronic versus acute phase clinical imaging studies is illustrated in a small cohort of 47 patients with uncomplicated type B dissection occurring between 2003 and 2012 who were followed up for up to 17 years . In addition to their 47 baseline scans, these patients underwent a total of 363 follow-up scans, or 7.7 follow-up scans per patient.\n\n【6】### Anatomic Spectrum of Chronic Aortic Dissection\n\n【7】The spectrum of patients living with chronic aortic dissection at a given point in time reflects the cumulative outcomes of multiple past events and depends on 删除11:<u>(1)</u> the initial spectrum of the disease, 删除11:<u>(2)</u> the differences in survival between groups, and 删除11:<u>(3)</u> the outcomes of any surgical or endovascular interventions.

This document updates the Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections through Hand Hygiene, published in 2014. This expert guidance document is sponsored by SHEA. It is the product of a collaborative effort led by SHEA, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and The Joint Commission, with major contributions from representatives of organizations and societies with content expertise.\n\n【6】删除19:<u>(Received 14 November 2022; accepted 15 November 2022)</u>\n\n【7】### Purpose\n\n【8】Previously published guidelines provided comprehensive recommendations for detecting and preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The intent of this document is to highlight practical recommendations in a concise format designed to assist acute-care hospitals in implementing and prioritizing efforts to prevent HAIs through hand hygiene. This document updates the *Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections through Hand Hygiene*, published in 2014. This expert guidance document is sponsored by SHEA. It is the product of a collaborative effort led by the SHEA, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and The Joint Commission, with major contributions from representatives of organizations and societies with content expertise.\n\n【9】### Summary of major changes\n\n【10】This section lists major changes from the *Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections Through Hand Hygiene: 2014 Update*, including recommendations that have been added, removed, or altered. Recommendations in this document are categorized as “essential practices” that are foundational to all HAI programs in acute-care hospitals. In 2014, these were “basic practices,” renamed to highlight their importance as foundational for hospitals’ healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevention programs. Some recommendations are “additional approaches” that may be considered for use in locations and/or populations within hospitals during outbreaks or when HAIs are not controlled after implementation of essential practices. In 2014, these were “special approaches.”\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](0_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2022 SHEA／IDSA／APIC实践建议：通过手部卫生预防卫生保健相关感染的策略（更新）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:23:17", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:23:53", "cost": 35.901}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:29", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:23:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:23:17"}

Black patients with advanced prostate cancer demonstrate worse outcomes, and understanding the societal and biological underpinnings of these disparities is a critical area of need. Personalized care with predictive markers for treatment selection based on tumor and host biology have not yet been achieved. PSMA imaging is changing the landscape of advanced prostate cancer. As we learn more about its utility in the management of these patients, we will soon also be able to treat these patients with precision guided therapy. The emerging field of theranostics will add further benefit and complexity to the sequencing dilemmas. Emerging evidence supports the use of SBRT as MDT for oligometastatic genitourinary cancers in Phase 2 trials. With the widening use of next-generation imaging, application of MDT as SOC requires definitive trials. Improving responses by treating high-risk patients in a neoadjuvant approach prior to surgery based on tumor susceptibilities is another area of developing interest.\n\n【2】There are many additional unmet needs. These include high-level evidence directed at understanding the optimal sequencing of advanced prostate cancer therapies. Further, we need additional studies and data to guide clinicians and patients in terms of treatment intensification and combinations of therapy. Improving access to care for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged is also a future goal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 AUA_SUO指南：晚期前列腺癌（更新版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 15:47:06", "endTime": "2024/08/05 15:49:07", "cost": 121.421}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:29", "update_time": "2024-08-04 23:49:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 23:47:06"}

Inhibition of PI3K leads to acute insulin resistance, blocking insulin's ability to suppress hepatic glucose issue, activating hepatic glycogenolysis, causing hyperglycemia and a compensatory increase in circulating insulin. Preclinical data suggest that the resulting hyperinsulinemia can partially reactivate the PI3K pathway. Acute hyperglycemia needs to be diagnosed and acted upon because it can cause volume depletion, electrolyte disturbances, catabolic weight loss, and, very rarely, hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis.

Among patients with a birthing injury, clinically relevant FI is more commonly observed in multiparous women and in patients who had instrument-assisted deliveries. Some women develop delayed FI, which can make it difficult to determine whether the FI is associated with prior, sometimes remote, sphincter injury or with other factors such as menopause, pelvic organ prolapse, internal intussusception, obesity, or aging. Additional causes of FI include sphincter injury from anorectal procedures (eg, hemorrhoidectomy, sphincterotomy, fistula surgery), hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, or transanal surgery, or after surgical or nonsurgical treatment for rectal cancer.\n\n【5】Patients with FI frequently have coexisting pelvic floor disorders and may benefit from a multidisciplinary evaluation. For example, patients with concurrent constipation represent a specific phenotype of FI that may be related to pelvic organ prolapse or internal rectal intussusception. Addressing the FI alone in this subgroup may not significantly improve patients' quality of life.\n\n【6】A detailed history goes beyond simply accounting for prior obstetric injury, anorectal surgery, or perineal trauma. For example, assessing changes in stool consistency and potential causative factors, dietary modifications, changes in medications and supplements, food intolerances, and allergies may help elucidate the underlying cause of FI. Operations such as cholecystectomy and gastric bypass can alter stool consistency and frequency and should also be considered when evaluating patients.\n\n【7】**Measures That Assess the Nature and Severity of Incontinence and the Impact of Incontinence on Quality of Life Should Be Used as a Part of the Assessment of FI**\n\n【8】A number of instruments have been developed to describe the type, frequency, and degree of incontinence as well as the impact of FI on quality of life. FI severity has been assessed most commonly with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, the St. Marks Fecal Incontinence Score (Vaizey Score), and the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (Wexner Score), although other measures of FI also have been reported. Using objective measures of severity can help establish baseline scores for a particular patient, measure response to treatment over time, and permit comparisons among groups of patients treated with different strategies.\n\n【9】A Wexner score of 9 or higher indicates a significant impairment of quality of life and is the threshold at which patients will commonly seek medical care. The Fecal Incontinence Quality-of-Life Scale is an incontinence-specific quality-of-life measure commonly used in conjunction with more general quality-of-life measures such as the Short Form 36 and is more commonly used in the research setting. A recent review by the ASCRS Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium suggested that standardizing measurements would be beneficial in streamlining clinical care and research regarding patients with FI and recommended the routine use of a combination instrument labeled “IMPACT” (Initial Measurement of Patient-Reported Pelvic Floor Complaints Tool) that combines the Wexner and the Vaizey scores while limiting the number of questions patients are asked.\n\n【10】All of these instruments are based on patients' subjective experience of FI. A bowel diary that documents the daily number and severity of FI episodes may help clinicians quantify disease severity before and after therapeutic intervention. A cutoff of 50% or more reduction in the number of episodes per week has been used in recent FI studies as an objective measure of clinical improvement after an intervention.

Among patients with a birthing injury, clinically relevant FI is more commonly observed in multiparous women and in patients who had instrument-assisted deliveries. Some women develop delayed FI, which can make it difficult to determine whether the FI is associated with prior, sometimes remote, sphincter injury or with other factors such as menopause, pelvic organ prolapse, internal intussusception, obesity, or aging. Additional causes of FI include sphincter injury from anorectal procedures (eg, hemorrhoidectomy, sphincterotomy, fistula surgery), hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, or transanal surgery, or after surgical or nonsurgical treatment for rectal cancer.\n\n【5】Patients with FI frequently have coexisting pelvic floor disorders and may benefit from a multidisciplinary evaluation. For example, patients with concurrent constipation represent a specific phenotype of FI that may be related to pelvic organ prolapse or internal rectal intussusception. Addressing the FI alone in this subgroup may not significantly improve patients' quality of life.\n\n【6】A detailed history goes beyond simply accounting for prior obstetric injury, anorectal surgery, or perineal trauma. For example, assessing changes in stool consistency and potential causative factors, dietary modifications, changes in medications and supplements, food intolerances, and allergies may help elucidate the underlying cause of FI. Operations such as cholecystectomy and gastric bypass can alter stool consistency and frequency and should also be considered when evaluating patients.\n\n【7】**Measures That Assess the Nature and Severity of Incontinence and the Impact of Incontinence on Quality of Life Should Be Used as a Part of the Assessment of FI**\n\n【8】A number of instruments have been developed to describe the type, frequency, and degree of incontinence as well as the impact of FI on quality of life. FI severity has been assessed most commonly with the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, the St. Marks Fecal Incontinence Score (Vaizey Score), and the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (Wexner Score), although other measures of FI also have been reported. Using objective measures of severity can help establish baseline scores for a particular patient, measure response to treatment over time, and permit comparisons among groups of patients treated with different strategies.\n\n【9】A Wexner score of 9 or higher indicates a significant impairment of quality of life and is the threshold at which patients will commonly seek medical care. The Fecal Incontinence Quality-of-Life Scale is an incontinence-specific quality-of-life measure commonly used in conjunction with more general quality-of-life measures such as the Short Form 36 and is more commonly used in the research setting. A recent review by the ASCRS Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium suggested that standardizing measurements would be beneficial in streamlining clinical care and research regarding patients with FI and recommended the routine use of a combination instrument labeled “IMPACT” (Initial Measurement of Patient-Reported Pelvic Floor Complaints Tool) that combines the Wexner and the Vaizey scores while limiting the number of questions patients are asked.\n\n【10】All of these instruments are based on patients' subjective experience of FI. A bowel diary that documents the daily number and severity of FI episodes may help clinicians quantify disease severity before and after therapeutic intervention. A cutoff of 50% or more reduction in the number of episodes per week has been used in recent FI studies as an objective measure of clinical improvement after an intervention. Although this is the most commonly used measure of success in industry-sponsored trials, it has not been validated against other measures.\n\n【11】**A Physical Examination Is an Essential Component of the Evaluation of Patients With FI**\n\n【12】Elements of a focused clinical examination include external inspection and digital rectal examination.

For Bosniak III or IV cyst measuring ≤2 cm, active surveillance is now suggested as the preferred strategy.\n3. For Bosniak III or IV cyst measuring 2–4 cm, active surveillance or surgery are suggested as equal options.\n\n【3】The panel made these changes in an attempt to decrease the burden of care for patients, but also acknowledges the low-quality evidence supporting these changes. Consequently, we emphasize the need for shared decision-making. Patients opting for non-surgical strategies should be made aware of the higher uncertainty surrounding the data supporting their treatment of choice.\n\n【4】## INTRODUCTION\n\n【5】Cystic renal lesions are usually diagnosed incidentally on routine imaging. With the increasing use of abdominal imaging, there is a growing number of individuals being diagnosed with renal cystic disease. It is estimated that up to one-third of individuals over 60 years of age will be diagnosed with at least one simple renal cyst following abdominal imaging. Therefore, patients are often referred to urologists for guidance and management of these lesions.

Consequently, we emphasize the need for shared decision-making. Patients opting for non-surgical strategies should be made aware of the higher uncertainty surrounding the data supporting their treatment of choice.\n\n【4】## INTRODUCTION\n\n【5】Cystic renal lesions are usually diagnosed incidentally on routine imaging. With the increasing use of abdominal imaging, there is a growing number of individuals being diagnosed with renal cystic disease. It is estimated that up to one-third of individuals over 60 years of age will be diagnosed with at least one simple renal cyst following abdominal imaging. Therefore, patients are often referred to urologists for guidance and management of these lesions. Physicians need to distinguish cystic lesions from solid renal masses with necrotic components, which behave more aggressively. Hence, the characterization of these cystic renal masses is crucial to determine the best clinical approach. We reviewed the literature and updated the previous iteration of the CUA guideline with the aim of offering guidance to physicians managing cystic renal lesions and to standardize their management across Canada.\n\n【6】## METHODS\n\n【7】A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out on June 删除13:<u>30, 2016</u>, in MEDLINE and PubMed, which identified 77 relevant studies to inform the development of the 2017 CUA guideline on the management of these lesions.", "index": 171, "show": true, "start": 171, "end": 396, "province": ["信息质量", "完整性"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "缺少半个段落"}], "startTime": "2024/08/05 15:44:11", "endTime": "2024/08/05 15:45:06", "cost": 55.479}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:29", "update_time": "2024-08-04 23:45:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 23:44:10"}

The transducer frequency range should be 2 to 7 MHz for late second- and third-trimester scans, while a transducer with a frequency range of 5 to 12 MHz may be useful for late first-trimester and early second-trimester scans. Technological capabilities should include two-dimensional (2D; B-mode), M-mode, color flow and pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler ultrasound as minimum requirements. Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound may be used to characterize high flow velocities if available.

In addition, oximetry cannot reliably distinguish between obstructive or central apnoeas and nocturnal hypoventilation, which is important to help determine treatment.\n\n【1】The option to do the sleep study in hospital was also considered important by the committee. Hospital polygraphy may sometimes be needed when investigating alternative diagnoses alongside OSAHS, because extra monitoring channels can be used. It might also be an option if home respiratory polygraphy or home oximetry are impractical, for example, for people who need help with the monitoring equipment, or who need to travel long distances to pick up and return devices, or when a number of inpatient investigations need to be combined.\n\n【2】The committee agreed that further investigation with polysomnography, which is more accurate and more expensive than respiratory polygraphy, should be an option to provide more detail on sleep fragmentation and respiratory events for people with symptoms of OSAHS who have a negative respiratory polygraphy or oximetry result but continue to have suggestive symptoms. This may help distinguish between OSAHS and other disorders such as narcolepsy, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, periodic limb movement disorders, idiopathic hypersomnolence or parasomnias, which are suspected as a more likely diagnosis for the person's symptoms; or help diagnose these disorders when they are suspected in addition to OSAHS.\n\n【3】### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\n【4】Current practice is variable, with some sleep services offering oximetry as the first-line test and others offering home respiratory polygraphy. The recommendations will reduce this variation by encouraging the use of home respiratory polygraphy over home oximetry. Some services will need to provide more home respiratory polygraphy equipment and fewer home oximetry devices, but improved testing should lead to fewer repeat tests and optimal treatment. The option to use home oximetry as an alternative to respiratory polygraphy will lessen the impact on resources as practice changes.\n\n【5】The use of polysomnography for those who still have symptoms despite negative respiratory polygraphy results reflects current practice for this small population.\n\n【6】[Return to recommendations](#)\n\n【7】### Lifestyle advice for all severities of OSAHS\n\n【8】#### Recommendation 1.4.1", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 56, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【内分泌领域】2021NICE指南：16岁以上人群阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停／低通气综合征和肥胖通气不良综合征(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:48:27", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:52:57", "cost": 270.671}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:28", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:52:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:48:26"}

Class IIa, Level of Evidence: C |\n\n【2】**Topic 10: Return to operating a vehicle after heart transplantation**\n\n【3】The 2010 recommendations for the operation of a vehicle after heart transplantation (HT) were reviewed, and the details of the former and updated versions are summarized in the recommendations below. The decision regarding whether a HT recipient can resume driving should consider the balance between minimizing driving-related road safety risks for the individual and the community posed by the driver’s permanent or long-term injury or disability while also understanding the driver’s lifestyle and employment-related mobility independence. The updated recommendations highlight the heterogeneity of this group of patients.

Clinicopathologic factors can be used to guide decisions about whether to administer initial postoperative RAI 删除9:<u>(see *Clinicopathologic Factors in the NCCN Guidelines for Follicular [Thyroid] Carcinoma*)</u>. The NCCN Guidelines provide algorithms to assist in decision-making about use of RAI in different settings: 1) RAI is not typically indicated for patients classified as having a low risk of recurrence/disease-specific mortality; 2) RAI may be considered for patients without gross residual disease, but data are conflicting regarding the benefit of RAI in this setting; and 3) RAI is often used for patients with known or suspected distant metastatic disease 删除9:<u>(see *Clinicopathologic Factors in the NCCN Guidelines for Follicular [Thyroid] Carcinoma*)</u>.\n\n【3】Iodine-131 pre- and post-treatment imaging (with consideration of dosimetry for distant metastasis) is recommended for suspected or proven iodine-131--avid metastatic foci 删除9:<u>(see *RAI Being Considered Based on Clinicopathologic Features in the NCCN Guidelines for Follicular [Thyroid] Carcinoma*)</u>. In patients with known or suspected distant metastatic disease, radioiodine diagnostic imaging (iodine-123 or iodine-131) with adequate TSH stimulation (thyroid withdrawal or thyrotropin alfa) should be considered before iodine-131 therapy is administered, with attention to dosing recommendations 删除9:<u>(see *Principles of Radiation and Radioactive Iodine Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma*)</u> to avoid the problem of stunning, which may limit treatment effect 删除9:<u>(see section on *Diagnostic Whole Body Imaging and Thyroid Stunning* in this Discussion)</u>.

The anatomical examination may be technically easier at this stage, as the rapid growth of the fetus after this window may result in a more flexed position, a relative decrease in the quality of the acoustic window provided by the amniotic fluid and decreased penetration of the maturing fetal tissues, including increasing ossification of bones. On the other hand, the detection of growth deviations, both SGA and LGA, in low-risk cases may be more accurate towards 36 weeks, which has been an argument for moving the scan to this gestational stage. However, this would not apply to pregnancies at higher risk of complications, in which examination at around 32 weeks, or even earlier, has been proposed.\n\n【4】Therefore, the timing of the ultrasound scan between 32 and 36 weeks should be decided based on individual maternal and fetal characteristics, the risk level of the pregnancy and local objectives and resources.\n\n【5】**Recommendation**\n\n【6】- The timing of the third-trimester scan, if indicated, between 32 and 36 weeks, should be decided based on individual maternal and fetal characteristics, the risk level of the pregnancy and local objectives and resources (GOOD PRACTICE POINT)\n\n【7】### Technique for third-trimester ultrasound assessment\n\n【8】The techniques for ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry and wellbeing, as well as amniotic fluid volume, in the third trimester are similar to those used in the second trimester and should follow the ISUOG fetal biometry guideline. Similarly, the techniques for Doppler ultrasound assessment in the third trimester are similar to those described for use in the second trimester. These descriptions, tailored for use in the third trimester, are included in Appendices 2–4.\n\n【9】GA estimation may sometimes be necessary in late pregnancy, and was the subject of a recent systematic review. In most cases, GA will have been determined at an earlier ultrasound examination, preferably in the first trimester. At 11–14 weeks' gestation, crown–rump length measurement has a half-width 95% prediction interval of around 5 days, meaning that the 'true' GA will be within ± 5 days of the estimated GA 95% of the time. This is the most accurate dating available, and the pregnancy should not be redated using later scans. However, in women presenting for the first time in the third trimester, the GA should be determined using head circumference (HC) plus femur length (FL), or HC alone, if FL is not available. This method, though ranking highest in a recent systematic review, still has a variation of 15 days around the mean at 32 weeks. The head biometry (HC and biparietal diameter (BPD)) may be more difficult to measure accurately in late pregnancy, when the head is deeper in the maternal pelvis. A single-parameter formula using transcerebellar diameter, which is based on the relative sparing of this structure in growth abnormalities, has also been shown to have low 95% prediction.\n\n【10】Assessment of fetal wellbeing in the third trimester includes umbilical artery Doppler in high-risk pregnancies and, when indicated, should include additional Doppler parameters, such as middle cerebral artery (MCA), ductus venosus and maternal (uterine artery) Doppler velocimetry.\n\n【11】### Equipment required for third-trimester ultrasound assessment\n\n【12】The equipment required for third-trimester ultrasound assessment is similar to that for second-trimester ultrasound examination and should include, as a minimum, the following:\n\n【13】- real-time, grayscale ultrasound capability;\n- transabdominal transducer with suitable resolution and penetration (usually 2–9-MHz range);\n- adjustable acoustic power output controls with output display onscreen;\n- freeze-frame capability;\n- electronic calipers;\n- capacity to print/store images;\n- regular maintenance and servicing, important for optimal equipment performance;\n- suitable cleaning equipment and cleaning protocols;\n- color and pulsed Doppler;\n- transvaginal transducer.\n\n【14】### Fetal anomalies\n\n【15】Some fetal abnormalities will not be detected at the routine second-trimester anatomy scan, even with the best equipment in the most expert of hands. Broadly, there are two possible reasons for this: first, the anomaly was there but not seen, for example due to technical difficulties, such as increased maternal body mass index or fetal position; second, the natural history of some fetal abnormalities means that they develop or become visible only after the second-trimester scan; these are typically anomalies affecting the genitourinary tract, central nervous system (CNS) and heart.\n\n【16】Drukker et al. performed a systematic review of 13 studies, including over 140 000 women, and reported a prevalence of 3.7 per 1000 women with fetal anomalies diagnosed in the third trimester, the most common being", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/1_2024+ISUOG实践指南：妊娠晚期产科超声扫描的表现.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:04:57", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:07:49", "cost": 171.504}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:28", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:07:46", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:04:54"}

However, progression to AIDS and death will occur in the majority of individuals without treatment.\n- No randomized controlled trials have addressed when a person with HIV-2 should start antiretroviral therapy (ART) or which regimens are most effective for initial or second-line ART when treating HIV-2; thus, the optimal treatment strategy is not well defined.\n- Existing data on the treatment of HIV-2, and extrapolation from data on the treatment of HIV-1, suggest that ART should be started at or soon after HIV-2 diagnosis to prevent disease progression and transmission of HIV-2 to others (AII).\n- Quantitative plasma HIV-2 RNA viral load testing for clinical care is available and should be performed before initiation of ART (AIII).\n- HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and to enfuvirtide; therefore, these drugs should not be included in ART regimens for HIV-2 infection (AII).\n- Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV-2 coinfection should be prescribed ART regimens that contain drugs with activity against both HIV-2 and HBV (AIII).\n- Initial ART regimens for ART-naive patients who have HIV-2 mono-infection or HIV-1/HIV-2 coinfection should include an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (AII). An alternative regimen is a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) that is active against HIV-2 (darunavir or lopinavir) plus two NRTIs (BII).\n- HIV-2 RNA, CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts, and clinical status should be used to assess treatment response (AIII). Unlike persons with HIV-1, persons with HIV-2 should continue to undergo periodic CD4 count testing even if their viral loads are persistently suppressed, because disease progression can occur despite an undetectable viral load.\n- Resistance-associated viral mutations to INSTIs, PIs, or NRTIs may develop in persons with HIV-2 while they are on ART. However, to the extent HIV-2 genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance assays are approved for clinical use.\n- In the event of virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure, a new ART regimen should be constructed in consultation with an expert in HIV-2 management.\n\n【3】## Rating of Recommendations:\nA = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional\n\n【4】## Rating of Evidence:\nI = Data from randomized controlled trials; II = Data from well-designed nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinion\n\n【5】## Overview\n\n【6】HIV-2 infection is endemic in West Africa, with certain countries experiencing a population prevalence of >1%. The possibility of HIV-2 infection should be considered when treating persons of West African origin, persons who have had sexual contact with or who have shared needles with persons of West African origin, and persons who reside in countries with strong socioeconomic ties to West Africa (e.g., France, Spain, Portugal, and former Portuguese colonies such as Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, and parts of India). Globally, it has been estimated that one million to two million individuals have HIV-2, a number that includes people with HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infection. However, current and accurate prevalence data are scarce, and neither the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS nor the World Health Organization have formal surveillance systems for HIV-2.\n\n【7】## Clinical Course of HIV-2 Infection\n\n【8】The clinical course of HIV-2 infection is generally characterized by a longer asymptomatic stage, lower plasma viral loads, and a lower mortality rate than HIV-1 infection. However, without effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-2 infection will progress to AIDS and death in the majority of individuals.

Recent studies have shown that the use of an ERAS programme in cardiac surgery is associated with a decrease in hospital stay and postoperative morbidity.\n\n【13】The objective of these guidelines, established jointly by experts from the SFCTCV and SFAR, was to formulate recommendations for optimising the pathway of patients requiring cardiac surgery (off-pump or under CPB).", "index": 2796, "show": true, "start": 2796, "end": 2985, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "版权信息"}], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:11:42", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:15:34", "cost": 232.38}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:28", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:15:35", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:11:42"}

Nevertheless, the amount, timing, architecture, and quality of sleep in the ICU are highly abnormal 删除11:<u>(23–29)</u>. For example, observational polysomnography (PSG) studies show shortened sleep duration over 24 hours and a high proportion of daytime sleep 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>23, 24</u>)</u>. Sleep is also highly fragmented, with frequent arousals and sleep episodes of short duration (e.g., lasting only 3 min). Finally, there is a paucity of stage REM and non-REM 3 sleep 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>23, 24</u>)</u>.\n\n【4】Circadian rhythms are similarly disrupted in critical illness. Studies have demonstrated that critically ill patients often have misaligned (usually delayed-type) or absent circadian rhythms as defined by melatonin (or its urinary metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin) concentrations and other circadian phase markers. This finding has been described in multiple critical illness cohorts, including patients with sepsis, those with intracerebral hemorrhage, and those requiring mechanical ventilation 删除11:<u>(30-41)</u>.\n\n【5】Notably, ICU SCD may differ substantially among individual patients and subgroups and may change over time as patients recover from acute illness. This raises key questions of ICU SCD definition and timing including when to measure and when to intervene in ICU SCD. These questions were rediscussed several times during ensuing subtopic discussions.\n\n【6】In addition, the group discussed whether acute changes in sleep and circadian rhythms during critical illness are adaptive or harmful. For example, infection-related illness and other proinflammatory states are known to increase sleepiness and extend sleep timing in non-ICU patients 删除11:<u>(42)</u>. Thus, biological plausibility suggests that sleep duration should be extended during infection-related critical illness rather than shortened, as observed in many ICU studies. Similarly, it does not seem likely that the high degree of sleep fragmentation observed in the ICU, due to light, sound, pain, anxiety, mechanical ventilation, overnight bedside care, and many unnamed factors, is adaptive, however, other aspects of ICU SCD may be. In terms of circadian disruption, limited data on circadian alignment and amplitude during acute infection suggest that acute infection can alter peripheral clock alignment 删除11:<u>(43)</u>, but it remains unclear if this is harmful or beneficial. Given the high relevance of infection and immune function in critically ill adults, this may be an area of particular interest for future research.

Increased survival and more frequent pregnancy of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is another contributing factor. Fortunately, the rate of mortality from arrhythmias decreased from 5.7% to 3.7% during the same time period.

In the case of sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) (defined as a resting heart rate >100, a mean ambulatory heart rate >90, and associated symptoms) has been reported to be associated with a higher frequency of induction at term, but with no impact on maternal or fetal outcomes.删除17:<u>42</u> Further, pregnancy is a common inciting event for IST, with about 8% of patients with IST identifying pregnancy as the inciting event. However, aside from symptoms, IST has not been associated with negative long-term outcomes.删除17:<u>43</u>\n\n【5】An arrhythmia that is documented during pregnancy can be the first onset of arrhythmia or the recurrence of a preexisting arrhythmia. In a study of 207 consecutive patients with PSVT referred for catheter ablation, only 3.9% of patients had first onset of PSVT in pregnancy. However, 22% of patients with PSVT prior to pregnancy had exacerbations of arrhythmia symptoms during pregnancy.删除17:<u>44</u> In a study of 73 patients with 87 pregnancies diagnosed with heart disease prior to pregnancy (69% with complex congenital or acquired heart disease), 44% developed recurrences of tachyarrhythmias during pregnancy. Recurrence rates during pregnancy in patients with a history of SVT, paroxysmal AF/AFL, and VT were 50%, 52%, and 27%, respectively. Adverse fetal events, such as prematurity, occurred more frequently in pregnant patients with antepartum arrhythmias.删除17:<u>45</u> In several other studies, the presence of documented arrhythmia in pregnant patients with congenital or acquired heart disease was also an important risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.删除17:<u>16,46</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 16, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 HRS专家共识声明：妊娠期心律失常的管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:09:34", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:11:38", "cost": 124.733}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:28", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:11:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:09:34"}

The inferior pedicle technique with Wise pattern, described by Robbins in 1977, is the most commonly used procedure because it is reliable in preserving nipple-areola perfusion and has successful outcomes across a wide range of reduction sizes. The superomedial pedicle technique described by Lassus and later modified by Lejour and Hall-Findlay preserves upper-pole fullness, has a decreased tendency for bottoming-out, and avoids a long transverse scar when performed with a vertical scar. The work group recognizes that there may be other evidence-based techniques; however, because of the volume of literature, this review focused on the two most common pedicles. This guideline does not comment on the safety or efficacy of other techniques, nor does it imply any superior or inferiority of the named techniques compared to any other techniques not listed.\n\n【8】A study by Antony et al. was a retrospective demographically matched cohort study comparing 50 patients who underwent the superomedial pedicle technique with 50 patients who underwent the inferior pedicle technique. Importantly, all patients in each group (superomedial and inferior pedicle) achieved symptomatic relief, and there was no statistical difference in either major or minor complications between the two groups. In another study by Ogunleye et al., nonmatched groups were compared. Patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity were more likely to undergo surgery using the inferior pedicle technique compared with the superomedial pedicle technique. Patients who underwent the inferior pedicle technique also had more breast tissue resected, with a mean resected tissue weight of 1090 g (inferior pedicle) versus 546 g (superomedial pedicle). Although the overall complication rate was actually lower in the superomedial pedicle group with a rate of 25.6 percent versus the inferior pedicle group with a rate of 47.1 percent, when matched for age and resection weight, there was no significant difference in major or minor complications. There were no significant differences in complication rates of either technique, even when comparing the techniques in patients that had large resection weights 删除19:<u>(>1000 g)</u>. This study was limited by the preoperative surgeon selection bias and variable follow-up.\n\n【9】Another study compared pedicle type alone in severe macromastia patients with a mean resection weight of approximately 1300 g in both groups. This was a prospective study with 50 superomedial pedicle patients matched based on age, body mass index, medical disorders, smoking status, and preoperative breast measurements to 50 inferior pedicle patients with a 1-year postoperative follow-up.

Overall, the evidence demonstrates a lower risk of complications when nicotine is ceased before surgery. The American College of Surgeons provides guidelines and resources on smoking cessation related to surgery.\n\n【4】Recommendation 4\n\n【5】The work group finds that it is acceptable for plastic surgeons to perform either superomedial pedicle or inferior pedicle techniques for reduction mammaplasty for postmenarche female patients presenting with symptomatic breast hypertrophy (other less common techniques were not reviewed).\n\n【6】Rationale\n\n【7】There are multiple pedicle and skin excision techniques used in reduction mammaplasty. The inferior pedicle technique with Wise pattern, described by Robbins in 1977, is the most commonly used procedure because it is reliable in preserving nipple-areola perfusion and has successful outcomes across a wide range of reduction sizes. The superomedial pedicle technique described by Lassus and later modified by Lejour and Hall-Findlay preserves upper-pole fullness, has a decreased tendency for bottoming-out, and avoids a long transverse scar when performed with a vertical scar. The work group recognizes that there may be other evidence-based techniques; however, because of the volume of literature, this review focused on the two most common pedicles. This guideline does not comment on the safety or efficacy of other techniques, nor does it imply any superior or inferiority of the named techniques compared to any other techniques not listed.\n\n【8】A study by Antony et al. was a retrospective demographically matched cohort study comparing 50 patients who underwent the superomedial pedicle technique with 50 patients who underwent the inferior pedicle technique. Importantly, all patients in each group (superomedial and inferior pedicle) achieved symptomatic relief, and there was no statistical difference in either major or minor complications between the two groups. In another study by Ogunleye et al., nonmatched groups were compared. Patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity were more likely to undergo surgery using the inferior pedicle technique compared with the superomedial pedicle technique. Patients who underwent the inferior pedicle technique also had more breast tissue resected, with a mean resected tissue weight of 1090 g (inferior pedicle) versus 546 g (superomedial pedicle). Although the overall complication rate was actually lower in the superomedial pedicle group with a rate of 25.6 percent versus the inferior pedicle group with a rate of 47.1 percent, when matched for age and resection weight, there was no significant difference in major or minor complications. There were no significant differences in complication rates of either technique, even when comparing the techniques in patients that had large resection weights 删除19:<u>(>1000 g)</u>. This study was limited by the preoperative surgeon selection bias and variable follow-up.\n\n【9】Another study compared pedicle type alone in severe macromastia patients with a mean resection weight of approximately 1300 g in both groups. This was a prospective study with 50 superomedial pedicle patients matched based on age, body mass index, medical disorders, smoking status, and preoperative breast measurements to 50 inferior pedicle patients with a 1-year postoperative follow-up. There was no difference in complication rates, and bottoming-out occurred in both groups.\n\n【10】A large randomized prospective study of 255 patients comparing superomedial pedicle to", "index": 94, "show": true, "start": 81, "end": 2957, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【1】"}], "startTime": "2024/08/06 09:56:22", "endTime": "2024/08/06 09:57:38", "cost": 76.307}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:28", "update_time": "2024-08-05 17:57:35", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 17:56:19"}

Nevertheless, there were no clinical trials comparing pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated SCLC. Furthermore, as discussed in the *First-line therapy for SCLC* section, first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved PFS but not OS compared with chemotherapy alone in KEYNOTE-604. In 2021, despite disease setting evaluated being in first-line rather than in previously treated patients with SCLC, the outcomes of KEYNOTE-604 were described as the rationale for the voluntary withdrawal of the pembrolizumab indication for patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy.\n\n【1】### Panel recommendations\n\n【2】- Patients with ES-SCLC and no contraindication for the use of ICIs should be treated with first-line carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab or platinum-based chemotherapy, etoposide, and durvalumab, both during induction chemotherapy and as maintenance (LE:2).\n- For patients with ES-SCLC following the completion of induction chemotherapy plus ICI, PCI is not currently recommended outside of a clinical trial setting.\n- The use of thoracic radiation following completion of induction chemotherapy plus ICI in patients with ES-SCLC is not recommended outside of a clinical trial setting.\n- Whenever possible, patients should be offered participation in clinical trials.\n\n【3】### MESOTHELIOMA\n\n【4】Mesothelioma can affect the mesothelium in any part of the body, although it most commonly occurs in the pleura surrounding the lungs (pleural mesothelioma). About 3,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year and mesothelioma was the primary cause of death for 45,221 persons age ≥25 years from 1999 to 2015.\n\n【5】### Diagnosis and biomarkers\n\n【6】Prognostic factors that are associated with survival in patients with pleural mesothelioma include performance status, white blood cell count, gender, and sarcomatoid subtype. While there have been efforts to identify molecular biomarkers of prognosis or response, no biomarkers have been validated for clinical use, and molecular biomarkers remain limited to research use at this time. One gene, BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), is commonly mutated in malignant mesothelioma. While *BAP1* has not demonstrated utility as a prognostic biomarker for mesothelioma, it is important to note that germline pathogenic mutations in the *BAP1* gene predispose patients (or their relatives) to mesothelioma or other types of cancer (including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and meningiomas).\n\n【7】### First-line treatment of mesothelioma\n\n【8】Historically, the first-line treatment of mesothelioma has consisted of chemotherapy, with regimens that include combination pemetrexed and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab. However, a new approval by the FDA introduced dual immunotherapy as an option for the first-line treatment of pleural mesothelioma in October 2020. CheckMate 743 删除19:<u>(NCT02899299)</u>, a phase III, randomized open-label trial, assigned 605 patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma to receive combination nivolumab and ipilimumab or chemotherapy (pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin). The median OS was significantly increased for patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy at 18.1 months (95% CI 16.8 to 21.5) and 14.1 months (95% CI 12.5 to 16.2), respectively (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.89; stratified log-rank p=0.002). Notably, there was a dramatic difference in OS between histological subtypes, with patients with non-epithelioid mesothelioma experiencing a greater benefit from ICI therapy. While the median OS in patients with epithelioid mesothelioma was similar between the ipilimumab and nivolumab and chemotherapy treatment groups at 18.7 months (95% CI 16.9 to 22) versus 16.5 months (95% CI 14.9 to 20.5), respectively, patients with non-epithelioid histology had a median OS of 18.1 months (95% CI 12.2 to 22.8) with ipilimumab and nivolumab and 8.8 months (95% CI 7.4 to 10.2) with chemotherapy. There was no significant difference when comparing ICIs to chemotherapy in median PFS (6.8 months vs 7.2 months), ORR (40% vs 43%), or median DOR (11.0 months vs 7.7 months). The 3-year duration of response rate was 28% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 0% with chemotherapy. Any-grade TRAEs occurred in 80% and 82% of the patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 TRAEs were experienced in 31% of patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 32% of patients treated with chemotherapy.\n\n【9】Several ongoing clinical trials are determining the efficacy and safety of additional immunotherapies for patients with pleural mesothelioma.

Nevertheless, there were no clinical trials comparing pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated SCLC. Furthermore, as discussed in the *First-line therapy for SCLC* section, first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved PFS but not OS compared with chemotherapy alone in KEYNOTE-604. In 2021, despite disease setting evaluated being in first-line rather than in previously treated patients with SCLC, the outcomes of KEYNOTE-604 were described as the rationale for the voluntary withdrawal of the pembrolizumab indication for patients with metastatic SCLC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy.\n\n【1】### Panel recommendations\n\n【2】- Patients with ES-SCLC and no contraindication for the use of ICIs should be treated with first-line carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab or platinum-based chemotherapy, etoposide, and durvalumab, both during induction chemotherapy and as maintenance (LE:2).\n- For patients with ES-SCLC following the completion of induction chemotherapy plus ICI, PCI is not currently recommended outside of a clinical trial setting.\n- The use of thoracic radiation following completion of induction chemotherapy plus ICI in patients with ES-SCLC is not recommended outside of a clinical trial setting.\n- Whenever possible, patients should be offered participation in clinical trials.\n\n【3】### MESOTHELIOMA\n\n【4】Mesothelioma can affect the mesothelium in any part of the body, although it most commonly occurs in the pleura surrounding the lungs (pleural mesothelioma). About 3,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year and mesothelioma was the primary cause of death for 45,221 persons age ≥25 years from 1999 to 2015.\n\n【5】### Diagnosis and biomarkers\n\n【6】Prognostic factors that are associated with survival in patients with pleural mesothelioma include performance status, white blood cell count, gender, and sarcomatoid subtype. While there have been efforts to identify molecular biomarkers of prognosis or response, no biomarkers have been validated for clinical use, and molecular biomarkers remain limited to research use at this time. One gene, BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), is commonly mutated in malignant mesothelioma. While *BAP1* has not demonstrated utility as a prognostic biomarker for mesothelioma, it is important to note that germline pathogenic mutations in the *BAP1* gene predispose patients (or their relatives) to mesothelioma or other types of cancer (including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and meningiomas).\n\n【7】### First-line treatment of mesothelioma\n\n【8】Historically, the first-line treatment of mesothelioma has consisted of chemotherapy, with regimens that include combination pemetrexed and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab.

The proformas help to stratify the patients into low-, medium- and high/very high risk categories, with the aim of |删除段内换行|improving personalised approaches to minimise the risk of cardiovas- cular toxicity from cancer therapies. It is also recommended that the risk level be recorded in the patient's medical records, reviewed by the treating oncologist or haemato-oncologist, and communicated to the patient and their primary care physician to address modifiable CV risk factors. Although CV comorbidity screening and monitoring are becoming integrated into clinical practice, their implementation has been limited in part due to the lack of recommendations on how best to consistently implement the recommendations of these major groups. In order to provide these multidisciplinary recommendations, con- sensus needs to be generated amongst medical experts across a range of allied health professions. This could be accomplished through face- to-face approaches, such as panel meetings, or the Nominal Group Technique, which involves structured small group discussion followed by voting. Alternatively, iterative surveys can be performed using |删除段内换行|the Delphi method. In this study, we used a panel meeting and an iterative survey approach to develop recommendations from clinical experts from the UK around CV risk screening, ongoing assessment and escalation to appropriate allied services in relation to TKI therapies for CML. Based on the clinical experience of this expert group, this consensus paper addresses the considerations needed in a thorough CV assessment, both pre-treatment and throughout TKI therapy. It provides guidance on the undertaking of specialist-recommended tests and referral path- ways and, uniquely, recommends a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making for patients with CML in order to provide holistic management.\n\n【1】## 2 METHODS\n\nWe conducted a multidisciplinary expert panel review comprising five haematologists, two cardio-oncologists, one vascular surgeon, one haemato-oncology pharmacist and one specialist nurse |删除段内换行|practitioner, from the UK and all with a specialist interest in managing CML. To establish advice on key CV considerations for different TKIs, the panel reviewed pivotal trial data for all TKIs licensed in the United Kingdom (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib) and reviewed current practices on CV comorbidity screening and investigations following CV events. Inspired by the Delphi method, panel members also completed two iterative surveys to assist in achieving group consensus . Here, we report results based on majority viewpoints, defined as ≥70% agree- ment in these surveys. Additional recommendations based on group discussion have also been included.\n\n【3】## 3 RESULTS\n\n【4】### 3.1 CV screening and risk stratification\n\n【5】**Recommendations:** A patient’s baseline CV risk should be assessed on the basis of their comorbidities and the safety profile of the selected TKI. For patients determined to be at high risk of CV events with TKI therapy, a multidisciplinary management team is recommended.\n\n【6】Panel members commented on the importance of considering risk factors in context with each other to define CV risk. For example, age combined with altogether risk factors would signal increased CV risk. **CV screening before commencing** dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib or ponatinib, but not necessarily prior to prescribing imatinib.

The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Articles were also excluded if they: 1) involved investigational agents that have not yet received FDA approval; 2) did not pertain to the disease site; 3) were clinical trial protocols; or 4) were reviews that were not systematic reviews. The search results were further narrowed by selecting publications reporting clinical data, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of clinical studies, and treatment guidelines developed by other organizations.\n\n【3】The potential relevance of the PubMed search results was examined by the oncology scientist and panel chairs, and a list of selected articles was sent to the panel for their review and discussion at the panel meeting. The panel also reviewed and discussed published materials referenced in Institutional Review Comments or provided with Submission Requests. The data from key PubMed articles, as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the panel, have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion删除1:<u>. The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are at www.NCCN.org.</u>\n\n【4】## Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer\n\n【5】### Reproductive Risk Factors\nEpidemiologic studies have identified risk factors in the etiology of ovarian cancer. A 30% to 60% decreased risk for cancer is associated with 1 or more pregnancies/births, the use of oral contraceptives, and/or breastfeeding. Conversely, nulliparity confers an increased risk for ovarian cancer. Data suggest that postmenopausal hormone therapy and pelvic inflammatory disease may increase the risk for ovarian cancer, although results vary across studies. The risk for ovarian borderline epithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors) may be increased after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.\n\n【6】### Obesity, Smoking, and Lifestyle and Environmental Risk Factors\nStudies evaluating obesity as a risk factor for ovarian cancer have yielded inconsistent results, which may be due to associations between obesity and other ovarian cancer risk factors (eg, parity, oral contraceptive use, menopausal status). The risk associated with obesity may differ across ovarian cancer subtypes, and depend on the timing and reason for weight gain. Smoking is associated with an increased risk for mucinous carcinomas but a decreased risk for clear cell carcinomas. Environmental factors have been investigated, such as talc, but so far they have not been conclusively associated with the development of this neoplasm.\n\n【7】### Family History and Genetic Risk Factors\nFamily history (primarily patients having two or more first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer)—including linkage with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotypes (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [HBOC] syndrome) or families affected by Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC] syndrome)—is associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly early-onset disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 67, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V2）NCCN临床实践指南：卵巢癌包括输卵管癌和原发性腹膜癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:32:58", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:38:39", "cost": 341.379}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:38:40", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:32:57"}

In this period, the MRI investigation is indicated only in the case of neurological symptoms. A study without sedation and contrast medium can avoid the risks associated with the opposition of gadolinium in the tissues and provide information on cortical venous anomalies, meningeal, choroidal plexus or on the presence of engorgement of medullary and ependymal veins, encephalomalacia, atrophy and calcifications. In any case, in the asymptomatic patient, the complete study with the contrast medium could be indicated after the completion of the first year of age, as suggested by an American multidisciplinary consensus.\n\n【2】In patients with neurological symptoms, MRI with contrast medium under sedation is indicated. In the event of a negative test, in children under 2 years of age it will be advisable to repeat the same after 1-2 years.\n\n【3】The use of diffusion sequences can provide information equivalent or superior to MRI with gadolinium has been identified through the quantitative analysis of the ADC (Apparent Diffusion of Contrast).\n\n【4】In stable patients it is not necessary to repeat the MRI routinely, but only in case of symptoms worsening.\n\n【5】Many authors underline the importance of early electroencephalographic and neuroradiological evaluation even in asymptomatic patients due to intracranial involvement in order to recognize patients at risk of developing neurological problems. However the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of these investigations, in the absence of specific pharmacological treatment or surgical procedures, are still controversial.\n\n【6】To complete the diagnosis, genetic counseling and molecular genetic examination on biopsy sampling of the tissue affected by the capillary malformation may be indicated for the search for somatic mutation in GNAQ  and GNA11 genes.\n\n【7】#### Treatment\n\n【8】The control of epileptic seizures is fundamental for the patient's prognosis from a cognitive point of view. It is important to warn the family in advance of the risk of epileptic seizures in patients with SW syndrome to organize themselves for any emergency with the administration of benzodiazepines. Families should also be educated on the signs of possible seizures in younger children where they may be mistaken for small behavioral abnormalities. Parents should take note of any changes in the child's attitudes and behaviors and report them to the specialist. In case of altered mental status, an electroencephalogram is also suggested to exclude the possibility of a non-convulsive epileptic status.\n\n【9】There are no guidelines for the management of headache in SW patients. Sleep, ibuprofen, patient hydration and the use of antiemetics are suggested.\n\n【10】Prophylaxis of seizures with antiepileptic drugs such as Valproic Acid, Levetiracetam, Topiramate and Tiagabine has been proposed, but there are concerns about the latter regarding a possible worsening of glaucoma. However, the pathophysiology of glaucoma development in SW patients is different and in the studies that evaluated it, topiramate was not associated with an increased risk of developing glaucoma. This should be borne in mind especially for the use of topiramate as an additional drug in epileptic seizures unresponsive to monotherapy and possibly as anti-migraine prophylaxis. The use of antiepileptic therapy before the onset of seizures has been evaluated in three studies and however it is considered by most clinicians as very controversial and contraindicated.\n\n【11】Other hygienic devices strongly recommended for the prevention of crises/headache/stroke-like events are a balanced diet, a regular sleep/wake rhythm, adequate hydration during intercurrent infectious events and the prevention of head trauma, saving the patient from sporting or recreational activities at risk.\n\n【12】In subjects at risk for known intracranial involvement, the neurologist/neuropsychiatrist specialist will evaluate whether to start neuropsychiatric tests from the age of 3-4 to diagnose patients at risk early and implement the appropriate educational and behavioral interventions.\n\n【13】Patients with epileptic episodes refractory to medical therapy and especially those with unilateral leptomeningeal capillary malformation can undergo neurosurgical treatment with a significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of seizures. Surgery often leads to their permanent resolution. The type of surgical treatment must necessarily be evaluated in a Specialized Epilepsy Surgery Center.\n\n【14】Photocoagulation using pulsed Dye-laser is the first-choice method for the treatment of capillary malformation of the face and to improve the psychological conditions of the patient related to the aesthetic appearance. The effectiveness of the treatment is greater if performed", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 90, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/SISAV：血管异常指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 14:23:11", "endTime": "2024/08/05 14:25:58", "cost": 166.916}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-04 22:25:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 22:23:11"}

In stage A (at-risk patients), the patient is at risk for HF but has no structural heart disease or symptoms of HF. Stage B (asymptomatic patients) is characterized by structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of HF. Stage C (symptomatic patients) is marked by cardiomyopathic heart disease with current or past symptoms of HF. Patients with stage D disease (refractory patients) have refractory HF requiring specialized interventions. This staging system can be harmonized with the various clinical milieus one can observe in pediatric DCM as a framework with which to consider specific therapeutic interventions.\n\n【4】Over the past 3 decades, a series of large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults with HF associated with reduced LV ejection fraction found that certain drugs reduced the incidence of hospitalization and mortality. These drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, ivabradine, and most recently sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Although there are evidence-based, goal-directed medical therapy treatment algorithms that are often updated by the AHA, the American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology , a similar evidence basis does not yet exist for children.\n\n【5】删除图片描述:<u>![](1_1.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 AHA科学声明：儿童心肌病的治疗策略.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 15:54:01", "endTime": "2024/08/05 15:59:29", "cost": 328.693}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-04 23:59:30", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 23:54:00"}

He was also an investigator in a trial on the safety and efficacy of pyronaridine artesunate in asymptomatic malaria-infected individuals.\n\n【5】Jennifer Armistead reported being employed by the US President's Malaria Initiative, who in turn has supported a number of projects in the past 4 years for which funding exceeded USD 5000 but for which she did not receive any personal funding. The projects focused on the effect of indoor residual spraying on Anopheles vector behaviors and their impact on malaria transmission in the northern region of Ghana, an evaluation of pirimiphos-methyl efficacy in experimental huts when sprayed on half the usual surface against natural populations of Anopheles gambiae in Ghana, a small-scale field pilot of Partial IRS with pirimiphos-methyl in households in northern Ghana for Malaria Vector Control and evaluating the impact of attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in experimental huts.\n\n【6】Caroline Jones reported receiving research support within the last 4 years that exceeded USD 5000 for being a co-investigator on UNITAID funded project: Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa, for being a co-investigator on Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award: Improving the efficacy of malaria prevention in an insecticide resistant Africa, for being a co-investigator on DFID/MRC/Wellcome Trust Joint Global Health Trials funded project: Can improved housing provide additional protection against clinical malaria over current best practice? A household-randomised controlled trial and lastly for being a co-investigator on the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) funded project: Dynamics of health care utilization strategies in the context of RTS,S/AS01vaccine introduction: a qualitative longitudinal study [in Kenya].\n\n【7】Neil Lobo reported receiving research funding exceeding USD 5000 and/or non-monetary support valued at over USD 1000 overall within the last 4 years towards a project investigating Spatial Repellent Products for Control of Vector-borne Diseases by SC Johnson, and a project on innovative intervention for reducing outdoor malaria transmission by Widdler Bros.\n\n【8】Melanie Renshaw reported receiving salary support exceeding USD 5000 from the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.\n\n【9】In summary, five members of the ERG reported interests; it was, however, judged that none of these were relevant to the recommendations under review and it was decided that all members could fully participate particularly as the remit of the review group was limited to identifying factual errors, providing clarity and commenting on implications for implementation not changing the recommendations formulated by the GDG. It was concluded that their expertise in some of these areas would be valuable, particularly on implementation considerations and factors to be considered associated with gender and social determinants, equity, and human rights.\n\n【10】No interests related to the topics of the meetings were disclosed by the methodologist or systematic review teams.\n\n【11】### 10.2 Recommendations for chemoprevention\n\n【12】The following outlines the constitution of the Guideline Development Group, Guideline Steering Group, and External Review Group for the chemoprevention recommendations listed below and published in 2022. Also indicated are the contributors to systematic reviews, summaries of contextual factors, AMSTAR-2 Checklist assessments and background papers, as well as the guidelines methodologist. Final compositions of these groups are shown as of the date of finalization of the Guidelines.\n\n【13】**Recommendations**\n\n【14】- Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy 删除11:<u>(4.2.1)</u>\n- Perennial malaria chemoprevention 删除11:<u>(4.2.2)</u>\n- Seasonal malaria chemoprevention 删除11:<u>(4.2.3)</u>\n- Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in school-aged children 删除11:<u>(4.2.4)</u>\n- Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention 删除11:<u>(4.2.5)</u>\n- Mass drug administration for burden reduction 删除11:<u>(4.2.6.1)</u>\n- Mass drug administration for burden reduction in", "index": 5522, "show": true, "start": 5522, "end": 5523, "province": ["格式规范性", "标点错误"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/05 11:30:26", "endTime": "2024/08/05 11:31:44", "cost": 77.559}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-04 19:31:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 19:30:27"}

Regimens containing pemetrexed or bevacizumab are not recommended for squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, few treatment options are available for patients with squamous cell carcinoma compared with nonsquamous NSCLC.\n\n【2】## Clinical Trial Data\n\n【3】Data show that platinum-based combination therapy is superior to best supportive care for patients with advanced, incurable disease who are not eligible for targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Cisplatin or carboplatin have been proven effective in combination with many of the following agents: docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, paclitaxel (and albumin-bound paclitaxel), and pemetrexed 删除9:<u>(see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin. Non-platinum regimens (eg, gemcitabine plus docetaxel, gemcitabine plus vinorelbine) are reasonable alternatives, because data show they are active and less toxic than platinum-based regimens.\n\n【4】ECOG 4599, a phase 2/3 trial, randomly assigned 878 patients to either 1) bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin; or 2) paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone. Both regimens were well tolerated with selected toxicities. Patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin showed an improved median survival (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, $P = .003$) when compared to patients receiving paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone. The overall 1-year survival was 51% versus 44%; 2-year survival was 23% versus 15%, respectively, in favor of the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin arm. More significant toxicities were observed with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin (grade 4 neutropenia: 25.5% vs. 16.8%; grade 5 hemoptysis: 1.2% vs. 0%; and grade 3 hypertension: 6.8% vs. 0.5%). Treatment-related deaths were more common with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin (15 patients) than with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (2 patients) ($P = .001$). An analysis of ECOG 4599 found that patients with adenocarcinoma histology receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin had improved survival compared with chemotherapy alone (14.2 vs. 10.3 months). AVAiL, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared cisplatin plus gemcitabine with (or without) bevacizumab; survival was not increased with the addition of bevacizumab. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in any of the systemic therapy regimens containing bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab) that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical data and FDA approvals.\n\n【5】A noninferiority trial in 1725 patients with advanced NSCLC (either stage IIIB or IV; most were stage IV) assessed cisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with cisplatin plus pemetrexed. Patients with either adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (ie, nonsquamous NSCLC) had improved survival with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (adenocarcinoma: 12.6 vs. 10.9 months). Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had improved survival with the cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen (10.8 vs. 9.4 months). When compared with the cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen, the cisplatin plus pemetrexed regimen had significantly lower rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia ($P ≤ .001$); febrile neutropenia ($P = .002$); and alopecia ($P < .001$). Treatment-related deaths were similar for both regimens (cisplatin plus pemetrexed, 9 patients [1.0%]; cisplatin plus gemcitabine, 6 patients [0.7%]). An analysis of three phase 3 trials confirmed that pemetrexed improves survival for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC in first-line, subsequent, and maintenance therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 210, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：非小细胞肺癌-.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:53:59", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:57:32", "cost": 213.694}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:57:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:53:59"}

Most of the burden of HBV-related disease results from infections acquired in infancy through perinatal or early childhood exposure to HBV in Asia–Pacific. Hepatitis B during pregnancy presents unique management issues for both the mother and fetus. These APASL guidelines provide a comprehensive review and recommendations based on available evidence in the literature for the management of females with HBV infection through every stage of pregnancy and postpartum. These also address the concerns, management challenges, and required follow-up of children born to hepatitis B-positive mothers.\n\n【5】**Keywords:** Hepatitis B • Acute Hepatitis B • Chronic Hepatitis B • Pregnancy\n\n【6】## Introduction\n\n【7】Despite the availability of effective preventive measures including vaccination, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still today a major public health issue worldwide, especially in the Asia–Pacific region. Chronic HBV infection may progress to hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cirrhosis.\n\n【8】Hepatitis B during pregnancy presents unique management issues for both the mother and the fetus.\n\n【9】Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is responsible for a majority of prevalent cases of chronic HBV infection in the Asia–Pacific region. Because HBV infection in infancy or early childhood often leads to chronic infection, it is important to take appropriate measures to prevent MTCT.\n\n【10】These guidelines are intended to be used by health-care providers, and suggest the preferred approaches to the management of females with HBV infection throughout the pregnancy and the postpartum period, and of children born to infected mothers. This document provides general guidelines only and will be applicable to the management of most of the patients, but should not replace clinical judgment for unique patients. In addition, despite increasing knowledge and research, some areas of uncertainty still exist and, therefore, appropriate choices should be made based on the evolving evidence, and the current literature as it evolves.\n\n【11】The experts from the members of the APASL guidelines’ development sub-committee were given specific areas for reviewing and writing consensus statements according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendations as per the current literature 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>. Then, the manuscript was circulated to all the members of the group for suggestions and endorsement.\n\n【12】## Epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection in pregnant females in Asia–Pacific\n\n【13】### Review of literature\n\n【14】The burden of HBV infection in the general population including pregnant females is particularly high in Asia–Pacific.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/APASL：妊娠期HBV感染指南（2022）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:56:52", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:57:11", "cost": 19.147}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:57:11", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:56:52"}

A threshold of 9g/dL should be considered in patients with massive bleeding, significant comorbidities (especially cardiovascular ischemia) or possible delay in receiving therapeutic interventions 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[81]</u></u>.\n\n【1】Massive, life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding is uncommon in patients with IBD and occurs in less than 6% of cases 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[82]</u></u>. Because of the low incidence of severe hemorrhage in IBD, a limited number of studies are available to guide management.\n\n【2】In IBD patients, bleeding has different features depending on the underlying disease. In UC, the bleeding typically occurs in patients with pancolitis from diffuse areas of mucosal ulceration. In CD, however, the bleeding most often is a result of focal erosion into an intestinal vessel, and this could include the small bowel.\n\n【3】In UC, the endoscopic assessment and treatment of the source of bleeding can thus be massive because of the diffuse nature of the disease. On the other hand, in CD, with limited focal disease, it may be possible to at least try to localize the source of bleeding preoperatively to avoid surgery or an extensive intestinal resection, even more so severe bleeding in a patient with CD could be due to an associated condition, such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, or multiple segments of GI tract could be involved in the bleeding and this could be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the endoscopist, with a high risk of re-bleeding.\n\n【4】The hemodynamic status of the patient presenting with hematemesis or massive melena or bright red rectal bleeding has to be assessed: the patient has to be resuscitated and stabilized, and a nasogastric tube is inserted to protect the airway and decompress the stomach. In a stable patient, a gastroscopy could be required to rule out an upper gastrointestinal bleeding. If a lower gastrointestinal source is suspected then one should consider sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n\n【5】The clinical significance of performing contrast-enhanced CT before colonoscopy has been examined in recent years. In a retrospective study of acute LGIB, Nagata et al. reported that the detection rate for vascular lesions was higher for colonoscopy following CT than for colonoscopy alone (35.7% vs 20.6%, P = 0.01), leading to more endoscopic examinations (34.9% vs 13.4%, P < 0.01) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[83]</u></u>.\n\n【6】In patients with IBD who are bleeding, the role of angiography and of angioembolization is not yet clear: the few studies available in the literature are case reports and suggest that angiography/angioembolization could be feasible in stable patients, but further studies are needed to better define outcomes in emergency setting.\n\n【7】The major advantage of angiography and embolization is that it can control severe bleeding without bowel preparation. A systematic review reported that superselective angiographic embolization achieves immediate hemostasis in 40–100% of diverticular bleeding with occasional rebleeding (15%) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>.

Other methods of localization include the use of a nuclear medicine labeled red cell scans if bleeding is not detected by angiography 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[65]</u></u>.\n\n【9】Once the source is known, the decision to perform a surgical urgent procedure depends on bleeding source and rate, the patient’s hemodynamic status, and response to resuscitative interventions (i.e., endoscopy or angiography) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[90]</u></u>.\n\n【10】If the patient is unstable, even after significant resuscitation, a surgical exploration is mandatory. In clinical practice, surgery is indicated for patients who demonstrate continued hemorrhage despite resuscitation or have other indications for resection of diseased bowel 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[91]</u></u>.\n\n【11】Significant bleeding is a rare event in Crohn’s disease, and all common causes of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be assessed; when a surgical exploration is required, it is recommended to perform an intra-operative ileoscopy to find the source of bleeding if the source has not been identified pre-operatively. All efforts to identify the bleeding source should be made preoperatively.\n\n【12】In case of acute severe ulcerative colitis, the bleeding could involve all the colon mucosa, and the surgical treatment of choice is a subtotal colectomy with ileostomy, to decrease the risk of recurrent bleeding, but it is important to have performed a flexible sigmoidoscopy to make sure there is no significant bleeding source in the rectum.\n\n【13】### 4) Free perforation\n\n【14】**Recommendation:** We recommend performing surgical exploration in the presence of radiological signs of pneumoperitoneum and free fluid within the peritoneal cavity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 19, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【消化领域】2021+WSES／AAST指南：炎症性肠病的急诊管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:11:39", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:16:43", "cost": 304.369}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:27", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:16:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:11:38"}

Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.\n\n【1】### Cervical Spine Precautions\nRecent discussions and research in the field of out-of-hospital medicine have brought to question the utility, safety, and clinical benefit of what once was called routine spine immobilization. The most current published review of this topic specific to austere environments is the Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Spinal Cord Protection: 2019 Update. We recommend reviewing the updated guidelines for current evidence on the utility of this procedure.\n\n【2】Retrospective studies of drowning patients found the incidence of cervical spine injuries was low (0.5% to 5%) and that most injuries were related to diving from a height. In patients without obvious signs of trauma or a known fall or diving event, the risk of spine injury is low. Another recent study further suggests that patients with no history to suggest axial spine loading are at exceptionally low risk of cervical spine injury. In patients without this specific traumatic mechanism, treatment maneuvers focused on restricting spine motion may distract rescuers from the critical role of oxygenation and ventilation.\n\n【3】**Recommendation:** We recommend consulting the most current Wilderness Medical Society Practice Guidelines concerning the field treatment of possible spinal injuries when developing or reviewing agency protocols. Drowning patients who display evidence of spine injury, such as focal neurologic deficit, have a history of high-risk activity, or exhibit altered mental status are considered to be at a higher risk for spine injury. This does not include patients with altered mental status who were witnessed to have no trauma as an initiating event. Treatment considerations for this population should be carried out in accordance with the most current version of Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Spinal Cord Protection. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.\n\n【4】### Hypothermia\nWater is thermally neutral at approximately 33℃ (91℉). Because most patients drown in water at a lower temperature than this, concomitant hypothermia is not uncommon. The main physiologic problem with drowning is brain hypoxia. Current practice suggests that the brain can withstand longer periods of hypoxia if the body is cooler than the normal physiologic range. On one hand, leaving a patient moderately cool, or warming them to a moderately cool degree, could be beneficial or at least innocuous. On the other hand, moderate-to-severe hypothermia should be corrected, with the understanding that warming may be operationally difficult in some drowning situations. Beyond initiation of basic warming measures, the details of hypothermia treatment, including augmented advanced life support measures, are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Readers are encouraged to review the most current version of the Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Out-of-Hospital Evaluation and Treatment of Accidental Hypothermia.\n\n【5】**Recommendation:** We recommend evaluation for and treatment of hypothermia. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.\n\n【6】## Postresuscitation Management\n\n【7】### Oxygenation/Ventilation\n#### Mechanical Ventilation\nNo literature is available comparing out-of-hospital or in-hospital mechanical ventilation (MV) strategies for the drowning patient. Current practice recommends a lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategy similar to that used for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), on the premise that the lung injury pattern after drowning is similar. This includes MV starting with a tidal volume ($V_T$) of 6 to 8 mL/kg, augmentation of $V_T$ and respiratory rate to maintain plateau pressure < 30 mm Hg, and augmentation of positive-end expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain partial pressure of arterial oxygen ($P_aO_2$) at 55 to 80 mm Hg (SpO2 89–95%). As many patients who require MV also suffer from hypoxic cerebral injuries, it is difficult to determine the value of MV alone for survival.\n\n【8】**Recommendation:** We recommend following lung protective ventilation protocols for mechanical ventilation for the drowning patient. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.\n\n【9】#### Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation\nNoninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been used successfully in the out-of-hospital setting. There are case reports describing its successful use in drowning. Similar to MV, the addition of airway pressure to prevent atelectasis and support respiratory muscle use while preventing hypoxemia can be achieved with NIPPV. However, NIPPV can only be used in spontaneously breathing patients and should be used with caution in the drowning patient with altered mental status because there may be an increased risk of vomiting and aspiration. Drowning patients who have mild to moderate hypoxemia and are being treated in out-of-hospital and emergency medical systems using NIPPV might benefit from this therapy.

We recommend that all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receive at least standard dose thromboprophylaxis.\n4. In patients admitted to the hospital for indications other than COVID-19 but incidentally found to have COVID-19 infection, we recommend standard dose thromboprophylaxis with LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH) unless specific contraindications exist.\n5. We suggest that clinicians consider the use of therapeutic intensity LMWH or UFH thromboprophylaxis for non-critically ill patients at increased risk of disease progression or thromboembolism and who are not high risk for anticoagulant-related bleeding 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u>.\n6. We recommend that \"intermediate\" intensity thromboprophylaxis and/or antiplatelet agents only be used.\n\n**Table 3 | Dosing of COVID-19 Thromboprophylaxis in Hospitalized, Non-Pregnant

Each of these conditions differs from recurrent ischemic priapism in that they lack any underlying ischemia and do not require emergent intervention. Similarly, very limited data exist on management strategies of these conditions, and their existence and optimal treatments remain investigational at the present time. Further research, including multicenter registries are merited given the relative low prevalence of these conditions and significant heterogeneity in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】**16. Clinicians should inform patients with recurrent ischemic priapism that optimal strategies to prevent subsequent episodes are unknown. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)**\n\n【3】Evidence is sparse regarding therapeutic prevention of recurrent ischemic priapism. There are preventative strategies for men with idiopathic recurrent ischemic priapism, which include oral baclofen, dutasteride, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is [tadalafil or sildenafil]), ketoconazole with prednisone, pseudoephedrine, cyproterone acetate, and aspirin. Preventative strategies for men suffering from recurrent ischemic priapism with SCD include the same treatment medications as above but also etilefrine, hydroxyurea and ongoing chronic transfusion, either simple or exchange. In general, ketoconazole with prednisone has the highest success rate, but should be used with caution considering its potential liver toxicity, thus warranting frequent assessment of liver function tests. Cyproterone acetate, an anti-androgen not available in the United States, had similarly high levels of complete response but also had high withdrawal rates due to side effects. While consistent treatment efficacy was observed for PDE5is, recent reports have suggested that hyperpigmented PDE5i therapy may reduce frequency and duration of priapic episodes with no negative side effects.\n\n【4】Home self-injection of phenylephrine on an as-needed basis was also utilized in some patients, and is reasonable as described in the previous AUA priapism guideline, but is not a preventative strategy.

Examples of this might be in management of pulmonary hypertension, the benefit of procedural interventions for valvular heart disease or CAD, or advice regarding the role of more complex GDMT use. Of note, pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (Group 2) commonly occurs in HFpEF, and it is important to recognize the lack of benefit of pulmonary vasodilator therapy in Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. An HF specialist can also assist with access to clinical trials and evaluation (if appropriate) for mechanical circulatory support or transplantation, a rare circumstance in HFpEF. Last, the HF specialist can assist in defining the prognosis and need for a palliative care referral.\n\n【1】### 8.3. Team-Based Approach to Care\nAs new medications and devices become available for individuals with HFpEF, a team-based approach is needed to optimize care, especially for those with multiple comorbidities associated with HFpEF. Use of multidisciplinary teams to facilitate the implementation of GDMT, address barriers to self-care, reduce readmission for HF, and improve survival in those with Stage C HF is a Class 1 recommendation in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of HF. Consistent with a team-based approach, multidisciplinary groups of clinicians (eg, primary care, specialists, nurses, advanced practice professionals, pharmacists, dieticians, exercise physiotherapists, and social workers) collaborate to implement evidence-based care that is patient-centered. Team-based programs vary in size and resources.

Examples of this might be in management of pulmonary hypertension, the benefit of procedural interventions for valvular heart disease or CAD, or advice regarding the role of more complex GDMT use. Of note, pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (Group 2) commonly occurs in HFpEF, and it is important to recognize the lack of benefit of pulmonary vasodilator therapy in Group 2 pulmonary hypertension. An HF specialist can also assist with access to clinical trials and evaluation (if appropriate) for mechanical circulatory support or transplantation, a rare circumstance in HFpEF. Last, the HF specialist can assist in defining the prognosis and need for a palliative care referral.\n\n【1】### 8.3. Team-Based Approach to Care\nAs new medications and devices become available for individuals with HFpEF, a team-based approach is needed to optimize care, especially for those with multiple comorbidities associated with HFpEF. Use of multidisciplinary teams to facilitate the implementation of GDMT, address barriers to self-care, reduce readmission for HF, and improve survival in those with Stage C HF is a Class 1 recommendation in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of HF. Consistent with a team-based approach, multidisciplinary groups of clinicians (eg, primary care, specialists, nurses, advanced practice professionals, pharmacists, dieticians, exercise physiotherapists, and social workers) collaborate to implement evidence-based care that is patient-centered.

In the WHS, compared with females in the highest quartile of triglyceride levels, those in the lowest quartile had a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.18–3.39]).\n\n【1】### Smoking/Tobacco Use\n#### 删除9:<u>(See Chapter 3 [Smoking/Tobacco Use] for more information.)</u>\n- Current smoking is associated with an increased prevalence of MRI-defined subclinical brain infarcts.\n- A meta-analysis of 141 cohort studies showed that low cigarette consumption (≈1 cigarette per day) carries a risk of developing stroke up to 50% of the risk associated with high cigarette consumption (≈20 cigarettes per day). This is much higher than what would be predicted from a linear or log-linear dose-response relationship between smoking and risk of stroke.\n- Exposure to secondhand smoke, also called passive smoking or secondhand tobacco smoke, is a risk factor for stroke.\n  - Meta-analyses have estimated a pooled RR of 1.25 for exposure to spousal smoking (or nearest equivalent) and risk of stroke. A dose-response relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and stroke risk was also reported.\n  - Data from a large-scale prospective cohort study of females in Japan showed that secondhand tobacco smoke exposure at home during adulthood was associated with an increased risk of stroke mortality in those ≥80 years of age (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05–1.46]). Overall, the increased risk was most evident for SAH (HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.02–2.70]) in all age groups.\n  - A study using NHANES data found that individuals with a prior stroke have greater odds of having been exposed to secondhand smoke (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.05–2.03]), and secondhand smoke exposure was associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality among stroke survivors compared with stroke survivors without the exposure (age-adjusted mortality rate, 964±408 versus 567±48 per 100 person-years; P=0.026).\n- Use of smokeless tobacco is associated with an increased risk of fatal stroke.\n  - In meta-analyses of studies from Europe, North America, and Asia, adult ever-users of smokeless tobacco had a higher risk of fatal stroke (OR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.29–1.49]).\n  - US smokeless tobacco users had a higher risk of stroke than nonusers, but this association was not observed in Swedish smokeless tobacco users. This difference may be attributable to differences in product type and use patterns between the 2 countries.\n- Smoking is perhaps the most important modifiable risk factor in preventing SAH, with the highest PAR (38%–43%) of any SAH risk factor.\n- The FINRISK study found a strong association between current smoking and SAH compared with nonsmoking (HR, 2.77 [95% CI, 2.22–3.46]) and reported a dose-dependent and cumulative association with SAH risk that was highest in females who were heavy smokers.\n- In a systematic review of efficacy of smoking-cessation pharmacotherapy after stroke (n=2 trials and n=6 observational studies), cessation rates ranged from 33% to 66% with pharmacological therapy combined with behavioral interventions versus 15% to 46% without behavioral interventions, but no individual study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit.\n\n【2】### Physical Inactivity\n#### 删除9:<u>(See Chapter 4 [Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior] for more information.)</u>\n- The GBD 2019 study demonstrated that the burden of stroke attributable to physical inactivity was ≈1.68% globally and 2.75% in high-income countries.\n- Physical inactivity is a significant risk factor for stroke in middle-aged and elderly populations.\n  - A prospective study among 437 318 participants in China found that physical inactivity was associated with increased risk of incident stroke and its subtypes (HR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.61–1.89]; aHR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.37–1.70]).\n  - A case-control study (mean, 67.2 years of age) showed that patients with stroke (n=40) had greater sitting time (10.9 h/d versus 8.2 h/d) with lower moderate and vigorous PA (4.9 min/d versus 38 min/d) than controls (n=23).\n  - A case-control study (>60 years of age) found that subjects with stroke (n=97) were physically inactive more often than controls (n=97; 74.2% versus 63.9%) and showed that lack of PA was associated with increased odds of stroke (OR 3.34 [95% CI, 1.34–8.41]). Among individuals >80 years of age in NOMAS, physical inactivity was associated with higher risk of stroke (physical inactivity versus PA; HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.05–2.42]).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 245, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AHA心脏病与卒中统计报告（2022年更新）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 11:04:46", "endTime": "2024/08/06 11:05:45", "cost": 58.77}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:26", "update_time": "2024-08-05 19:05:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 19:04:46"}

This is one example of the multitude of interventions that fall under the broad category of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation. To be able to generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow to downstream areas, the evaluation should include an assessment of whether this was achieved, the extent to which this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito, and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas.

To be able to generate evidence on the efficacy of larval habitat modification and/or manipulation in preventing malaria, and to facilitate the interpretation of the evidence once generated, it is important to well define the interventions that are being evaluated and, importantly, compare how the water conditions of larval habitats at the intervention and control sites are affected. For example, if the intervention aimed to increase the water flow to downstream areas, the evaluation should include an assessment of whether this was achieved, the extent to which this impacted the development of the immature and adult stages of the mosquito, and, ultimately, whether there was an epidemiological impact against malaria in the intervention arms compared to control areas.

It was withdrawn from the European market in 2008 for safety reasons, but was re-introduced in 2012 with narrow licencing indications, specifically isolated CABG surgery in high-risk patients. However, in clinical practice, its predominant use appears to be outside its licence, mainly being used in acute aortic dissection and infective endocarditis valve surgery.删除22:<u>$^{346}$</u> A meta-analysis of 106 RCTs and 11 observational studies (totalling 43 270 patients) was performed to compare the safety of aprotinin with other antifibrinolytic treatments.删除22:<u>$^{347}$</u> The analysis was largely inconclusive, although the authors did observe that there was, on average, higher mortality and renal failure or dysfunction rates in patients who had been given aprotinin compared with other drugs or no treatment. The authors concluded that concerns about the safety of aprotinin in cardiovascular surgery still remain, and clinicians should be aware of the benefits and risks of the drug. Karkouti et al.删除22:<u>$^{348}$</u> observed a lower incidence of massive bleeding associated with a significant reduced mortality in high-risk cardiac surgery. A meta-analysis of 35,501 patients suggested that, compared with TXA or EACA, aprotinin may increase mortality in low-risk to treat high-risk cases but not in high-risk cases.删除17:<u>349</u> An RCT compared with propensity-matched controls who did |删除段内换行|not.删除22:<u>$^{350}$</u> Treatment with aprotinin was associated with significantly increased risks of early and late mortality. Sander et al.删除22:<u>$^{351}$</u> observed that the use of TXA was associated with higher cumulative drainage losses and a higher rate of repeat thoracotomy for bleeding than in the group of patients treated with aprotinin. In the subgroup of patients with open-chamber procedures, mortality was lower in the aprotinin group than in the TXA group (7.5 versus. 16.2%; P = 0.02).

Compared with controls, significantly reduced allogeneic blood transfusions were reported with autologous platelet-rich plasma, together with a decrease in major adverse events.删除22:<u>$^{356}$</u> However, a large RCT is needed to confirm the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma as a haemostatic option.\n\n【5】A prospective study of 10 patients receiving an intraoperative series of four apheresis concentrates showed the changes in platelet count, viscoelastic and aggregometric variables and bleeding.删除22:<u>$^{357}$</u>\n\n【6】### Desmopressin\n\n【7】A double-blind RCT ($n = 102$) tested the effects of DDAVP on postoperative blood loss and platelet aggregation.删除22:<u>$^{358}$</u> The intervention group was treated with $0.3\\ \\mu g \\cdot kg^{−1}$ during surgery and a control group received saline. The results showed a significant decrease in postoperative blood loss and FFP transfusions in the DDAVP group during the first 6 h postoperatively (the duration of the drug activity). Further studies are needed to establish, whether platelet aggregation, RBC or platelet transfusion were observed. A subsequent RCT compared DDAVP with placebo in patients with bleeding following elective cardiac surgery despite pretreatment with TXA.删除22:<u>$^{359}$</u> The study was stopped early because of data monitoring in 135 patients showing that DDAVP did not reduce RBC transfusions or blood loss.

One parent usually has to reduce the number of hours worked or give up their job to provide fulltime care for their child. Caring for someone with SMA is physically and emotionally challenging and is associated with high levels of anxiety. Other siblings may feel that they get less attention and are emotionally affected by the effects of SMA. The committee concluded that SMA is a serious condition that has a substantial effect on family members and carers.\n\n【2】### Diagnosis and management\n\n【3】4.3 The classification system used to diagnose people with SMA is based on the age when symptoms appear. The committee was aware that the SMA classification system does not always reflect the full extent of the disease because boundaries between different SMA classifications are blurred and can be subjective. SMA type is a predictor of disease severity and prognosis. The clinical experts explained that newborn screening is not currently available in England. However, when a child in the family has been previously diagnosed with symptomatic SMA, genetic testing to screen for SMA is available for all siblings. NHS England noted that newborn screening may become part of future clinical practice in England. Also, both the NHS England representative and clinical experts highlighted that the availability of new active treatments for SMA is increasing the need for a screening programme. This is so that people who are eligible for treatment are identified and offered treatment as early as possible, and before the onset of symptoms.

Criteria for the response categories should be observed for a minimal period of 4 weeks to qualify for the response (eg, CR, PR, SD). The response criteria also include a category for unverified complete response (CRu), defined as greater than or equal to 75% reduction in tumor size but with a residual mass after treatment, with an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of less than 4 x 10^9/L. The usefulness of PET or PET/CT has not been evaluated in the response assessment of patients with ATLL.\n\n【2】## Treatment Options\n\n【3】### First-line Therapy\n\n【4】The ATLL subtype is an important factor for deciding appropriate treatment strategies. Smoldering and chronic subtypes are usually managed with watchful waiting until symptomatic disease. In contrast, the acute and lymphoma subtypes typically require immediate therapy.\n\n【5】The activity of zidovudine in combination with interferon-alfa (IFN-alfa) has been reported in a number of small studies and case reports. Among patients with primarily treatment-naïve aggressive ATLL, zidovudine in combination with IFN-alfa resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 58% to 80% and CR rates of 20% to 50%. Outcomes with this therapy were poor for patients with previously treated relapsed/refractory disease, with ORR 17% to 67% (nearly all PRs).\n\n【6】In a meta-analysis of 254 patients with ATLL, first-line therapy was composed of antiviral therapy (n = 75; comprising a combination of zidovudine and IFN-alfa in 97% of cases), chemotherapy alone (n = 77; CHOP in 86% of cases), or chemotherapy followed by maintenance antiviral therapy (n = 55). Most of the patients (n = 207 evaluable) had acute (47%) or lymphoma (41%) subtypes, with the remaining patients presenting with indolent disease. Among the patients who received first-line antiviral therapy alone, 60% had the acute subtype; in contrast, among the patients who received chemotherapy alone, 62% had the lymphoma subtype. In patients with available survival data and recorded first-line therapy (n = 207), the 5-year OS rates were 46%, 20%, and 12%, respectively, for patients who received first-line antiviral therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, and chemotherapy followed by antiviral therapy. The ORR was 66% (CR in 35%) among patients who received first-line antiviral therapy (n = 62 evaluable) and 88% (CR in 25%) among those who received first-line chemotherapy alone (n = 48 evaluable). Among patients who received chemotherapy followed by antiviral therapy (n = 14 evaluable), the ORR was 93% (CR in 50%). For all patients with follow-up survival data (n = 238), the median OS was 12 months and the 5-year OS rate was 23%. In the subgroup analysis by ATLL subtype, median OS was 6 months, 13 months, and not reached, respectively, in patients with acute lymphoma and indolent (chronic or smoldering) subtypes; the 5-year OS rate was 15%, 16%, and 76%, respectively. In the subgroup analysis by first-line treatment regimen, antiviral therapy resulted in significantly longer median OS (17 vs. 12 months) and higher 5-year OS rate (46% vs. 14%) compared with chemotherapy (with or without maintenance antiviral therapy). Interestingly, only the patients with the acute and indolent subtype benefited significantly from first-line antiviral therapy, whereas patients with the lymphoma subtype had worse survival with antiviral therapy and better outcomes with first-line chemotherapy (with or without maintenance antiviral treatment). Multivariate analysis showed that only the ATLL subtype and type of first-line treatment were significant independent predictors for poorer OS. These data suggest that zidovudine in combination with IFN-alfa is effective in patients with leukemic ATLL, but not in the lymphoma subtype.\n\n【7】A retrospective analysis evaluated outcomes in patients with aggressive ATLL (n = 73; 60% had lymphoma subtype) treated with chemotherapy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 139, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：T细胞淋巴瘤.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 15:29:18", "endTime": "2024/08/05 15:29:39", "cost": 20.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:26", "update_time": "2024-08-04 23:29:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 23:29:17"}

Out-comes for patients with obesity who receive acute MCS are less clear, but the reported experience with percutaneous cannulation for ECMO in patients with obesity has been reassuring. A German cohort of patients with BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 supported by peripherally cannulated VV- or VA-ECMO had comparable outcomes to patients without obesity, with 74% of VV patients and 52% of VA patients successfully weaning from support, and only 3% of patients requiring a surgical intervention for limb ischemia, with bleeding in 5% and wound infections in 6.  \nDespite reassuring outcomes reported from an experienced center, in practice the potential for cannulation site complications remains a major concern when managing patients with obesity in CS. Femoral access may be more challenging to obtain swiftly in a patient with excess adiposity and significant cannulation site bleeding may not be recognized promptly. Obesity is generally associated with a higher comorbidity burden that may also impact CS management, and patients with a BMI of more than 35 kg/m2 may be ineligible for heart transplantation, thus affecting MCS strategy plans.\n\n【6】### Special Considerations by Acute MCS Indication\n\n【7】Among patients hospitalized for myocarditis, approximately 2%–6% present with fulminant myocarditis and severe clinical instability including CS and ventricular arrhythmias 删除9:<u>(Table 3.5)</u>.  \nDespite limited data, acute MCS can be valuable as a bridge to recovery or transplantation in hemodynamically unstable patients with fulminant myocarditis, with the device selection dependent upon patient-specific criteria (eg, predominant LV or RV failure). Survival to discharge was 61% in an ELSO series of 150 patients with acute myocarditis supported by VA-ECMO. Importantly, such patients require prompt referral to specialized centers to allow for timely endomyocardial biopsy and treatment initiation. Endomyocardial biopsy should be performed as soon as possible in all patients with suspected myocarditis and CS, and if the initial biopsy is not high, should be repeated. Specific immunosuppressive therapy should be considered and used where indicated, at least as an initial trial while determining myocardial response, to try to promote cardiac recovery.\n\n【8】### Postcardiotomy shock\n\n【9】Postcardiotomy shock is a life-threatening entity that occurs infrequently after elective cardiac surgery, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is defined as acute HF after open heart surgery which leads to an inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass or leads to an acute decompensation in the early postoperative course. It is one of the most common indications for MCS and is associated with an in-hospital mortality of up to 50%.

The first generation of novel targeted and immunotherapy agents (ie, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, ipilimumab) demonstrated significantly improved response rates and outcomes compared with conventional therapies. Subsequently, a number of ongoing or recently completed phase II and phase III trials testing new immunotherapies, targeted therapies, and combination regimens have yielded noteworthy results. Second and emerging third generations of effective agents and combination regimens are now available for treatment of advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n\n【4】### Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors\n\n【5】The immune system may be capable of identifying and destroying certain malignant cells, a process called immunosurveillance. Conditions or events that compromise the immune system can lead to cancer cells escaping immunosurveillance. Once cancer cells have escaped immunosurveillance and have begun to proliferate, their genetic and phenotypic plasticity enables them to develop additional mechanisms by which the nascent tumor can evade, thwart, or even exploit the immune system. Immunotherapies are aimed at augmenting the immune response to overcome or circumvent the immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells and tumors. Some of the most effective immunotherapies target immune checkpoints—often exploited by cancers to decrease immune activity. For example, activation of T helper cells upon binding to antigens on the antigen-presenting cell (APC) can be modulated by other receptor-ligand interactions between the two cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are two examples of receptors on T cells that upon ligand binding trigger a signaling cascade that inhibits T-cell activation, limiting the immune response. Antibodies against these receptors (eg, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) prevent receptor-ligand interaction, removing the inhibition of T-cell activation and “releasing the brake” on the immune response. The importance of this science has recently been recognized by the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their research on CTLA-4 and PD-1.\n\n【6】#### Ipilimumab\n\n【7】Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the immune checkpoint receptor CTLA-4. Two phase III trials in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma support the use of ipilimumab for advanced disease 删除9:<u>(Table 9)</u>. Results from these trials showed that ipilimumab improved response rates, response duration, PFS, and OS in patients with previously treated or previously untreated advanced disease. Most importantly, extended follow-up showed that ipilimumab resulted in long-term survival in approximately 20% of patients (5-year OS: 18% vs. 9% for dacarbazine), consistent with findings from phase II trials. Safety results from these trials showed that ipilimumab is associated with a substantial risk of irAEs, including grade 3–4 events 删除9:<u>(Table 9)</u> and drug-related deaths (7 in CA184-002). Even higher rates of grade 3–4 irAEs were observed in patients treated with ipilimumab in CA184-024 删除9:<u>(Table 9)</u>, possibly due to the high dose used (10 mg/kg), or due to combination therapy with dacarbazine, or both. Combination therapy with ipilimumab and dacarbazine therefore is not used in clinical practice, and the FDA-recommended dose of ipilimumab is 3 mg/kg rather than 10 mg/kg. Results from CA184-169, a phase III randomized double-blind trial comparing ipilimumab 10 mg/kg dosing with 3 mg/kg, showed that the higher dose improved OS but was also associated with dramatically higher rates of treatment-related AEs.

In theory, this may allow for an eventual switch back to the original insecticide class if resistance decreases to the point that it is no longer detectable by means of bioassays.\n\n【3】The agricultural industry has had some success in managing resistance by using different insecticides over space and time. Similar approaches have been proposed with the aim of preventing or delaying the spread and increase of resistance by removing selection pressure or by killing resistant mosquitoes. These strategies include mixtures of insecticides, mosaic spraying, rotations of insecticides and deployment of multiple interventions in combination.\n\n【4】- Mixtures are co-formulations that combine two or more insecticides with different modes of action. Effective deployment of a mixture requires the presence of resistance to all insecticides in the mixture to be rare, so that any individual mosquito that survives exposure to one insecticide is highly likely to be killed by the other insecticide or insecticides. Ideally, all insecticides in a mixture should have a similar residual life and remain bioavailable over time; in practice, this is difficult to achieve, particularly for vector control products that are meant to last for a number of years, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). An ITN product containing a pyrethroid and a pyrrole insecticide and another containing a pyrethroid and a juvenile hormone mimic have been developed and prequalified by WHO. Trials are ongoing to assess the epidemiological impact of these products after which their public health value will be assessed in order to develop any WHO recommendation. A mixture of a pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid insecticide for IRS has been prequalified by WHO.\n- Rotations involve switching between insecticides with different modes of action at pre-set time intervals, irrespective of resistance frequencies. The theory is that resistance frequencies will decline (or at least not increase) during the period of non-deployment of insecticides with a specific mode of action.\n- Mosaics involve the deployment of insecticides with different modes of action in neighbouring geographical areas. The optimal spatial scale (size of areas) for mosaics has yet to be determined, and rotations are generally considered to be more practical and feasible.\n- Combinations expose the vector population to two classes of insecticides with differing modes of action through the co-deployment of different interventions in the same place, such as ITNs co-deployed with non-pyrethroid IRS 删除9:<u>(where both are at high coverage; see recommendations under section 4.1.2)</u>.\n\n【5】For malaria vector control, however, there is still little evidence of the success of these strategies and no consensus on the best IRM approach or approaches to apply in a given situation. Success of a particular approach will likely depend on mosquito genetics, behaviour and population dynamics, and the chemical nature of the insecticides and their formulation.

However, more recently, an exploration of overlaps between agriculture and public health found that – owing to caveats and case specificity – there is only weak evidence of one IRM approach being better than another, and that the standard practice of using insecticides until resistance emerges before switching to an alternative (i.e. sequential use) may be equally effective under certain circumstances.

Effective deployment of a mixture requires the presence of resistance to all insecticides in the mixture to be rare, so that any individual mosquito that survives exposure to one insecticide is highly likely to be killed by the other insecticide or insecticides. Ideally, all insecticides in a mixture should have a similar residual life and remain bioavailable over time; in practice, this is difficult to achieve, particularly for vector control products that are meant to last for a number of years, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). An ITN product containing a pyrethroid and a pyrrole insecticide and another containing a pyrethroid and a juvenile hormone mimic have been developed and prequalified by WHO. Trials are ongoing to assess the epidemiological impact of these products after which their public health value will be assessed in order to develop any WHO recommendation. A mixture of a pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid insecticide for IRS has been prequalified by WHO.\n- Rotations involve switching between insecticides with different modes of action at pre-set time intervals, irrespective of resistance frequencies. The theory is that resistance frequencies will decline (or at least not increase) during the period of non-deployment of insecticides with a specific mode of action.\n- Mosaics involve the deployment of insecticides with different modes of action in neighbouring geographical areas. The optimal spatial scale (size of areas) for mosaics has yet to be determined, and rotations are generally considered to be more practical and feasible.\n- Combinations expose the vector population to two classes of insecticides with differing modes of action through the co-deployment of different interventions in the same place, such as ITNs co-deployed with non-pyrethroid IRS 删除9:<u>(where both are at high coverage; see recommendations under section 4.1.2)</u>.\n\n【5】For malaria vector control, however, there is still little evidence of the success of these strategies and no consensus on the best IRM approach or approaches to apply in a given situation. Success of a particular approach will likely depend on mosquito genetics, behaviour and population dynamics, and the chemical nature of the insecticides and their formulation. A 2013 review of experimental and modelling studies on insecticide, pesticide and drug resistance concluded that mixtures generally lead to the slowest evolution of resistance 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[26]</u></u>. However, more recently, an exploration of overlaps between agriculture and public health found that – owing to caveats and case specificity – there is only weak evidence of one IRM approach being better than another, and that the standard practice of using insecticides until resistance emerges before switching to an alternative (i.e. sequential use) may be equally effective under certain circumstances. More data, both from research and programmatic operations, are needed to compare resistance management approaches in the field 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[27]</u></u> and to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms that are likely to favour different approaches in different situations 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[28]</u></u>, 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[29]</u></u>.\n\n【6】### Evidence-based planning\n\n【7】To achieve optimal impact against malaria, control measures must be suitable for the geographic area (based on vector bionomics) and, well targeted and deployed at sufficient coverage.

This has led to the formulation of 29 separate recommendations. The accompanying systematic review 删除11:<u>(7)</u> has been published and we developed 27 summary of judgement tables (available as online-only Supporting Information S1).\n\n【3】We considered the interventions to be adjunctive to best standard of care when best standard of care alone has failed to heal the ulcers. This should include basic wound dressings, which according to the IWJGDF Practical Guidelines should be dressings to absorb exudate and maintain a moist wound healing environment 删除11:<u>(1)</u>. Additionally, these should be of the lowest acquisition cost for the local health care economy.\n\n【4】## INTERVENTION: DEBRIDEMENT\n\n【5】**Clinical question 1:** In people with diabetes-related foot ulcers, is enzymatic debridement, autolytic debridement, biosurgical debridement, ultrasonic debridement, hydrosurgical abrasion or chemical debridement more effective for achieving wound healing compared to best standard of care (including sharp debridement)?\n\n【6】Debridement involves the removal of dead and devitalised tissue (necrosis and slough) from wounds in order to create a clean wound bed and is designed to promote wound healing. There are several different types of debridement including physical (e.g. surgical, sharp, hydro-debridement, or gaseous debridement), biological (larvae), autolytic (hydrogels) or biochemical (enzymes). Although there is unequivocal consensus amongst experts in support of the need for regular wound debridement to facilitate healing, high quality evidence to justify debridement in general, and to identify the best form of debridement is limited. For types of debridement, we found ten RCTs that met our prespecified inclusion criteria as described in our systematic review 删除11:<u>(16-25)</u>.

However we found no RCTs of other types of debridement.\n\n【7】**Recommendation 1:** Do not use autolytic, biosurgical, hydrosurgical, chemical or laser debridement over standard of care. (GRADE Strength of recommendation: Strong; Certainty of evidence: Low)\n\n【8】**Rationale:** No publications of RCTs were found on the use of autolytic, biosurgical, hydrosurgical, chemical or laser debridement that met our prespecified inclusion criteria, or had sufficient cost effectiveness data to warrant their use. Thus we were unable to make a recommendation supporting their use.\n\n【9】删除图片描述:<u>![](9_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 IWGDF指南：促进糖尿病患者足溃疡愈合的干预措施（更新版.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:04:01", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:04:42", "cost": 41.671}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:26", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:04:40", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:03:58"}

A flanged mouthpiece is typically used; however, an inline bacterial/viral filter must be used to prevent cross-contamination.\n\n【1】**Consensus:** A flanged mouthpiece is typically used; however, an inline bacterial/viral filter must be used to prevent cross-contamination.\n\n【2】The sniff measurement cannot be performed with a nasal filter, and one nostril remains open, thereby opening up a pathway for aerosol spreading.\n\n【3】**Consensus:** Use disposable nasal olive and tubing. Maintain physical distance and minimize exposure time.\n\n【4】#### i) 6-min walk test\nThe 6-min walk test (6MWT) requires a submaximal level of exertion, and sometimes, in patients with chronic respiratory failure, a maximal level of exertion. The best measure to decrease transmission is by using a face mask 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>. The impact of wearing a face mask when walking has been evaluated in both patients and healthy subjects. Wearing a surgical mask does not reduce the distance covered in a 6MWT but alters the sensation of breathing effort in healthy subjects. The performance of a 6MWT in patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection should be duly justified given the risk of interpersonal transmission.\n\n【5】**Consensus:**\n* The corridor must be low traffic and have natural ventilation.\n* The patient must wear a surgical mask during the entire test.\n* For patients who cannot tolerate a surgical mask (due to severe lung disease), an alternative option is a plastic face visor; however, extra precautions must be taken to protect staff, _i.e._ extra PPE must be worn by staff conducting the test.\n\n【6】#### j) Cardiopulmonary exercise tests\nCardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an important tool in the identification of differential diagnosis, response to interventions and risk stratification for surgical procedures. Existing assessments poorly identify exercise-associated pathophysiology and so the delivery of CPET services is essential. However, these services must be delivered safely, for both the patient performing the test and the staff conducting the test. During CPET the patient is breathing at ever-increasing ventilation rates without the exhaled breath being filtered. The potential, therefore, to produce infected droplets will increase the risk of both airborne and surface transmission and needs consideration regarding the potential for protracted viral shedding (_i.e._ the test lasts >10 min). Appropriate mitigation strategies are required to ensure that CPET can be conducted safely and without posing a risk of transmission and infection. The use of bacterial/viral filters that are routinely used in other LFTs have been postulated as a potential option to further mitigate the risk associated with CPET. These filters have an inherent resistance to exhalation and inhalation, but this is very low in relation to the expiratory and inspiratory flows. At high ventilation associated with maximal exercise the likely resistance is still relatively low and would be unlikely to impact exercise performance. The risk associated with the use of such filters on exercise is the water vapour in the exhaled breath which will likely saturate the filter as the exercise test ensues, thus leading to increased resistance to ventilation and impacting exercise performance and dyspnoea, especially in patients with anomalies in ventilatory mechanics. A PhD thesis from 2012 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[85]</u></u> outlined a trend towards significance of the increase in ventilation at peak exercise in the presence of a filter, but this aspect needs to be verified and validated in further larger studies involving patients and not only healthy volunteers. More recently researchers have confirmed the deleterious effects of using filters during CPET and the impact on measurements and interpretation of results 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[86]</u></u>. We therefore advise extreme caution when considering the use of bacterial/viral filters manufactured specifically for lung function testing as filter exhalation during a CPET.\n\n【7】**Consensus:** Single-use masks, sensors, turbines and gas lines should be used to prevent transmission from the repeated use. See introductory consensus notes 5.1a to 5.1k.\n\n【8】#### k) Bronchial challenge tests\nMeasures to avoid cross-contamination during inhaled drug delivery in the LFT setting For a variety of reasons, doing a bronchial challenge test (BCT) on someone who might have COVID-19 would have to be", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 15, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/COVID-19流行时期及后期肺功能检测的国际共识（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 09:42:56", "endTime": "2024/08/06 09:44:05", "cost": 69.362}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-05 17:44:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 17:42:53"}

For many years, the standard of care was melphalan and prednisone (MP). However, the introduction of novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has significantly improved patient outcomes.\n\n【3】### Treatment Overview\n\n【4】In general, the initial treatment choice for NDMM should be based on patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. Treatment goals should focus on achieving a rapid and deep response, with an emphasis on minimizing toxicity. Maintenance therapy may also be considered to prolong remission.\n\n【5】### Combination Therapies\n\n【6】1. **VRd (Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone):** The combination of VRd is a well-established first-line treatment for NDMM. Clinical trials have demonstrated high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS).\n\n【7】2. **Daratumumab Combinations:** Daratumumab, a CD38 mAb, in combination with various regimens has shown significant efficacy in NDMM. For example, daratumumab plus VRd or Rd has demonstrated deep and durable responses.\n\n【8】3. **Doublet Regimens:** For frail patients or those with significant comorbidities, doublet regimens such as lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) can be considered.\n\n【9】### Table: Key Clinical Trials in NDMM\n\n目录删除:<u>| Study                     | Regimen                | Patient Population            | Key Findings                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SWOG S0777                | VRd vs Rd              | NDMM, transplant-ineligible   | VRd improved PFS and OS compared to Rd.                                       |\n| ALCYONE                   | Daratumumab + VMP vs MP| NDMM, transplant-ineligible   | Addition of daratumumab improved PFS and response rates.                     |\n| MAIA                      | Daratumumab + Rd vs Rd | NDMM, transplant-ineligible   | Daratumumab + Rd significantly improved PFS and overall response rates.      |\n| TOURMALINE-MM2            | Ixazomib + Rd vs Rd    | NDMM, transplant-ineligible   | Addition of ixazomib improved PFS compared to Rd.                            |</u>\n\n【11】### Conclusion\n\n【12】The treatment landscape for NDMM has been transformed with the advent of novel therapies. Tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics and preferences is crucial for optimizing outcomes. Continued research and clinical trials will further refine and expand treatment options for this patient population.\n\n【13】The above summarizes key points from recent advancements and studies in the treatment of newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 13, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 CMRG建议：新诊断不适合移植治疗的多发性骨髓瘤的一线治疗.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:04:46", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:04:55", "cost": 9.196}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:04:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:04:43"}

Acne affects approximately 85% of teenagers but can occur in most age groups and can persist into adulthood. The burden of acne, as measured by disability-adjusted life years, ranked second among all skin diseases in 2013. Over 50 million people in the US have acne. In the US, more than 5.1 million Americans sought medical treatment for acne, leading to $846 million in medical costs and $398 million in lost productivity for patients and caregivers in 2013. Acne has important impact on emotional functioning, social functioning, relationships, leisure activities, daily activities, sleep, school, and work. The health-related quality of life impact of acne is comparable to that of chronic conditions such as asthma, psoriasis, and arthritis. Acne is associated with increased risks of stigmatization, bullying, depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem, and suicidal ideation.\n\n【3】Multifactorial pathogenesis of acne involves follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization with *Cutibacterium acnes*, sebum production, complex inflammatory mechanisms involving both innate and acquired immunity, neuroendocrine mechanisms, and genetic and nongenetic factors. Risk factors for acne development include increasing age during adolescence, family history of acne, and oily skin type.\n\n【4】### ACNE GRADING AND CLASSIFICATION\n\n【5】Numerous acne clinical grading and classification systems have been used in research and clinical settings to assess overall acne disease severity, lesion number and morphologies, affected anatomic sites, and associated secondary changes such as dyspigmentation and scarring. Consistent use of an acne grading and classification system may help facilitate therapeutic decision-making and assess treatment response in clinical practice. Available grading systems include the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), Leeds revised acne grading system, Global Acne Grading System, Global Acne Severity Scale, and Comprehensive Acne Severity Scale, among others.\n\n【6】While there is no universally accepted acne grading system in clinical settings, the IGA is most commonly used in the US and demonstrates good agreement between clinician and patient ratings. The definition of IGA scales varied over time and will require harmonization efforts to facilitate use and future meta-analyses. The IGA scale has been used in many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for acne treatments and proposed as a cohesive framework upon which to establish an ideal acne grading system. An ideal acne grading system should measure the types of primary acne lesions, number of lesions, and extent and region of skin involvement and should feature strong psychometric properties, ability to categorize severity via descriptive text or photographs, ease of use, and stakeholder acceptance. Stakeholders from the International Dermatology Outcomes Measures and the American Academy of Dermatology reached consensus on a 5-point ordinal scale (ranging from 0-4: clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, and severe) to quantify severity of acne and other inflammatory dermatoses in routine clinical practice. Descriptors of this scale remain to be standardized and validated for use in facial and truncal acne. Acne severity may also be measured via digital photography, as is increasingly used in clinical practice and trials, as well as fluorescent photography, polarized light photography, video microscopy, and multispectral imaging modalities.\n\n【7】Beyond signs and symptoms, core acne outcomes measures should also include domains such as satisfaction with appearance, extent of scars/dark marks, satisfaction with treatment received, long-term acne control, adverse events, and health-related quality of life. Acne quality-of-life measures provide a more comprehensive and holistic perspective on the burden of acne on patients’ lives and may not correlate well with clinical acne severity. While multiple dermatology-specific and acne-specific health-related quality-of-life measures are available as research tools, shorter measures also exist for use in routine clinical practice.\n\n【8】### MICROBIOLOGICAL AND ENDOCRINE TESTING\n\n【9】*C. acnes* (formerly *Propionibacterium acnes*) is a Gram-positive anaerobic rod primarily implicated in acne pathogenesis, with some strains likely pathogenetic while others commensal in the skin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2024+AAD指南：寻常痤疮的护理管理(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 15:12:46", "endTime": "2024/08/05 15:13:08", "cost": 21.971}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-04 23:13:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 23:12:45"}

Men with prolonged erections that are not fully rigid are less likely to later progress to acute ischemic priapism compared to those with fully rigid erections. As such, partial erections should likely not be counted towards the four-hour time criteria. Similarly, the specific medication used to create the erection is an important factor to consider. Men treated with alprostadil alone are less prone to progress to ischemic priapism compared to those treated with papaverine and phentolamine, which may counteract normal pathways of detumescence. Pain is also not likely a helpful indicator, as many men may experience pain relating to the injection medication or pain from full engorgement. Ultimately, clinical judgment is required to determine if any specific therapy is warranted versus additional observation.\n\n【1】The optimal management strategy for a persistent erection following iatrogenic ICI administration is not clear. Several randomized, controlled studies have evaluated the use of oral therapies, including terbutaline, pseudoephedrine, and midodrine in this setting. Results from these small series demonstrated either modest or inconsistent responses. Specifically, oral midodrine as a single dose was not more effective than placebo, whereas in a repeat-dosing protocol, it was modestly more effective (36-41% versus 12-15%). Similarly, oral pseudoephedrine (60 mg) was found to be mildly more effective than placebo, although not statistically significant (28% versus 12%). In a case series of 14 men receiving midodrine 15-30 mg, all men achieved detumescence, although side effects included increased blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n【2】Other potential conservative treatments include applying ice to the penis, ejaculation, exercise, laying supine, and penile compresses. It is notable that none of these therapies have any high-level evidence and that most are based on clinician experience and physiologic mechanism. Given the non-emergent nature of prolonged iatrogenic erections, the Panel felt that these treatments were reasonable and could be done at the clinician’s discretion. However, these should never be used in place of, or prolong effective treatments, if more emergent detumescence is required (ie, if a fully rigid erection >4 hours).\n\n【3】In contrast to the above therapies, the use of ICI phenylephrine is highly effective in men with prolonged erections <4 hours; an injection of intracavernosal phenylephrine should be considered as a primary treatment option 删除9:<u>(see Supplementary Materials A for guidance on dosing and administration of phenylephrine)</u>. Four specific case series (n = 126 combined) with phenylephrine doses ranging from 200-1000 mcg achieved detumescence in 100% of men.\n\n【4】Intracavernosal aspiration and irrigation likely represents too aggressive of a therapy for this specific clinical scenario to be used as a first-line therapy. Additionally, the physiologic rationale for aspiration and irrigation is to remove intracavernosal clots and permit entry of fresh blood in an attempt to restore smooth muscle function and vascular drainage. However, persistent, prolonged erections may be considered for aspiration and irrigation if phenylephrine alone is unsuccessful. See Supplementary Materials B for guidance on aspiration and irrigation.\n\n【5】In contemporary practice, prolonged erections often present in distinct ‘virtual’ clinical settings, including during telephone conversations, text messages, and other similar scenarios. It is the Panel’s opinion that these must be managed using the clinician’s best judgment and may lead to recommendations of observation with status updates, oral or topical therapies (eg, pseudoephedrine, ice), urgent return to clinic with anticipated phenylephrine injection, or referral to the emergency department.\n\n【6】### 22. Clinicians should instruct patients who receive intracavernosal injection teaching or an in-office pharmacologically induced erection to return to the office if they have an erection lasting >4 hours. (Expert Opinion)\n\n【7】The Panel felt that it was important to highlight a clinician’s responsibility in managing office-based erectogenic therapies. In cases of prolonged erections resulting from in-office intracavernosal erectogenic injections, the treating physician should make appropriate efforts to achieve adequate detumescence prior to dismissal from the office. Patients should also be counseled as to appropriate management strategies if a fully rigid erection were to recur after leaving the office. In general, the Panel felt that it was not appropriate for clinicians who administer in-office erectogenic medications to refer the patient to the emergency department as a matter of routine following an in-office injection, rather, the patient should return to the office for detumescence whenever possible. Similarly, it is the Panel’s opinion that clinicians should not administer intracavernosal injection therapies if they lack the expertise, facilities, hospital privileges, or other factors which preclude them from fully managing ischemic priapism (including surgical management if required).\n\n【8】All patients should be instructed at the time of in-office training or after receiving an in-office erectogenic", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AUA_SMSNA：复发性缺血性、镰状细胞患者和非缺血性阴茎异常勃起的诊断和管理指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:24:07", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:25:12", "cost": 64.636}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:25:09", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:24:04"}

Genetic analyses (eg, BRAF or KIT mutation status) are appropriate for patients being considered for treatment with targeted therapy, or if mutational status is relevant to eligibility for participation in a clinical trial. To ensure that adequate metastatic material is available for mutational analysis, biopsy (core, excisional, or incisional) is preferred if initial therapy is to be systemic and archival tissue is not available. However, the panel also recognized that brain metastases are typically treated without histologic confirmation.\n\n【4】Panelists encourage baseline chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with or without PET/CT in patients with stage IV melanoma. Because patients with metastatic melanoma have a high incidence of brain metastases, brain MRI or CT scan with contrast should be performed at presentation with stage IV disease. Brain MRI is also recommended if patients have even minimal symptoms or physical findings suggestive of CNS involvement, or if results of imaging would affect decisions about treatment.\n\n【5】Although LDH is not a sensitive marker for detecting metastatic disease, the panel recognizes its prognostic value. It is recommended that serum LDH be obtained at diagnosis of stage IV disease. Other blood work may be done at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n【6】Treatment of Primary Melanoma\n\n【7】Wide Excision\n\n【8】Surgical excision is the primary treatment for melanoma. Several prospective randomized trials have been conducted in an effort to define optimal surgical margins for primary melanoma 删除9:<u>(Table 3)</u>.\n\n【9】In an international prospective study carried out by WHO, 612 patients with primary melanomas not thicker than 2.0 mm were randomized to wide excision with 1 cm or ≥3 cm margins. At a median follow-up of 90 months, local recurrence, DFS and OS rates were similar in both groups. Similarly, Swedish and French randomized trials confirmed that survival was not compromised by narrower margins in melanomas thinner than 2 mm.\n\n【10】A multicenter European trial randomized 936 patients with melanoma thicker than 2.0 mm to wide excision with 2 or 4 cm margins. The 5-year OS rate was similar in the two groups. This is in keeping with previous trials that found no survival benefits with margins wider than 2 cm for thicker lesions. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the first three trials shown in Table 3 reported that surgical excision margins of at least 1 cm and no more than 2 cm are adequate.\n\n【11】A recent update on the UK-based prospective trial of 1- versus 3-cm margins in patients with melanomas greater than 2 mm thick showed that at a median follow-up of 8.8 years, wider margin was associated with statistically significantly improved melanoma-specific survival 删除9:<u>(see Table 3 footnote)</u>. OS was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Although this is the only prospective trial that has shown a wider margin to be associated with a survival advantage, this is not practice-changing finding. The current recommendations are for 2-cm margins in this population, and this trial did not demonstrate superiority of 3-cm over 2-cm margins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 129, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：皮肤黑色素瘤(1)(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 16:58:26", "endTime": "2024/08/05 17:28:08", "cost": 1781.105}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-05 01:28:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 00:56:26"}

According to the Rotterdam criteria, PCOS in adults is diagnosed based on a minimum of two of the following: oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology on ultrasound, after ruling out differential diagnoses. These criteria result in four phenotypes of PCOS including phenotype A with oligo/anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and PCO morphology; phenotype B with oligo/anovulation and hyperandrogenism; phenotype C with hyperandrogenism and PCO morphology; and phenotype D with oligo/anovulation and PCO morphology. PCOS is associated with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features. Aetiology is complex including genetic, in-utero, potential epigenetic factors, exacerbated by adverse lifestyle and excess adiposity. Hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and resulting hyperinsulinemia are common underpinnings in PCOS.\n\n【2】PCOS and excess adiposity have a bidirectional relationship, with excess weight exacerbating the underpinning hormonal imbalance and PCOS itself appearing to predispose to excess weight and weight gain. The prevalence of PCOS in women with obesity is up to 37%. Women with PCOS may also be more likely to gain weight longitudinally and at a greater pace. This may be attributable to impairments in satiety regulation and increased prevalence of psychological features of PCOS such as anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life. Obesity further exacerbates hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia and plays a key independent role in increasing cardiometabolic risks in women with PCOS.\n\n【3】Women with PCOS commonly have oligo/anovulation, with or without irregular menstrual cycles, with PCOS the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. Infertility and a longer time to pregnancy may confer a higher risk for pregnancy and birth complications. Additionally, the type and intensity of treatment used to manage infertility, may further complicate pregnancy and birth outcomes of multiple pregnancies. Infertility is exacerbated by obesity. Women with PCOS are generally at higher risk of pregnancy and birth complications including gestational diabetes (GDM), gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, induction of labour, caesarean section, preterm birth, and large for gestational age babies. The association of PCOS with pregnancy and birth complications varies by PCOS phenotype, target population, ethnic background, self or family history of metabolic, reproductive, and potentially psychological conditions during or outside pregnancy, and women's lifestyle. In pregnancy, obesity is an independent risk factor for complications, as is excess gestational weight gain. Both obesity and increased gestational weight gain are documented in PCOS although whether there is an additional adverse impact of gestational weight gain on pregnancy and birth complications in women with PCOS is not well understood.\n\n【4】While common features of PCOS are recognized as risk factors for pregnancy and birth complications by pregnancy care guidelines, PCOS per se is not consistently perceived as a risk factor for complications in pregnant women with PCOS. Delayed and missed diagnosis is common in the general population and recognition of PCOS as a risk factor in pregnancy and birth complications is even poorer. In this context, we aimed to review the relationships between PCOS and pregnancy and birth complications, the intersecting impact of obesity and excess gestational weight gain, the need to enhance recognition of PCOS before and during pregnancy, and to provide maternity care that meets the needs of this high-risk group. Here, we seek to reflect the evidence assembled for the International evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of PCOS and the multidisciplinary recommendations for clinical management of pregnancy in PCOS from the guidelines including risk, screening, pregnancy care, lifestyle, healthy gestational weight gain, and lifestyle in pregnancy.\n\n# 2 | PCOS, Pregnancy, and Birth Complications\n\n【6】Increased body mass index (BMI) at conception is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as GDM, pregnancy hypertensive disorders, and macrosomia. Similarly, risk are increased with excess gestational weight gain in pregnancy. Additionally, women with a higher BMI in the absence of obesity have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Women with PCOS who were referred for infertility treatments conceived with a higher BMI, and in nonpregnant women with PCOS the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher. However, there is no evidence about preconception BMI in unselected populations of women with PCOS. Two systematic reviews of pregnancy and birth complications in women with and without PCOS confirmed that women with PCOS have higher total gestational weight gain compared with women without PCOS. However, it was unclear whether this higher gestational weight gain results in a higher proportion of women with PCOS exceeding the internationally recognized National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formally Institute of Medicine [IOM]) recommendations for a healthy gestational weight gain.\n\n【7】Women with PCOS are at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform molar pregnancy, and miscarriage.\n\n【8】## Table 1 National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formally Institute of Medicine [IOM]) recommendations for a healthy gestational weight gain in singleton pregnancies\n\n参考删除-3:<u>| Preconception BMI category       | Total weight gain (kg) |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Underweight (<18.5 kg/m²)        | 12.5–18.0              |\n| Normal (18.5–24.9 kg/m²)         | 11.5–16.0              |\n| Overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m²)     | 7.0–11.5               |\n| Obese (≥30 kg/m²)                | 5.0–9.0                |</u>\n\n【10】*Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test.*", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/多囊卵巢综合征患者妊娠的临床管理专家意见（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "exacerbated by obesity.

However, it was unclear whether this higher gestational weight gain results in a higher proportion of women with PCOS exceeding the internationally recognized National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formally Institute of Medicine [IOM]) recommendations for a healthy gestational weight gain.\n\n【7】Women with PCOS are at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform molar pregnancy, and miscarriage.\n\n【8】## Table 1 National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formally Institute of Medicine [IOM]) recommendations for a healthy gestational weight gain in singleton pregnancies\n\n参考删除-3:<u>| Preconception BMI category       | Total weight gain (kg) |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Underweight (<18.5 kg/m²)        | 12.5–18.0              |\n| Normal (18.5–24.9 kg/m²)         | 11.5–16.0              |\n| Overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m²)     | 7.0–11.5               |\n| Obese (≥30 kg/m²)                | 5.0–9.0                |</u>\n\n【10】*Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test.*", "index": 432, "show": true, "start": 432, "end": 487, "province": ["格式规范性", "缺少换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/05 11:26:32", "endTime": "2024/08/05 11:28:14", "cost": 102.536}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:25", "update_time": "2024-08-04 19:28:15", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 19:26:32"}

Although the presence of CNS-3 involvement at diagnosis is uncommon (approximately 3%–7% of cases), a substantial proportion of patients (>50%) will eventually develop CNS leukemia in the absence of CNS-directed therapy.\n\n【2】Factors associated with an increased risk for CNS relapse in children include T-cell immunophenotype, high WBC counts at presentation, Ph-positive disease, t(4;11) translocation, and presence of leukemic cells in the CSF. CNS-directed therapy may include IT chemotherapy (eg, MTX, cytarabine, corticosteroids), cranial irradiation, and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, HD-MTX, cytarabine, asparaginase).\n\n【3】Although prophylactic cranial irradiation is an effective treatment modality for CNS leukemia, its use has been reduced or eliminated because it is associated with serious adverse events, such as neurocognitive dysfunctions, secondary malignancies, and other long-term complications. With the increasing use of effective IT chemotherapy and high-dose systemic chemotherapy regimens, studies have examined the feasibility of eliminating cranial irradiation as part of CNS prophylaxis. In studies of children with ALL who only received IT and/or intensive systemic chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis, the 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse or any CNS relapse was 3% to 4% and 4% to 5%, respectively.\n\n【4】Data from the St. Jude Total Therapy XV study showed dramatic improvements in survival outcomes for the AYA population with the omission of cranial irradiation. In this study, patients were primarily risk-stratified based on treatment response; patients were treated according to risk-adjusted intensive chemotherapy, with the incorporation of MRD evaluation during induction (day 19) to determine the need for additional doses of asparaginase. The 5-year EFS rate for the AYA population (aged 15–18 years; n = 45) was 86% (95% CI, 72%–94%), which was not significantly different from the 87% EFS rate (95% CI, 84%–90%; P = .61) observed for the younger patients (n = 448). The 5-year OS rates for the AYA patients and younger patients were 88% and 94%, respectively (P = .13). The favorable EFS and OS outcomes in AYA patients in this study were attributed in part to the use of intensive dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase, in addition to early IT therapy (ie, triple IT chemotherapy with MTX, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) for CNS-directed therapy. In addition, the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation was safely omitted in this study; the 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse and any CNS relapse was 3% and 4%, respectively, for the entire study population (n = 498). Moreover, all 11 patients with isolated CNS relapse were children <12 years of age. This study showed that, with intensive risk-adjusted therapy and effective CNS-directed IT regimens, AYA patients can obtain long-term EFS without the need for cranial irradiation or routine allogeneic HCT.\n\n【5】### NCCN Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment of Extramedullary Involvement\n\n【6】CNS involvement should be evaluated with lumbar puncture at timing in accordance with the specific treatment protocol used for each patient. Pediatric-inspired treatment regimens typically include lumbar puncture at diagnostic workup.

Duration of time off thyroid hormone depends on the extent of thyroidectomy and approach to hormone replacement in the initial postoperative setting. Two retrospective studies showed that patients with distantly metastatic RAI-avid differentiated thyroid cancer who received recombinant human TSH in preparation for RAI treatment did not differ significantly in treatment response or survival, compared to patients who received RAI treatment after thyroid hormone withdrawal. However, thyroid hormone withdrawal continues to be preferred by the NCCN Panel for preparation of RAI treatment compared to thyrotropin alfa, due to an increased likelihood of augmentation of the delivered radiation dose. Guidance for preparing the patient and managing iodine-131 administration can be found in the *Principles of Radiation and Radioactive Iodine Therapy: Iodine-131 Administration* in the NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma.\n\n【3】Data suggest that lower doses of RAI are as effective as higher doses versus 100 mCi for ablation in patients with low-risk thyroid cancer (eg, T1b/T2 [1–4 cm], clinical N0 disease). The NCCN Guidelines reflect a more cautious approach to using RAI ablation based on these randomized trials. If RAI ablation is used, the NCCN Guidelines recommend (category 1) 30 mCi of iodine-131 for RAI ablation in patients at low risk based on these randomized trials. This same ablation dose—30 mCi—may be considered (category 2B) in patients at slightly higher risk. RAI ablation is not recommended in patients at very low risk.\n\n【4】RAI therapy for thyroid cancer carries the risk of possible adverse effects including salivary gland dysfunction, lacrimal gland dysfunction, transient gonadal dysfunction, and secondary primary malignancies. The possible benefits of RAI should be weighed with the risk of adverse effects as part of treatment decision-making. Adverse effects may be minimized by using lower doses of RAI.\n\n【5】Historically, the three methods of determining iodine-131 therapy activities (doses) have included: empiric fixed doses, quantitative dosimetry, and upper-bound limits that are set by blood dosimetry. Most patients at NCCN Member Institutions receive postoperative RAI based on empiric fixed dosing; a few centers use a combination of blood dosimetry and quantitative lesional dosimetry. In the past, hospitalization was required to administer therapeutic doses of iodine-131 greater than 30 mCi 删除19:<u>(1110 MBq)</u>. However, hospitalization is no longer necessary in most states, because a change in federal regulations permits the use of much larger iodine-131 doses in patients who are ambulatory. However, iodine-131 therapy with high doses (>200 mCi) is best done in medical centers with experience using high doses. Dosimetry can be used to determine the maximal safe dose for treatment of unresectable, large-volume, iodine-concentrating, residual, or recurrent disease.\n\n【6】Administration of a fixed dose of iodine-131 is the most widely used and simplest method. Most clinics use this method regardless of the percentage uptake of iodine-131 in the remnant or metastatic lesion. Patients with uptake in tumor are routinely treated with large, fixed amounts of iodine-131. Lymph node metastases may be treated with about 100 to 175 mCi 删除19:<u>(3700–6475 MBq)</u> of iodine-131. Cancer growing through the thyroid capsule (and incompletely resected) is treated with 150 to 200 mCi 删除19:<u>(5550–7400 MBq)</u>. Patients with distant metastases are usually treated with 100 to 200 mCi 删除19:<u>(3700–7400 MBq)</u> of iodine-131, which typically will not induce radiation sickness or produce serious damage to other structures but may exceed generally accepted safety limits to the blood in the elderly and in those with impaired kidney function.

岁以下患者的安全性和有效性数据尚未提供。儿童和青少年感染 COVID-19 的典型症状相对较轻——即使那些高风险的重症患者——可能会转变为较小的感染规模和需要治疗的患者数量较少的情况，导致测试的结果相对显得不太重要。在考虑这些因素时，小组建议根据美国疾病控制与预防中心的指导意见，将疫苗接种作为预防 COVID-19 的主要策略，并辅以暴露前预防 (PrEP) 作为补充策略。我们没有根据任何患者群体推荐 \"推荐\"，而是校准了我们对重症 COVID-19 风险程度的推荐强度，认为 PrEP 的可能不良效果会被更容易预计和接受，从而减轻患者的重症 COVID-19 风险。因此，我们建议，对于那些因自我免疫功能低下或医学禁忌症不能接种疫苗的高危患者来说 PrEP 更可能是有意义的。对于那些低风险的患者，如果他们希望作为一种疾病预防手段使用，我们建议根据具体情况考虑使用 PrEP。\n\n【1】参考删除-3:<u>### Agent Previously Available for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis\nTixagevimab–cilgavimab 最初于 2021 年 12 月 8 日获得授权，用于 12 岁及以上且体重至少为

Comparable clinical trial data are not available for pediatric patients. The Clinical Administration of Remdesivir After COVID-19 Diagnosis in Children (CARAVAN) study 删除19:<u>(NCT04431453)</u> is a phase 2/3, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical and virologic effects of remdesivir in infants and children from birth to <18 years of age who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Interim results for 53 participants indicate that remdesivir was well tolerated; constipation was the most common AE, and no SAEs were attributed to the study drug. A high proportion (85%) of the participants showed clinical improvement based on a clinical ordinal scale over the study period. The study is ongoing 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[126]</u></u>.

The lack of high-quality clinical trial data on the effectiveness of remdesivir in pediatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 complicates treatment decisions for pediatric providers. Remdesivir is reported to be generally safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients, with a high proportion of treated patients showing clinical improvement, based on interim clinical trial data 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[126]</u></u>. However, no placebo-controlled, randomized, controlled trials of remdesivir in pediatric patients have been completed, which raises the question as to whether antiviral treatment improves the clinical status of children when compared with supportive care.\n\n【2】### Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Therapy for Treating COVID-19 in Pediatric Patients Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19\n\n【3】COVID-19 may cause significant pulmonary inflammation, resulting in hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and, in the most severe cases, death. Several randomized trials conducted in adults with severe and critical COVID-19 demonstrated reductions in mortality with corticosteroid administration, and corticosteroid use is recommended by the WHO, NIH, and IDSA guidelines for managing COVID-19 in selected patients with severe or critical disease 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>125, 133, 134</u>]</u>.\n\n【4】Most studies evaluating the impact of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 have used dexamethasone. For this reason, the panel favors using dexamethasone over alternative corticosteroids. A randomized clinical trial evaluated the impact of high-dose dexamethasone (20 mg daily × 5 days, followed by 10 mg daily × 5 days) versus usual care (most often dexamethasone at 6 mg daily) in hospitalized adults. Among patients receiving low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy, the higher-dose dexamethasone group experienced greater mortality (19% vs 12%; RR: 1.删除13:<u>59, 95</u>% CI: 1.20–2.10), prompting trial enrollment to be halted for this group 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[142]</u></u>. Based on the above evidence, the recommended dose for patients weighing ≥40 kg is 6 mg daily; for patients weighing <40 kg, the recommended daily dose is 0.15 mg/kg. Dexamethasone may be administered intravenously or orally for up to 10 days.\n\n【5】For patients with critical COVID-19 disease, additional anti-inflammatory therapy may be indicated. For adults with critical COVID-19 and evidence of significant inflammation, adding an interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, such as tocilizumab, or a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, such as baricitinib, to corticosteroid therapy is associated with superior outcomes. However, published reports on the use of these therapies in pediatric patients with COVID-19 are extremely limited.\n\n【6】### Corticosteroids for Treating COVID-19  \n**Recommendation 3.7:**\n\n【7】For patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19, require supplemental oxygen therapy above baseline, and are worsening, consider administering dexamethasone.\n\n【8】**Comments:**\n\n【9】The RECOVERY trial randomized 6424 hospitalized adults to receive dexamethasone at 6 mg/day for up to 10 days plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Overall, there was a significant reduction in 28-day mortality in the dexamethasone group relative to the placebo group (22.9% vs 25.7%; RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.75–0.93; $P < 0.001$). However, among the approximately one-quarter of the study population who required no supplemental oxygen, there was no statistical difference in 28-day mortality, but numerically higher mortality in the dexamethasone group (17.8% versus 14%; RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.92–1.55) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[96]</u></u>. A subsequent observational study evaluated the impact of dexamethasone on 90-day mortality among adults hospitalized in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system with a positive PCR or antigen test for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 9450 hospitalized adults who did not require supplemental oxygen, 3514 received dexamethasone within 48 hours of admission. Using propensity score weighting, the hazard ratio (HR) for 90-day mortality was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.47–2.12) for patients who received dexamethasone 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[143]</u></u>.

This study removed the OB of rats, which reliably produced rapid apoptosis of the peripheral OSNs. Although the results indicated that minocycline did not prevent apoptosis, the time course was significantly delayed, suggesting the possibility that lesser degrees of injury might respond to minocycline. Moreover, the limited data available suggest that apoptosis is a common pathway for a range of human olfactory disorders, leading those authors to suggest that minocycline might serve as a broadly effective treatment for smell loss.\n\n【5】Based on this theoretical rationale, as well as an excellent safety profile, a human trial of minocycline for the management of PVOL was undertaken. A total of 55 patients were randomized in a prospective, double-blind, controlled trial of 50-mg minocycline twice daily for 3 weeks and were followed for 7 months. The duration of olfactory loss was not reported. Unfortunately, there was no difference between groups in TDI score but both groups demonstrated baseline improvement in olfactory performance over those 7 months.

As in young children the proposed activities should consider the ease and enjoyment of moving and playing.\n\n【2】Structured exercise programs based on aerobic and/or resistance training or sports participation in gym or sport facilities can be performed at moderate intensity, gradually increasing the frequency, intensity and duration over time.\n\n【3】A research gap is still represented by establishing the optimal exercise dose for promoting weight loss in children and adolescents living with overweight or obesity. According to a recent meta-regression analysis that included aerobic exercise and strength training interventions, a positive linear association between exercise dose and weight loss was found without identifying the specific amount needed to achieve significant weight loss (roughly 150 min of moderate activity per week).\n\n【4】In addition, the daily physical activity outside the intervention was not considered.

Physical exercise programs lasting 4–12 weeks, or sessions of 60 min each, or involving a total exercise time of at least 1,500 min were effective in improving cardio-metabolic and vascular parameters (lipids, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], intrahepatic fat, systolic blood pressure, and carotid intima-media thickness) in children with obesity 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[75]</u></u>.\n\n【6】As part of behavioral approaches, sedentary activity should be reduced, particularly the amount of recreational screen time to a minimum of two hours daily 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[73]</u></u>.

We recommend using the latter as it has been the basis for the indication of adjuvant imatinib in all contemporary clinical trials 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u> 删除15:<u>(I, A)</u> More recently, a novel risk classification based on heatmaps is being increasingly used 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[19]</u></u>. This system considers the same prognostic factors but as continuous variables. Adjuvant imatinib is usually recommended for those cases with a probability of recurrence higher than 40% using this heatmap model.\n\n【1】### Management of local and locoregional disease\n\n【2】The algorithm for the management of localized disease is depicted in Fig. 1.\n\n【3】#### Surgery\n\n【4】Approximately 70% of patients with GIST will be treated by surgery alone, and therefore, it constitutes the standard treatment for localized GIST ≥ 2 cm or GISTs with suspicious EUS features 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[12]</u></u>. R0 resection (negative margins) with a 1-cm margin is the aim of surgery, although seemingly an R1 surgery (microscopic positive margins) does not impact local recurrence. With the exception of SDH-deficient GISTs, routine local lymphadenectomy is not indicated, although nearby enlarged lymph nodes should be removed 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>. GISTs are prone to bleed, friable, and easy to rupture masses, which is an independent poor prognostic factor 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[19]</u></u>. The most common location of GISTs is the stomach and a formal anatomic gastrectomy is rarely required. Conversely, segmental resection with a 1-cm radial margin is the most common approach 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[22]</u></u>. Segmental resection is also the best choice in GIST from the small bowel. However, pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple resection can be required in duodenal periampullary tumors. Surgery for rectal GISTs with anastomosis to the remaining rectum can be done but in GIST close to the anal sphincter abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy is required. Novel transanal techniques to remove rectal GISTs have been described although mostly in case reports.\n\n【5】Laparoscopic surgery is indicated if the GIST is less than 5 cm and up to 8 cm in size can be removed laparoscopically with retrospective data favoring this approach regarding less hospital staying and wound complications 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[23]</u></u>. Data from endoscopic resection for small GISTs (most of them <2 cm) have mixed results, with potential for perforation. Enucleation techniques attempt to preserve organ’s function and can be suitable for polyp-like GISTs with a narrow connection to muscularis propria 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[12]</u></u>.\n\n【6】In SDH-deficient and NF1-associated GISTs presenting as multifocal disease, surgery is often indicated when one or a few tumors are growing faster than the others or have become symptomatic.\n\n【7】#### Adjuvant treatment with imatinib\n\n【8】Three randomized phase III trials established the indication and duration of adjuvant treatment in GIST. The ACOSOG Z9001 trial showed superiority in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) for imatinib against placebo in resected GIST tumors larger than 3 cm 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[24]</u></u>.

This benefit was not statistically significant, but the observed trend supports the results of the Scandinavian/German trial SSGXVIII/AIO in which 3 years of adjuvant imatinib proved superior regarding overall survival and RFS in high-risk (following NIH modifications) GIST patients 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[26]</u></u>.

However, no data support this practice in the adjuvant setting and the only available retrospective series suggests that the use of 400 mg daily already provides benefit in this molecular subset (IV, B) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[30]</u></u>.

It would also help them to tailor their approach to the needs of their employees and the organisation. They believed that this would give employers the opportunity to raise awareness about why the interventions are being implemented, which could improve employee support for them.\n\n【3】The committee discussed that by providing interventions during the working day, employers would give employees a beneficial break from work and send a clear message about the importance of mental wellbeing. However, organisations should be flexible because employees may also prefer to access interventions outside work hours. The committee also noted that people will have different preferences about how they learn. For example, some employees would benefit from a group setting, whereas others would prefer one-to-one or online interventions. This highlights the importance of engaging with employees to ensure that their needs are considered, and that if online interventions are offered, digital exclusion does not prevent any employee from accessing the intervention.\n\n【4】The committee also discussed, based on their experience, that the effectiveness of certain interventions may be different for different groups. Factors may include socioeconomic factors such as low income and whether people have disabilities, work in urban or rural locations or have good digital access. The committee agreed that staff surveys and consultation could be used to regularly monitor intervention accessibility.\n\n【5】### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\n【6】The committee discussed the resource implications of these recommendations but overall did not think they would be significant in most cases. They noted that some organisations may not be able to provide interventions during work hours for financial reasons. In these cases, it may be better to provide interventions outside work hours rather than not making them available at all. They also noted that some organisations may not have the space to provide certain interventions on site, and this may affect the type or format of intervention offered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 41, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/NICE：工作中的心理健康指南（NG.212）（2022）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/06 10:26:46", "endTime": "2024/08/06 10:27:42", "cost": 55.919}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:24", "update_time": "2024-08-05 18:27:42", "grab_time": "2024-08-05 18:26:46"}

This is especially important when DxWBS is not performed or when PT-WBS shows additional foci of activity as compared to DxWBS 删除11:<u>(86)</u>. A high level of concordance between DxWBS and PT-WBS findings has been demonstrated in 2 large single-institution data sets from Stanford University of 98% concordance in a group of 307 patients 删除11:<u>(71,87)</u>.

Along with basal and stimulated-Tg testing and cross-sectional anatomic imaging, the results of follow-up DxWBS contribute to dynamic risk stratification, which is usually performed at 6–12 mo after initial treatment strategy (surgery and postoperative 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I therapy). For patients with rising Tg levels, DxWBS and PET/CT evaluation can be scheduled sequentially to assess for recurrent and/or metastatic disease and evaluate tumor biologic behavior for determining whether the patient would benefit from additional 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I therapy 删除11:<u>(73)</u>. Of importance, a recent report examining the results of a large Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database 删除19:<u>(28,220 patients diagnosed with DTC between 1998 and 2011)</u> showed that follow-up DxWBS performed after primary treatment of DTC are the only imaging studies associated with improved disease-specific survival, demonstrating the clinical benefit of 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I theranostics for DTC management 删除8:<u>删除11:<u>(90)</u>. Figures 1 and 2 provide sample protocols for initiation of DxWBS evaluation, 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I therapy delivery, and PT-WBS imaging after THW and after rhTSH stimulation, respectively.

Risk-Based Management Followed by Posttherapy 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I Scans with Diagnostic Intent\n\n【4】The risk-based approach is generally used for thyroid remnant ablation and for adjuvant 删除22:<u>$^{131}$</u>I treatment. Empiric activity selection is the most commonly used approach in advanced DTC, in which the nuclear medicine physician chooses an activity based on convention, availability, experience with various imaging modalities, and patient parameters. With this therapeutic approach, patients are most commonly given activities of 1.1 GBq (30 mCi), 删除17:<u>1.85</u> GBq (50 mCi), 删除17:<u>3.7</u>GBq (100 mCi), 删除17:<u>5.6</u> GBq (150 mCi), or 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) 删除11:<u>(91)</u>.

The primary outcome of the trial is the proportion of clinically significant cancers (defined as ISUP 2 or above) detected in people who had a biopsy with a suspicious MRI (MRI score 3, 4 or 5 on either the Likert or Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] schema). The EAG commented that the study aims to recruit 3,600 people with suspected prostate cancer in the UK, but that not all of these people will provide data on MRI fusion performance (the study includes 2 linked randomised controlled trials, and is also comparing biparametric and multiparametric MRI to detect clinically significant prostate cancers). The EAG emphasised that to help inform cost-effectiveness estimates from its model, the numbers of cancer detected by ISUP grade should be reported (rather than just the number of ISUP grade 2 or higher). During consultation on the draft guidance, a stakeholder further highlighted the importance of collecting data on the effect of MRI fusion technologies on detecting clinically insignificant prostate cancer, as well as higher-grade cancers. Given the uncertainty about the generalisability of data generated using 1 MRI fusion technology to others 删除9:<u>(see section 3.4)</u>, it would be beneficial if data was reported separately for each MRI fusion biopsy system. The committee concluded that this will be a useful trial for reducing uncertainty about MRI fusion biopsy performance, but noted that the estimated study completion data is not until 2026.

The prevalence of pre-frail state and frailty syndrome increases exponentially with advancing age and is associated with greater morbidity, disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, mortality, and health care resource use. Frailty represents a global problem, making early identification, evaluation, and treatment to prevent the cascade of events leading from functional decline to disability and death, one of the challenges of geriatric and general medicine. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in advancing age, chronic illness, and frailty and include a broad spectrum of rhythm and conduction abnormalities. However, no systematic studies or recommendations on the management of arrhythmias are available specifically for the elderly and frail population, and the uptake of many effective antiarrhythmic therapies in these patients remains the slowest. This European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) consensus document focuses on the biology of frailty, common comorbidities, and methods of assessing frailty, in respect to a specific issue of arrhythmias and conduction disease, provide evidence base advice on the management of arrhythmias in patients with frailty syndrome, and identifies knowledge gaps and directions for future research.\n\n【2】### Keywords\n\n【3】European Heart Rhythm Association • Position paper • Consensus document • Frailty • Elderly • Frailty syndrome • Frailty assessment • Frailty domains • Pre-frailty state • Elderly • Cachexia • Arrhythmias • Atrial fibrillation • Ventricular tachycardia • Heart failure • Stroke • Cognitive impairment • Antiarrhythmic drugs • Anticoagulants • Ablation • Pacemaker • Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator • Cardiac resynchronization therapy • Cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/EHRA关于虚弱综合征心律失常管理的专家共识文件——心脏节律学会(HRS)、亚太心脏节律学会(APHRS)、拉丁美洲心脏节律学会(LAHRS)和南部非洲心律失常学会(CASA)认可.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 11:26:13", "endTime": "2024/08/05 11:26:29", "cost": 15.637}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:24", "update_time": "2024-08-04 19:26:29", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 19:26:13"}

The presence of aortic valve disease (stenosis or insufficiency) in the absence of either LV dilatation or LV hypertrophy should not preclude donor consideration. Isolated cases of aortic or mitral valve intervention at the time of heart transplant have been performed with acceptable outcomes. However, this consideration should be balanced with risks and benefits for the recipient. Use of donor heart with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) can be used with backbench repair of the ASD before implanting the donor heart. Use of donors with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) remains controversial. Small retrospective studies have shown mixed results. Recent registry analysis demonstrated that almost half of all used donors had LVH (interventricular septum or left ventricular posterior wall thickness ≥ 1.1 cm), with 5.6% having moderate to severe LVH (≥ 1.4 cm). This study demonstrated similar survival up to 3 years post-transplant regardless of the presence of LVH. However, donors with LVH and additional factors (≥ 55 years old or ischemic time > 4 hours) led to significantly worse 3-year survival. A 2017 consensus conference identified LVH as one of the most important risk factors to consider when evaluating donor organs, with approximately half the participants stating that an organ with LVH greater than 1.3 cm would be considered as unacceptable.\n\n【3】### Donor cardiac function\n\n【4】Multiple large retrospective registry studies have demonstrated that donor hearts with initial low EF may have reversible dysfunction particularly in the setting of younger age or brain death/ severe brain injury causing neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. In the case of brain death/injury, donor management recommendations include hormonal replacement (i.e., thyroxine and steroids), optimization of cardiac loading conditions (i.e., diuretics, vasopressors), and catecholamine repletion (i.e., inotropes). Donor hearts with initial low EF that improve have been utilized with no significant difference in short- and long-term survival compared to donors with normal initial EF ≥55%. Systolic function of these donor hearts may continue to improve post transplantation. Thus, donor hearts with initial low EF that improve with appropriate donor management should be considered for transplantation.\n\n【5】### Donor-recipient size matching\n\n【6】Multiple large registry studies have shown predicted heart mass to be the optimal metric for size matching donor and recipient in heart transplant. The degree of undersizing or oversizing by predicted heart mass correlates more accurately with survival post-transplant compared to weight alone though prospective studies are warranted.\n\n【7】### Donor considerations for pediatric recipients\n\n【8】Recommendations relevant to pediatric donor considerations are presented in the ISHLT Pediatric Consensus statement.\n\n【9】### Recommendations on the utilization of donation after circulatory death donor hearts\n\n【10】Since the successful introduction of utilizing distantly procured donation after circulatory death hearts into clinical practice in 2014, with the necessary and adjunctive use of organ perfusion technology, donation after circulatory death (DCD) heart transplantation has become standard of care in several transplant centers in Australia and the United Kingdom. Excellent early- and medium-term outcomes have encouraged a wider uptake across some European centers and led to the initiation of the FDA approved Donors after Circulatory Death Heart Trial 删除19:<u>(NCT03831048)</u> across 25 institutions in the US that is expected to complete in December 2021. To date over 270 DCD heart transplants have been performed with outcomes that are non-inferior to heart transplants from standard care hearts from donation after brain death (DBD) donation.

The presence of aortic valve disease (stenosis or insufficiency) in the absence of either LV dilatation or LV hypertrophy should not preclude donor consideration. Isolated cases of aortic or mitral valve intervention at the time of heart transplant have been performed with acceptable outcomes. However, this consideration should be balanced with risks and benefits for the recipient. Use of donor heart with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) can be used with backbench repair of the ASD before implanting the donor heart. Use of donors with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) remains controversial. Small retrospective studies have shown mixed results. Recent registry analysis demonstrated that almost half of all used donors had LVH (interventricular septum or left ventricular posterior wall thickness ≥ 1.1 cm), with 5.6% having moderate to severe LVH (≥ 1.4 cm). This study demonstrated similar survival up to 3 years post-transplant regardless of the presence of LVH. However, donors with LVH and additional factors (≥ 55 years old or ischemic time > 4 hours) led to significantly worse 3-year survival. A 2017 consensus conference identified LVH as one of the most important risk factors to consider when evaluating donor organs, with approximately half the participants stating that an organ with LVH greater than 1.3 cm would be considered as unacceptable.\n\n【3】### Donor cardiac function\n\n【4】Multiple large retrospective registry studies have demonstrated that donor hearts with initial low EF may have reversible dysfunction particularly in the setting of younger age or brain death/ severe brain injury causing neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. In the case of brain death/injury, donor management recommendations include hormonal replacement (i.e., thyroxine and steroids), optimization of cardiac loading conditions (i.e., diuretics, vasopressors), and catecholamine repletion (i.e., inotropes). Donor hearts with initial low EF that improve have been utilized with no significant difference in short- and long-term survival compared to donors with normal initial EF ≥55%. Systolic function of these donor hearts may continue to improve post transplantation. Thus, donor hearts with initial low EF that improve with appropriate donor management should be considered for transplantation.\n\n【5】### Donor-recipient size matching\n\n【6】Multiple large registry studies have shown predicted heart mass to be the optimal metric for size matching donor and recipient in heart transplant. The degree of undersizing or oversizing by predicted heart mass correlates more accurately with survival post-transplant compared to weight alone though prospective studies are warranted.\n\n【7】### Donor considerations for pediatric recipients\n\n【8】Recommendations relevant to pediatric donor considerations are presented in the ISHLT Pediatric Consensus statement.\n\n【9】### Recommendations on the utilization of donation after circulatory death donor hearts\n\n【10】Since the successful introduction of utilizing distantly procured donation after circulatory death hearts into clinical practice in 2014, with the necessary and adjunctive use of organ perfusion technology, donation after circulatory death (DCD) heart transplantation has become standard of care in several transplant centers in Australia and the United Kingdom. Excellent early- and medium-term outcomes have encouraged a wider uptake across some European centers and led to the initiation of the FDA approved Donors after Circulatory Death Heart Trial 删除19:<u>(NCT03831048)</u> across 25 institutions in the US that is expected to complete in December 2021.

It was put forward that few of the irAEs generally considered chronic are genuinely ‘ongoing’ in the sense of persistent inflammation and active tissue injury, but rather, many long-lasting irAEs such as alopecia, vitiligo, neuropathies, xerostomia and endocrinopathies are more likely due to irreversible tissue damage. The distinction between irAEs that reasonably may be expected to respond to anti-inflammatory interventions versus those for which steroids would be considered futile has important implications for toxicity management. Endocrine toxicities are often used as the paradigmatic example of irAEs that generally are not expected to improve with immunosuppression—high-dose glucocorticoids have demonstrated no effect on either the medication or thyrotoxicosis or maintenance dose of levothyroxine in patients with ICI-related thyroid disorders, and high-dose glucocorticoids have conferred no obvious benefit over low-dose steroids for patients with anti-CTLA4-associated hypophysitis.

HHV8-positive MCD follows a more aggressive course. Immunocompromising conditions is a primary risk factor for HHV8-positive MCD, with HIV being the most common. HHV8-positive MCD is more commonly associated with systemic symptoms such as fluid accumulation, cytopenias, liver and kidney dysfunction, and constitutional symptoms driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6).\n\n【3】iMCD affects multiple lymph node stations and exhibits lymphadenopathy in more than 1 lymph node or lymph node region. Clinical presentation can range from mild constitutional symptoms to life-threatening organ failure. iMCD-TAFRO generally has a more aggressive disease course and poorer outcomes than iMCD-NOS.\n\n【4】### Diagnosis\n\n【5】Due to the nonspecific and heterogeneous nature of the disease, CD can often mimic other benign and malignant conditions. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and histopathologic analysis is required for diagnosis of CD.\n\n【6】CD has classically been divided into hypervascular (hyaline vascular), plasmacytic, and mixed histologic subtypes. The hypervascular variant is most commonly associated with UCD, whereas the plasmacytic and mixed variants are more common in MCD. A combination of clinical, imaging, and pathologic features should be used to establish the diagnosis of UCD, HHV8-positive MCD, and iMCD. In an asymptomatic patient, histopathology consistent with CD along with the involvement of a single lymph node or region of lymph nodes can establish a diagnosis of UCD.\n\n【7】Adequate immunophenotyping of a surgically excised lymph node is required to confirm the diagnosis and exclude malignancy and other diseases. The recommended immunohistochemistry (IHC) panel essential for diagnosis includes: CD20, CD3, CD5, CD138, HHV8, kappa, and lambda. Additional IHC markers may be useful under certain circumstances: Ki-67 index, Ig heavy chains, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, cyclin D1, CD21, CD23, CD38, IRF4/MUM1, and PAX5. Cell surface marker analysis by flow cytometry with peripheral blood and/or biopsy specimen of kappa/lambda, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, and CD10 may also be useful in certain circumstances. EBER-ISH immunophenotyping is also an essential diagnostic test. Other diagnostic testing that may be useful under certain circumstances includes molecular analysis to detect immunoglobulin and TCR gene rearrangements.\n\n【8】In 2017, international diagnostic consensus criteria for the diagnosis of iMCD was published. These diagnostic criteria include two major criteria (histopathologic lymph node features consistent with the iMCD spectrum and enlarged lymph node in at least 2 lymph node stations) and eleven minor criteria (anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, renal dysfunction [elevated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or proteinuria], elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP], constitutional symptoms, enlarged spleen and/or liver, fluid accumulation, eruptive cherry hemangiomatosis or violaceous papules, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis).

A substitute decision maker must be involved in the consent process if an adult patient is not competent to provide informed consent for any reason.\n\n【1】All patients should be informed that arrangements will be made to meet with an anesthesiologist if they wish to discuss anesthetic management before admission to the facility. The preoperative assessment clinic should also allow nursing and other healthcare personnel to assess the patient. The attending anesthesiologist is responsible for performing a final preanesthetic assessment in the immediate preoperative period.\n\n【2】### 4.1 Preoperative Testing\n\n【3】Laboratory testing should not be performed on a routine basis but should be obtained only when results will change perioperative management. Laboratory investigations should be performed when indicated by the patient’s medical status, drug therapy, and the nature of the proposed procedure. Routine laboratory blood testing, electrocardiograms, and chest radiographs are not recommended for asymptomatic patients at low perioperative risk. Examples of low-risk surgery include breast biopsy, cataract surgery, minor breast surgery, superficial procedures, and many minor ambulatory procedures.

It also aims to encourage DCs to work collaboratively with other providers to provide patients with the optimal resources for successfully managing their chronic pain.\n\n【2】A limitation in making such recommendations is that some treatment practices in common use may not have accumulated the highest quality evidence. However, it is important to give practitioners as much guidance as possible, using the best available evidence, as Sackett first described it.\n\n【3】There are factors that contribute to the relative scarcity of high-quality evidence for nonpharmacological treatments, particularly manual therapies, for chronic pain. One is that randomized controlled trials of nonpharmacological treatments, particularly manual therapies, usually assume a curative model. RCTs usually test the hypothesis that a course of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) will result in long-term pain reduction—a curative model—and if it does not, then SMT is considered ineffective. However, chronic MSK pain is not medically managed in that same curative model. Analgesics are not expected to function like antibiotics—that is, to “cure” pain after a course of treatment. Although some studies are beginning to approach the topic of chronic pain from a management, rather than curative, approach, the literature is still scarce on optimal treatment parameters, and future studies are important to conduct.\n\n【4】After our project was completed and we were preparing to submit AHRQ published a systematic review, which had formed the foundation of our recommendations. We found that their 2020 update did not substantially alter our recommendations. The fact that AHRQ saw fit to produce an update so quickly emphasizes the importance of the topic of nonpharmacological approaches to chronic MSK pain.\n\n【5】We sought to secure buy-in from the chiropractic profession in developing this guideline by forming a large and broad-based Delphi panel and by disseminating the preliminary recommendations very widely throughout the profession. We hope that the consensus achieved will facilitate their use in chiropractic practice. We also hope that these evidence-based recommendations for a variety of conservative treatment approaches to the management of common chronic MSK pain conditions will foster collaboration between provider groups, and thereby improve patient outcomes.\n\n【6】## Acknowledgments\n\n【7】The authors thank Cathy Evans for excellence, as usual, in coordinating the complex consensus process and ensuring the highest response rate possible.

However, the panel recommends use of these regimens without leucovorin in situations where leucovorin is not available.\n\n【1】Palliative/Best Supportive Care  \nThe goals of palliative/best supportive care are to prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering and improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers, regardless of the stage of the disease or the need for other therapies. In patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal or EGJ cancer, palliative/best supportive care provides symptom relief and improvement in overall quality of life and may result in prolongation of life. This is especially true when a multimodality interdisciplinary approach is pursued. Therefore, a multimodality interdisciplinary approach to palliative/best supportive care of patients with esophageal and EGJ cancers is encouraged.\n\n【2】Dysphagia  \nDysphagia is the most common symptom in patients with esophageal cancer, especially those with locally advanced disease. Dysphagia most often arises due to obstruction but can also be associated with tumor-related dystonality. Assessing the extent of disease and severity of swallowing impairment, preferably through a standardized scoring scale, is essential to initiate appropriate interventions for long-term palliation of dysphagia in patients with esophageal cancer. Although various treatment options are available for the management of dysphagia, optimal treatment is still debated. Individualized management of esophageal cancer-related dysphagia is strongly encouraged. Patients with dysphagia who are not candidates for curative surgery should be considered for palliation of their symptoms. Palliative management of dysphagia can be achieved through multiple modalities, although placement of permanent or temporary SEMS is the most common and can achieve long-term results. However, the guidelines emphasize that stent placement is generally not advised in patients who are surgical candidates due to concerns that stent-related adverse events may preclude future curative surgery.\n\n【3】A clinical trial involving 45 patients with esophageal carcinoma found that temporary placement of SEMS with concurrent RT significantly reduced the total number of patients with one or more complications (P = .042) and increased resultant PFS and OS rates (P = .005 and P = .001, respectively) compared with permanent stent placement. Additionally, membrane-covered stents have been shown to have significantly better palliation than conventional bare metal stents because of the decreased rate of tumor ingrowth, which in turn is associated with lower rates of endoscopic reinsertion for dysphagia. However, the optimal extent of the covering to prevent recurrent obstruction is unknown. In a recent trial of 98 patients with malignant dysphagia randomized to receive either a fully covered or partially covered SEMS, there was no significant difference in recurrent obstruction between the two stent types (19% for fully covered SEMS vs. 22% for partially covered SEMS; P = .65). The times to recurrent obstruction and the rates of adverse events were also similar. Another recent trial investigating stent migration found no significant differences in either migration distance or migration frequency between the two stent types. However, there was a trend towards better dysphagia relief with the fully covered stents as measured by the Watson and Ogilvie dysphagia scores (P = .081 and P = .067, respectively). The results suggest that fully covered SEMS may not lower the recurrent obstruction or stent migration rates compared to partially covered SEMS but may be more effective in the palliation of dysphagia.\n\n【4】The optimal stent diameter needed to effectively palliate dysphagia in patients with esophageal cancer is also unknown.

Interestingly, several studies have linked these genetic anomalies to the development of ILD-PH. A parallel human-murine study\\(^7\\) unveiled reduced expression of BMPR2 in myofibroblasts and pulmonary arterioles from fibrotic lesions of explanted IPF lungs, compared to normal lung samples, as well as increased expression of IL-6 and phosphorylated STAT3  in the same regions. Both these findings were more prominent in IPF patients with PH than in patients with IPF alone. Furthermore, BMPR2 expression was inversely correlated, and IL-6 expression directly correlated with mPAP, and microRNAs downregulating BMPR2 were increased differentially in IPF patients with and without PH. Blocking IL-6 and p-STAT3 reduced expression of those microRNAs, which in the bleomycin murine model allowed expression of BMPR2 and attenuated lung fibrosis and vascular remodeling. Other authors have reported reduced expression of the BMP9/BMP2/SMAD signaling pathway and apoptosis of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells in the same bleomycin murine model, resulting in the development of PH. Interestingly, pulmonary vascular changes were prevented by the administration of recombinant human BMP9 protein. These studies suggest that restoring the BMP/TGF-β equilibrium might be an interesting avenue in some forms of ILD-PH. Importantly, targeting BMP-TGF-β signaling together (an activin receptor type IIA-Fc [ActRIIA-Fc] fusion protein) resulted in a promising reduction in PVR in patients receiving background therapy for PAH, in a Phase 2 study. These findings have since been validated with clinical endpoints in the Phase 3 STELLAR study.\n\n【1】Patients bearing mutations of the gene for T-box transcription factor 4 (TBX4) may develop PAH alongside small patella syndrome (which presents with impaired development of the lower limbs), congenital heart disease and cognitive deficits. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant, and PAH typically develops with incomplete penetrance. The disease can manifest either in childhood or in adult life. In two recently published case series, patients with TBX4 mutations frequently had mild obstructive or restrictive spirometric patterns, DLCO reduction, and pulmonary abnormalities on imaging (emphysema, mosaic distribution, septal lines, micronodules, and ground-glass opacity), with one patient initially being diagnosed with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) based on the imaging aspect. Some patients manifest combined emphysematous or interstitial abnormalities with plexiform lesions and arterial vasculopathy typical of PAH in the lung tissue.\n\n【2】Finally, recent promising pharmacological data may explain the possible role of the endothelium in triggering epithelial fibrotic changes, based on the direct antifibrotic action of treprostinil, iloprost, soluble guanylate cyclase modulators, and other vasodilators observed in animal models. However, these findings remain to be further validated in the clinical setting. This might infer that not only does fibrosis drive pulmonary vascular remodeling but also that pulmonary vascular dysfunction might promote the development of fibrosis.\n\n【3】### Histopathology\n\n【4】In patients with ILD, histological changes occur at any level of the pulmonary vascular tree, from the main arteries to arterioles, as well as including the capillaries and pulmonary veins. In addition, there are changes involving all layers of the vessel wall thus constituting a “panvasculopathy.” Interestingly, the number of capillaries is increased in non-fibrotic areas and reduced where fibrosis is more prominent. This finding is associated with the presence of PH in ILD and has also been observed in systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related fibrosis with PH. Notably, all the vascular changes, such as hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of the entire arterial wall layers and pulmonary-bronchial anastomoses, can be found in more pronounced in ILD-PH patients. While prominently increased vascular thickness may be observed in arteries, arterioles, and venules in fibrotic areas, non-fibrotic areas show a pattern characterized by occlusion of pulmonary venules, muscularization of arterioles, and capillary multiplication . In contrast to these findings, a recent study applied the Heath & Edwards histological grading to pulmonary vascular lesions of explanted end stage fibrotic ILD lungs. The findings included a widespread arterial vasculopathy which was not correlated with the hemodynamic or functional severity of the underlying lung disease; however, the sites of examination (fibrotic vs. non-fibrotic areas) were not specified. Interestingly, almost half of the patients had evidence of vascular occlusion with intimal fibrosis and in one-fifth plexiform lesions were evident; the latter being traditionally considered a hallmark of WHO group 1 PAH pathology.\n\n【5】The distinction between progressive vascular alteration due to increasing fibrotic disease versus the development of pulmonary vascular changes independent of fibrosis is a key pathogenic factor that is yet to be fully understood. Indeed, while it is commonly held that fibrosis drives the development of vascular changes either directly or indirectly, could the opposite hold true and vascular changes drive the development of fibrosis in a feedback loop?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/西班牙肺血管研究所创新药物开发计划的共识声明--第3组肺动脉高压：与间质性肺疾病相关的肺动脉高压的发病机制、临床特征和表型.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/05 14:32:53", "endTime": "2024/08/05 14:33:25", "cost": 31.721}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-02 01:44:23", "update_time": "2024-08-04 22:33:25", "grab_time": "2024-08-04 22:32:53"}

See Table 12 for details of \"Ongoing Management.\"|删除段之间换行|### Separate chronic pain management goals\n\n【5】The goals of chronic pain management are different from those of acute pain associated with acute care management. The chronic care goals may include (but are not limited to) the following:\n- a. Pain control: relief to tolerance.\n- b. Support or maximize patient’s current level of function/ADLs.\n- c. Reduce/minimize reliance on medication.\n- d. Maximize patient satisfaction.\n- e. Maximize patient’s engagement in meaningful/pleasurable activities to de-emphasize pain (examples: playing with grandchildren; getting hair done; or going to the park).\n- f. Minimize exacerbation frequency and/or severity.\n- g. Minimize further disability.\n- h. Minimize lost time on the job.\n\n【6】### Consider patient-specific goals\n\n【7】Patients with chronic MSK pain generally fall into one of these categories:\n- a. Self-management is sufficient using strategies/procedures such as exercise, ice, heat, and stress reduction.\n- b. Episodic care is necessary to manage pain. Patients arrange nonpharmacological care on an as-needed basis to support their self-care strategies for acute flare-ups, 1–2 visits/episode, followed by release.\n- c. Scheduled ongoing physician-directed care is necessary to manage pain. Treatment withdrawal results in deterioration .\n\n【8】### Condition-specific diagnosis and treatment recommendations\n\n【9】This guideline includes recommendations for best practices for chiropractic management of some of the most common chronic MSK pain conditions.

Given the smaller magnitude of the PFS effect in patients without BRCA1/2 mutation, and that PRIMA likely included very few patients who had bevacizumab as part of primary therapy, single-agent niraparib is not a recommended maintenance therapy option for those who have BRCA1/2 wild-type or unknown and received bevacizumab as part of primary therapy 删除9:<u>(Table 23)</u>.\n\n【2】As in PAOLA-1, in PRIMA the patient group without BRCA1/2 mutation was further subdivided into homologous recombination deficient and proficient based on a GIS cutoff of 42 using the MyChoice CDx (Myriad Genetic Laboratories).删除21:<u>^754^</u> Results showed that the PFS effect of niraparib (vs. placebo) remained significant for the smaller subgroup of patients with homologous recombination deficiency but no BRCA1/2 mutation, and was significant, with a trend toward smaller magnitude, for the homologous recombination-proficient subgroup 删除9:<u>(Table 19)</u>.删除21:<u>^754^</u> Because of these results, the NCCN Panel chose to include the following footnote relating to the use of maintenance niraparib: in the absence of a BRCA1/2 mutation, homologous recombination deficiency status may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor therapy (category 2B).\n\n【3】OS data from the interim analysis was reported 删除9:<u>(Table 19)</u>, but it is premature to draw conclusions from those results.\n\n【4】**Veliparib**\n\n【5】The phase III VELIA study design was similar to GOG-0218 and ICON7 bevacizumab trials in that it tested the effect of adding veliparib during first-line chemotherapy and as subsequent single-agent maintenance after completion of chemotherapy.删除21:<u>^755^</u> VELIA did not require that patients have CR/PR before receiving maintenance therapy; they only needed to have absence of progression during first-line systemic therapy (6 cycles) and no limiting toxicities.

Subgroup analyses showed that whereas the PFS benefit from veliparib appeared to be the greatest for those with a BRCA1/2 mutation, and was significant for those with homologous recombination deficiency (BRCA1/2 mutation or a GIS ≤33 on myChoice CDx assay), the effect was smaller and not significant for the subgroup without BRCA1/2 mutation and the subgroup that was homologous recombination-proficient 删除9:<u>(no BRCA1/2 mutation and GIS <33; Table 19)</u>.删除21:<u>^755^</u> OS results were not mature.删除21:<u>^755^</u> Veliparib is not recommended in the NCCN Guidelines because it is not FDA approved for any indications.

When acute pharmacological cardioversion is considered, ibutilide and vernakalant (not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States) have demonstrated specific efficacy in acute pharmacological cardioversion of AF after cardiac surgery.\n\n【2】Special consideration should be given to patients who develop atrial arrhythmias after surgical ablation, which may vary in extent of ablation lesion sets. Management of this specific population would benefit from a heart team approach with close collaboration of the cardiac electrophysiologist and the operating surgeon in further individualizing acute treatment strategies and plans for longer-term follow-up. Acute management strategies will need to take into account potential concomitant sinus node dysfunction and an early period of extensive atrial inflammation.\n\n【3】### Acute Anticoagulation Considerations for AF After Cardiac Surgery\nData related to anticoagulation for AF after cardiac surgery are limited. Balancing the risk of stroke in this vulnerable population against the risk of major bleeding in this postsurgical population is key. Retrospective studies have highlighted the association of AF after isolated coronary artery bypass surgery with increased adverse outcomes of ischemic stroke and thromboembolism and mortality but have shown conflicting results in terms of the potential benefit of early initiation of oral anticoagulation. The conflicting results may relate to the nonrandomized nature of oral anticoagulant treatment; recipients of oral anticoagulants may be older, more frequently have a history of heart failure, and have increased risk for both thromboembolic and bleeding complications. Furthermore, although the retrospective studies included populations who had undergone cardioversion, the timing of anticoagulation in relation to the cardioversion was unclear.\n\n【4】In the absence of data from dedicated RCTs in this regard, the anticoagulation protocol used in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network RCT on rate versus rhythm control has frequently been extrapolated for clinical care. The study protocol recommended anticoagulation if patients remained in AF or had recurrent AF 48 hours after study randomization; anticoagulation with warfarin targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 was recommended, and bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin was allowed.

When acute pharmacological cardioversion is considered, ibutilide and vernakalant (not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States) have demonstrated specific efficacy in acute pharmacological cardioversion of AF after cardiac surgery.\n\n【2】Special consideration should be given to patients who develop atrial arrhythmias after surgical ablation, which may vary in extent of ablation lesion sets. Management of this specific population would benefit from a heart team approach with close collaboration of the cardiac electrophysiologist and the operating surgeon in further individualizing acute treatment strategies and plans for longer-term follow-up. Acute management strategies will need to take into account potential concomitant sinus node dysfunction and an early period of extensive atrial inflammation.\n\n【3】### Acute Anticoagulation Considerations for AF After Cardiac Surgery\nData related to anticoagulation for AF after cardiac surgery are limited. Balancing the risk of stroke in this vulnerable population against the risk of major bleeding in this postsurgical population is key. Retrospective studies have highlighted the association of AF after isolated coronary artery bypass surgery with increased adverse outcomes of ischemic stroke and thromboembolism and mortality but have shown conflicting results in terms of the potential benefit of early initiation of oral anticoagulation. The conflicting results may relate to the nonrandomized nature of oral anticoagulant treatment; recipients of oral anticoagulants may be older, more frequently have a history of heart failure, and have increased risk for both thromboembolic and bleeding complications. Furthermore, although the retrospective studies included populations who had undergone cardioversion, the timing of anticoagulation in relation to the cardioversion was unclear.\n\n【4】In the absence of data from dedicated RCTs in this regard, the anticoagulation protocol used in the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network RCT on rate versus rhythm control has frequently been extrapolated for clinical care. The study protocol recommended anticoagulation if patients remained in AF or had recurrent AF 48 hours after study randomization; anticoagulation with warfarin targeting an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 was recommended, and bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin was allowed. Anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days unless complications occurred. However, it is important to note that the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network RCT on rate versus rhythm control was focused primarily on rate versus rhythm control and was not powered to detect thromboembolism and stroke.

It is important to determine whether the multiple lung cancers are metastases or separate lung primaries (synchronous or metachronous); most multiple lung tumors are metastases. Lesions with different cell types, such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma, are usually different primary tumors. However, lesions of the same cell type may not be metastases. Therefore, it is essential to determine the histology of the lung tumor 删除9:<u>(see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. Infection and other benign diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, inflammatory granulomas). Although criteria have been established for diagnosing multiple lung cancers, no definitive method has been established before treatment. The Martini and Melamed criteria are often used to diagnose multiple lung cancers as follows: 1) the histologies are different; or 2) the histologies are the same, but there is no lymph node involvement and no extrathoracic metastases. Data suggest that NGS testing may help determine whether separate lung nodules are clonally related.\n\n【4】Broad molecular profiling can be used to assess multiple lung lesions 删除9:<u>(see Summary of the Guidelines Updates in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. For example, tumors with non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered to be clonally unrelated, separate primary lung cancers even if they are histologically similar. Therefore, these tumors can be treated with local therapy 删除9:<u>(see Multiple Lung Cancers in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. Treatment of multiple lung cancers will depend on the status of the lymph nodes (eg, N0–1) and on whether patients are asymptomatic, symptomatic, or at high or low risk of becoming symptomatic. Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting by thoracic surgeons, pulmonary medicine, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. In patients eligible for definitive local therapy, parenchymal-sparing resection is preferred 删除9:<u>(see the Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. Multiple lung nodules (eg, solid, subsolid nodules) may also be detected on CT scans; some of these nodules can be followed with imaging, whereas others need to be biopsied or excised .\n\n【5】For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the algorithm for multiple lung cancers. For example, the NCCN Panel added an initial recommendation for multidisciplinary evaluation for patients suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers. One of the goals during multidisciplinary evaluation for multiple lung cancers is to assess whether patients have lung nodules that can be observed instead of erroneously assuming that patients have stage IV NSCLC. The panel added the following caveats: lesions at low risk of becoming symptomatic can be observed, such as small subsolid nodules with slow growth. However, treatment should be considered if the lesion(s) show accelerating growth, increasing solid component, or increasing FDG uptake, even if the lesions are small.\n\n【6】Stage IIIB and IIIC NSCLC\n\n【7】Stage IIIB NSCLC comprises two unresectable groups, including: 1) T2–N3 tumors; and 2) T3–4–N2 tumors; stage IIIC NSCLC includes T3, N3 and contralateral mediastinal nodes (T4, N3), which are also unresectable.

Imaging may also be used to identify congenital abnormalities in infants with asthma-like symptoms, and alternative diagnoses in children with difficult-to-treat asthma. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the lungs can identify conditions such as bronchiectasis, emphysema, lung nodules, airway wall thickening and lung distension, and may assess airway distensibility. The presence of radiographically detected emphysema is considered when differentiating asthma from COPD , but there is no accepted threshold and these conditions can coexist. Moreover, air trapping (which may be present in asthma, and is also a feature of ageing) can be difficult to distinguish from emphysema. Chest imaging is not currently recommended to predict treatment outcomes or lung function decline, or to assess treatment response.\n\n【2】CT of the sinuses can identify changes suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps , which in patients with severe asthma may help with choice of biologic therapy 删除9:<u>(see Box 3-28, p.125)</u>.\n\n【3】### Box 1-3. Steps for confirming the diagnosis of asthma in a patient already taking ICS-containing treatment\n\n| Current status | Steps to confirm the diagnosis of asthma |\n| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation | **Diagnosis of asthma is confirmed.** Assess the level of asthma control  and review ICS-containing treatment . |\n| Variable respiratory symptoms but no variable airflow limitation | **Consider repeating spirometry** after withholding bronchodilator (4 hrs for SABA, 24 hrs for twice-daily ICS-LABA, 36 hrs for once-daily ICS-LABA) or during symptoms. Check between-visit variability of FEV₁, and bronchodilator responsiveness. If still normal, consider other diagnoses .<br> * If FEV₁ is >70% predicted: consider stepping down ICS-containing treatment 删除9:<u>(see Box 1-5)</u> and reassess in 2–4 weeks, then consider bronchial provocation test or repeating bronchodilator responsiveness.<br> * If FEV₁ is <70% predicted: consider stepping up ICS-containing treatment for 3 months , then reassess symptoms and lung function. If no response, resume previous treatment and refer patient for diagnosis and investigation. |\n| Few respiratory symptoms, normal lung function, and no variable airflow limitation | **Consider repeating BD responsiveness test** again after withholding bronchodilator as above or during symptoms. If normal, consider alternative diagnoses .<br> **Consider stepping down ICS-containing treatment** 删除9:<u>(see Box 1-5)</u>:<br> * If symptoms emerge and lung function falls: asthma is confirmed. Step up ICS-containing treatment to previous lowest effective dose.<br> * If no change in symptoms or lung function at lowest controller step: consider ceasing ICS-containing, and monitor patient closely for at least 12 months . |\n| Persistent shortness of breath and persistent airflow limitation | **Consider stepping up ICS-containing treatment for 3 months** , then reassess symptoms and lung function.

Imaging may also be used to identify congenital abnormalities in infants with asthma-like symptoms, and alternative diagnoses in children with difficult-to-treat asthma. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the lungs can identify conditions such as bronchiectasis, emphysema, lung nodules, airway wall thickening and lung distension, and may assess airway distensibility. The presence of radiographically detected emphysema is considered when differentiating asthma from COPD , but there is no accepted threshold and these conditions can coexist. Moreover, air trapping (which may be present in asthma, and is also a feature of ageing) can be difficult to distinguish from emphysema. Chest imaging is not currently recommended to predict treatment outcomes or lung function decline, or to assess treatment response.\n\n【2】CT of the sinuses can identify changes suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps , which in patients with severe asthma may help with choice of biologic therapy 删除9:<u>(see Box 3-28, p.125)</u>.\n\n【3】### Box 1-3.

Check between-visit variability of FEV₁, and bronchodilator responsiveness. If still normal, consider other diagnoses .<br> * If FEV₁ is >70% predicted: consider stepping down ICS-containing treatment 删除9:<u>(see Box 1-5)</u> and reassess in 2–4 weeks, then consider bronchial provocation test or repeating bronchodilator responsiveness.<br> * If FEV₁ is <70% predicted: consider stepping up ICS-containing treatment for 3 months , then reassess symptoms and lung function. If no response, resume previous treatment and refer patient for diagnosis and investigation. |\n| Few respiratory symptoms, normal lung function, and no variable airflow limitation | **Consider repeating BD responsiveness test** again after withholding bronchodilator as above or during symptoms. If normal, consider alternative diagnoses .<br> **Consider stepping down ICS-containing treatment** 删除9:<u>(see Box 1-5)</u>:<br> * If symptoms emerge and lung function falls: asthma is confirmed. Step up ICS-containing treatment to previous lowest effective dose.<br> * If no change in symptoms or lung function at lowest controller step: consider ceasing ICS-containing, and monitor patient closely for at least 12 months . |\n| Persistent shortness of breath and persistent airflow limitation | **Consider stepping up ICS-containing treatment for 3 months** , then reassess symptoms and lung function.

Image Acquisition\n\n【2】Imaging should start at the vertex and extend to the midthighs. Although a small lesion seen on PET may be better characterized with a diagnostic-quality CT, both CT and PET acquisition parameters will be scanner- and institution-dependent. Intravenous contrast is optional; however, it can improve characterization of hepatic metastases and other soft-tissue lesions. If diagnostic CT is performed, water should be used as oral contrast, since it will not obscure the CT identification of gastrointestinal lesions.\n\n【3】Time-of-flight PET with a reconstruction method including modeling of resolution degradation, often referred to as point spread function reconstruction, may help with the detection of small lesions. PET data should be fused with both standard and bone CT reconstructions.\n\n【4】PET/MRI may be used instead of PET/CT and may be beneficial for patients with liver-dominant NETs due to the ability to perform hepatobiliary phase imaging. Details about acquisition protocol and reconstruction for PET/MRI are beyond the scope of this guideline. For details, see relevant literature 删除11:<u>(21)</u>.\n\n【5】### G. Impact of ⁶⁴Cu Versus ⁶⁸Ga\n\n【6】The range of the positron is one of several components that will affect the spatial resolution of PET images. The amount of image blurring due to the positron range depends on the energies of the positrons emitted from the particular isotope. Positron emitters such as ¹⁸F and ⁶⁴Cu emit positrons of relatively low-energy (250 and 278 keV, average energy, respectively) and the amount of resolution loss from the positron range is 0.2 mm in full width half maximum (FWHM) of 0.3 mm in full width tenth maximum (FWTM). For ⁶⁸Ga, the energy of the positrons is higher (836 keV, average energy), increasing the positron’s range for image resolution and will underestimate activity concentration and SUV, particularly for small lesions. It is difficult to generalize how much of the greater positron range of ⁶⁸Ga will affect quantification in small lesions compared with ⁶⁴Cu. The reason for this is the complex interplay of the components that contributes to the final image resolution (i.e., the intrinsic detector resolution, system diameter, image reconstruction algorithm, and spatial filtering). Under typical clinical imaging conditions, it is expected that there will be an additional 10%–20% underestimation in small lesions (≤10-15 mm diameter) when imaging with ⁶⁸Ga compared with ⁶⁴Cu.\n\n【7】Additionally, the positron emission yield of 14.9% for ⁶⁴Cu is significantly lower than the yield 88.9% for ⁶⁸Ga. To achieve the same number of counts in the study, it would be necessary to image for approximately 5 times longer, assuming the same injected activity. However, when taking into account the longer physical half-life of ⁶⁴Cu (12.7 h) compared with ⁶⁸Ga (68 min), the difference in scan time 55-90 min after injection for the same injected dose is reduced to approximately 2 times longer. However, for practical reasons the scan time is not increased as this may lead to patient motion during imaging. In theory, the injected activity could be increased instead, but one hesitation to doing this may be the dosimetry of ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE as the radiation dose per injected activity for ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE is 20%-25% higher than or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>. The expected increase in image noise due to the lower positron yield of ⁶⁴Cu can be reduced by applying a smoother spatial filter compared with the filter used for ⁶⁸Ga. Nonetheless, using standard image acquisitions, the ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE produces diagnostic scans equivalent to the ²⁸Ga-labeled compounds.\n\n【8】One of the main advantages of using ⁶⁴Cu over ⁶⁸Ga is the longer half-life. This makes the distribution logistics easier and delivery times less critical. Furthermore, the longer half-life makes the ⁶⁴Cu less susceptible to delays in imaging after a patient has been injected compared with ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC.\n\n【9】### TABLE 1\n**Dosimetry for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE, ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC, ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE, and ¹⁸F-FDG**\n\n目录删除:<u>| Organ        | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(22)</u> | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC 删除11:<u>(48)</u> | ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(49)</u> | ¹⁸F-FDG 删除11:<u>(50)</u> |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Organ (mSv/MBq)** |                     |                   |                    |              |\n| **Kidneys**  | 9.2E-02             | 2.2E-01           | 1.4E-01            | 1.7E-02      |\n| **Liver**    | 4.5E-02             | 7.4E-02           | 1.6E-01            | 2.1E-02      |\n| **Spleen**   | 2.8E-01             | 2.4E-01           | 1.2E-01            | 1.1E-02      |</u>\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](3_0.png)</u>\n删除图片描述:<u>![](3_1.png)</u>\n\n【12】**ED = effective dose; IA = injected activity.**\n\n【13】### VI.

Impact of ⁶⁴Cu Versus ⁶⁸Ga\n\n【6】The range of the positron is one of several components that will affect the spatial resolution of PET images. The amount of image blurring due to the positron range depends on the energies of the positrons emitted from the particular isotope. Positron emitters such as ¹⁸F and ⁶⁴Cu emit positrons of relatively low-energy (250 and 278 keV, average energy, respectively) and the amount of resolution loss from the positron range is 0.2 mm in full width half maximum (FWHM) of 0.3 mm in full width tenth maximum (FWTM). For ⁶⁸Ga, the energy of the positrons is higher (836 keV, average energy), increasing the positron’s range for image resolution and will underestimate activity concentration and SUV, particularly for small lesions. It is difficult to generalize how much of the greater positron range of ⁶⁸Ga will affect quantification in small lesions compared with ⁶⁴Cu. The reason for this is the complex interplay of the components that contributes to the final image resolution (i.e., the intrinsic detector resolution, system diameter, image reconstruction algorithm, and spatial filtering). Under typical clinical imaging conditions, it is expected that there will be an additional 10%–20% underestimation in small lesions (≤10-15 mm diameter) when imaging with ⁶⁸Ga compared with ⁶⁴Cu.\n\n【7】Additionally, the positron emission yield of 14.9% for ⁶⁴Cu is significantly lower than the yield 88.9% for ⁶⁸Ga. To achieve the same number of counts in the study, it would be necessary to image for approximately 5 times longer, assuming the same injected activity. However, when taking into account the longer physical half-life of ⁶⁴Cu (12.7 h) compared with ⁶⁸Ga (68 min), the difference in scan time 55-90 min after injection for the same injected dose is reduced to approximately 2 times longer. However, for practical reasons the scan time is not increased as this may lead to patient motion during imaging. In theory, the injected activity could be increased instead, but one hesitation to doing this may be the dosimetry of ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE as the radiation dose per injected activity for ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE is 20%-25% higher than or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>. The expected increase in image noise due to the lower positron yield of ⁶⁴Cu can be reduced by applying a smoother spatial filter compared with the filter used for ⁶⁸Ga. Nonetheless, using standard image acquisitions, the ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE produces diagnostic scans equivalent to the ²⁸Ga-labeled compounds.\n\n【8】One of the main advantages of using ⁶⁴Cu over ⁶⁸Ga is the longer half-life. This makes the distribution logistics easier and delivery times less critical. Furthermore, the longer half-life makes the ⁶⁴Cu less susceptible to delays in imaging after a patient has been injected compared with ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC.\n\n【9】### TABLE 1\n**Dosimetry for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE, ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC, ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE, and ¹⁸F-FDG**\n\n目录删除:<u>| Organ        | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(22)</u> | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC 删除11:<u>(48)</u> | ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(49)</u> | ¹⁸F-FDG 删除11:<u>(50)</u> |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Organ (mSv/MBq)** |                     |                   |                    |              |\n| **Kidneys**  | 9.2E-02             | 2.2E-01           | 1.4E-01            | 1.7E-02      |\n| **Liver**    | 4.5E-02             | 7.4E-02           | 1.6E-01            | 2.1E-02      |\n| **Spleen**   | 2.8E-01             | 2.4E-01           | 1.2E-01            | 1.1E-02      |</u>\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](3_0.png)</u>\n删除图片描述:<u>![](3_1.png)</u>\n\n【12】**ED = effective dose; IA = injected activity.**\n\n【13】### VI.

Furthermore, the longer half-life makes the ⁶⁴Cu less susceptible to delays in imaging after a patient has been injected compared with ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE or ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC.\n\n【9】### TABLE 1\n**Dosimetry for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE, ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC, ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE, and ¹⁸F-FDG**\n\n目录删除:<u>| Organ        | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(22)</u> | ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATOC 删除11:<u>(48)</u> | ⁶⁴Cu-DOTATATE 删除11:<u>(49)</u> | ¹⁸F-FDG 删除11:<u>(50)</u> |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| **Organ (mSv/MBq)** |                     |                   |                    |              |\n| **Kidneys**  | 9.2E-02             | 2.2E-01           | 1.4E-01            | 1.7E-02      |\n| **Liver**    | 4.5E-02             | 7.4E-02           | 1.6E-01            | 2.1E-02      |\n| **Spleen**   | 2.8E-01             | 2.4E-01           | 1.2E-01            | 1.1E-02      |</u>\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](3_0.png)</u>\n删除图片描述:<u>![](3_1.png)</u>\n\n【12】**ED = effective dose; IA = injected activity.**\n\n【13】### VI.
