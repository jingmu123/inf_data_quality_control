Gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon in incidence, and has been rarely described in acute-appendicitis-related literature reviews. In this presented case, we have reported a rare case of appendiceal phlegmon, due to a diagnosis of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with uncommon symptoms.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 79-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with history of weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and mood changes for 2 months. Abdominopelvic computed tomography showed an abscess in right iliac muscle. After percutaneous drainage of the abscess and 6 weeks antibiotic therapy, an appendectomy was done for the patient. Histopathologic findings revealed the involvement of the appendiceal wall by adenocarcinoma, most probably with gastrointestinal origin. Gastric cancer was confirmed later by upper endoscopy and pathologic report.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Although the presence of tumor in appendectomy specimens is rare, and metastasis to appendix is even rarer, it should be considered as a cause of appendicitis, especially in elderly patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Gastric carcinoma is one of the most prevalent malignancies around the world \\[ 1 \\]. Gastric adenocarcinoma, with a prevalence of 85% among gastric cancers, is considered the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide \\[ 2 \\]. Most patients with gastric carcinoma are symptomatic, and are often diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease when they have metastatic lesions in other organs \\[ 3 \\]. Gastric cancer disseminates through straight development across the gastric wall to the perigastric organs (liver and pancreas) and lymphatics, and results in seeding of peritoneal regions \\[ 2 \\]. Liver, peritoneum, lung, and bone are the most frequent sites of gastric metastasis. The average survival after diagnosis in metastatic gastric carcinoma is 3 months, worse among individuals with metastasis to bone and liver (2 months) \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon in terms of incidence, and has been rarely described in acute-appendicitis-related literature reviews \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. In this presented case, we have reported a case of appendiceal phlegmon, due to the diagnosis of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma admitted with septic shock.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Patient information\n\n【13】A 79-year-old Persian male presented to the emergency department with history of weakness, anorexia, drowsiness, and mood changes for 2 months. He was a shopkeeper, and before the onset of symptoms, he regularly performed activities such as cycling and walking, but in the last 2 months he had lost his ability, with his symptoms having worsened in the last 2 weeks. There was no complaint of fever, nausea and vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. His past medical history included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, previous coronary artery bypass surgery, and an ischemic cerebral vascular accident episode 3 months prior to his admittance. He had no positive family history of diseases, including cancer, vascular, or heart problems.\n\n【14】### Clinical and laboratory findings\n\n【15】Physical examination showed a low-grade fever \\[temperature (T), 37.9 °C\\], hypotension \\[blood pressure (BP) 83/55 mmHg\\], pulse rate (PR) of 88 beats per minute, and respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute. There was no sign of tenderness, or rebound tenderness, on abdominal examination, and the only positive finding was a bilateral basal reduction of respiratory sounds on lung auscultation.\n\n【16】He was admitted to the emergency department with an impression of “sepsis,” based on a positive Quick Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score.\n\n【17】Initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis \\[white blood cell count (WBC), 14,700 with 80% neutrophils\\], normochromic normocytic anemia \\[hemoglobin (Hb), 11.9 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 86; mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), 30 pg\\], and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 103 mm/hour) and C-reactive protein (CRP <sup>+++ </sup> ) levels. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lung computed tomography revealed moderate bilateral pleural effusion and passive collapse consolidation of the lower lobes of basal segments. Thoracentesis demonstrated transudative effusion, and echocardiography showed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF-EF, 40%).\n\n【18】#### Treatment and management\n\n【19】There were no positive findings on abdominopelvic ultrasonography. Since the source of infection was not found, an abdominopelvic computed tomography examination was performed, which showed 35 × 52 mm abscess formation in the right iliac muscle and dilated appendix with peripheral inflammation (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【20】**Fig. 1**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Abdominopelvic CT scan of the patient. Yellow arrows demonstrate collection in the right iliac muscle adjacent to the appendix. **A** Axial view. **B** Coronal view\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】On the basis of these findings, percutaneous drainage was done under a guided ultrasound, and antibiotic therapy was continued. After these interventions, the patient’s hypotension and mood changes improved. Subsequent tests revealed improved leukocytosis (WBC, 5100 cell/microliter) and anemia (Hb, 12.5 gr/dL); however, the ESR level was still high (87 mm/hour). Due to the iliac abscess and changes in the appendix location, the patient underwent antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks, with suspected appendiceal phlegmon and subsequently, an interval appendectomy was performed after 6 weeks. The pathology report showed involvement of the appendiceal wall by tumoral glands (adenocarcinoma), most probably of gastrointestinal origin. Consequently, a colonoscopy was performed to determine the origin of the tumor, and there were no positive pathological findings except a few polyps in the transverse colon. Eventually, the patient underwent upper endoscopy, which revealed an infiltrative and circumferential tumoral stenosis in the body of the stomach. The pathology report showed severe dysplastic gastric mucosa, with an ulcerative feature compatible with gastric well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2 ). Due to distant metastasis, the patient was referred to the oncology ward with diagnosis of stage IV gastric cancer and underwent chemotherapy. According to age, physical conditions, and clinical judgment of the oncologist, the oral chemotherapy drug capecitabine was started for the patient.\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Histopathology findings reveal infiltration of some atypical epithelial cells, with pleomorphic and hyperchromic nuclei, within the muscularis propria layer, which are arranged as glandular structures\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】There is limited evidence in studies describing the presence of appendiceal metastasis as the first manifestation of primary cancer. Araujo _et al_ . study showed that incidental appendiceal tumor followed by appendectomy occurs in only 0.9% of patients and metastasis to the appendix is very rare and the most origin sites are lungs, stomach and colon \\[ 9 \\]. Yoon _et al_ . found that appendiceal metastasis is usually associated with an extensive stage of disease, in which the average survival rate was 22.6 months. The combination of the female sex, simultaneous diagnosis of appendiceal metastasis with the primary tumor, and initiation of chemotherapy ensured a longer survival \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【31】Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies around the world and the patients are already in the advanced stages of such incurable disease \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. The average prognosis in metastatic gastric carcinoma is 3 months, which is worse among individuals with metastasis to bone and liver (2 months) \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【32】Although gastric cancer metastasis to the appendix is uncommon, it can remain asymptomatic and be diagnosed accidentally \\[ 8 \\]. However, in the most documented cases, due to adherence of metastatic cancer cells to the serosa and infiltration of all the appendix layers, lumen obstruction can develop, leading to inflammation, appendicitis symptoms, and perforation \\[ 7 \\]. The mechanism of metastasis remains unknown, but it has been considered that the appendix is infiltrated by peritoneal seeding, or even indicates a single peritoneal mass \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【33】Gastric adenocarcinoma is radioresistant neoplasm, and for sufficient control of the primary tumor, doses of external beam irradiation are required, specifically which overpass adjacent organs’ resistance, for example, bowel mucosa. Therefore, pain relief is the prominent role of radiation therapy in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma. Among patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, 30–50% respond relatively well to a combination of cytotoxic agents. Regardless of the response rates, complete remission is rare, partial responses are temporary, and the general effect of combination therapy on survival is low \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【34】Thirteen to twenty percent of acute appendicitis cases lead to perforation, with higher rates occurring in men and elderly adults \\[ 11 \\]. In imaging studies, appendicitis may present with a localized perforation (an inflammatory lesion frequently referred to as a “phlegmon”) or, infrequently, a free perforation. The management of perforated appendicitis is determined by the patient’s situation (stable versus unstable), the type of perforation, and whether an abscess or phlegmon is present in imaging studies \\[ 12 \\]. Stable patients with extensive (> 3 cm) abscesses must first be managed with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage \\[ 13 \\]. Urgent surgery in patients presenting with symptoms over a long period, and phlegmon or abscess development, has been shown to lead to increased morbidity due to firm adhesion and inflammation. Conservative management of the initial admission enables a decrease in regional inflammation, and interval appendectomy can be performed at a lower risk \\[ 14 \\]. Following favorable conservative management of perforated appendicitis, all patients should undergo follow-up in 6–8 weeks, to carry out interval appendectomy to rule out an appendiceal tumor. The appendiceal tumor is much more prevalent in the interval appendectomy specimens (10–29%), compared with conventional appendectomy specimens (0.9–1.4%), particularly in patients over 40 years old \\[ 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】We have reported a rare case of appendiceal metastasis, with phlegmon, as the first presentation of gastric adenocarcinoma. Although appendicitis caused by metastasis to the appendix is unusual in clinical practice, it should be considered, especially in older patients.\n\n【37】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【38】All patient’s data are available in the hospital’s data archive system and, if needed, can be made available through the corresponding author of the article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

A case series and review found that the mortality rate of invasive bronchial aspergillosis is high, at about 40%, and 23.7% of invasive bronchial aspergillosis patients require mechanical ventilator management. There are few reports of life-saving cases with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as rescue therapy in invasive pulmonary _Aspergillus_ and invasive bronchial aspergillosis. Here, we report a case of invasive bronchial aspergillosis and invasive pulmonary _Aspergillus_ that was successfully treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and combined systemic and intratracheal instillation of liposomal amphotericin B.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 61-year-old Japanese man with invasive tracheobronchial-pulmonary aspergillosis while receiving chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. Bronchoscopy revealed trachea covered with pseudomembranous necrotizing tissue, the culture revealed _Aspergillus fumigatus_ , and the histological findings of pseudomembranous revealed fungal hyphae. The patient required venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of respiratory failure for atelectasis and obstructive pneumoniae. While continuing systemic administration of liposomal amphotericin B, intratracheal instillation liposomal amphotericin B was performed by bronchoscopy three times a week. Although the respiratory conditions improved and the patient was discontinued on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, he ultimately died of recurrence of malignant lymphoma.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Intratracheal instillation of liposomal amphotericin B is safe, and liposomal amphotericin B instillation allowed a targeted high local drug concentration, which led to improvement in the invasive bronchial aspergillosis. In addition, since the patient was supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we were able to perform safe bronchoscopic debridement of airway lesions and intratracheal instillation of liposomal amphotericin B.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Invasive pulmonary _Aspergillus_ (IPA) is a life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised hosts \\[ 1 \\]. Invasive bronchial aspergillosis (ITBA) is rare, accounting for 7% of IPA cases \\[ 2 \\]. ITBA is an unusual form of IPA; in most cases, it is likely to be associated with IPA infiltration into the central airways \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. In a case series and review, the mortality rate of ITBA is found to be high at about 40%, and 23.7% of ITBA patients require mechanical ventilator management \\[ 5 \\]. However, to our knowledge, there are few reports of life-saving cases with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) as rescue therapy in IPA and ITBA.\n\n【10】As per the proposal of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines in 2016 for _Aspergillus_ infections, treatment with a mold-active triazole or intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) and bronchoscopic debridement of airway lesions in selected cases is recommended for ITBA, and especially for lung transplant recipients, adjunctive inhaled amphotericin (AmB) in the setting of ITBA is recommended \\[ 1 \\], but as far as we have been able to determine, there were been no report of intratracheal instillation of L-AmB for ITBA.\n\n【11】Here, we report a case of ITBA and IPA that was successfully treated with VV-ECMO, and combined systemic and intratracheal instillation of L-AmB.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 61-year-old Japanese man who had no significant medical, family, or psycho–social history was admitted with a 2-week history of fever, whole-body lymph node swelling, and abdominal swelling caused by hepatosplenomegaly. He was diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), by histopathological analysis of the lymph nodes. On admission, his laboratory data showed pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Table 1 ). Bone marrow aspiration revealed proliferating hemophagocytosis and lymphocytes, and we diagnosed the patient with lymphoma associated with hemophagocytic lymphoma (LAHS). The day after he was admitted to our hospital, he was treated with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (EPOCH) chemotherapy. He responded to the chemotherapy; on day 9 after admission, DIC, hyperbilirubinemia, AKI, and hepatosplenomegaly improved. However, the period of bone marrow suppression from day 9 to day 19, lasted for 11 days, and he developed febrile neutropenia (FN). From day 9 after admission, he was treated for FN with meropenem 6 g/day and micafungin 100 mg/day, and was administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). His blood cultures were negative. On day 10, computed tomography of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse infiltration shadow of the lungs, and due to progressive respiratory failure, he required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (Fig. 1 ). However, on day 15, type 2 respiratory failure progressed. The findings from a blood gas test were as follows; pH 7.18, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 77.6 mmHg, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 72.3 mmHg, \\\\({\\\\text{HCO}}\\_{3}^{ - }\\\\) 26.8 mmol/L, and PaO <sub>2 </sub> to FiO <sub>2 </sub> (P/F) ratio 110. He underwent tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopic findings revealed a widespread pseudomembranous necrotizing tissue formation covering the trachea and the bronchi, and numerous filamentous fungal hyphae infiltration were revealed in the pathologic examination (Fig. 2 a–c). In addition, the β- d \\-glucan level was significantly increased to 1160 pg/mL, and the _Aspergillus_ galactomannan antigen level \\[on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA)\\] was > 5.0. _Aspergillus fumigatus_ was isolated from a pseudomembrane culture. We started L-AmB at 3 mg/kg/day. After intubation, he developed AKI with worsening of his general condition; therefore, we started continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We performed daily bronchoscopy for pseudomembrane and necrotic tissue removal to release atelectasis. However, he was placed under deep sedation and fully controlled ventilation, and type 2 respiratory failure was worsened for atelectasis and obstructive pneumoniae. The findings from a blood gas test were as follows; pH 7.141, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 67.9 mmHg, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 67.9 mmHg, \\\\({\\\\text{HCO}}\\_{3}^{ - }\\\\) 22.9 mmol/L, (FiO <sub>2 </sub> 0.8, PEEP 15 mmHg), and P/F ratio, 86. The patient showed severe hypoxemia (P/F = 86) under PEEP 15 mmHg, and severe respiratory acidosis with a Murray score of 4, so we initiated VV-ECMO as a reversible condition. Since severe respiratory failure occurred due to _Aspergillus_ pseudomembrane that fills the tracheobronchial airway, systemic administration of only L-AmB was thought to be inadequate. After VV-ECMO, we continued to perform bronchoscopy three times a week for pseudomembrane removal and intratracheal instillation of aerosolized L-AmB. With the informed consent of his family, off-label use of L-AmB was administered via intratracheal instillation as a life saver. The L-AmB dose was referenced as an AmB attachment; 1 vial (50 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water and 0.2–4 mL (1–20 mg) of the vial was added to it and further diluted (0.1–2 mg/mL of amphotericin B) in about 10 mL of distilled water. The L-AmB instillation allowed targeted high local drug concentration, which led to an improvement. In addition, we increased the systemic dose of the L-AmB to 6 mg/kg/day (the dose was increased to twice the normal dosage). Ten days after initiating VV-ECMO, a bleeding event from the gastric vestibular area was reported; however, VV-ECMO was successfully weaned after 14 days, with the improvement of lung function. Bronchoscopy revealed disappeared pseudomembrane necrotizing tissue (Fig. 2 d). However, although ITBA improved, the patient developed an impairment of consciousness caused by central nervous system involvement of the lymphoma, at the same time, splenomegaly and enlarged inguinal lymph nodes were revealed again, soluble IL2 receptor was elevated (8527 U/mL), and uncontrollable metabolic acidosis had developed by lymphoma; the patient developed recurrent lymphoma and he died 50 days after admission.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Laboratory data on admission**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Chest computed tomography showed infiltration and bronchial thickening of right upper lobe\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse wide raised pseudomembrane necrotizing tissue at right upper lobe ( **a** ). Pseudomembrane obstruction from the trachea to the left main bronchus resulted in atelectasis ( **b** ). Pathological finding of pseudomembrane showed numerous filamentous fungal hyphae (Grocott–Gomori’s methenamine silver stain, ×100) ( **c** ). After systemic and intratracheal instillation of liposomal amphotericin B, pseudomembrane necrotizing tissue disappeared ( **d** )\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Krenke et al. reported that ITBA in severely immunocompromised hosts with hematologic malignancies is characterized by a pseudomembranous overlying of the mucosal surface that is extensively involved in the lower airways. On the other hand, ITBA in those who have undergone a heart or lung transplant, is characterized by ulcerative types or plaque-like lesions in the bronchial walls \\[ 2 \\]. In this case, the pseudomembrane necrotizing tissue caused severe respiratory distress that required ECMO support. Mario et al. reported that the overall in-hospital mortality rate of ITBA was 39.1%, with neutropenia \\[odds ratio (OR) 20.47; _p_ < 0.001) and acute respiratory distress at presentation (OR 9.54; _p_ \\= 0.002) being independent prognostic factors, indicating that the prognosis of ITBA in severely immunocompromised hosts with hematologic malignancies is worse than that of ITBA with other diseases \\[ 5 \\]. In this case, severe neutropenia lasted for more than a week during bone marrow suppression following chemotherapy due to LAHS, and the patient had acute respiratory distress, and presented two poor prognostic factors. The IDSA guidelines recommend ITBA treatment with a mold-active triazole or intravenous L-AmB and bronchoscopic debridement of airway lesions in selected cases \\[ 1 \\]. In this case, removal of atelectasis and obstructive pneumonia caused by pseudomembranes was considered necessary. However, bronchoscopic debridement of the the pseudomembrane may not be practicable due to high risk of hypoxia and progressive respiratory acidosis in cases of severe respiratory failure, even under mechanical ventilator control. Since the patient had severe respiratory failure, we started VV-ECMO management as rescue therapy, and then bronchoscopy could be performed safely and we were able to release atelectasis due to the pseudomembrane.\n\n【26】There is usually a delay in culture and pathology reports, and there is often a delay in fungal identification because some tests for species identification cross-react with other fungi. Also, in the present case, it took several days from the progression of type 2 respiratory failure to the diagnosis of fungal infection. Thair et al. reported that the cell-free DNA, which is collected for plasma next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing at the time of initial blood culture, identified a broad range of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic pathogens, which can provide valuable information to help clinicians better target antimicrobial therapy for septic patients \\[ 6 \\]. It is hoped that NGS will become more accessible in clinical practice.\n\n【27】VV-ECMO is an effective treatment to support patients with severe respiratory failure who are unresponsive to conventional therapies \\[ 7 \\]. _Aspergillus_ spp. are identified more frequently (approximately 7%) in ECMO patients compared with patients without ECMO who are critically ill \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. However, to our knowledge, there is only one a single report of life-saving cases with VV-ECMO as rescue therapy in IPA \\[ 10 \\], and there are no reports of cases with ECMO support in ITBA. In patients receiving VV-ECMO, drug pharmacokinetics may be significantly altered. Yanjun et al. reported a twofold increase in the standard total daily dose of both drugs to overcome low serum concentrations thought to be secondary to drug loss from ECMO circuit sequestration \\[ 11 \\]. We upped the amount of L-AmB to 6 mg/kg/day, while the patient was treated with VV-ECMO and CRRT.\n\n【28】L-AmB is a unique lipid formulation of AmB. AmB binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, which leads to the formation of pores, ion leakage, and ultimately fungal cell death \\[ 12 \\]. L-AmB is currently the most common type of AmB in distribution because intravenous AmB (Fungizone) is often complicated by nephrotoxicity \\[ 13 \\]. The efficacy and safety of intratracheal inhaled L-AmB or AmB lipid complex for prophylaxis IPA have also been reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients and in solid organ transplantation recipients \\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 \\], and efficacy and safety of intratracheal instillation of L-AmB was reported in treatment of endobronchial mucormycosis \\[ 18 \\]. In addition, inhaling L-AmB for _Aspergillus_ infection does not cause changes in the lipid content of the pulmonary surfactant \\[ 19 \\]. Although only AmB has been approved for intratracheal inhalation and instillation, L-AmB is not indicated. This study was done in accordance with the institutional guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, which were ethically reviewed and approved by our hospital; informed consent was also obtained. This is the first report of an intratracheal instillation of L-AmB for ITBA. In this case, intratracheal instillation of aerosolized L-AmB by bronchoscopy was effective and safe for severe ITBA. At a time when AmB is not widely distributed, L-AmB is becoming more mainstream; therefore, intratracheal inhalation and instillation of LAmB will be even more necessary in the future to treat severe ITBA.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【30】In this case, we successfully treated severe respiratory failure associated with ITBA with timely implementation of systemic and intratracheal instillation of aerosolized L-AmB and maximal supportive care, including VV-ECMO. The L-AmB instillation allowed a targeted high local drug concentration, which led to an improvement. Because an intratracheal instillation of L-AmB is safe and effective, it could be a treatment option for ITBA. In addition, since the patient was supported with VV-ECMO, we were able to safely perform bronchoscopic debridement of airway lesions and intratracheal instillation of L-AmB.\n\n【31】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【33】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【34】IPA:\n\n【35】Invasive pulmonary _Aspergillus_\n\n【36】ITBA:\n\n【37】Invasive bronchial aspergillosis\n\n【38】VV-ECMO:\n\n【39】Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n\n【40】IDSA:\n\n【41】Infectious Disease Society of America\n\n【42】L-AmB:\n\n【43】Liposomal amphotericin B\n\n【44】PTCL-NOS:\n\n【45】Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified\n\n【46】AKI:\n\n【47】Acute kidney injury\n\n【48】DIC:\n\n【49】Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n【50】FN:\n\n【51】Febrile neutropenia\n\n【52】LAHS:\n\n【53】Lymphoma associated with hemophagocytic lymphoma\n\n【54】P/F:\n\n【55】PaO <sub>2 </sub> to FiO <sub>2</sub>\n\n【56】CRRT:\n\n【57】Continuous renal replacement therapy\n\n【58】NGS:\n\n【59】Next-generation sequencing", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Nonetheless, _Francisella tularensis_ , the causative agent of tularemia, can infect numerous animal species and should, therefore, not be neglected as a dangerous pathogen. Tularemia can lead to massively swollen lymph nodes and might even be fatal without antibiotic treatment. To our knowledge, the case described here is the first report of the disease caused by a squirrel bite in Germany.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 59-year-old German woman with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and cutaneous lupus erythematosus presented at the emergency room at St. Katharinen Hospital with ongoing symptoms and a swollen right elbow persisting despite antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime for 7 days after she had been bitten (right hand) by a wild squirrel (Eurasian red squirrel). After another 7 days of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the suspected diagnosis of tularemia on day 14. After starting the recommended antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin, the patient recovered rapidly.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This is the first report of a case of tularemia caused by a squirrel bite in Germany. A naturally infected squirrel has recently been reported in Switzerland for the first time. The number of human cases of tularemia has been increasing over the last years and, therefore, tularemia should be taken into consideration as a diagnosis, especially in a patient bitten by an animal who also presents with headache, increasing pain, lymphadenitis, and fever, as well as impaired wound healing. The pathogen can easily be identified by a specific real-time PCR assay of wound swabs and/or by antibody detection, for example by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), if the incident dates back longer than 2 weeks.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Here, we present the case of a 59-year-old German woman who was admitted to our hospital after a squirrel bite with an ulcerative lesion at digit IV of the right hand and a lymphadenitis at the right elbow combined with persistent fever, myalgia, and headache. The diagnosis of tularemia was based on the results of a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that showed positivity for _Francisella tularensis_ , and on culture of the material on agar plates showing growth typical of _Francisella_ .\n\n【10】Tularemia, also called “rabbit fever,” is a rare, but potentially severe zoonosis caused by _F. tularensis_ . The disease has been described in more than 250 animal species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, all of which potentially transmit the bacterium to humans. Transmission of _F. tularensis_ to humans may also occur through mosquito or tick bites and through the consumption of contaminated water or food \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Human-to-human transmission has not yet been reported \\[ 6 \\]. Four _F. tularensis_ subspecies ( _tularensis_ , _holarctica_ , _mediasiatica_ and _novicida_ ) care known to cause tularemia, but only two, _F. tularensis_ ssp. _tularensis_ and _F. tularensis_ ssp. _holarctica_ ( _Fth_ ), are of clinical relevance. To our knowledge, however, the only _F. tularensis_ subspecies identified in Germany so far is _Fth_ \\[ 7 \\] _._ In endemic regions, especially, hunters and forest workers are at an increased risk for tularemia. Because of the low prevalence of the disease in Germany \\[ 8 \\], physicians might be unaware or underestimate the disease, which leads to delayed adequate diagnoses and specific treatment \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【11】Only rarely can the sources of human infections be verified. For example, during a recent outbreak that was linked to freshly pressed grape must, a wood mouse was identified as a potential source of contamination \\[ 9 , 11 , 13 \\]. To our knowledge, the case described here is the first report in Germany of a human infection caused by a squirrel bite occurring, although a naturally infected squirrel has also been reported from Switzerland recently \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 59-year-old German woman with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and cutaneous lupus erythematosus presented at the hospital´s emergency room 7 days after having been bitten by a wild Eurasian red squirrel ( _Sciurus vulgaris_ ).\n\n【14】The patient reported having noticed a squirrel lying motionless on the ground when she took a walk. As soon as she tried to examine the animal, it started biting her, biting digit IV of the right hand and digit II of the left hand. After the wounds had been cleaned and dressed, she was started the same day on antibiotic therapy consisting of cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice a day. Tetanus vaccination status was also checked. On day 6 after the bite, the patient presented at the hospital’s emergency room showing the following symptoms: general malaise, aching head and body, fever, chill, and a swollen right elbow. She did not report having suffered from nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise.\n\n【15】The clinical examination showed a minor bite on digit IV of the right hand, located near the middle phalanx, slightly reddened, yet without clear inflammatory signs. There was no pain to pressure, no movement restriction, nor any sensory deficit. There were also visible signs of lymphadenitis at the ulnar side of the right elbow. The peripheral sensitivity as well as movement skills and blood flow were intact. At the index finger of the left hand, another minor bite without any local or proximal signs of inflammation was recorded. The physical examination did not reveal anything unusual. The vital parameters were stable, with the exception of a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were found.\n\n【16】Laboratory tests showed an increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 28.6 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), but no leukocytosis. The test for procalcitonin (indicating bacterial inflammation) was negative. Sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative in standard laboratory tests. X-rays of the thorax and of digit IV of the right hand and a native computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not show any pathological outcomes. Real-time PCR assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. Starting on day 7, the medical treatment also comprised combination therapy with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) 3 times a day. However, the patient’s condition did not improve and fever rose up to 39.2 °C and persisted until day 12. Blood culture remained negative, even at 14 days after inoculation. CRP increased up to 185 mg/L on day 12. As a consequence, treatment was intensified by commencing combination antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Followin initiation of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L (day 14) and there was a mild persisting leukocytosis (12.14 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> ).\n\n【17】In parallel, the wound on the patient’s right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion showing swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation (Fig. 1 ). The lymphadenitis of the right elbow persisted. It was at this stage that tularemia was suspected as a possible diagnosis for the first time. Following a phone call with the reference laboratory for human tularemia at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) on day 14, the decision was made to send a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient’s right hand (A-1825/1) to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for microbiological examination. In addition, a serum sample (A-1825/2) was taken for antibody detection (day 14). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of _F. tularensis_ Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were borderline.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Picture of the right hand of the patient at day 14 after the squirrel bite on the digit IV. After presentation of the ulcerous lesion and the local lymphadenitis of the right elbow in combination with the non-effective antibiotic treatment using three different antibiotics over 2 weeks, the suspicion of an ulcero-glandular tularemia was expressed\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】To isolate living bacteria and extract DNA, the wound swab was suspended in 900 µL double-distilled water, and a 450-µL of the suspension was centrifuged. The resulting pellet was used for genomic desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A real-time PCR based on _F. tularensis_ \\-specific primers (for genes _fopA_ and _tul4_ ) confirmed the presence of _F. tularensis_ DNA in the wound swab sample. Subspecies _F_ th was identified by block PCR targeting the region of difference 1 (RD1) according to protocols described by Broekhuijsen _et al._ \\[ 15 \\]. For culture, 50 µL of the swab suspension was inoculated in 10 mL medium T \\[ 16 \\] and streaked onto MTKH \\[ 17 \\], as well as onto chocolate agar plates and Neisseria selective medium plus (both Oxoid Germany GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The liquid medium and the agar plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO <sub>2 </sub> . Bacterial growth typical for _F. tularensis_ could be observed on MTKH on day 3 of culture and on the chocolate and Neisseria agar plates on day 4. The patient’s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for _F. tularensis_ .\n\n【23】Minimal inhibitory concentration testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/ ) guidelines for _F. tularensis_ demonstrated an _in vitro_ sensitivity to all antibiotics recommended for treatment of tularemia (for example, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, levofloxacin) \\[ 6 , 18 \\]. The patient’s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate (resistance against ampicillin/sulbactam, and cefuroxime, piperacillin/tazobactam are ineffective in the treatment for tularemia). In a sequencing study (MiSeq sequencer \\[Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA\\], see \\[ 13 \\] for details) and the phylogenetic analysis (Geneious prime \\[Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand\\], Mauve alignment, followed by neighbor-joining clustering, see \\[ 19 \\] for details), the DNA from _Fth_ strain A-1825/1, isolated from the patient’s wound swab, was shown to belong to biovar I, clade B.6 and subclade B.49 (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Phylogenetic relationship of _Francisella tularensis_ ssp. _holarctica_ ( _Fth_ ) in a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient’s right hand (A-1825/1) (red, in bold) to _F_ th isolates from North Rhine-Westphalia (NW), Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), and Hesse (He).

For the clustering, the neighbor-joining bootstrap method was used, with _F. tularensis_ ssp. _holarctica_ ( _F_ th) strain OSU18 as an outgroup\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】When the reference laboratory for human tularemia underpinned the suspected diagnosis on day 14, the treatment was immediately adjusted, and 500 mg of ciprofloxacin was administered twice a day for 14 days. Under the adjusted treatment, the patient recovered immediately (the CRP dropped to 15 mg/L) and she could be discharged fever-free with a negligible headache on day 17.\n\n【29】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【30】We report here the case of an ulcero-glandular tularemia after a squirrel bite _._ Healthcare staff treat persons with animal bites, mainly by dogs, cats, and snakes \\[ 20 \\], on a daily basis. In such cases, the risk of a systemic infection depends on a number of different parameters, such as the type of injury, the animal involved, and the patient’s own immune defense. The treatment should include immediate irrigation and debridement of the wound, a prophylaxis against tetanus, and possibly against rabies, and an antibiotic treatment (depending on the risk for a systemic infection) \\[ 21 \\]. Although the risk of being bitten and/or infected by a wild Eurasian red squirrel ( _Sciurus vulgaris_ ) is low \\[ 22 \\], Europe has seen an increase in the number of tularemia cases in both humans and animals during the past decades \\[ 2 , 7 , 8 \\]. While only one report of a natural infection with _Fth_ in a wild Eurasian red squirrel, in Switzerland, has been published \\[ 14 \\], it is known that squirrels, although being herbivores, may be a reservoir of _F. tularensis_ , as are many other rodents. The human case of tularemia reported here from Germany also confirms the possibility of a European squirrel infected by _Fth_ . After contact with squirrels, tularemia should, therefore, be considered as a differential diagnosis to prevent a delay of specific treatment \\[ 9 , 10 , 13 \\].\n\n【31】Studies on _Francisella_ isolates from humans and wild animals in Germany have revealed an unexpected genetic diversity of _F_ th \\[ 19 , 23 , 24 , 25 \\] that is not only of academic interest: the phylogenetic analysis showed that _Fth_ isolates of biovar I are erythromycin-susceptible and mainly occur in western Europe, whereas isolates of biovar II are erythromycin-resistant and mainly occur in northern and eastern Europe. A similar north-west divide has been observed in Germany \\[ 7 , 19 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 \\]. The phylogenetic analysis of the draft genome sequence of strain A-1825 reported here, isolated from the patient in the Rhein-Erft region (Rhein-Erft-Kreis) in North Rhine-Westphalia, revealed that it belongs to erythromycin-sensitive biovar I (major clade B.6), subclade B.49 (Fig. 2 ). As mentioned, this is not surprising as _F_ th isolates of biovar I appear more often in the south-west of Germany. The same applies to B.6 strains being more often detected in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, near the Rhein-Erft region \\[ 7 , 19 , 28 \\].\n\n【32】The clinical manifestation of tularemia depends on the portal of entry of the bacteria into the organism. Consequently, the disease is defined by the following different forms: ulcero-glandular or glandular, oropharyngeal, ocular-glandular, and respiratory \\[ 1 , 3 , 6 \\]. The ulcero-glandular form of tularemia mostly occurs after direct skin contact with an infected animal or by percutaneous penetration of the pathogen after a bite by a wild or domestic animal (cats, dogs) or by a tick \\[ 2 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 \\]. The following primary clinical symptoms may occur 1–14 days (mainly 3–5 days) after penetration of the pathogen: fever, malaise, headache, melalgia, and swollen lymph nodes \\[ 6 , 8 , 18 \\]). Subsequently, an ulcerous lesion at the portal of entry and swollen lymph nodes may appear. The ocular-glandular form can be caused by eye contact with contaminated materials and may result in a conjunctivitis. The oropharyngeal form is characterized by a mostly unilateral cervical lymph node swelling, stomatitis, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis after ingestion of contaminated food or water. The respiratory form of tularemia after inhalation of the pathogen may cause cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and pneumonia \\[ 6 \\]. For diagnosis, serological methods, antigen detection, or molecular methods are used \\[ 38 \\]. Specific real-time PCR assays and bacterial growth on suitable agar plates (for example, chocolate, Neisseria selective medium plus) allow the pathogen to be identified in clinical material, such as wound swabs or blood cultures \\[ 38 \\]. If an isolate is available, mass-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometry can be used for identification of _F. tularensis_ . Whole-genome sequencing and PCR targeting the RD1 for subspecies differentiation \\[ 15 \\] are methods which enable further characterization of the pathogen \\[ 3 \\]. Serological methods, for example ELISA or western blot, can be used for antibody detection against the lipopolysaccharide of _F. tularensis_ to confirm tularemia retrospectively, but only if the incident occurred more than 2–3 weeks prior to the tests or assays.\n\n【33】The clinical presentation of this case in combination with the ineffective antibiotic treatment, namely, three different antibiotics in 2 weeks, underpinned the suspected diagnosis of an ulcero-glandular form of tularemia proposed by clinicians and specialists from the reference laboratory. After the appropriate antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin, the patient recovered immediately and could be discharged from hospital on day 3 after treatment adaptation (aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol) \\[ 37 \\].\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Furthermore, anti-insulin immunoglobulin G antibodies are occasionally detected in patients with diabetes. Hence, we report a case in which switching to liraglutide therapy ameliorated both the symptoms of insulin allergy with hypereosinophilia and the characteristics of insulin antibodies in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 70-year-old Japanese man with type 2 diabetes who developed insulin allergy with hypereosinophilia. Anti-insulin antibodies, high glycated hemoglobin levels (approximately 12 %), and high serum insulin levels were detected. Because a change in his insulin treatment was inefficient, treatment with liraglutide to protect residual insulin secretion was started, resulting in improvements in his insulin allergy, serum glycated hemoglobin, insulin, and eosinophil levels. Scatchard plots revealed decreased binding capacity and increased affinity constant for high affinity sites of anti-insulin antibodies.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Liraglutide might be useful for treating insulin allergy and anti-insulin antibodies in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Insulin allergy is an important adverse effect of insulin treatment in patients with diabetes. Ghazavi and Johnston recently reported that the prevalence of allergic reactions to insulin products is approximately 2 % at present \\[ 1 \\]. Although the frequency of insulin allergy is low, the symptoms vary, ranging from local injection site reactions to complete anaphylactic reactions \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Given that anaphylactic reactions are occasionally life-threatening, clinicians must act quickly and appropriately when allergy is suspected.\n\n【10】Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs have recently been introduced worldwide as a therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide is one such analog that improves blood glucose control by directly affecting both insulin and glucagon secretion in the pancreas \\[ 4 \\]. However, there are only a few reports of liraglutide being used for the treatment of insulin allergy, and its effectiveness remains to be completely elucidated in this context \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Furthermore, anti-insulin immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies \\[ 5 , 7 , 8 \\] and anti-insulin receptor antibodies \\[ 5 , 9 \\] are occasionally detected in patients with diabetes who have brittle glycemic control or severe insulin resistance. The effectiveness of liraglutide remains unclear in these cases.\n\n【11】We report a case in which switching to liraglutide therapy ameliorated both the symptoms of insulin allergy with hypereosinophilia and the characteristics of insulin antibodies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### History leading to admission\n\n【14】Our patient is a 70-year-old Japanese man with diabetes. He was admitted to our hospital 4.5 years ago for further investigation and treatment of recent-onset insulin allergy. He had a 30-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and an approximately 6-year history of insulin injection administration, with an average glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.0 %. He reported a past history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting at 68 years. During that surgery, intravenous protamine sulfate was administrated, which induced anaphylaxis.\n\n【15】At that time, 4.5 years prior to the current presentation, he was receiving 100 mg/day aspirin, 100 mg/day clopidogrel, 100 mg/day imidapril, 20 mg/day isosorbide mononitrate, 5 mg/day nicorandil, and 10 mg/day pravastatin, and these had been stable for more than 3 years. In addition, he was being treated with 20 U/day insulin lispro and 8 U/day insulin glargine, which had also been unchanged for approximately 3 years. Finally, he had been receiving 0.9 mg/day voglibose to supplement his insulin therapy for approximately 5 years.\n\n【16】Approximately 5 months before his current presentation, he reported that he had started to develop wheals with redness and itching at the injection site, which occurred immediately after injecting insulin. Of note, these symptoms only occurred following the use of insulin lispro and not after insulin glargine. Over the subsequent months, part of the surface of the wheals had hardened and further investigation was performed. Two months before his current admission, blood samples were taken that revealed high serum levels of human insulin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE; 4.21 U/mL; normal range <0.35 U/mL), hypereosinophilia (total white blood cell count, 6000/μL; total eosinophil granulocyte count, 780; percentage, 13 %), and a high level of total IgE (403 IU/mL; normal range <173 IU/mL). A pathology sample was taken 2 months before his admission, which revealed eosinophilic infiltration in the hardened part of the injection site (Fig. 1 ). Therefore, just before admission, he was diagnosed with insulin allergy and was switched from insulin lispro plus glargine to insulin aspart plus glargine.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Pathological findings of insulin injection site.

On admission, his physical examination was largely unremarkable (height, 157.1 cm; body weight, 53.0 kg; body mass index, 21.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; body temperature, 36.5 °C; blood pressure, 104/62 mmHg; and pulse, 75 beats/minute, regular), although there was induration with slight redness of his abdomen. His laboratory data at that time are shown in Table 1 . Of note, his fasting plasma glucose level was 346 mg/dL, and his HbA1c level was 12.3 %. In addition, we detected high serum insulin, anti-insulin IgG antibody, and anti-insulin receptor antibody levels. Although there were no further symptoms of local allergy (wheals, redness, and itching) after injecting with insulin aspart, his postprandial hyperglycemia continued at approximately 350 mg/dL. Therefore, he was switched to insulin glulisine (24 U/day) plus glargine (22 U/day) after admission. On day 17 of admission, his 24-hour blood glucose profile was 88, 241, 241, 295, 297, and 292 mg/dL at 7:30 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 8:00 p.m., respectively, with an energy intake of 1600 kcal. On days 18 and 19, his urinary excretion of C-peptide was 42.8 to 51.5 μg/day (normal range 40 to 100 μg/day). On day 19, a glucagon stimulation test was performed, and his serum C-peptide response ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 ng/mL (Table 2 ). On day 22, although his high glucose levels persisted, he was discharged because we had confirmed his ability to secrete insulin. Although his hypereosinophilia was not resolved before his discharge, he had no further allergic symptoms (wheals, redness, and itchiness) at the injection site for glulisine, and the area of induration had almost disappeared.\n\n【23】**Table 1 Laboratory data on admission**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】**Table 2 An evaluation of the patient’s insulin secretion ability**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】### Progress since discharge and the introduction of liraglutide\n\n【28】Figure 2 summarizes his clinical course before and after the introduction of liraglutide. After discharge, although glulisine and glargine were continued, his glycemic control worsened, with fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia levels of approximately 200 and 300 mg/dL, respectively, and high serum insulin levels persisted (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, 2 months after his admission, we added 0.3 mg liraglutide, discontinued the insulin glulisine, and added 2 mg/day glimepiride and 500 mg/day metformin to decrease his total insulin requirements. However, he also started to develop intermittent induration at the site of insulin glargine injection, and although there was no evidence of wheals or redness, his hypereosinophilia persisted. Based on these findings, we reduced the dose of glargine (32→22→26→10 U/day) and increased the dose of liraglutide (0.3→0.6→0.9 mg/day; Fig. 2 ). This was followed by improvements in his HbA1c, serum insulin, and eosinophil levels; therefore, we decided to completely discontinue the insulin glargine after 3 months of the liraglutide treatment. On his new regimen of 0.9 mg/day liraglutide in combination with oral antidiabetic agents, his HbA1c level was maintained at approximately 7.0 %. The induration had almost completely disappeared 1 month after the insulin injections were discontinued. In addition, his body weight decreased by 1.7 kg after 2 months of liraglutide treatment. Table 3 indicates his diabetes-related medical history.\n\n【29】**Fig. 2**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Clinical course. A diagrammatic representation of the treatment and clinical course of a 70-year-old man with insulin allergy. He presented 5 months before his admission with wheals, redness, and itching immediately after insulin lispro injection that progressed to an area of induration. A skin biopsy and blood tests confirmed an allergy, and after trialing different insulin regimens, we eventually introduced 0.3 mg liraglutide, discontinued the short-acting insulin, and added glimepiride and metformin. However, induration intermittently occurred after insulin glargine injections, so we eventually cross-tapered him off glargine and onto a liraglutide dose of 0.9 mg. Thereafter, his glycated hemoglobin, insulin, and eosinophil levels gradually improved. _Eo_ eosinophil count, _HbA1c_ glycated hemoglobin, _INS_ insulin dose\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Table 3 Timeline**\n\n【34】Full size table\n\n【35】### Supplemental investigation by Scatchard analysis\n\n【36】We also elucidated the changes in the characteristics of anti-insulin IgG antibodies before and after treatment with liraglutide. Scatchard analysis of the anti-insulin IgG antibodies in our case indicated that there was a high binding capacity and a low affinity constant for the high affinity sites before liraglutide therapy (Fig. 3 ). After 1 year of treatment with liraglutide, the Scatchard plot indicated that the binding capacity decreased and the affinity constant for high affinity sites increased (Fig. 3 ). Of interest, the anti-insulin receptor antibodies had completely disappeared within 1 year after the injection of liraglutide.\n\n【37】**Fig. 3**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】Scatchard plot analysis showing changes in the characteristics of anti-insulin immunoglobulin G antibodies before and after treatment with liraglutide. **a** The Scatchard plot analysis before the treatment of liraglutide. The binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) of 882 (R <sub>1 </sub> ) and affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) of 0.000582 (K <sub>1 </sub> ) for high affinity sites and the binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) of 4830 (R <sub>2 </sub> ) and affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) of 0.0000190 (K <sub>2 </sub> ) for low affinity sites are shown. **b** The Scatchard plot analysis approximately 1 year after starting liraglutide. The binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) of 70.6 (R <sub>1 </sub> ) and affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) of 0.00203 (K <sub>1 </sub> ) for high affinity sites and the binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) of 298 (R <sub>2 </sub> ) and affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) of 0.0000704 (K <sub>2 </sub> ) for low affinity sites are shown. **c** It is notable, particularly for high affinity sites, that the binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) has changed from 882 to 70.6 (R <sub>1 </sub> ), and that the affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) has changed from 0.000582 to 0.00203 (K <sub>1 </sub> ). Therefore, liraglutide appeared to induce a decrease in the binding capacity and an increase in the affinity constant for high affinity sites of anti-insulin immunoglobulin G antibodies\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】There are two important aspects to this case. First, we provide a rare description of insulin allergy associated with hypereosinophilia, anti-insulin IgG antibodies, and anti-insulin receptor antibodies in a patient with type 2 diabetes. Second, the marked efficacy of liraglutide suggests that it is useful in all patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n【43】In our case, we believed that our patient’s insulin allergy was predominantly a type 1 immediate reaction based on the fact that insulin lispro induced wheals, itching, and redness immediately after injection. Insulin allergy is typically classified into the following: type 1, which is local and immediate; type 3, which is related to autoimmune disease; and type 4, which is a delayed-type reaction. Symptoms typically manifest within 15 minutes after insulin injection in type 1 reactions, approximately 6 hours after type 3 reactions, and 8 to 24 hours after type 4 reactions \\[ 2 \\]. In our case, we confirmed that insulin lispro induced immediate symptoms but could not detect whether insulin aspart, glulisine, or glargine induced those reactions.\n\n【44】We did not perform either a skin prick test or an intradermal reaction test because of his past history of anaphylaxis. Out of concern for his safety, we substituted this with a non-invasive drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, which is normally considered best suited for delayed (type 4) reactions. Although this test was only positive for insulin glulisine, false-negatives have been detected in some cases, and we considered that insulin glargine was also associated with delayed-type allergy. This was because insulin glargine induced occasional induration and because its discontinuation resulted in improvement of both his induration and hypereosinophilia.\n\n【45】Based on the combination of these results, we concluded that our patient probably had a delayed-type allergic reaction that was complicated with a predominant immediate-type allergic reaction. Unfortunately, we did not obtain the list of additives in either the lispro or glargine, which could have been important given his history of protamine anaphylaxis. Further investigation of the cause of the allergic reactions could not be performed (for example, to other insulin preparations, including human neutral protamine Hagedorn, or the additives in the insulin types).\n\n【46】Previous reports of type 1 and type 4 allergic reactions to insulin indicate that hypereosinophilia does not necessarily occur. Therefore, the increase of eosinophilia in both local pathological findings and systemic peripheral blood is characteristic of this case. In general, although numerous eosinophils tend to be detected in local inflammation, such as allergy and parasitic infection, the complete role of eosinophils has not been elucidated \\[ 10 \\]. For example, although hypereosinophilia has been observed in invasive parasitic infection, it has recently been reported to be partially defensive _in vivo_ during such an infection \\[ 10 \\]. In clinical cases of hypereosinophilia, clinicians must quickly and accurately diagnose the cause \\[ 11 \\]. Potential causes in the differential diagnosis of this case included adrenal crisis, parasitic infection, and blood disease, but there was no evidence in support of these diagnoses. In addition, because hypereosinophilia simultaneously occurred with the observed clinical course of insulin allergy, we considered insulin allergy the more likely cause. This was consistent with the report by Nagai _et al_ ., who reported a case of immediate-type allergy against human insulin associated with marked eosinophilia in a patient with type 2 diabetes \\[ 12 \\]. In that case, there was also the possibility of hypereosinophilia-induced renal dysfunction. Although there was no evidence of organ damage in this case, clinicians should remain vigilant for hypereosinophilic syndrome \\[ 11 , 13 \\] and be prepared to initiate appropriate therapy. Currently, treatment options for insulin allergy include switching to another insulin device \\[ 2 \\], steroid therapy \\[ 2 \\], continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy \\[ 14 \\], hyposensitization therapy \\[ 15 \\], pancreas transplantation \\[ 16 \\], and anti-IgE therapy \\[ 17 \\]. However, reports on the treatment of insulin allergy with hypereosinophilia are limited, and new options are needed. Therefore, we consider that liraglutide might be a breakthrough agent in the treatment of insulin allergy with hypereosinophilia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, a Medline search indicated that at the time of writing, we are the first to report the beneficial effects of liraglutide in this setting.\n\n【47】Treatment with liraglutide requires the residual ability to secrete insulin, but we do not know the appropriate range of insulin secretion that is necessary. Previously, Kozawa _et al_ . reported that the cut-off value for predicting the efficacy of liraglutide was 1.1 for the C-peptide index, which was defined as (fasting C-peptide/glucose)×100, and 1.5 ng/mL for fasting C-peptide \\[ 18 \\]. This index was also shown to be a predictive marker for the beta-cell area of the human pancreas \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Using a glucagon stimulation test, Usui _et al_ . reported that a ΔC-peptide value of 1.34 ng/mL was a useful cut-off point for switching from insulin to liraglutide without developing hyperglycemia \\[ 20 \\]. In this case, although the fasting C-peptide level was high, the ΔC-peptide in the glucagon stimulation test had a low value. Therefore, liraglutide alone could not inhibit postprandial hyperglycemia, and the antidiabetic drugs glimepiride, metformin, and voglibose were combined to achieve complete control. Moreover, the additional benefits of liraglutide include the prevention of body weight gain due to its appetite-suppressing and gastrointestinal peristaltic movement-suppressing effects. Liraglutide and other GLP-1 analogs have been reported to decrease body weight \\[ 21 , 22 \\]. In our case, our patient’s body weight decreased by only 1.7 kg, but we could not administer liraglutide at a dose of more than 0.9 mg/day. Worldwide, liraglutide is administered at a maximum dose of 1.8 mg/day; however, Japan has approved that liraglutide is administered at a maximum dose of only 0.9 mg/day.\n\n【48】In our case, it is possible that both the insulin allergy and the presence of anti-insulin IgG antibodies themselves aggravated our patient’s glycemic control. Therefore, we tested his human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) type based on the report by Uchigata _et al_ . that insulin autoimmune syndromes are strongly associated with HLA-DR4 \\[ 23 \\]. We showed that his HLA-DR types were DR-9 and DR-15 and not DR-4; thus, we did not consider HLA-DR to be a potential causative factor for producing anti-insulin IgG antibodies. Instead, we concluded that the anti-insulin IgG antibodies resulted from the exogenous insulin injection; thus, we used liraglutide without insulin to decrease the amount of anti-insulin IgG antibodies and to avoid further production.\n\n【49】Moreover, Scatchard analysis of the anti-insulin IgG antibodies in our patient indicated that there was a high binding capacity and a low affinity constant for high affinity sites. At high affinity sites, Eguchi reported two important patterns of Scatchard analysis of anti-insulin IgG antibodies: (1) high (11.5 to 53.2) binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) and low (0.04 to 0.21) affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) in insulin autoimmune syndrome; and (2) low (0.12 to 1.1) binding capacity (10 <sup>−8 </sup> M) and high (1.45 to 7.11) affinity constant (10 <sup>8 </sup> M <sup>−1 </sup> ) in patients with diabetes requiring insulin therapy \\[ 24 \\]. Therefore, the binding capacity and low affinity constant for high affinity sites are clinically important. Our patient had extremely high binding capacity and a low affinity constant compared with previous reports. In particular, his extremely high binding capacity was consistent with his high serum insulin levels.\n\n【50】After insulin therapy was discontinued and liraglutide was started, the characteristics of his anti-insulin IgG antibodies changed. Specifically, there was a notable decrease in the binding capacity and an increase in the affinity constant for high affinity sites (Fig. 3c ). Hara _et al_ . have reported that antibody-mediated insulin resistance was treated by ceasing insulin administration \\[ 25 \\], whereas Tamura _et al_ . reported that liraglutide ameliorated the anti-insulin IgG antibodies in a woman with type 2 diabetes receiving hemodialysis \\[ 26 \\]. In our case, it remains unclear how liraglutide might have affected our patient’s anti-insulin IgG antibodies; however, a recent report has suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonists interact with the immune system. In fact, Hadjiyanni _et al_ . reported that GLP-1 receptor signaling selectively regulated murine lymphocyte proliferation and maintained peripheral regulatory T cells _in vivo_ \\[ 27 \\]. In humans, the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists have been investigated in patients with psoriasis \\[ 28 \\], but the detailed mechanism of action is unclear. Further reports are needed to improve our understanding of these agents.\n\n【51】Anti-insulin IgG antibodies have often been reported to induce hypoglycemia \\[ 8 , 21 , 23 , 24 \\]. Unfortunately, we could not measure serum free insulin levels directly and do not know whether the anti-insulin receptor antibodies really affected glucose metabolism. Although Kim _et al_ . reported that anti-insulin receptor antibodies often coexist with anti-insulin IgG antibodies in Korean patients with insulin autoimmune syndrome \\[ 29 \\], the clinical significance of this finding has been not determined. Acquired anti-insulin receptor antibodies induce severe insulin resistance, called “type B insulin resistance,” which was first reported in 1976 \\[ 30 \\]. However, we found no other symptoms or complications of type B insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans or autoimmune disease (Table 1 ). In addition, the total insulin dose was smaller than that reported in previous studies on type B insulin resistance \\[ 9 , 30 \\]. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the presence of anti-insulin receptor antibodies is a false positive in this case. It is also possible that the method of measurement led to a false positive result for anti-insulin receptor antibodies because we used the insulin binding inhibition method \\[ 31 \\]. Perhaps the high insulin levels and high anti-insulin IgG antibodies levels had some unknown influence on the measured values.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【53】In conclusion, our case suggests that liraglutide is a useful treatment for insulin allergy associated with hypereosinophilia and anti-insulin IgG antibodies in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, similar case reports are limited, and further reports are clearly needed.\n\n【54】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【55】GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; HLA-DR, human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related; IgE, immunoglobulin E; IgG, immunoglobulin G", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The condition is usually asymptomatic and is often discovered accidentally \\[ 2 \\]. However, pelvic digit may also cause pain and functional impairment and can cause some confusion in trauma cases, especially if the patient is symptomatic in the area \\[ 3 \\]. Radiology characteristically shows a rib- or phalanx-like bone structure with a clear cortex and medulla related to the pelvis, often with a typical pseudoarticulation at its base \\[ 2 \\]. We present the case of a 40-year-old Caucasian man who presented with chronic pain and tenderness over his right hip together with functional impairment. Radiology identified a bony protuberance at the right anterior inferior iliac spine with fusion of the proximal bony nucleus to the adjacent bone. The pelvic digit was surgically removed and the patient was discharged free of symptoms with complete range of motion in his right hip joint.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 40-year-old white Caucasian man presented to our outpatient service complaining of right hip pain. He reported having experienced this discomfort since his youth with the condition now worsening, but he denied any history of trauma. Clinical examination revealed tenderness over his right hip together with functional deficits in abduction and external rotation in his right hip joint. Conventional radiography extended by computed tomography (CT) showed a bony protuberance at the right anterior inferior iliac spine with fusion of the proximal bony nucleus to the adjacent bone (Figure 1a and 1b ). This finding together with the clinical picture was highly suggestive of a pelvic digit. Due to the patient's complaints including functional impairment in his right hip joint, surgical removal of the pelvic digit was performed (Figure 1c ) and the patient was discharged 3 days later free of symptoms with a full range of motion in his right hip joint. Histopathological work-up was consistent with a rib bone (Figure 1d ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Conventional radiography (a) and computed tomography including scout view (b) shows a bony protuberance at the right anterior inferior iliac spine** . Complete removal of the pelvic digit (c and d) restored the full range of motion within the patient's right hip joint together with complete relief of symptoms.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】To date, few single cases and case series of pelvic digits have been reported. For example, Sullivan and Cornwell \\[ 4 \\] described a 15-year-old girl with a well-defined 'rib' in the pelvis. The abnormal bone curved caudad towards the right side of the distal sacral vertebra but was not directly attached to the sacrum. Histological assessment after removal was consistent with a rib, as in our patient. The authors postulated that the abnormal bone originated embryogenically from the first coccygeal vertebra. A similar observation was made by Lame \\[ 5 \\] who reported on the case of a 63-year-old man with a finger-shaped bony structure arising from the right iliac crest, terming this anomaly an 'iliac rib'. This author located the anomaly to the mesenchymal stage of bone growth before the sixth week of fetal development \\[ 6 \\], with the posterior segment originating from a displaced rib center and the anterior counterpart from a displaced sternal center \\[ 5 \\]. Morphologically, pelvic digits may present as rib-like \\[ 7 \\] and phalanx-like structures with one or more (pseudo-) joints within \\[ 5 – 8 \\]. Intermediate appearances with features of both rib and phalanx have also been reported \\[ 9 \\]. The pelvic digit is most frequently attached to the ilium \\[ 2 , 3 \\], but also to the sacrum \\[ 4 \\], coccyx \\[ 10 \\], abdominal wall \\[ 8 \\], and, rarely, to the symphysis \\[ 6 \\]. Although pelvic digits occur mostly unilaterally, bilateral occurrences have been reported \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【18】There are some variations in the numbers of bony segments and (pseudo-) articulations of pelvic digits described in the literature. For example, Lame \\[ 5 \\] and Granieri and Bacarini \\[ 7 \\] described a total of six cases, all consisting of a bony structure of at least two bony elements and at least one (pseudo-) articulation. Nguyen _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] reported a case series where one patient had one phalanx and one pseudoarticulation, and two other cases with three bony segments and two pseudoarticulations. A similar configuration was reported by Casey _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】Similarly, variable origins for the digits have been described. According to some authors, the anomaly can originate from a displaced costal process, a displaced sternal center, or the ossification center at the anterior superior iliac spine \\[ 4 – 6 , 9 \\]. However, these suggestions do not reflect the sites of attachment in the pelvis, for example, at the coccyx, the pelvic walls, and the inferior abdominal wall. Therefore, it appears more likely that pelvic digits originate from an embryonic mesoderm with rib-forming capacity disposed to these regions \\[ 2 \\]. At the end of the third week of embryogenesis, embryonic mesoderm cells with rib-forming capacity migrate from the primitive streak and pass around the cloacal membrane, finding their way from the region of the future coccyx via the region of the future pelvic walls, to the region of the lower abdominal wall \\[ 2 \\]. In normal rib development, the posterior part of each rib originates as a 'costal process' of the mesenchyma, thus forming the vertebral centra \\[ 11 \\]. It has been suggested that, in the pelvis, the 'costal processes' become incorporated into the lateral parts of the sacrum and coccyx \\[ 2 \\]. The 'costal process' mesenchyma normally degenerates due to apoptosis. Absence of apoptosis may allow differentiation of 'costal process' mesenchyma into rib tissue. These bony structures may come into contact with the neighboring developing bone \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis of a pelvic digit comprises myositis ossificans, avulsion, heterotopic bone formation, Fong's disease and osteochondroma. Fong's disease (onychoosteodysplasia) is a hereditary condition with dysplastic or absent nails and absent or hypoplastic kneecaps (nail-patella syndrome). Other characteristic features include iliac horns and abnormality of the elbows interfering with the full range of motion. In some cases, new bone formation after surgery or ossification of the sacrotuberous ligament can resemble a pelvic digit \\[ 2 \\]. The pelvic digit is usually identified via radiography and differentiated from post-traumatic myositis ossificans and heterotopic bone formation by its corticated appearance in the absence of trauma \\[ 6 , 7 , 12 \\]. Additionally, CT confirms the presence of cortical bone \\[ 3 , 8 , 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【21】In the absence of clinical symptoms, surgical intervention is not required \\[ 12 \\]. Our patient suffered from chronic pain along with functional impairment in his right hip joint. Diagnostic imaging including conventional radiography and CT revealed a right-sided pelvic digit that prompted surgical intervention. Complete removal restored the full range of motion within his right hip joint together with complete relief of symptoms.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【23】Pelvic digit is a benign congenital anomaly where bone develops in the soft tissue adjacent to normal skeletal bone. It is usually identified via radiography and differentiated from post-traumatic myositis ossificans and heterotopic bone by its corticated appearance in the absence of a traumatic event. Surgical removal is indicated in the case of symptoms such as functional impairment. It is important to recognize and distinguish a pelvic digit from post-traumatic ossification and avulsion to avoid unnecessary investigations.\n\n【24】Consent\n-------\n\n【25】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Gas gangrene is one of the most fulminant infectious diseases; it can cause myonecrosis, gas production, and sepsis. Progression of toxemia and shock is often very rapid. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement than with involvement of the extremities, which carries a better prognosis \\[ 2 \\]. Antibiotics alone are not effective because they do not penetrate ischemic muscles sufficiently \\[ 3 \\]. With respect to vertebral involvement, there are few reports in the literature \\[ 4 \\- 10 \\]. The purpose of this paper is to report a very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 78-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to our institution with a 1-week history of back pain and a 1-day history of paralysis of both legs. She had been bedridden for a week prior to admission in another hospital. There was no history of trauma. No gastrointestinal symptoms were present. Her temperature was 36.8°C, blood pressure was 100/70mmHg, and pulse was 103 beats per minute. On physical examination, her patellar tendon reflexes were present, but Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. All sensory modalities were absent below the inguinal level. Her leg muscles were completely paralyzed bilaterally. There was no anal wink. Anal tone was diminished, and there was no voluntary contraction of the external sphincter.\n\n【12】Admission laboratory values included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 18,800 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , her hemoglobin was 9.4g/dL, and her hematocrit was 30%. Her Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80mm/hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 30.02mg/dL. Initial radiographic examination of her lumbar spine at admission showed only spondylotic change. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed soft tissue swelling anterolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 and a gas-containing epidural abscess that compressed her spinal cord (Figure 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging showed involvement of the T11/12 disc space and adjacent vertebral body with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images with a gas-containing epidural abscess (Figure 2 ).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Computed tomography sagittal and axial images on initial admission.

Hemilaminectomy was done from T10 to T12, and the epidural abscess was removed, followed by T11/12 disc debridement. The epidural abscess was yellow and turbid. Cultures later grew _C. perfringens_ and _Escherichia coli_ . The wound was closed over subfascial drains.\n\n【22】On the second postoperative day, she was confused, and hydrothorax appeared. Thoracic drainage was then performed by a surgeon. Intravenous antibiotic treatment was begun with imipenem/cilastatin at 0.5g every 8 hours for 2 weeks, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for 2 weeks, and then ampicillin-sulbactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for 2 weeks.\n\n【23】Postoperatively, she experienced some sensory and motor return in her legs, but back pain and left chest pain in the sitting position continued. A CT scan 6 weeks after the operation showed T12 vertebral bone destruction (Figure 3 ); her WBC count and CRP were 8800 per mm <sup>3 </sup> and 0.26mg/dL, respectively. She went on to have fusion surgery with instrumentation and subsequently experienced complete relief of her pain. She was discharged 2 months later, at which time she was able to walk with a cane. Examination 18 months after surgery showed normal gait without a cane. Plain radiograph at 18 months after operation showed complete union between the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies (Figure 4 ).\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Computed tomography at 6 weeks after operation.

( **a** ) Anteroposterior radiograph, ( **b** ) Lateral radiograph.\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】Gas gangrene is divided into the following three types: posttraumatic, postoperative, and spontaneous \\[ 11 \\]. A literature review reported that the spontaneous type accounts for 16% of cases \\[ 11 \\]. Spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis is caused by _C. perfringens_ and _Clostridium septicum_ in 60% and 30% of cases, respectively \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Clostridial species are commonly found in soil, dust, water, and the intestines of humans and various animals \\[ 2 , 14 , 15 \\]. Without treatment, there is a 100% mortality rate within 24 hours of onset of systemic symptoms \\[ 14 \\]. If properly treated, the overall mortality rate is 20 to 30% \\[ 2 , 3 , 16 \\]. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement (50%) than with involvement of the extremities (24%), which carries a better prognosis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【34】With respect to vertebral involvement, favorable outcomes after discitis caused by _C. perfringens_ are obtained if the infection occurs only within the disc \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 \\]. However, with surgical site infection (SSI) after lumbar spine surgery, one patient died, and one needed multiple operations \\[ 4 , 7 \\]. The differences in outcomes may be related to the amount of ischemic tissue. Although the disc itself has a small amount of ischemic tissue and a favorable outcome, the amount of ischemic tissue with SSI is larger and is associated with a terrible outcome. The present case with discitis and an epidural abscess survived because the amount of ischemic tissue was small, and emergency debridement and antibiotic therapy were effective.\n\n【35】Fusion surgery is needed if instability remains \\[ 17 \\]. Stabilization with instrumentation is a safe and effective treatment for pyogenic osteomyelitis \\[ 18 \\- 21 \\]. In this case, even after her CRP level decreased, the patient could not sit because of her left lateral chest pain. On CT, vertebral bone destruction had appeared, and instability was considered the main reason for her lateral chest pain. We managed this patient with posterior fixation with instrumentation. She was treated successfully, and she was ambulatory and showed complete bone union on X-ray at 18-month follow-up.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】A very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene that was successfully treated by immediate debridement and subsequent fusion surgery combined with antibiotics was described.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis and Ewing’s sarcoma.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by a proliferation of cells causing local or systemic effects \\[ 1 \\]. LCH includes the clinical entities of eosinophilic granuloma (EG), Letterer–Siwe disease, and Hand–Schuller–Christian disease \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. EG is the most common form of LCH, and involves single or multiple bones \\[ 3 \\]. The disease is characterized by proliferation of the Langerhans cells that usually causes pain and adjacent soft tissue swelling \\[ 4 \\]. It is a relatively uncommon disease suffered by infants and children \\[ 5 \\]. The involvement of both forearms is extremely rare and not previously reported to the best of our knowledge; it is this rare form of LCH that we report in this observation.\n\n【10】Case representation\n-------------------\n\n【11】An 8-year-old Moroccan girl presented to our institution with painful swelling of both forearms which initially appeared on her left forearm and 6 months later on her right forearm. Her family history and medical history were unremarkable. Given the exacerbation of the pain she consulted a doctor who obtained plain radiographs and noted a lesion in both forearms. She was then referred to us for further evaluation. She reported that despite daily use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic analgesics, the pain in her forearms continued to progress. On physical examination she had no fever and had a good general condition. She presented a swelling in the upper third of her right forearm and the upper two-thirds of her left forearm with inflammatory signs (Fig. 1 ). Laboratory studies found a moderate anemia (hemoglobin at 10 g/dL) and a white blood cell count of 11,210/μL with 80% neutrophils. Her C-reactive protein level was 60 mg/L. We obtained plain radiographs (Fig. 2 ) that showed: an osteolytic lesion of the upper one-third of the right ulna and osteolytic lesion of the upper two-thirds of the left radius. On both forearms, we did not note mineralized matrix production, but a cortical breakthrough and internal trabeculations were present. We therefore performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 3 ) which showed: an osteolytic lesion mass (arrow) of the upper one-third of her right ulna and the upper two-thirds of the left radius. The mass was invading her elbow joint whose matrix was in hyposignal T1 (Fig. 3 a), hypersignal T2 (Fig. 3 b), and short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) (Fig. 3 c), containing septa and enhanced annularly after injection of gadolinium (Fig. 3 d). The lesion began in the diaphysis and crossed the physis. A soft tissue mass and cortical breakthrough were noted. A soft tissue edema was also seen. A biopsy curettage of her left forearm was done. A histopathologic examination revealed a proliferation of histiocytes with an infiltration of eosinophils (Fig. 4 ). These histiocytes were positive for S-100 protein (Fig. 5 a) and for CD-1a (Fig. 5 b). No chemotherapy was necessary. Our patient’s symptoms disappeared after a short (5 days) period of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. A repeat X-ray was obtained (Fig. 6 ) and showed a partial improvement of the osteolysis. She remained asymptomatic after 6 months.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Physical examination.

The disease involves typically patients aged from 5 to 15 years in approximately 90% of cases, with a slight male predominance \\[ 6 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, a bilateral localization of LCH on both forearms has not been reported. The most frequent site of EG is the skull followed by the femur, then the ribs. Localization in the forearm is approximately 1.5% \\[ 7 \\]. The most common complaint is the pain, often worse at night \\[ 8 \\]. However, a fracture, a swelling, a deformity, and a soft tissue component are also encountered. The lesions caused by LCH are often located on the diaphysis, the metaphysis, or extend to the physis and epiphysis of the long bone \\[ 9 \\]. Cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling, and medullar widening are often found on radiography. The periosteal reaction, while less common, may be present at an early phase of the disease, giving a more aggressive and pseudomalignant appearance \\[ 9 \\]. The most common lesions on MRI are perilesional bone marrow edema, periosteal reaction, endosteal scalloping, and postcontrast enhancement with or without soft tissue mass \\[ 10 \\]. The differential diagnoses include aneurysmal bone cyst, osteomyelitis, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteoblastoma, Gaucher’s disease, acute leukemia, and metastatic tumor \\[ 11 \\]. The diagnosis of EG is based on histological and histochemical identification. The therapeutic modalities include observation for spontaneous resolution, biopsy, curettage with or without bone grafting, local steroid injection, anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy \\[ 6 \\]. The results of treatment of solitary lesions are always satisfactory. In contrast, multifocal and multisystem types of LCH are generally treated with chemotherapy in combination with other therapeutic modalities \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】LCH is a rare disease in children with a very broad clinical spectrum. The particularity of this observation is the bilaterality of the lesion on both forearms and it has not previously been reported to the best of our knowledge. LCH should be included in the differential diagnosis of osteomyelitis and Ewing’s sarcoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Whereas many of these are frequently reported in the literature, hypoglycemia, a possible side effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, may be underpublicized.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report nine cases of non-diabetic Caucasian women who were between 29 and 68 years of age and who developed low glucose readings after treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. We provide a more detailed discussion of existing evidence of the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the pathogenesis of inflammation and its impact on glycemic equilibrium.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Physicians using tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in the treatment of various rheumatic and other autoimmune diseases should be aware of the potential for the development of glycemic disturbance in these patients. A further role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in the glycemic equilibrium warrants larger controlled trials in patients with and those without a history of diabetes.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Treatment with a biologic agent is useful for controlling inflammatory disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), when disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are not enough to fully control their activities \\[ 1 \\]. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is categorized as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. It is thought that this molecule is crucial in the initiation and continuation of inflammation in many rheumatic diseases, including RA, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and many others. Currently available TNF-α inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab) aim to block pro-inflammatory actions of this cytokine \\[ 2 \\]. Their effectiveness to finally control disease activities in various rheumatic diseases has been proven in many randomized controlled studies \\[ 3 – 5 \\].\n\n【10】However, TNF-α inhibitors entail a plethora of concerns associated with their use. Some of the potential side effects and complications include increased risk of infusion reactions, life-threatening and opportunistic infections (tuberculosis and fungal and other atypical infections), malignancy, and existing concerns associated with their use during pregnancy \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【11】Interestingly, TNF-α inhibitors may also play a role in glycemic control since the TNF-α molecule is known to affect glucose homeostasis. Outcomes affecting glycemic control may be an underpublicized side effect in the literature. The evidence linking inflammation and diabetes mellitus (DM) dates back more than a century. Studies in mice showed a positive correlation between TNF-α quantity and insulin resistance \\[ 6 \\]. Additionally, other studies have been confirmed in humans, in both those with and those without diabetes mellitus type II (DM II) \\[ 7 \\]. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity was noted to improve in patients with prolonged infliximab treatment \\[ 8 \\]. In this paper, we present nine patients who developed low glucose readings after treatment with TNF-α inhibitors.\n\n【12】### Case presentations\n\n【13】Table 1 includes detailed information regarding each of the nine patients presented in our paper.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Descriptive characteristics of patients**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】In Case 1, a 68-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of RA was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine. Since her disease activity was not adequately controlled, additional treatment with TNF inhibitor infliximab at 3 mg/kg intravenously was initiated. She developed an episode of low blood glucose (a venous glucose level of 67 mg/dL) six months after starting treatment. Her infliximab was discontinued because of ineffectiveness, and treatment with another biologic agent, etanercept, at 50 mg subcutaneously weekly was started. Subsequently, she developed another episode of low blood glucose, of 68 mg/dL, 10 months after initiating treatment. So, overall, she developed two episodes of low blood glucose readings: one of 67 mg/dL and the other of 68 mg/dL. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【17】In Case 2, 54-year-old Caucasian woman had a history of RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud syndrome, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome, and a family history of DM type II. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Owing to uncontrolled disease activity, TNF-α inhibitor infliximab was added. She developed one episode of low blood glucose reading of 66 mg/dL 8 months after starting treatment with infliximab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【18】In Case 3, A 62-year-old Caucasian woman had a history of RA along with chronic anemia. Her RA was initially treated with leflunomide. Owing to uncontrolled disease activity, TNF-α inhibitor infliximab at 3 mg/kg intravenously was added to her treatment regimen. She developed one episode of low blood glucose reading of 60 mg/dL four months after starting infliximab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【19】In Case 4, a 29-year-old Caucasian woman had a history of RA and seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA). She was treated with hydroxychloroquine, and then, owing to uncontrolled disease activity, TNF-α inhibitor adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously was added. She experienced one episode of low blood glucose reading with a value of 67 mg/dL three months after starting adalimumab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【20】In case 5, a 45-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of RA and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) was initially treated with leflunomide. Subsequently, TNF-α inhibitor certolizumab at 200 mg subcutaneously every four weeks was added to her treatment regimen. She had an episode of low blood glucose reading with a value of 69 mg/dL two months after starting certolizumab. Owing to intolerance, she was switched to another TNF-α inhibitor, infliximab, at 3 mg/kg intravenously. After three months, another bout of low blood glucose reading, with a value of 63 mg/dL, occurred. So she developed two episodes of low blood glucose readings: one of 69 mg/dL after certolizumab and another, of 63 mg/dL, after infliximab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【21】In case 6, a 55-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of RA, SLE, and CREST syndrome was treated with leflunomide at the beginning, and then after her disease activity was not controlled, TNF-α inhibitor adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously was added. She developed three episodes of low blood glucose readings of 63, 62, and 62 mg/dL four, 14, and 15 months, respectively, after starting adalimumab. Secondary to intolerance, another anti-TNF inhibitor, certolizumab, was started. Another episode of low blood glucose reading, of 68 mg/dL, developed six months after starting certolizumab. So she developed three low blood glucose readings of 63, 62, and 62 mg/dL, respectively, after initiation treatment with adalimumab, and then another episode of low blood glucose reading, of 68 mg/dL, after certolizumab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【22】In case 7, a 30-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of von Willebrand disease and RA was initially treated with methotraxate. After uncontrolled disease activity, treatment with TNF-α inhibitor adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously was initiated. She developed one episode of low blood glucose reading with a value of 68 mg/dL six months after starting adalimumab. Secondary to intolerance, she was switched to golimumab at 50 mg subcutaneously. Then, one month after starting golimumab, another episode of low blood glucose reading was recorded at 58 mg/dL. So she had one episode of low blood glucose level of 68 mg/dL after adalimumab and then another episode of low blood glucose reading, of 58 mg/dL, after golimumab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【23】In case 8, a 47-year-old Caucasian woman had a history of SpA, FMS, and RA. Since her disease activity was not well controlled, TNF-α inhibitor adalimumab at 40 mg subcutaneously every two weeks was initiated. Subsequently, patient developed one episode of low glucose reading of 54 mg/dL 2 months after starting adalimumab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【24】In case 9, a 65-year-old Caucasian woman had a history of RA and FMS. Initially, she was treated with hydroxychloroquine. After uncontrolled disease activity, TNF-α inhibitor infliximab at 3 mg/kg intravenously was started. She developed an episode of low blood glucose level of 64 mg/dL five months after starting infliximab. She was not symptomatic.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Biologic agents in the category of TNF-α inhibitors, including etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, have proven efficacious in controlling disease activity of various rheumatic and autoimmune diseases, including RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, because of their action against the TNF-α molecule \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【27】In this paper, nine patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors developed low blood glucose levels. Six of them were treated with infliximab, five with adalimumab, two with certolizumab pegol, and one with golimumab. The average time of developing hypoglycemia after initiating TNF-α inhibitor was 4.3 months; the shortest time was one month, and the longest time was six months. The level of hypoglycemia ranged from 54 to 69 mg/dL. All of the patients treated were Caucasian women ranging from 29 to 68 years of age. Only one patient treated had a family history of DM type II (case 2), but none of the patients had a personal history of DM type I or type II. All of the recordings of blood glucose levels were done retrospectively for approximately two hours in a post-prandial state.\n\n【28】The body mass index (BMI) in our patients ranged from 18.3 to 32.4, and the average was 22.15 (normal weight). One patient had a BMI of 18.3, placing her in the underweight category. Another patient had a BMI of 32.4, placing her in the obese category. The majority of the BMIs were within normal weight category and included the following values: 22.0, 22.1, 19.3, 24.5, 19.6, 21.4, and 19.8. It is known that higher BMI is associated with increased risk for developing diabetes type II along with cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and high blood pressure. However, most of our patients who developed low blood glucose readings had BMIs within the normal weight category. This finding suggests that the impact of TNF-α inhibitors on glycemic equilibrium might be independent of BMI measurement.\n\n【29】While all nine patients had at least one bout of a low blood glucose reading, four patients (cases 1, 5, 6, and 7) developed more than one episode of hypoglycemia after initiating TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Case 1 was a patient who had RA and who developed one episode of a low blood glucose reading after treatment with infliximab and another low blood glucose reading after treatment with etanercept. Case 5 was a patient who had RA and who developed low blood glucose readings after treatment with certolizumab and then after treatment with infliximab. Case 5 was a patient who had RA and who developed a low blood glucose reading while being treated with certolizumab pegol and another low blood glucose reading after switching to infliximab. Case 6 was a patient who had RA, SLE, and CREST syndrome and who had the highest incidence of low blood glucose readings during this observational case series. Three episodes of low blood glucose readings occurred while she was on adalimumab, and one episode occurred while she was on certolizumab pegol. Case 7 had one episode of low blood glucose reading while she was on adalimumab and another episode while she was on golimumab.\n\n【30】The literature describes episodes of hypoglycemia occurring in those with pre-existing diabetes and concurrent use of TNF-α inhibitors. Boulton and Borne \\[ 10 \\] report the case of a 55-year-old woman who had a history of type I diabetes and RA and who developed several episodes of hypoglycemia within three weeks after initiating etanercept and subsequently within a 24-hour period of starting adalimumab. Moreover, in another case, a 54-year-old woman who had RA and type II diabetes experienced periods of severe hypoglycemia hours after receiving etanercept injections \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【31】Farrokhi and colleagues \\[ 12 \\] describe the case of a 59-year-old woman who had psoriasis and type II diabetes and who experienced symptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia of between 50 to 68 mg/dL six weeks after receiving etanercept injections. This patient exhibited an unexpected improvement in glycemic control shortly after beginning etanercept treatment, despite only minimal change in body weight. Also, a decline of hemoglobin A1C of 2.8% along with a significant decrease of medication requirement for glycemic control was found in this patient within nine months of treatment with etanercept. This finding pointed to a salutary effect on glucose metabolism \\[ 12 \\]. In a similar case, a 51-year-old woman who had type II diabetes and who was hospitalized with erythrodermic psoriasis experienced hypoglycemia of as low as 27 mg/dL and convulsions after only seven hours of initiating etanercept, and insulin therapy was discontinued to maintain normal glycemic control \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【32】Cheung and Bryer-Ash \\[ 14 \\] describe a case of a 72-year-old man who had a history of type II DM and chronic plaque psoriasis and who developed hypoglycemic events of 60 mg/dL or less a few times a week one month after treatment with etanercept. His insulin dose was progressively decreased and then completely discontinued at 16 months of treatment with etanercept, and instead he was treated only with oral anti-diabetic agents. He no longer experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, and at the end of 20 months of treatment with etanercept, his BMI remained unchanged whereas his fasting blood sugar levels improved \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【33】In a small pilot study of 18 patients (11 males and seven females), pediatric patients who had newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and who were treated with etanercept had lower A1C and increased endogenous insulin production, suggesting preservation of beta-cell function. From baseline to week 24, insulin doses decreased 18% in the etanercept group but increased 23% in the placebo group \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【34】So far, the only reported cases of hypoglycemia have occurred in individuals who were treated with TNF-α inhibitors and who had a known history of diabetes. In our paper, the presentation is quite unusual since all nine of our patients who developed low blood glucose readings after treatment with a TNF-α inhibitor did not have an underlying history of diabetes. All of our patients were women, whereas cases presented above described both men and women. Whereas all of our cases were asymptomatic, pointing to a more biochemical hypoglycemia, all other reported cases with hypoglycemia occurred in diabetic patients who were treated with TNF-α inhibitors and who were symptomatic. It is possible that TNF inhibitors magnify the clinical effects of hypoglycemia in patients with already-treated diabetes. Additionally, whereas the mean time before development of low blood glucose readings observed in our nine cases was 4.2 months, some instances describe episodes of hypoglycemia occurring within a few hours of TNF inhibitor therapy in patients with pre-existing diabetes.\n\n【35】Our study is a series of cases and aims to serve as a guide for further investigations. However, it carries some limitations. Mainly, it is not a randomized controlled study. The recordings of low blood glucose levels were done retrospectively. Additionally, there might be inadequate exclusion of all other possible causes of low blood glucose readings. Lastly, the threshold for low blood glucose levels used here (< 70 mg/dL) is considered to be higher than the one used in current classic criteria for hypoglycemia, which consists of serum glucose levels of less than 50 to 55 mg/dL and, preferably, documentation of Whipple triad for hypoglycemia (low blood glucose concentration measured with a precise method, presence of symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, and symptom alleviation upon correction of blood glucose) \\[ 16 \\]. Thus, it may be undermining the clinical significance of such low levels of glucose. However, a threshold of blood glucose level of less than 70 mg/dL is often used in anti-diabetic trials to monitor any adverse effects. Also, the neuroendocrine responses begin at an arterial plasma glucose concentration of less than approximately 70 mg/dL \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【36】On a more molecular level, the TNF-α molecule appears to inhibit the insulin-mediated uptake of glucose in adipose tissue via a mechanism of downregulating the GLUT-4 receptor. This could lead to a state of insulin resistance \\[ 11 \\]. It is possible that, in the patient population presented here, the action of the TNF-α inhibitors brought about increased insulin sensitivity because of the blockade of TNF-α in adipose tissue \\[ 17 \\]. Hence, this could be a proposed mechanism for the development of low blood glucose readings observed in our cases.\n\n【37】Hotamisligil and colleagues \\[ 18 \\] demonstrated that TNF-α induced serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), which in turn caused the serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. This prevented the normal tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and thus interfered with insulin signal transduction. Interleukin-6 and TNF-α have recently been shown \\[ 19 , 20 \\] to induce SOCS-3, a protein that was thought to interfere with cytokine signal transduction but that is now also known to interfere with tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 and to cause ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of IRS-1 \\[ 21 \\]. This, in turn, reduces the activation of Akt (protein kinase B), which normally causes the translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut-4 to the plasma membrane. This also induces the phosphorylation of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and its activation to generate nitric oxide \\[ 22 \\]. A newly described protein, TRB3, has also been shown to interfere with the activation of Akt and thus to interfere with the action of insulin \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【38】The evidence linking inflammation and DM dates back more than a century. Overproduction of TNF-α has been found in obesity, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and type II DM \\[ 6 \\]. Also, it was found that inhibition of TNF-α resulted in the improvement of peripheral uptake of glucose in response to insulin in obese mice \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【39】One report showed that chronic treatment with infliximab for either RA or psoriatic arthritis brought about a substantial improvement in insulin sensitivity \\[ 8 \\]. In the same study, one patient with type II diabetes actually reverted to a state in which glucose tolerance was impaired and insulin therapy ceased. Another study pointed out that glycemic control could improve after 24 months of etanercept therapy \\[ 15 \\]. It stands to reason, therefore, that the TNF-α inhibitors used to treat RA could indeed induce a state of hypoglycemia with chronic use.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】In our paper, we presented nine cases of non-diabetic patients who developed episodes of low blood glucose readings after treatment with TNF-α inhibitors. The proposed mechanism might involve induction of increased insulin sensitivity while blocking TNF-α in adipose tissue \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【42】This study has some limitations, including the lack of randomization, the use of retrospective recordings, the inadequate exclusion of other possible causes, and the use of a high glucose threshold, undermining the clinical significance of such low levels of glucose. We believe that more investigations are needed to examine this complex relationship between TNF-α and glucose equilibrium.\n\n【43】Physicians using TNF-α inhibitors in the treatment of various rheumatic and autoimmune diseases should be aware of the potential for the development of glycemic disturbance in these patients, a side effect that may be underpublicized. Accordingly, closer monitoring of blood glucose levels should be rendered. Further randomized controlled studies on the relationship between TNF-α inhibitors and glycemic control are warranted, along with more studies examining the possible therapeutic role of TNF-α inhibitors in controlling other autoimmune diseases, such as DM.\n\n【44】Consent\n-------\n\n【45】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

In patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tubes cannot be placed, single-incision laparoscopic surgery gastrostomy is an alternative method. This minimally invasive approach is a new technique performed through a single umbilical incision and without the need for additional laparoscopic ports.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In this article we present a case of single-incision laparoscopic surgery gastrostomy performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments in a 10-year-old girl of Caucasian ethnicity who was not a candidate for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube because of esophageal varices due to her advanced-stage cystic fibrosis with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. She also had an umbilical hernia, which was repaired during the same procedure through the same incision. Access and pneumoperitoneum were obtained through the umbilicus with the single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. The selected site for the feeding tube in the stomach was exteriorized through this incision and a feeding tube was placed. The stomach was returned into the abdomen. The fascial defect, and thus also the hernia, was repaired, and the 2cm umbilical incision was closed with endocutaneous sutures. The total operative time was 25 minutes. Our patient’s intra-operative and post-operative course was uneventful. We were able to use the feeding tube on the first post-operative day with good intestinal function. Our patient and her parents were pleased with the cosmetic result.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The single-incision laparoscopic surgery procedure seems to be a less invasive alternative to open placement of gastrostomy. This approach has the possible advantages of reduced post-operative pain, faster return to normal function, reduced port site complications, improved cosmesis and better patient satisfaction.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】As technology and innovation continue to advance in the field of minimally invasive surgery, the use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is gaining popularity. Single-port surgery is a procedure in which laparoscopic surgery is performed through a small incision at the umbilicus or another region in the abdomen. Applications have been previously described using this approach for various procedures in adults. In children, SILS procedures have been published in particular for cholecystectomy and appendectomy.\n\n【10】Potential advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery include better cosmesis, less post-operative wound pain, and fewer port site complications.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Our patient was a 10-year-old girl of Caucasian ethnicity. She had an advanced stage of cystic fibrosis with liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly. She needed supplementary tube feeding because of weight loss due to external compression from her enlarged liver and spleen on the stomach. It was not possible to place a gastrostomy by gastroscopy because of esophageal varices. For this reason, a surgical approach was mandatory. Because of the enormous hepatosplenomegaly it would have been difficult to find the stomach under the left liver lobe by median laparotomy. For that reason we decided to use the SILS procedure. She also had an umbilical hernia with incarcerated fat, which was repaired during the same procedure.\n\n【13】The operation was carried out under general anesthesia via endotracheal intubation with our patient in dorsal decubitus, tilted to a 30° anti-Trendelenburg position. After appropriate skin preparation and application of sterile drapes, a 2cm incision was made at the upper half of the umbilical ring, at the place of the hernia (Figure 1 ). The incision was deepened to the fascia. The hernial sac was dissected and opened so we could enter the abdomen.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**A 2cm hemi-circumferential incision was made at the upper half of the umbilical ring to insert the single-incision laparoscopic surgery port.**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Under vision, the SILS® port (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), a specially designed single port with three inserts, was placed into the peritoneal cavity (Figure 2 ). A pneumoperitoneum of 12mmHg was developed. A 5mm laparoscope was used for visualization and two 5mm working instruments were inserted. The three ports formed an inverted triangular configuration, with the two working ports being farthest away and the laparoscope being at the inferior position. The extracorporeal lengths of the ports were kept different, with the laparoscopic port being the longest so as to minimize collisions at the back ends. A standard 30° laparoscope was used for the procedure (Figure 3 ).\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】**A single-incision laparoscopic surgery port (Covidien) with three inserts was placed into the peritoneal cavity.**\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**The three ports form an inverted triangular configuration, with the two working ports being farthest away and the laparoscope being at the inferior position.**\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】During abdominal exploration with standard straight instruments we could see a very large heterogeneous left liver lobe and an enormous spleen. It was difficult to see the stomach. With the help of the instruments the stomach could be identified under the left liver lobe. We grasped the stomach along the great curvature with an instrument and brought it outside the abdomen by extracting the single port (Figure 4 ). The gastrostomy passed the skin and abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant and was then grasped and brought outside through the incision of the single port at the umbilicus. Outside the abdomen we made a purse-string suture on the stomach. The gastrostomy was placed in the stomach and the purse-string was closed. We filled the balloon of the gastrostomy with 5cm <sup>3 </sup> of saline solution. Once the gastrostomy was placed in the stomach, the stomach was returned into the abdomen. The fascial defect, and thus also the hernia, was repaired with a Vicryl 2–0 suture (Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson) and the 2cm umbilical incision was closed with endocutaneous sutures.\n\n【28】**Figure 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】**With the help of the instruments the stomach could be identified under the left liver lobe and grasped along the great curvature during the single-incision laparoscopic surgery procedure.**\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】The total operative time was 25 minutes. There was no blood loss. Our patient’s post-operative course was uneventful, and she required minimal analgesia.\n\n【33】Our patient was able to use the feeding tube on the first post-operative day with good intestinal function.\n\n【34】Our patient was discharged on the third post-operative day with no oral analgesics. Our patient and her parents were very pleased with the cosmetic result. Early follow-up at two weeks showed no evidence of complications, and the umbilical wound had healed (Figure 5 ).\n\n【35】**Figure 5**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】**Follow-up at two weeks showed no evidence of complications, and the umbilical wound was healed.**\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】SILS has recently been developed, and has been embraced by many throughout the world as the new paradigm in laparoscopy.\n\n【41】Potential advantages over conventional laparoscopic surgery include better cosmesis, less post-operative wound pain, earlier recovery and fewer port site complications. A SILS procedure at the level of the umbilicus is also less traumatic than the conventional three-trocar laparoscopic approach, because no trocar is inserted into the abdomen through the abdominal muscles, which reduces possible injury to intra-abdominal organs \\[ 1 \\]. In SILS, the insertion of the port is performed under direct view.\n\n【42】Most of the reports in the literature on SILS are in adults, such as SILS for appendectomy, cholecystectomy and colectomy and in bariatric surgery. Single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy \\[ 2 – 4 \\] and cholecystectomy \\[ 5 – 7 \\] are SILS procedures that have been described in pediatric patients. Few case reports of splenectomy \\[ 8 – 10 \\] and nephrectomy \\[ 11 , 12 \\] by SILS approach in children have been described to date.\n\n【43】For the placement of a gastrostomy in children, different techniques have been described in the literature. The laparoscopic U-stitch technique, first described by Georgeson in 1993, allows primary button placement and carries the advantages of laparoscopy. It enables direct visualization of the intra-peritoneal anatomy, greatly minimizing the risk of hollow viscous or vascular injury \\[ 13 \\]. Kawahara _et al_ . reported a single-port technique using a 15mm incision and operating laparoscope \\[ 14 \\]. Ponsky _et al_ . described a single-site laparoscopic gastrostomy with a 4mm bronchoscopic optical grasp, which is a minimal invasive procedure that provides direct visualization through a single 5mm abdominal port \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【44】Via our SILS technique it was possible to explore the whole abdomen, as in the procedures described above, but it was also possible to use extra instruments to push away the liver and spleen to allow optimal visualization of the stomach and perfect intra-peritoneal anatomy.\n\n【45】We recommend the use of conventional laparoscopic instruments to keep the procedure costs equal to conventional laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【46】The cosmetic result of this SILS procedure was excellent, with the scar above the umbilicus. A virtually scar-free surgery is important in pediatric patients, as a scar is a stigma for life. Normally in SILS procedures, we make an incision into the umbilicus in order to make it a scar-free procedure, but in this case we decided to make a supra-umbilical incision to correct the umbilical hernia at the same time.\n\n【47】This early experience suggests that outcomes are comparable to standard laparoscopic surgery, but with improved cosmesis, less pain and earlier recovery; however, larger series should confirm these findings.\n\n【48】Pediatric surgeons need to play an active role in developing the SILS approach for additional procedures, as well as encouraging the industry to produce instruments specific for pediatric needs.\n\n【49】The development of a flexible-tip laparoscope, together with articulated laparoscopic instruments, will make the procedure slightly easier and thus attractive for many pediatric surgeons. With more input from the experience of colleagues around the world, the feasibility and safety of adopting SILS into pediatric practice, as well as its benefits over conventional laparoscopic surgery, could be determined.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【51】Single-incision surgery is a developing technique in children. In this article we describe our first experience of single-incision gastrostomy in a pediatric patient. We have shown that single-port gastrostomy can be safe and effective in pediatric patients, and may be a replacement for traditional laparotomy for the placement of a gastrostomy.\n\n【52】Furthermore, we hope to extend the use of this operative approach to other commonly performed pediatric procedures.\n\n【53】Consent\n-------\n\n【54】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this manuscript and any accompanying images.

Although systemic chemotherapy is applied to distal cholangiocarcinoma with factors of unresectability such as metastasis to the liver, lung, peritoneum, and distant lymph nodes (LNs), its clinical value remains unsatisfactory \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. A few recent reports have described the effectiveness of resection for treatment of recurrent cholangiocarcinoma \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. However, none have described resection of synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma. We report the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of a slow-growing synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma resected 3.5 years after the initial surgery.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 67-year-old Japanese man who had been diagnosed with distal cholangiocarcinoma at a previous hospital was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment. He was a current smoker. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. He had undergone percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage at a previous hospital because of obstructive jaundice without biliary tract stones. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed thickening of the distal bile duct (Fig. 1a ), and chest CT showed an air-space pattern in the upper lobe of the left lung (Fig. 1b ). The patient’s serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated at 15.1 ng/ml, and that of carbohydrate antigen was within the reference range.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Computed tomography findings. **a** Abdominal computed tomography showing thickening of the distal bile duct ( _arrow_ ). **b** Chest computed tomography showing an air-space consolidation in the upper lobe of left lung ( _arrow_ )\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for the distal cholangiocarcinoma. Because of its small size, the lesion in the left lung could not be diagnosed accurately in terms of whether it was malignant and had the possibility of being pneumonia. Therefore, the lesion was observed. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the pancreas with five regional LN metastases (Fig. 2a, b ). Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) (Fig. 2c ) and CDX-2 (Fig. 2d ) and negative for CK20 (Fig. 2e ). According to the seventh edition of the TNM staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control, the patient’s disease was diagnosed as distal cholangiocarcinoma, T3N1M0, stage IIB. The patient received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 (120 mg/body) for 6 months. S-1 was given for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest. This administration of S-1 was repeated every 6 weeks for up to four cycles.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry of the resected specimen after pancreaticoduodenectomy. H&E stains show well-differentiated to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma ( **a** , original magnification × 10; **b** , original magnification × 200). Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 ( **c** , original magnification × 200) and CDX-2 ( **d** , original magnification × 200) and negative for cytokeratin 20 ( **e** , original magnification × 200)\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Follow-up chest CT was periodically performed about every 4 months during the first 5 years after the initial surgery. Follow-up chest CT demonstrated that the air-space pattern in the upper lobe of the left lung had gradually enlarged to 36.8 mm in diameter with no additional lesions for 3.5 years after PD (Fig. 3a–d ). The patient was asymptomatic, and a physical examination including assessment of respiratory function revealed no remarkable findings. The patient’s serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen was slightly elevated at 5.6 ng/ml. Biochemical parameters except for carcinoembryonic antigen were within the reference ranges. Positron emission tomography with <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose CT detected abnormal uptake in the left lung lesion with a maximum standardized uptake value of 4.30 (Fig. 4 ). A transbronchial lung biopsy showed malignant findings. However, the definitive diagnosis could not be established.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Change in the air-space consolidation in the upper lobe of the left lung after pancreaticoduodenectomy: ( **a** ) 1 year, ( **b** ) 2 years, ( **c** ) 3 years, and ( **d** ) 3.5 years\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】<sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose computed tomography revealing abnormal uptake in the lesion of the left lung with a maximum standardized uptake value of 4.30\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】With differential diagnoses of either primary lung cancer or solitary pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma, thoracoscopic left S6 segmentectomy with LN dissection was performed. Histologically, the resected lung specimen showed adenocarcinoma tissue characterized by the formation of irregular tubular structures with lepidic growth (Fig. 5a, b ). Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CK7 and CDX-2 (Fig. 5c, d ), similar to the cholangiocarcinoma, and negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, napsin A, and CK20 (Fig. 5e–g ). Additionally, an LN metastasis was detected in a resected regional LN. On the basis of these findings, we finally diagnosed the patient with a solitary synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】The resected lung specimen resembled the previous distal cholangiocarcinoma. Histopathological examination (H&E staining) of the lung tumor showed tumor cells forming irregular tubular structures with a lepidic pattern ( **a** , original magnification × 10; **b** , original magnification × 200). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 ( **c** , original magnification × 200) and CDX-2 ( **d** , original magnification × 200) and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 ( **e** , original magnification × 200), napsin A ( **f** , original magnification × 200), and cytokeratin 20 ( **g** , original magnification × 200)\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of resection of a solitary synchronous pulmonary metastasis with lepidic growth from distal cholangiocarcinoma 3.5 years after PD. This patient’s course suggests two important clinical issues. First, surgical resection of a synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma might offer better long-term survival than nonsurgical treatments. Although surgical resection is the only curative treatment for distal cholangiocarcinoma, more than half of patients who undergo curative resection develop recurrences \\[ 7 \\], and the median survival time is < 12 months \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The lung is the fourth most common site of recurrence after resection of cholangiocarcinoma \\[ 5 \\]. In general, systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy are considered for patients with recurrence, including recurrence of pulmonary metastases from cholangiocarcinoma. However, the clinical outcomes are not satisfactory \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. A few recent reports have described the effectiveness of resection for treatment of recurrent cholangiocarcinoma in select patients \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. One study on metachronous pulmonary metastasectomy from cholangiocarcinoma revealed that surgery for pulmonary metastasis should be considered in patients with a longer initial disease-free interval \\[ 5 \\]. In our patient, we surgically resected a slow-growing lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung with no additional lesions 3.5 years after the initial surgery because the definitive diagnosis could not be established (primary lung cancer versus solitary pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma). The lesion in the left lung was histopathologically diagnosed as a solitary synchronous pulmonary metastasis. This case indicates that patients with synchronous pulmonary metastasis may have long survival and that pulmonary resection is possible in these patients.\n\n【37】Second, pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma may exhibit lepidic growth, making it difficult to distinguish from primary lung cancer. In general, pulmonary metastasis is typically described as one or multiple nodules on radiological imaging. However, metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma rarely shows lepidic growth on radiological or histopathological examination \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Chest CT of pulmonary metastasis from the pancreas, colon, and stomach shows lepidic growth associated with air-space patterns, such as air bronchograms, ground-glass opacities, and consolidation \\[ 9 \\]. Additionally, lepidic pulmonary metastasis from perihilar cholangiocarcinoma was reported in an autopsy case \\[ 10 \\]. In our patient, preoperative chest CT before PD showed an air-space pattern in the upper lobe of the left lung. The lesion in the lung was diagnosed as pulmonary metastasis with a lepidic pattern from distal cholangiocarcinoma by immunohistochemical examination of the resected specimen 3.5 years after the initial surgery. A regional LN metastasis of the lung was also detected. Finally, we diagnosed the patient with a solitary synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【39】We report the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of a slow-growing synchronous pulmonary metastasis with lepidic growth from distal cholangiocarcinoma resected 3.5 years after the initial surgery. This case is also extremely rare in that we were able to observe the course of the synchronous pulmonary metastasis for a long period of time. Surgical resection might offer better long-term survival to patients with synchronous pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma than nonsurgical treatments. Pulmonary metastasis from distal cholangiocarcinoma may exhibit a lepidic pattern, making it difficult to distinguish from primary lung cancer. Therefore, pulmonary resection should be considered for patients with lepidic lesions who have been diagnosed with distal cholangiocarcinoma because of the possibility of synchronous pulmonary metastasis.\n\n【40】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【41】CK:\n\n【42】Cytokeratin\n\n【43】CT:\n\n【44】Computed tomography\n\n【45】LN:\n\n【46】Lymph node\n\n【47】PD:\n\n【48】Pancreaticoduodenectomy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It represents 5% of all spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. In spite of extensive investigation, understanding of the mechanisms leading to perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage remains incompletely defined. A growing body of evidence has supported a familial predisposition for non-aneurysmal spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 39-year-old Caucasian man presented with sudden onset headache associated with diplopia.

The older brother of the first case, a 44-year-old Caucasian man, presented 1.5 years later with acute onset of headache and his computed tomography scan also showed perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was discharged home with normal neurological examination 1 week later. Follow-up angiograms did not reveal any source of bleeding in either patient.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We report the cases of two siblings with perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which may further suggest a familial predisposition of non-aneurysmal spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage and may also point out the possible higher risk of perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first-degree relatives of patients with perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating clinical problem and is most commonly caused by a rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. In approximately 15% of patients with spontaneous SAH, the origin of the hemorrhage cannot be detected, despite extensive diagnostic imaging studies, and this is called non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (NSAH) \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. NSAH can be subdivided into two different subgroups: perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (P-NSAH) and non-perimesencephalic non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (nP-NSAH). P-NSAH is characterized by accumulation of subarachnoid blood, predominantly around the midbrain, and a lack of blood in the brain parenchyma or ventricular system \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In contrast, computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with nP-NSAH reveal bleeding patterns similar to those seen in aneurysmal SAH.\n\n【10】P-NSAH has generally been considered a distinct entity after the identification of different prognoses from the other NSAH by van Gijn _et al._ \\[ 2 \\]. Patients with P-NSAH not only have a much lower risk of morbidity and mortality than the patients with aneurysmal SAH, but also have better outcomes than patients with nP-NSAH \\[ 1 – 3 \\].\n\n【11】It has repeatedly been shown that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of SAH \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. An apparent relationship between genetic factors and P-NSAH has not been defined; however, accumulating reports of familial cases of P-NSAH and nP-NSAH raise the question of whether there are genetic factors that play an important role in the development of SAH \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【12】We report the cases of two siblings with P-NSAH, which suggest first-degree relatives of individuals with this entity may have a higher risk for SAH.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Case 1\n\n【15】A 39-year-old otherwise healthy Caucasian man presented with spontaneous, sudden onset headache associated with diplopia lasting for several minutes. The most severe headache episode lasted for about 15 minutes. During admission, the intensity of his headaches diminished significantly along with an improvement of the diplopia. On admission, he was awake, alert and fully oriented with fluent speech. He had no focal neurological deficits except nuchal rigidity. He was a non-cigarette smoker with no significant past medical history. A CT of his head without contrast revealed subtle subarachnoid hemorrhage within the interpeduncular and ambient cisterns (Figure 1 A and 1 B). A subsequent lumbar puncture was found positive.He was admitted to our neurosurgical intensive care unit (N-ICU) for observation and further work-up. Coagulation studies were normal. Further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of his head and neck and 4-vessel cerebral angiogram did not show any abnormalities (Figure 2 A- 2 C). Venous phases of the cerebral angiograms showed a Type C variant of the basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR) draining into the superior petrosal sinus on the left side and a small and hypoplastic Type A variant of BVR on the right side (Figure 2 D and 2 E). His symptoms improved and eventually he was discharged 1 week after the bleeding. On follow-up at 2 years, no neurological deficit and no recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed.\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Case 1.** Axial non-contrast computed tomography of the head **(A** **and** **B)** shows a small amount of subarachnoid blood (circle) in the interpeduncular and ambient cisterns.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Figure 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**Case 1.** Axial magnetic resonance angiography **(A, B** **and** **C)** shows a Type A basal vein of Rosenthal on the right side (arrow head in **A** ) and a Type C basal vein of Rosenthal on the left side (arrows in **A** , **B** and **C** ).

He denied loss of consciousness, vision loss, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness and dizziness. On neurological examination, he was awake, alert and fully oriented with fluent speech. In the presence of slight nuchal rigidity, he had full motor strength with no sensory deficit in all four extremities and his cranial nerves were intact. He was a non-cigarette smoker and had no significant medical history except inguinal hernia repair. Family history was positive for P-NSAH in younger brother (Case 1), which was diagnosed 1.5 years previously. A non-contrast axial CT scan of his head revealed a perimesencephalic SAH pattern and no evidence of intraventricular or intraparenchymal blood and hydrocephalus. The center of bleeding was located anterior to the midbrain (Figure 3 A and 3 B).He was admitted to our N-ICU for observation and further work-up. No abnormality was found in the coagulation studies. He underwent additional multiple imaging studies, including CT and CT angiography of his head and neck (Figure 4 A and 4 B) and 4-vessel cerebral angiograms. None of these diagnostic studies showed the source of this SAH. Venous phases of the angiograms showed a Type A variant of BVR on the left side and a Type B variant of BVR on the right side (Figure 4 C and 4 D). His symptoms continued to improve and eventually he was discharged 1 week after the bleeding. A repeat cerebral angiogram 3 months later again confirmed the absence of any aneurysm and vascular abnormality. On 1 year follow-up, his neurological examination was normal and no recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed.\n\n【26】**Figure 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Case 2.** Axial non-contrast computed tomography of the head **(A** **and** **B)** shows perimesencephalic spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (circle) with the center of bleeding located anterior to the midbrain.\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Figure 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Case 2.** Axial computed tomography angiography of the head **(A** **and** **B)** shows a Type B basal vein of Rosenthal on the right side (arrow head in **A** ) and a Type A basal vein of Rosenthal on the left side (arrows in **A** and **B** ). Lateral view of the venous phase of the internal carotid artery angiogram **(C** **and** **D)** shows a Type B basal vein of Rosenthal on the right side (arrow in **C** ; the basal vein of Rosenthal is not visualized anteriorly) and a Type A basal vein of Rosenthal on the left side (arrow in **D** ).\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】P-NSAH was first described by van Gijn _et al._ \\[ 2 \\] and characterized by subarachnoid blood predominantly around the mesencephalon without any vascular pathology or any other source of bleeding \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. The typical CT pattern of P-NSAH has been described by Rinkel _et al_ . as follows: 1) subarachnoid blood around the mesencephalon, with possible extension to the posterior part of the interhemispheric fissure without complete filling of the fissure; 2) extension of the subarachnoid blood to the basal part of the sylvian cistern; 3) minimal sedimentation of intraventricular blood; 4) absence of intraventricular blood \\[ 8 \\]. While both arterial and venous origins have been postulated as the source of hemorrhage, the precise etiology of P-NSAH remains enigmatic despite extensive diagnostic investigation \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. A non-arterial origin has been proposed in the literature due to infrequent loss of consciousness, lack of blood in the brain parenchyma or ventricular system, and low incidence of vasospasm and hydrocephalus. Furthermore, accumulation of subarachnoid blood around the brainstem has drawn the attention of investigators to variations of the perimesencephalic and deep cerebral veins \\[ 8 \\]. Typically, blood is found in the interpeduncular, crural and ambient cisterns, all of which have a close relationship with the BVR.\n\n【36】A growing body of evidence has supported the role of anatomic variations of this vein as a critical contributor to P-NSAH pathogenesis \\[ 9 – 12 \\]. Watanabe _et al._ studied the relationship between P-NSAH and variations of deep cerebral veins in particular BVR and classified the venous drainage of BVR into three types \\[ 12 \\]. Type A is the normal continuous pattern, in which the BVR is continuous with the deep middle cerebral vein and drains mainly to the vein of Galen (VG). Type B is a normal discontinuous pattern with drainage anterior to uncal veins and posterior to VG. Type C is a primitive variant with drainage to other veins but not to the VG. In a study by Watanabe _et al._ , Type C variants of the BVR on one or both sides were identified in all patients with P-NSAH . Moreover, the Type C pattern was found much more frequently in patients with P-NSAH than in patients with aneurysmal SAH \\[ 12 \\]. Similar findings have been later reported by different groups \\[ 9 – 11 \\]. In these studies, in addition to Type C, Type B also was found to be associated with P-NSAH more frequently than SAH \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. All venograms of our two patients have been retrospectively reviewed by two separate neuroradiologists who confirmed the presence of a Type C variant on the left side in patient 1 and a Type B variant on the right side in patient 2. Both patients had Type A on the contralateral side (Figures 2 D, 2 E and 4 C, 4 D).\n\n【37】A series of reports have highlighted the critical role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of aneurysmal SAH \\[ 4 – 7 , 13 \\]. A large population-based study by Bor _et al._ revealed that people with two first-degree relatives affected with SAH have a higher risk of SAH in comparison with individuals with just one affected first-degree relative \\[ 4 \\]. Furthermore, Bromberg _et al._ have shown that the SAH occurrence in first-degree relatives is up to seven times greater than in second-degree relatives \\[ 13 \\]. It is suggested that the first-degree relatives of patients with aneurysmal SAH are at a higher risk of bleeding than the general population, similar results for NSAH have not been reported however \\[ 4 , 5 , 13 \\].\n\n【38】Although the etiology of NSAH has not been determined, some risk factors for NSAH have been defined, such as: female sex, arterial hypertension, smoking, and excessive use of alcohol \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. There are only two case reports describing an association between the familial predisposition of venous system variants and NSAH in the literature \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Type C variant of the BVR has been reported in two first-degree relatives with P-NSAH \\[ 7 \\] (Table 1 ); however, three siblings with NSAH (one with nP-NSAH, two of them with P-NSAH) have been described with no report of BVR variant \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【39】**Table 1 **Spontaneous perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage in siblings****\n\n【40】Full size table\n\n【41】Our report is the second familial occurrence of P-NSAH in two siblings with Type B and Type C BVR variants.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【43】In a concise manner, our report together with the previous reports \\[ 6 , 7 \\] suggest that a positive family history in first-degree relatives of P-NSAH accounts for higher risk of P-NSAH. Further investigation, however, is necessary to illuminate the precise role of familial inheritance in pathogenesis.

The virulent strains K1 and K2 are recognized to cause a new invasive syndrome with metastatic infection \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for the development of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ liver abscess (KLA). Poor glycemic control results in a worse prognosis and complications including sight-threatening endophthalmitis \\[ 3 \\]. We report the first case of KLA in Sri Lanka.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 63-year-old Sinhalese man with diabetes mellitus of 8 years’ duration presented with fever, loose stools, and loss of appetite of 1 week’s duration. He was on diet control for diabetes with poor glycemic control and was not on a proper follow up. On admission he was ill and febrile. An abdominal examination revealed hepatomegaly, 2 cm from right costal margin, which was non-tender. Other systemic examination was unremarkable. An ophthalmoscope examination revealed non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A full blood count revealed white cell count of 18 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with neutrophil predominance. His hemoglobin was 12.2 g/dL and platelet count was 256 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L initially and dropped up to 9.8 g/dl and 63 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, respectively. Blood film showed severe bacterial infection with sepsis and features suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A coagulation profile showed international normalized ratio of 1.7 and activated partial thromboplastin time of 37 seconds. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm/first hour. His C-reactive protein level was 197 mg/dL and his procalcitonin level was 59.9 ng/L. Consecutive blood cultures were positive for _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ after 9 and 13 hours. The strain was sensitive to imipenem, meropenem, ceftriaxone, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. A chest radiograph was normal. Retroviral screening was negative. His fasting blood sugar level was 212 mg/dl. A urine full report showed proteinuria (++) with 3–5 pus cells per high power field and the urine culture was negative. Stool examination was negative for amoebae, ova, or cysts. His initial serum creatinine level was 134 microgram/L and increased up to 647 microgram/L reflecting acute kidney injury. His urine output was satisfactory throughout the course. Serum potassium went up to 6.1 mmol/L and was managed medically. An ultrasound scan of his abdomen revealed a large ill-defined hypoechoic lesion suggestive of a liver abscess in the right lobe of his liver, at segments VII and VIII, measuring 8 × 6 × 5.5 cm in size (Fig. 1 ). Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal. The abscess was aspirated once by the interventional radiology team under ultrasound guidance yielding 100 ml of thick pus. He was treated with intravenously administered ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and a marked clinical and biochemical improvement was seen. His serum creatinine returned to upper normal limit following resolution of sepsis. A repeat ultrasonography performed at completion of intravenous antibiotic therapy revealed resolving abscess in segment VIII of his liver measuring 5 × 4 × 3.2 cm. As there was considerable clinical and biochemical improvement, he was discharged with a further course of orally administered cefixime and did not require further aspirations.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Liver abscess in the right lobe of the liver\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】A liver abscess is a potentially life-threatening infection. Common causes predisposing to occurrence of liver abscess include biliary disease, malignancies of gastrointestinal tract, and pylephlebitis \\[ 4 \\]. It is commonly a polymicrobial infection and the common causative organisms well documented in the literature include _Escherichia coli_ , streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobes \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. But currently there is an emerging trend of primary liver abscess caused by _Klebsiella_ pneumonia.\n\n【18】_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is a Gram-negative bacillus belonging to the genus _Klebsiella_ . It is an important nosocomial pathogen and is mostly associated with respiratory and urinary tract infections \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【19】Primary liver abscess due to _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ was first described in the literature in 1986 in Taiwan \\[ 9 \\]. A recent alarming incidence of a new syndrome due to K1 and K2 serotypes of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is reported, mainly in Taiwan \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The cause for the predominance of cases in Southeast Asia is not currently understood and a genetic predisposition is still not proven. However a high fecal carriage of virulent K1 _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ST23 strains was demonstrated in individuals of Southeast Asia and may explain the higher incidence \\[ 10 \\]. Intestinal colonization with virulent strains has been shown to be highly associated with development of KLA \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【20】This genotype, which is strongly associated with highly invasive disease in Taiwan, has also been reported in three continents denoting its widespread geographic existence \\[ 12 \\]. KLA is currently recognized as an emerging infection and an important cause of sight-threatening endophthalmitis in a number of countries worldwide \\[ 2 , 13 \\].\n\n【21】Patients with diabetes are more prone to develop KLA and related septicemic complications. Also, regardless of etiology, they have longer periods of fever after treatment and prolonged hospital stay \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. Poor glycemic control impairs the phagocytosis of K1/K2 _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ . Thus poorly controlled diabetes increases the susceptibility to K1/K2 _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ infections and related liver abscess and complicated endophthalmitis \\[ 3 \\]. Also KLA has been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer, particularly in the sigmoid colon and rectum, in the Eastern Asian male population \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【22】The _rmpA_ gene of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ , Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score ≥ 2, and septic shock were found to be statistically significant predictors of metastatic infection due to KLA. The predictors of mortality due to KLA include metastatic infection, severity of infection, septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and gas formation in radiography \\[ 17 \\]. Molecular analysis and virulence studies have revealed phagocytic resistance associated with K1 serotype and hypervirulence associated with the aerobactin gene \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【23】Numerous extrahepatic complications of KLA reported in the literature include meningitis, bacteremia with multiple metastatic abscess formations, epidural abscess formation, necrotizing fasciitis, septic arthritis, and septic pulmonary embolism \\[ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 \\]. Of these, sight-threatening endophthalmitis has been commonly reported \\[ 23 \\]. Diabetes is a significant risk factor for development of endophthalmitis and predicts a poor visual outcome \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【24】Diagnosis of KLA is made based on culture evidence and radiography. On computed tomography the features that suggest KLA include single abscess, unilobar (commonly right) involvement, and solid or multiloculated appearance \\[ 25 \\].\n\n【25】Third generation cephalosporins are the preferred choice of treatment in KLA. Pigtail catheter drainage is shown to be protective against metastatic infection and mortality. Treatment with first generation cephalosporins and percutaneous drainage has been found to be associated with low mortality rates, metastatic infection and complications, showing comparable rates to treatment with third generation cephalosporins \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【26】In Sri Lanka, one case of a 14-year-old girl has been previously reported with pyogenic liver abscess due to _Klebsiella_ species \\[ 26 \\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ causing pyogenic liver abscess in Sri Lanka.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】Considering the reported rise of KLA according to recent literature and its preponderance to occur in Southeast Asian countries, it is worthwhile to suspect _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ as an etiological agent in cases of liver abscess in Sri Lanka. Early clinical suspicion mainly in patients with diabetes can lead to early intervention, institution of appropriate therapy, and minimize complications.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】APACHE:\n\n【31】Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation\n\n【32】DIC:\n\n【33】Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n【34】KLA:\n\n【35】_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ liver abscess", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

They occur most commonly at the carotid bifurcation, where they are known as carotid body tumors. Most paragangliomas are benign, locally aggressive, infiltrative tumors. Approximately 10% of patients with paragangliomas develop distant metastases, 10% present with multiple or bilateral tumors (mostly carotid body tumors), and 10% have a family history of paragangliomas. The malignant transformation of carotid body tumors has been reported in 6% of cases.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 64 year-old Caucasian woman with a gigantic glomic tumor mass in the neck. Twenty years before the consultation, the patient had undergone an unsuccessful attempt to remove the mass. Over the last 3 years, the patient had felt enlargement of the mass at an increased rate, almost doubling the prior size. Angio magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 c m of the trachea. Due to the change in the tumor behavior, the maxillofacial team at Ruber International Hospital decided to remove the tumor surgically after embolization. During the surgery the tumor was gently dissected from the carotid an removed from the carotid bifurcation uneventfully. Two small nodes adhering tightly to the internal carotid adventitia and the posterior torn hole were left in place to avoid any potentially life-threatening complications. The final biopsy confirmed the initial diagnosis of carotid body paraganglioma and showed a Ki-67 expression of 19%. Due to the aggressive growth behavior and high Ki-67 expression of the tumor, the patient was referred to the CyberKnife Unit of Ruber International Hospital for treatment of the remaining nodes.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The management of cervical paragangliomas is difficult and remains a challenge. Although the likelihood of tumor control is high with surgical or radiotherapeutic treatments, we currently lack consensus regarding the best treatment option. Nevertheless, in selected complex cases, such as the case we present, the combination of surgery and radiosurgery may allow complete local tumor control with minimal morbidity.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Paragangliomas are rare vascular neuroendocrine tumors that develop in the extra-adrenal paraganglion tissue. They represent less than 0.5% of all head and neck tumors. In the head and neck, paragangliomas are named after their site of origin. They occur most commonly at the carotid bifurcation, where they are known as carotid body tumors. Additional sites of origin include the jugular bulb (jugular paraganglioma), the vagus nerve (vagal paraganglioma), and within the middle ear mucosa (tympanic paraganglioma) \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】These tumors grow slowly, and they are reported to have a median doubling time of 4.2 years. Without therapy, they may grow to a considerable size and become life threatening.\n\n【11】Most paragangliomas are benign, locally aggressive, infiltrative tumors. Approximately 10% of patients with paragangliomas develop distant metastases, 10% present with multiple or bilateral tumors (mostly carotid body tumors), and 10% have a family history of paragangliomas. The malignant transformation of carotid body tumors has been reported in 6% of cases \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【12】The clinical signs and symptoms of benign and malignant paragangliomas overlap significantly. Most lesions produce local compressive symptoms including hearing loss, otalgia, tinnitus, neck mass, or cranial neuropathy. Cranial neuropathy can lead to dysphagia, facial weakness, and vocal fold paresis. A small proportion of head and neck paragangliomas may also show biochemical activity similar to that of pheochromocytomas, possibly inducing symptoms of diarrhea, hypertension, and flushing \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【13】The diagnosis of paragangliomas is generally based on radiological appearance because biopsy is challenging due to the anatomical location and vascularity. The literature contains little information about the specific clinical behavior of malignant paragangliomas that would help to distinguish them from benign lesions prior to therapy. Furthermore, the diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma is problematic and often relies on final pathological results \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【14】Several of these tumors are inherited through mutations of the genes that encode for the succinate dehydrogenase enzymes SDHD and SDHB. Although the inheritance of both genes is autosomal dominant, the SDHD gene is subject to maternal imprinting, and the SDHB gene has incomplete penetrance. Patients with the inherited gene almost invariably have multiple tumors \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【15】Three treatment options are currently recognized: surgical resection, radiation therapy, and a wait-and-scan policy. Of these, surgery is the only curative treatment. However, because surgery may be complicated by significant morbidity, especially in larger tumors, it is considered by some authors to be controversial.\n\n【16】Here, we present the case of a giant paraganglioma body tumor treated with a combined surgical and radiotherapeutic (CyberKnife) protocol. This case report review has been approved by the Ethics Committee at the Ruber International Hospital.\n\n【17】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【18】A 64-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our office for the assessment of a gigantic left neck mass (Fig. 1 ). The patient reported that she had started to feel a paratracheal node 34 years previously, and that it had grown progressively during the subsequent three decades. She had undergone an operation in the area 24 years previously, although the surgery had to be terminated due to massive bleeding from the mass. During surgery, the mass was diagnosed as most likely a glomus tumor. No further surgeries to remove the mass were attempted, and it had been allowed to grow steadily.\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Preoperative image shows the large mass protruding in the left side of the neck\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】In May 2013, the patient was referred elsewhere for further study of the mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hypervascularized mass with a maximum diameter of 4 cm located at the bifurcation of the left carotid artery and causing the forward displacement of the external carotid artery and the backward displacement of the internal carotid artery. The patient refused surgery at that time and remained asymptomatic for almost 3 years. She then decided to consult a physician again due to the enlargement of the mass, which caused discomfort and mild compression symptoms when swallowing.\n\n【24】In 2016, angio MRI (Fig. 2 ) showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 cm of the trachea. The mass was pulsatile and slightly painful. No Horner syndrome or Hering–Breuer reflex was noted. A carotid occlusion test and a complete angiography were also performed, and these confirmed the permeability of the Willis polygon and the diagnosis of the mass.\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**A** Angio MRI image showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 cm to the right side the trachea. **B** Coronal axial vascular MRI showing the same paratracheal mass on the left cervical side involving the carotid bifurcation\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Due to the change in the behavior of the tumor, which had doubled in size within 3 years after remaining relatively stable for almost three decades, the size of the tumor, which had started causing compression symptoms, and the Shamblin grade II classification, the maxillofacial team at Ruber International Hospital decided to remove the tumor surgically after embolization.\n\n【30】The surgery was performed in February 2016. The tumor was approached through a wide cervical exposure after identifying the primitive carotid artery (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【31】**Fig. 3**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】Neck mass appearance at the beginning of the dissection\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】The tumor was gently dissected from the carotid bifurcation in a subadventitial plane (Fig. 4 ), with great emphasis placed on maintaining hemostasis.\n\n【36】**Fig. 4**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Paraganglioma showing its relationship to the carotid glomus\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】The surgeons would like to note that a partially blunt Freer periostotome is the best tool to use in high-risk areas. The vagal nerve was readily identified and separated from the mass. The hypoglossal nerve and major neck vessels were also preserved (Fig. 5 A, B). The mass was then removed from the bifurcation uneventfully. Two small nodes adhering tightly to the internal carotid adventitia and the posterior torn hole were left in place to avoid any potentially life-threatening complication.\n\n【41】**Fig. 5**\n\n【42】 \n\n【43】**A** Surgical field following paraganglioma removal. The great displacement of the internal and the external carotid arteries at the glomus due to the progressive enlarging mass protrusion of the paraganglioma can be noted. **B** Surgical specimen\n\n【44】Full size image\n\n【45】The postoperative phase was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 6 days after the surgery with moderate hoarseness, which was resolved within 1 month. The final biopsy confirmed the initial diagnosis of carotid body paraganglioma and showed a Ki-67 expression of 19%.\n\n【46】Due to the aggressive growth behavior and high Ki-67 expression of the tumor, the patient was referred to the CyberKnife Unit of Ruber International Hospital for treatment of the remaining nodes. A thermoplastic mask was made to ensure that the patient remained immobilized during the treatment. A T2 MRI and computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast were performed to locate the above-mentioned remaining nodes of the paraganglioma. The treatment was performed separately in each affected area on two consecutive days. A coverage dose of 14 Gy and an isodose of 83% were administered using 5- and 7.5-mm collimators. The maximum dose used was 16.87 Gy. The medullary canal received a dose of less than 4 Gy, and the left VII and VIII nerves received a dose of less than 5 Gy (Fig. 6 ). The treatment course was uneventful, and no complication occurred during or after treatment.\n\n【47】**Fig. 6**\n\n【48】 \n\n【49】CyberKnife planning: Coverage dose of 14 Gy and an isodose of 83% were administered using 5- and 7.5-mm collimators.

No recurrence has been detected\n\n【55】Full size image\n\n【56】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【57】The carotid body tumor is the most common type of paraganglioma in the head and neck, and is the only pathology to affect the carotid body \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Carotid body tumors may be sporadic or familial; the sporadic form is slightly more common in women \\[ 3 , 10 , 11 \\]. These tumors often present as slow-growing, non-tender neck masses located just anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the thyroid \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【58】The differential diagnosis includes cervical lymphadenopathy, carotid artery aneurysm, brachial cleft cyst, laryngeal carcinoma, and metastatic tumor. Carotid body tumors are typically mobile in the lateral plane but have restricted mobility in the cephalocaudal direction (Fontaine sign). Occasionally, such tumors may transmit the carotid pulse or demonstrate a bruit or thrill. Due to the close proximity to the carotid vessels and cranial nerves X–XII, tumor enlargement may cause progressive neurological symptoms, such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or hoarseness \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【59】Histologically, carotid body tumors resemble the normal architecture of the carotid body. The tumors are highly vascular and contain clusters of tumor cells between the capillaries, producing the pseudoalveolar pattern of Zellballen (cell balls) \\[ 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 \\]. These cells have fine-grained eosinophilic cytoplasm and small round or oval nuclei. The malignant potential of these tumors cannot be predicted by histological studies. The diagnosis of malignancy is based on the invasion of lymph nodes, vessels, nerves, the airway, or the base of the skull, rather than on tumor size or histological features \\[ 9 \\]. Chapman _et al._ \\[ 4 \\] recently suggested that pain, a rapidly enlarging neck mass, and younger age are predictive factors of underlying malignancy, which should prompt the consideration of an aggressive diagnostic and management approach.\n\n【60】Contrast CT and MRI \\[ 9 \\] have evolved as effective noninvasive imaging modalities for the detection of carotid body tumors. They commonly demonstrate tumor blood supply and the widening of the carotid bifurcation by a well-defined tumor blush (Lyre sign), which is a classic pathognomonic contrast angiographic finding. Carotid angiography also plays an important role in the evaluation and management of these tumors. Angiography demonstrates the vascular extent of the tumor, carotid artery involvement, the size and location of tumor-feeding vessels (useful for evaluating the possibility of tumor embolization), and coexisting atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries.\n\n【61】The management of carotid body tumors has been controversial because of their low malignant potential and high rates of operative complications. Early experiences with carotid body tumor resections were associated with operative mortality rates ranging from 5% to 13%, postoperative cranial nerve palsy in 32–44% of patients, and other postoperative neurological complications in 8–20% of patients. However, most recent experiences have demonstrated the safety of the surgical approach, with mortality rates of 1–2% but a high (40%) morbidity rate due to cranial nerve injury and cerebral ischemic events \\[ 12 \\]. Surgical treatment has been the standard approach to symptomatic carotid body tumors for many years and has shown high cure rates \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【62】The size of a carotid body tumor is a very important consideration in the development of a treatment strategy. As in the case reported here, tumors larger than 4–5 cm tend to show partial or complete encirclement of the carotid arteries. Larger tumors have been associated with higher risks of bleeding and cranial nerve injury during surgery. Preoperative tumor embolization has been employed to reduce tumor size and thereby decrease the risk of complications. The Shamblin classification system (Table 1 ), which is based on tumor size, was proposed in 1971. According to this classification, group I tumors are relatively small and minimally attached to carotid vessels; the surgical excision of these tumors is not difficult. Group II tumors, including the case reported here, are large and show moderate attachment to the carotid vessels; these tumors are amenable to careful surgical excision. Group III tumors are very large and encase the carotid vessels; these tumors often require arterial resection and grafting \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【63】**Table 1 Shamblin classification of carotid body paraganglioma. Shamblin, 1971 \\[ 13 \\]**\n\n【64】Full size table\n\n【65】As previously described, a thorough subadventitial dissection with proximal control of the primitive carotid artery and the early identification and dissection of the cranial nerves (mainly the vagal and hypoglossal nerves) help to prevent much of the morbidity related to the surgical excision.\n\n【66】Recent studies have reported on the use of radiotherapy as the first-choice treatment for paragangliomas \\[ 14 \\]. The main arguments in favor of this treatment are that it is less invasive than surgery, has fewer complications, and achieves high rates of local control. Hinerman and colleagues \\[ 14 \\] reported a 96–100% tumor control rate in cervical paragangliomas after radiation therapy using a dose of 45 Gy. However, the cure criterion for radiotherapy, which is growth cessation rather than disappearance, is difficult to evaluate \\[ 15 \\]. Thus, in gigantic tumors such as the one presented here, radiotherapy may stop growth but will not reduce the tumor mass. In such cases, compression symptoms may not worsen but will not disappear.\n\n【67】Further complications of radiation therapy may include inflammation of the external auditory canal and middle ear, osteoradionecrosis, cranial nerve neuropathies, and direct injury to brain tissue. Furthermore, it must be remembered that surgery will be more difficult if radiation therapy fails \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【68】Histological examination has shown that the chief cells are minimally affected by radiation; rather, the distinctive vascular structure of the tumor is replaced by fibrous connective tissue \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. This development is of concern in potentially malignant tumors, which have been reported in 3–5% of cases. In our case, we used the predictive factors of Chapman _et al._ \\[ 4 \\] to consider the possibility of malignant transformation of the chemodectoma. Given the wide experience of the surgical team with this type of tumor, surgical excision was selected as the primary treatment option.\n\n【69】Radiosurgery has arisen as a promising approach to the management of paragangliomas, especially glomus jugular tumors. Radiosurgery provides a high degree of accuracy, exquisite precision, and rapid radiation-dose falloff at the peripheries of the target lesions, allowing the clinician to deliver a high radiation dose to neoplastic tissue while sparing healthy brain tissue. This treatment is also relatively noninvasive and can be performed as an outpatient procedure \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\].\n\n【70】In the case reported here, a preoperative goal of zero morbidity was defined according to the patient’s desires. Therefore, although the tumor resection was practically completed, we did not attempt to remove the nodes adhering most strongly to the skull base and internal carotid artery to avoid taking any further risks. Thus, gamma-knife radiosurgery was crucial to ensure effective local disease control with minimal morbidity.\n\n【71】In summary, the management of cervical paragangliomas is difficult and remains a challenge. Treatment must be individualized, taking into account the patient’s age, tumor site and size, multicentricity, and preexisting cranial nerve deficits. Although the likelihood of tumor control is high with surgical or radiotherapeutic treatments, we currently lack consensus regarding the best treatment option. Nevertheless, in selected complex cases, the combination of surgery and radiosurgery may allow complete local tumor control with minimal morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The tumor histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with infiltration of the serosa and pathological TNM staging of pT4pN1M0.\n\n【12】A follow-up CT examination three months later revealed eight focal hepatic lesions distributed throughout both lobes. Chemotherapy treatment with the folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) scheme was started, and the patient showed a partial response after the fourth course of treatment. She underwent surgical resection of metastases localized at hepatic segments IV and V. CT examination showed disease progression in the lung and liver parenchyma six months later. Several lines of treatment were started, including XELOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin), FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan) and radiofrequency thermoablation, with no response. CT showed a partial hepatic response after 12 courses of cetuximab and irinotecan therapy, but hepatic progression was observed after 24 courses. Therefore, chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) and FOLFOX was started, but it was suspended after nine cycles as the patient developed left hemiparesis, hemifacial left anesthesia and right-hand paresthesia.\n\n【13】A brain MRI scan showed three millimetric lesions located in the right temporooccipital lobe (Figure 1A ), the left pontine region (Figure 2B ) and the right parietal lobe (Figure 2C ) with restricted diffusion (Figures 1A to 1C ) and no enhancement after gadodiamide injection. These findings, that is, hyperintensity on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, slight enhancement on postgadolinium T1-weighted images, restricted diffusion and no contrast enhancement, were suggestive of areas of acute microischemic strokes. Although unusual in the context of stroke, the subcortical lesion at the level of the right temporooccipital white matter was confirmed to be unchanged with regard to size and signal intensity on FLAIR images obtained at the one-year follow-up examination (Figure 3 ). Moreover, other bilateral centrum semiovale lesions not detected on diffusion-weighted images and not showing contrast enhancement were hypointense with a hyperintense gliotic peripheral ring visualized on FLAIR images, suggestive of areas of chronic microischemic origin (Figure 2D ). These lesions appeared as millimetric spots of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images obtained at the one-year follow-up examination. No other risk factors for thromboembolic events were recognized: the patient's clinical history was negative for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, atrial fibrillation, heart disease, atrial or ventricular septal defects and previous episodes of thrombosis or symptoms correlated to thrombosis. Her pharmacological history was negative for anticoagulant or procoagulant drugs. Her platelets were 161 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL (normal range, 150 to 450), her International Normalized Ratio was 1.08 (normal range, 0.85 to 1.16) and her activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was 0.84 (normal range, 0.82 to 1.20).\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**(A) Right temporooccipital lesion can be easily detected as a hyperintense spot in T1-weighted sequences** . **(B)** The lesion shows restricted diffusion, an absence of perilesional edema. **(C)** No enhancement is observed after gadodiamide injection.

In addition, the patient's electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal.\n\n【27】Low-molecular-weight heparin (6,000 IU twice daily), edema therapy (8 mg of dexamethasone twice daily) and antiplatelet therapy (200 mg/day aspirin) were administered, resulting in complete resolution of the patient's neurological symptoms.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Bevacizumab, a humanized antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that is used as an angiogenesis inhibitor, has been examined in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in several clinical trials in patients with advanced colorectal cancer \\[ 1 \\], even as a first-line treatment \\[ 2 \\]. The addition of bevacizumab increased the overall response rate and extended median survival. In the past four years, bevacizumab has been used with increasing frequency for the treatment of other neoplasms, such as breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【30】Several adverse events have been associated with the use of bevacizumab: hypertension (the most common side effect), gastrointestinal perforation, wound-healing complications, hemorrhage, arterial thomboembolic events, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, leukopenia and diarrhea \\[ 3 \\]. Arterial thromboembolic events have been observed in 0.9% of the cases in the BEATrial \\[ 3 \\] and in 2.1% of the cases in the BRiTE Registry \\[ 4 \\]. The mechanism of concurrent thrombosis and bleeding during bevacizumab treatment is not clear, being related to the role of VEGF in maintaining a healthy endothelium.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】Vascular events involving the central nervous system have been reported as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome following a bevacizumab or FOLFIRI treatment regimen for metastatic colon cancer, which are likely related to high systolic blood pressure levels \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, as thromboembolic events and microischemic phenomena are a well-known complication of bevacizumab chemotherapeutic treatment \\[ 6 \\], the occurrence of neurological focal symptoms leads to an MRI-based differential diagnosis between focal parenchymal metastases and microischemic phenomena, which lead to crucial decisions for patient management.\n\n【33】Consent\n-------\n\n【34】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification system categorizes PTLD into six different categories: infectious mononucleosis PTLD, plasmacytic hyperplasia PTLD, florid follicular hyperplasia PTLD, polymorphic PTLD, monomorphic PTLD arising from B and T/natural killer (NK) T cell types, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD \\[ 1 \\]. Approximately 90–95% of cases of PTLD are attributable to the B cell lineage while the remaining 5–10% are T/NK cell or Hodgkin lymphoma. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of PTLD as most recipients of a transplant are on chronic immunosuppressants which lead to inhibition of T cell function. The inhibition of T cell function favors the proliferation of EBV. The incidence of PTLD in patients post solid organ transplant and HSCT is approximately 20% and 4%, respectively \\[ 2 \\]. The most frequent incidence of PTLD is seen in intestinal and multi-organ transplant recipients (5–20%), followed by heart and lung transplants (2–10%), and then by liver and kidney transplants (1–5%) \\[ 2 \\]. Prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) falls into the monomorphic PTLD subtype. PLL is a rare lymphocytic disorder which accounts for only 2% of all mature lymphocytic leukemias in adults over the age of 30 \\[ 3 \\]. It can be further categorized into T and B cell subtypes with differing laboratory and clinical manifestations. T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive mature post thymic leukemia with an unfavorable prognosis. It is a very rare disease and was first described in 1973 \\[ 4 \\]. Patients diagnosed as having T-PLL typically have systemic manifestations at diagnosis such as hepatosplenomegaly, widespread lymphadenopathies, and skin infiltrates \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 59-year-old man of Chinese ethnicity presented to our hematology unit with headache, lethargy, and exertional dyspnea for the past 1 month. He underwent an uneventful cadaveric renal transplant 20 years ago for chronic glomerulonephritis-induced end-stage renal disease. He had been on long-term immunosuppressants since then consisting of orally administered prednisolone 10 mg daily and orally administered cyclosporine A 50 mg twice daily. He is married with four children. He had no significant family history. He did not smoke tobacco and did not drink alcohol. He works as a contractor with a construction company.\n\n【12】On examination, he was pale. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. He had a palpable liver and spleen of 3 cm. There were no palpable lymph nodes. The renal graft was palpable and of normal size.\n\n【13】His complete blood count revealed normochromic normocytic anemia of 7.4 g/dL with leukocytosis of 54 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (predominantly lymphocytosis) and a normal platelet count of 202 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. The other laboratory parameters on presentation are tabulated in Table 1 .\n\n【14】**Table 1 Shows the laboratory parameters and their values**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】A peripheral blood film revealed a leukoerythroblastic picture with presence of abnormal mononuclear cells. A bone marrow smear (Fig. 1 ) showed a markedly hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltrates of abnormal lymphoid cells which were pleomorphic, moderate to large in size, and contained multiple coarse chromocenters in convoluted nuclei with irregular nuclear outline and scanty cytoplasm. The trephine (Fig. 2 ) was consistent with T-PLL.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】The bone marrow smear shows a markedly hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltrates of abnormal lymphoid cells which are pleomorphic, moderate to large in size, contain multiple coarse chromocenters in convoluted nuclei with irregular nuclear outline and scanty cytoplasm\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Bone marrow trephine biopsy shows infiltrate which is in an interstitial distribution\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Marrow flow cytometry analysis showed 25% abnormal population of cells expressing CD2, CD3, CD7, CD52, and TCL-1. The cell population was negative for CD4, CD8, CD25, CD56, CD57, CD94, and cMPO.\n\n【26】In view of the bone marrow and flow cytometry findings, he was diagnosed as having T-PLL which is an aggressive form of a lymphoproliferative disorder.\n\n【27】He was treated with one cycle of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy to which he failed to respond.\n\n【28】He was then started on orally administered venetoclax daily. Since he has a renal graft, the option of anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) therapy was not suitable due to the risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) activation and the renal toxicity of ganciclovir.\n\n【29】Subsequently, on day 15 of orally administered venetoclax, he developed severe auto tumor lysis syndrome which required mechanical ventilation and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. His white cell count progressed to 174 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, predominantly lymphocytosis. He died 2 days later at our intensive care unit.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】PTLD is known to occur post solid organ transplant or HSCT. It was first described in recipients of renal transplant in the year of 1968 by Doak _et al._ and the term PTLD was first coined in 1984 by Starzl _et al_ . \\[ 6 \\]. The higher incidence of PTLD seen in haploidentical stem cell transplant and solid organ transplant involving intestine, multiple organs, heart, and lung could be explained by histo-incompatibility and the amount of lymphoid tissue present in the grafts. Grafts containing a substantial amount of lymphoid tissues, such as the small intestine, can result in transfer of potentially EBV-infected donor lymphocytes which may drive the development of PTLD \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【32】In our case, we described a very aggressive course of T-PLL which occurred as a T cell type monomorphic PTLD in a patient who was on chronic usage of immunosuppressants post renal transplant. T-PLL primarily affects older individuals with an average age of 65 years at presentation with a slight male predominance \\[ 8 \\]. In T-PLL, there is usually marked lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood which is often more than 100 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with most of them being prolymphocytes. Renal function, including calcium levels, is normal; liver function tests may show a mild impairment. Hyperuricemia and a slightly raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are common features \\[ 9 \\]. Frequently, human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and II serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are negative \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【33】T-PLL consists of prolymphocytes which are medium sized and often contain a single nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm with occasional projections \\[ 10 \\]. The nuclei are usually round to oval in shape, with some patients having cells with a more irregular nuclear outline that are similar to the cerebriform nuclear shape seen in Sézary syndrome \\[ 10 \\]. Bone marrow trephine biopsies usually reveal infiltrate which is interstitial and nodular with an intertrabecular distribution \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【34】On immunophenotyping, the cells show positivity for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, and CD 52 staining. The CD7 intensity is strong in contrast to other mature T cell malignancies, where this marker may be weak or negative. CD4 and CD8 can be co-expressed in 21% of cases and CD8 alone in 13% of cases \\[ 12 \\]. The most specific markers for T-PLL by flow cytometry are CD26 and TCL-1 protein expression, which are not detected in the other mature T cell leukemia/lymphomas \\[ 13 \\]. The overexpression of the oncogene _TCL1_ is useful for detecting residual T-PLL in bone marrow sections after therapy \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【35】T-PLL is characterized by complex cytogenetic abnormalities, which may explain the aggressive nature of this disease. Recurrent changes mainly affect chromosomes 14, 8, 11, and X \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【36】Abnormalities of chromosome 8 are seen in approximately 75% of patients, including idic(8p11), t(8;8)(p11-12;q12), and trisomy 8 \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【37】In 80% of patients, the cytogenetics reveal inversion of chromosome 14 \\[inv14(q11;q32)\\] and in 10% translocation t(14)(q11;q32) inducing activation of the _TCL1_ oncogene \\[ 15 \\]. The expression of the _MTCP1_ gene which has homologies with _TCL1_ has been reported in rare cases of T-PLL \\[ 16 \\]. Activation of _TCL1_ appears to be the initiator of T-PLL oncogenesis.\n\n【38】T-PLL is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Approximately one third of the patients respond to CHOP chemotherapy. The disease eventually recurs in all of these patients \\[ 17 \\]. The prognosis is poor for those with bulky disease but the average survival has increased by 2 years due to the availability of anti-CD52 which is alemtuzumab. The best responses have been seen with alemtuzumab, but responses are still transient and further disease progression is inevitable \\[ 18 \\]. Alemtuzumab may result in reactivation of CMV infection and the usage of ganciclovir to treat CMV is potentially nephrotoxic in a patient with a renal graft.\n\n【39】Allogenic stem cell transplantation should be considered in younger patients who have responded to their initial therapy, as this disease tends to progress. There is a possibility of long-term cure by potentially harnessing a graft-versus-leukemia effect \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【40】A research group led by hemato-oncologist Philipp Staber, from the Medical University of Vienna’s Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, and biochemist Stefan Kubicek, from the Research Center for Molecular Medicine, found that venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor) is useful in T-PLL. The protein BCL-2 is imperative for the survival of T-PLL cells. Besides that, venetoclax has minimal adverse effects.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【42】PTLD T-PLL is a very rare disease and it can be easily missed by practicing physicians. The place of immunophenotyping in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder is of significant importance. More research needs to be carried out to further comprehend the pathophysiology and treatment modalities for this disorder.\n\n【43】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Pseudohallucinations have been described as the patient being aware of the nonreality of hallucination-like phenomena. Data on pseudohallucinations of cerebral somatic origin are sparse. We present a case of auditory and visual pseudohallucinations due to superficial siderosis. Siderosis was diagnosed using cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging as part of the clinical routine for newly emerged psychiatric symptoms.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An 84-year-old white/european female presented to our hospital with no prior history of psychiatric or neurological disease and no history of trauma. She reported seeing things and hearing voices singing to her for some days. She was aware these phenomena were not real (pseudohallucinations). On examination, no relevant abnormalities were detected. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated ferritin. Magnetic resonance imaging with susceptibility-weighted sequences revealed diffuse superficial siderosis in several parts of the brain, among other occipital and temporal gyri. The pseudohallucinations resolved with a risperidone regime. The patient was treated with rivaroxaban because of atrial fibrillation. Potentially elevating the risk of further hemorrhage, this therapy was discontinued, and an atrial appendage occlusion device was implanted.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We report the first case of pseudohallucinations in superficial siderosis. The risk of missing this diagnosis can be reduced by applying a standardized diagnostic pathway for patients presenting with the first episode of psychiatric symptoms.

Hemosiderin is deposited on brain or spinal cord surfaces and is thought to cause clinical symptoms that usually consist of cranial nerve dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, or myelopathy \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】Pseudohallucinations have been described as the patient being aware of the nonreality of hallucination-like phenomena \\[ 2 \\]. Data on pseudohallucinations of cerebral somatic origin are sparse. A known cause of visual pseudohallucinations in elderly patients is severely impaired vision (that is, due to ophthalmologic disease such as Charles Bonnet syndrome). Patients can also develop this syndrome following occipital cerebral ischemic stroke or cardiac surgery \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【11】We present the case of an 84-year-old female who presented with auditory and visual pseudohallucinations due to superficial siderosis.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】An 84-year-old white/european female presented to the hospital’s emergency department complaining of seeing people who were not present in the room and of hearing voices singing to her. The symptoms started acutely several days prior. She was aware that the phenomena were not real. It was her first ever episode. She did not have a history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. She had a medical history of ankylosing spondylitis, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and coronary heart disease. In the past, surgery was performed on her right eye because of glaucoma, and she underwent implantation of a biological heart valve in the aortic position. Her prescribed medication comprised rivaroxaban (in adequate dose), spironolactone, torasemide, bisoprolol, irbesartan, amlodipine, simvastatin, ezetimibe, and brinzolamide/timolol eye drops, as well as moisturizing eye drops.\n\n【14】Initial physical examination revealed anisocoria (right pupil larger than the left) due to the operation. There were no neurological deficits. Apart from the pseudohallucinations, there were no additional psychopathological findings. She appeared to be in good medical condition. Apart from mild anemia, no other abnormalities appeared in the laboratory test of blood and urine.\n\n【15】Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head did not provide an explanation for the pseudohallucinations. Electroencephalography revealed a discontinuous slowing in both parietal regions without epileptiform patterns. Thorough neuropsychological testing (CERAD battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease), MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), and Brief Test of Attention) revealed normal cognitive function with fluctuating concentration, which was attributed to distraction due to the misperceptions. There were no signs of dementia or schizophrenia. An ophthalmological referral did not provide new explanations.\n\n【16】Lumbar puncture (after pausing rivaroxaban) revealed xanthochrome cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with elevated leucocytes (8/µl; normal: <5/µl), heightened protein (0.754 g/l; normal: <0.45 g/l), and increased ferritin (129 ng/ml; normal: <15 ng/ml). Testing for antineuronal antibodies in serum and CSF, as well as microbiological and virological testing of the CSF, did not reveal abnormalities. CT angiography did not detect a source of a potential subarachnoidal hemorrhage that was suspected owing to the elevated ferritin. Because the leukocyte count in the CSF was elevated, we started the patient on intravenous aciclovir, which was omitted after virological test of CSF found no viral Desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\n【17】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with susceptibility-weighted sequences finally showed diffuse bilateral superficial siderosis with bitemporal, bi-insular, and cerebellar emphasis (Fig. 1 ). No overt reason could be determined for this finding. We were unable to perform conventional angiography because of severe arteriosclerosis, elongation, and tortuosity of aorta and supra-aortic arteries. MRI of the spine did show hemosiderin remnants on the height of the first lumbar vertebra and the ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Axial susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences of the patient with bitemporal, bi-insular, bi-occipital, perimesencephal, peripontine, and cerebellar hemosiderin depositions\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】After prescribing risperidon (1.5 mg daily), the pseudohallucinations resolved during the stay in hospital. Because of elevated ferritin and the superficial siderosis, we did not continue rivaroxaban after the lumbar puncture. Nevertheless, protection from thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation was necessary. Therefore, we discussed implantation of an atrial appendage occlusion device with the cardiology department. Because dual antiplatelet therapy would necessitate implantation and because we were unable to rule out active bleeding, we planned to discharge the patient and readmit her for MRI of the brain 2 weeks later. The patient was put on enoxaparin for thrombosis prophylaxis because full anticoagulation was not possible owing to potential bleeding. Risperidone could be reduced to 0.5 mg daily. The new MRI showed the siderosis had not progressed, and the patient did not report the reappearance of visual or auditory pseudohallucinations. The patient was started on 100 mg of aspirin daily and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (loading dosage 300 mg), and a left-atrial occluder was implanted without complications.\n\n【23】Over time, the patient was not readmitted to our hospital. During the last contact for consent for publication, no new symptoms were reported.\n\n【24】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【25】Superficial siderosis of the brain is a rare disease of the central nervous system. Due to intermittent or ongoing hemorrhage, hemosiderin deposits in the spinal cord and the subpial layers of the brain. A common risk factor is prior history of trauma or intradural cranial surgery. Patients usually present with slowly progressive cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, or sensineural hearing loss \\[ 3 \\]. A coincidence with Alzheimer’s disease and amyloid angiopathy has been described \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Ferritin, which could be detected in our patient’s CSF, is synthesized by the brain as a reaction to contact with hemoglobin. Siderosis can be readily diagnosed using MRI with T2- and susceptibility-weighted sequences. The diagnosis is usually missed on CT of the head \\[ 3 \\]. If a source for the hemorrhage can be found, then the source is appropriately treated. Iron-chelating therapy using oral deferiprone is currently gaining attention as a treatment option \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【26】Data on pseudohallucinations of cerebral somatic origin are sparse. A known cause of visual pseudohallucinations in elderly patients is severely impaired vision (for example, due to ophthalmologic disease such as Charles Bonnet syndrome). Patients can also develop this syndrome following occipital cerebral ischemic stroke or cardiac surgery \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【27】We identified one case of superficial siderosis in a 68-year-old male with a history of head trauma 20 years prior to auditory and visual disturbances. However, these were true hallucinations, and the patient developed a delusional state \\[ 6 \\]. Therefore, our study is the first to report pseudohallucinations in superficial siderosis as the only symptom.\n\n【28】If a patient presents to our emergency department with unprecedented psychiatric disease, then CT is usually performed after taking history and clinical examination. We then analyze CSF for acute changes and send a sample to a specialized laboratory for evaluation for antineuronal antibodies (for example, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or CASPR2). If the patient is agitated and aggressive on presentation, then we usually refer the patient to a psychiatric ward and recommend electroencephalography and MRI of the brain when the patient is calm enough for the examinations. Otherwise, these patients are admitted to our neurological ward where both examinations are performed. We recommend this approach to identify cases such as the one described or for differential diagnosis of psychiatric symptoms due to other disease entities (for example, tumor or encephalitis). Somatic and potentially treatable causes should not be missed, and newly emerged symptoms should not be attributed to age or suspected onset of dementia, especially in the elderly. This could lead to unnecessary treatments and stigmatization and might lead to legal restrictions of self-determination.\n\n【29】We report the first case of pseudohallucinations in superficial siderosis. The risk of missing this diagnosis can be reduced by applying a standardized diagnostic pathway for patients presenting with the first episode of psychiatric symptoms. This is of great importance, especially for the elderly.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】CT:\n\n【34】Computed tomography\n\n【35】CSF:\n\n【36】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【37】MRI:\n\n【38】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【39】CERAD:\n\n【40】Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease\n\n【41】MMSE:\n\n【42】Mini-Mental State Examination", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We report a case demonstrating the limitations of these modalities, especially the inability of functional imaging to help localize the site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 37-year-old Arabian woman presented with 12 months of progressive Cushing's syndrome-like symptoms. Biochemical evaluation confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone -dependent Cushing's syndrome. However, the anatomical site of her excess adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion was not clearly delineated by further investigations. Magnetic resonance imaging of our patient's pituitary gland failed to demonstrate the presence of an adenoma. Spiral computed tomography of her chest only revealed the presence of a non-specific 7 mm lesion in her left inferobasal lung segment. Functional imaging, including a positron emission tomography scan using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and gallium-68-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide, also failed to show increased metabolic activity in the lung lesion or in her pituitary gland. Our patient was commenced on medical treatment with ketoconazole and metyrapone to control the clinical features associated with her excess cortisol secretion. Despite initial normalization of her urinary free cortisol excretion rate, levels began to rise eight months after commencement of medical treatment. Repeated imaging of her pituitary gland, chest and pelvis again failed to clearly localize a source of her excess adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. The bronchial nodule was stable in size on serial imaging and repeatedly reported as having a nonspecific appearance of a small granuloma or lymph node. We re-explored the treatment options and endorsed our patient's favored choice of resection of the bronchial nodule, especially given that her symptoms of cortisol excess were difficult to control and refractory. Subsequently, our patient had the bronchial nodule resected. The histological appearance of the lesion was consistent with that of a carcinoid tumor and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor stained strongly positive for adrenocorticotropic hormone. Furthermore, removal of the lung lesion resulted in a normalization of our patient's 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion rate and resolution of her symptoms and signs of hypercortisolemia.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case report demonstrates the complexities and challenges in diagnosing the causes of adrenocorticotropic hormone -dependent Cushing's syndrome. Functional imaging may not always localize the site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The diagnostic efficacy of biochemical and imaging modalities for localizing the anatomical site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion are limited. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), using the ligand 111-indium-pentetreotide, has traditionally been the functional imaging technique used, but it's usefulness has been questioned \\[ 1 \\]. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using gallium-68-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC) has been reported to be a superior modality for detecting neuroendocrine tumors \\[ 2 \\]. However, here we describe a case where this functional imaging technique failed to localize the site of ectopic ACTH secretion.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 37-year-old Arabian woman was referred to our endocrinology clinic with 12 months of progressive weight gain of 30 kg, hirsutism, acne, alopecia, lethargy, amenorrhea and marked anxiety. An examination revealed features of Cushing's syndrome with rounded face, buffalo hump, abdominal striae and proximal muscle weakness. Investigations confirmed excess cortisol production. Her 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion was 1870 nmol/day (normal range 40-450 nmol/day), her midnight salivary cortisol level was 121 nmol/L (normal range < 9 nmol/L) and after a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test her serum cortisol level was 597 nmol/L (expected value < 50 nmol/L). Her serum ACTH level was elevated at 55.8 and 55.1 ng/L on two separate occasions (normal range 7-63.2 ng/L), consistent with a diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her pituitary gland did not reveal the presence of an adenoma.\n\n【12】Localizing the source of excess ACTH secretion was challenging. Inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) sampling was difficult due to a left petrosal sinus anatomical variation. However, it demonstrated a central to peripheral ACTH gradient of less than three, consistent with ectopic ACTH secretion. This diagnosis was supported by failure of cortisol suppression (472 nmol/L) after an 8 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Computed tomography (CT) of her chest, abdomen and pelvis only revealed a well circumscribed 7 mm left inferior basal lung segment lesion. This was reported to most likely represent a benign granuloma or a small lymph node (Figure 1 ).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Transverse image of a chest CT scan showing a small 7 mm inferobasal segment lesion (arrow) in the left lower lobe** .\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Due to the wide range in sensitivity and specificity of the high dose dexamethasone suppression test (59-92% and 67-100%, respectively) and the inability to successfully catheterize her left IPS, further dynamic biochemical tests were performed \\[ 3 \\]. A five-hour intravenous dexamethasone test suppressed her serum cortisol level at five hours to less than 70% of basal values and a peripheral corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) test showed a 58% increase in ACTH levels from baseline. Contrary to preceding results, these findings could be interpreted to suggest the presence of a pituitary source for her excess ACTH secretion. However, PET scanning using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and gallium-68-DOTATOC failed to show increased metabolic activity in the lung lesion or in her pituitary gland.\n\n【18】Serial CT scanning of her chest, abdomen and pelvis over 18 months failed to definitively localize a source of ectopic ACTH production. The well circumscribed 7 mm left inferior basal lung segment lesion was reported as stable in size over this time. A repeat MRI of her pituitary gland once again did not reveal the presence of an adenoma.\n\n【19】Given the failure of biochemical or imaging techniques to localize the site of excess ACTH secretion, medical therapy was initiated with ketoconazole. However, combination treatment with metyrapone was required after eight months due to rising 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and progressive symptoms of weight gain, lethargy, depression and anxiety. Despite combination medical therapy there was still a progressive rise in 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels (Figure 2 ). As a result, our patient again developed florid symptoms of weakness, depression and anxiety which limited her daily activities and interpersonal relationships.\n\n【20】**Figure 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**Pattern of 24-hour urinary free cortisol secretion (normal range: 25-360 nmol/day) in response to various treatment modalities** . Note the horizontal axis is not to scale.\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Given the failure of medical therapy to control her symptoms, other potential treatment options were discussed with our patient. These included progressing to bilateral adrenalectomy or resection of the lung lesion, which was the only possible anatomical site of ectopic ACTH secretion located so far. Unfortunately, the lung lesion was reported to be lying adjacent to the pericardium which negated a minimally invasive surgical approach to remove it. Despite this our patient still strongly favored proceeding to resection of the lung lesion even though this would require an open procedure. Hence, an open thoracotomy to remove the lung lesion was performed 18 months after her initial presentation.\n\n【25】Histological examination of the resected nodule showed a 9 mm well circumscribed tumor surrounding a bronchus, with features consistent with a carcinoid tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor stained strongly positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin and ACTH. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and perioperative corticosteroid replacement was progressively weaned. Clinically, her symptoms of Cushing's syndrome slowly abated. She achieved a normal 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion off all treatment four months after surgery. Our patient remains well with no clinical or biochemical evidence of cortisol excess seven months after her surgery.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】This case illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing a pituitary or an ectopic source of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. A wide variability in the sensitivity and specificity of current biochemical dynamic tests has been reported (Table 1 ). None of the current diagnostic tests are able to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic ACTH syndrome with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Thus there is a need for a combination of tests to help determine the cause of Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【28】**Table 1 Reported sensitivity and specificity of commonly utilized dynamic biochemical diagnostic tests for determining the site of excess ACTH secretion**\n\n【29】Full size table\n\n【30】Furthermore, functional imaging may not always assist in localizing an anatomical site of excess ACTH secretion (Table 2 ). In some instances, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors can be detected by SRS using 111-indium-pentetreotide, or as highlighted in a recent case reported in this journal, with technetium-99 m-labelled octreotide acetate \\[ 4 \\]. However, the sensitivity of SRS for detecting occult tumors that secrete ACTH only ranges from 30 to 53% \\[ 1 \\]. In contrast, some preliminary reports have suggested that PET scanning using gallium-68-DOTATOC yields a higher detection rate of neuroendocrine tumors compared to SRS \\[ 2 \\]. Despite this, the limitations of even this technique to localize an ectopic source of ACTH secretion are highlighted by this case.\n\n【31】**Table 2 Reported sensitivity of current imaging modalities for localizing the site of ectopic ACTH secretion**\n\n【32】Full size table\n\n【33】When all modalities fail to localize a source of ectopic ACTH, the role of clinical judgment plays a significant role. Ongoing monitoring of the patient, combined with a relevant discussion of risks and benefits of different therapeutic options led to a decision to proceed to removal of the small bronchial nodule. This nodule was subsequently confirmed to be an ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumor. Embarking on this decision despite there being no definitive preoperative confirmation that the nodule was the source of her ectopic ACTH production resulted in a cure of our patient's Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】We have shown the limitations of the currently available diagnostic tools in differentiating pituitary or ectopic sources of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Furthermore, despite significant advances in radiological and nuclear medicine imaging modalities, the localization of the site of ectopic ACTH may still not be possible.\n\n【36】Consent\n-------\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Intraoperative findings showed that the cause of the dorsal capsular perforation and extensor tendon rupture was mechanical friction with the unstable ulnar head, which had no osteophytes or roughness.

According to the previous literature, the mechanism of extensor tendon rupture results from the perforation of the dorsal capsule of the DRUJ by attrition of the posteriorly dislocated or subluxated ulnar head and osteophytes during pronation and supination \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Yamazaki and colleagues suggested that deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch, and radial shift of the ulnar head are radiologic risk factors for extensor tendon ruptures in patients with osteoarthritic DRUJ \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【10】Here, we present a case of extensor tendon rupture caused by instability of the ulnar head with an osteoarthritic DRUJ. We discuss its pathomechanism and risk signs and conduct a literature review.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 74-year-old right-handed Asian woman was referred to our hospital with complaints of limited motion of her right little and ring fingers. Our patient had been experiencing an inability to extend her right little finger for two months, and subsequently, her ring finger for two weeks. Our patient denied any associated pain and warning symptoms such as tendon irritation.\n\n【13】On physical examination, our patient was unable to actively extend her right little and ring fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joint (Figure 1 ). A palpable mass with swelling at the wrist dorsum and severe instability of the DRUJ on the load and shift test was observed. Laboratory examinations revealed that her blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were within normal range. Her rheumatoid factor was also negative. Plain radiographs showed osteoarthritic change at the DRUJ. Deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch and radial shift of the ulnar head were also revealed (Figure 2 ).\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**This 74-year-old right-handed woman was unable to actively extend her right little and ring fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joint.**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Plain radiographs show osteoarthritic change at the distal radioulnar joint with deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch.**\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Intraoperatively, extensor digiti minimi (EDM), along with the fourth and fifth extensor digitorum communis (EDC) tendons, were ruptured with fraying of the tissue in the ruptured margin. Their distal ends were matted together in the scar and the fraying tissue and their proximal ends lay just proximal to the DRUJ. The ulnar head was directly exposed and the dorsally overlaying capsule was worn out (Figure 3 ). The ulnar head had arthritic change, but a smoothened surface without osteophyte formation. Although mild synovitis was present, there was no macroscopic evidence of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**An intraoperative photograph shows extensor digiti minimi, as well as the fourth and fifth extensor digitorum communis tendons, are ruptured with fraying of the tissue in the ruptured margin.** The ulnar head is directly exposed and the dorsally overlaying capsule is worn out.\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Because end-to-end repair was impossible, the extensor indicis proprius tendon was transferred to the EDM tendon, and the distal stumps of the fourth and fifth EDC tendon were sutured to the intact EDC tendon, in the end-to-side fashion. The ulnar head was resected. At 15 months after surgery, she can extend her ring and little fingers without difficulty for daily activities. She denied any pain around her wrist area.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Nontraumatic osteoarthritis of the DRUJ is uncommon and occurs principally in elderly patients \\[ 6 \\]. Although extensor tendon rupture associated with osteoarthritis of the DRUJ has been rarely reported, it is a clinically important complication \\[ 3 – 8 \\]. In 1948, Vaughan-Jackson first reported two cases of extensor tendon rupture by attrition at the osteoarthritic DRUJ \\[ 7 \\]. Typically, extensor tendon rupture is sequential and begins from the little finger, followed by the ring and long fingers \\[ 4 \\]. It may occur by attrition between the extensor tendon and posteriorly displaced ulnar head with osteophytes, which protrudes through a perforation of the dorsal capsule of the DRUJ \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【30】Commonly reported radiographic findings in cases of osteoarthritic DRUJ combined with extensor tendon rupture included deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch, radial shift of the ulnar head, ulnar plus variance, osteophytes of the distal end of the ulna, and dorsal subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar head. Freiberg and Weinstein have termed the plain radiographic finding, a scalloping of the ulnar aspect of the distal radius, the ‘scallop sign’ \\[ 1 \\]. The scallop sign is characterized by a sclerotic border with deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch. Beyond incidental interest, attention is called to the scallop sign because it seems diagnostic of existing or impending extensor tendon rupture \\[ 1 \\]. Osteophytes of the radial aspect of the ulnar head and dorsal shift of the ulnar head may perforate the DRUJ capsule and allow abrasion of the extensors. Osteophytes in the DRUJ make contact with, and may abrade, the extensor tendon of the little finger, which has an ulnar location in the extensor tendon sheath. Ohshio and colleagues reported five cases of spontaneous rupture of the extensor tendon due to osteoarthritis of the DRUJ \\[ 4 \\]. Several reports have described that the distal end of the ulna showed the plus variant, as well as dorsal dislocation or subluxation. Carr and Burge reported that perforation of the dorsal capsule of the DRUJ, allowing contact between the roughened ulnar head and extensor tendons, was present in all cases \\[ 3 \\]. They described that the consistent finding of capsular perforation with protrusion of the roughed ulnar head is strong evidence in favor of attrition as a mechanism of tendon rupture in osteoarthritis. In our case, we observed a definite scallop sign, a radial shift of the ulnar head, and a smoothened ulnar head. Indeed, we could not find a dislocated or subluxated ulnar head, ulnar positive variance, osteophytes or roughness of the ulnar head on plain radiographs. Our operative findings showed that the cause of the dorsal capsular perforation and extensor tendon rupture was mechanical friction with the unstable ulnar head, which had no osteophytes or roughness.\n\n【31】Yamazaki and colleagues analyzed the radiographic morphology of the DRUJ to identify the risk factors for extensor tendon rupture \\[ 8 \\]. They reported that the risk factors include severe osteoarthritic changes, exceeding Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3, deepening and widening of the sigmoid notch, radial shift of the ulnar head and dorsal inclination of the sigmoid notch. There was no significant association between tendon rupture and the morphology of the ulnar head or positive variance \\[ 8 \\]. Our case is consistent with these findings. It means that extensor tendon rupture associated with osteoarthritic DRUJ can occur without osteophytes, dislocation or subluxation, and with a positive variance of the ulnar head on radiographic findings.\n\n【32】Treatment options for extensor tendon rupture with osteoarthritic DRUJ included end-to-end repair, tendon graft, and tendon transfer \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. End-to-end repair is usually impossible because ruptured stumps have scars and fraying tissue. Tendon transfer is more preferable than tendon graft because it is technically easier and has a lower complication rate \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Excision of the distal ulna is necessary to prevent the recurrence of tendon rupture \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【33】Although dorsal wrist pain or pain on active finger extension may precede tendon rupture in rheumatoid disease, it appears that there are few predictive or warning symptoms in osteoarthritic DRUJ \\[ 3 \\]. In our case, there was no associated pain and warning symptoms, such as tendon irritation.\n\n【34】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【35】When a patient with osteoarthritic DRUJ has instability of the ulnar head and a ‘scallop sign’ on radiography, physicians should consider the possibility of extensor tendon rupture as a complication.\n\n【36】Consent\n-------\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Dengue infection can present from subclinical infection to dengue shock syndrome. Further, the disease also shows a variety of atypical presentations and has been reported to mimic a number of causes of acute abdomen.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The authors report two children (a 6-year-old Tamil girl and an 8-year-old Muslim girl) who were diagnosed to have acute appendicitis during the early recovery phase of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and late recovery period of dengue hemorrhagic fever with platelet count of 92 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm and 102 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm, respectively. Both children were investigated with abdomen ultrasound as they developed severe abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation during the recovery phase, which was felt to be very unusual. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed in one child, while the other child had a ruptured appendicular abscess. Both children were treated with laparoscopic appendectomy and a 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics. Both children were reviewed in 1 month following treatment and had complete recovery.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Although precise pathophysiology and associations of the surgical abdomen with dengue fever remain to be elucidated, there are known factors in dengue fever that can potentially lead to secondary bacterial infections and surgical abdomen. Awareness and increased suspicion by the clinician are paramount to detect such complications early, especially in children who demonstrate unusual clinical features during various stages of dengue infection.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection and recognized as a common neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) \\[ 1 \\]. The condition has had a great impact on the economy of Sri Lanka in providing both primary and secondary healthcare over the past two decades \\[ 2 \\]. It has a myriad of clinical manifestations which range from self-resolving subclinical infection to fatal dengue shock syndrome \\[ 3 \\]. Atypical presentations and multiorgan involvement were recognized under the umbrella of dengue expanded syndrome in 2012 by the WHO \\[ 4 \\]. Various manifestations are reported in dengue expanded syndrome, including involvement of heart, brain, kidney, liver, spleen, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract \\[ 5 \\]. Reported uncommon complications are myocarditis \\[ 6 \\], encephalitis \\[ 7 \\], liver failure with encephalopathy \\[ 8 \\], and acute kidney damage \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【10】During dengue fever, abdominal pain is a common manifestation due to hepatic involvement, gastritis, myalgia, and hypovolemia \\[ 5 \\]. Further, acute abdomen in the form of either medical or surgical complications is also a known presentation of dengue infection mimicking peritonitis, acute acalculous cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, intussusception, and acute appendicitis \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. The coexistence of dengue fever with the acute abdomen is undoubtedly a challenge to clinicians for timely diagnosis and treatment. Recognition of acute surgical conditions is mandatory to optimize appropriate treatment and reduce morbidity and mortality. The authors report two pediatric patients who manifested acute appendicitis during the recovery phase of dengue fever within a tertiary care setting during the heavy rainy season with an outbreak of dengue in eastern Sri Lanka.\n\n【11】Presentation of case 1\n----------------------\n\n【12】A 6-year-old Tamil girl who had dengue aemorrhagic fever during the previous year was readmitted with fever, headache, vomiting, and abdominal pain for 5 days’ duration. This was the heavy rainy season with widespread dengue outbreaks in this region. She tested positive for dengue antigen (NS1) and had a low white blood cell count (2.8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm), low platelet (70 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm), and hematocrit of 38, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) of 145 IU/dl, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) of 98 IU/dl, and normal C-reactive protein. Her sister also had DHF and had been discharged recently.\n\n【13】Physical examination revealed that she was febrile (39 °C), appeared ill and irritable, and weighed 22 kg. All peripheral pulses were felt with low volume. Blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg with pulse pressure of 20 mmHg. Capillary refilling time was around 2 s with cold clammy extremities. Inward ultrasound revealed fluids in the Morrison pouch and right pleural space compatible with 8 h leakage time. The respiratory system had been unremarkable except for reduced air entry in the right lung base. There was generalized abdominal tenderness with 3-cm hepatomegaly. The rest of the system examination was normal.\n\n【14】She was resuscitated with intravenous normal saline two boluses followed by 5 ml/kg/hour infusion. She improved with meticulous monitoring and fluid management. Her platelet count had dropped to 30 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm and gradually picked up on the seventh day of illness to 90 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm, with a WBC count of 4.5 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm, indicating recovery phase. The diagnosis of dengue fever was confirmed by the presence of dengue IgM and IgG antibodies, and her urine and blood cultures grew no organisms. On the night of the same day, she developed loose stools which were profuse, watery, and contained mucus. She also had vomiting and generalized abdominal pain. She was initially treated as having infective diarrhea pending stool cultures. However, stool culture was sterile after 48 hours of incubation. Repeated WBC count was 11 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm, and C-reactive protein was elevated to 12 mg/dL. The platelet count was 92 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm. She continued to have severe acute abdominal pain with demonstrable guarding and rigidity, and subsequently, repeated ultrasound in the late night was compatible with acute appendicitis. She underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and was given intravenous ampicillin 50 mg/kg/dose 6 hourly and metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg/dose three times a day for 7 days. Fig. 1 shows the appearance of the grossly inflamed appendix during laparoscopy. Several clinical follow-ups were performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after discharge, and the patient was noted to have made a complete recovery. The histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Laparoscopic view of acute appendicitis. Arrow indicates inflamed appendix\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Presentation of case 2\n----------------------\n\n【20】An 8-year-old previously healthy Muslim girl, who had been treated for DHF in a local hospital, was transferred to the tertiary care unit for further management of abdominal pain of 2 days’ duration during a widespread outbreak of dengue infection while she had been in the late recovery period of DHF. She was admitted to the local hospital with fever which had been more than 38 °C, mild cough, and loose stools for 2 days. She was investigated with full blood count (lowest WBC count 3.2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm, platelets 74 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm) and NS1 antigen (positive). Abdomen ultrasound initially showed pericolic collection of fluids, and she was managed as DHF with intravenous fluids and other supportive treatment. Urine, blood, and stool cultures grew no organisms. The diagnosis of dengue fever was confirmed by presence of dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. When she was planned for discharge with platelet count of 102 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm and WBC count of 8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm on day 7 of illness, she developed vague generalized abdominal pain without tenderness. Ultrasound abdomen revealed that appendix was not visualized, but there were enlarged mesenteric multiple lymph nodes. She was managed symptomatically as mesenteric adenitis. She developed severe tenderness and abdominal pain in addition to severe vomiting and was transferred to the tertiary hospital for further management. Ruptured acute appendicitis was detected in a repeat ultrasound abdomen by the consultant radiologist. She was operated by laparoscopy; the image is shown in Fig. 2 . Further treatment was intravenous cefotaxime at 50 mg/kg/dose, 6 hourly and metronidazole at 7.5 mg/dose, three times per day. Antibiotics were continued for 14 days as she had continued fever above 38.5 °C throughout the hospital stay. White blood cells (highest 24 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /cumm) and C-reactive protein (highest 96 mg/dL) remained persistently elevated during the first week of intravenous antibiotics. Multiple clinical follow-up reviews were performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after discharge, and the patient was noted to have made a complete recovery with normal hematological and biochemical parameters. The histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Laparoscopic view of the ruptured necrotic appendix with fecolith. Arrow indicates ruptured necrotic appendix with faecolith\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Dengue is one of the most common tropical diseases in Sri Lanka, presenting with abdominal pain and fever. Further, during dengue shock, hypovolemia also presents as severe abdominal pain \\[ 14 \\]. Therefore, accurate and well-timed diagnosis of coexisting medical and surgical conditions such as acute appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, and cholecystitis is often difficult in dengue infection \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. Children with predominant abdominal pain may be referred to surgeons initially, and dengue fever might be the underlying diagnosis subsequently, although it could potentially be detected with delay due to initial focus on the surgical abdomen \\[ 15 \\]. Sometimes, an initial referral to the surgeon can lead to an unnecessary appendectomy \\[ 10 \\]. Some authors suggest that acute abdomen may be a co-occurrence with dengue infection rather than a direct effect, although pathophysiological changes occurring in dengue may predispose to acute abdomen \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【27】Lymphoid hyperplasia and mesenteric adenitis may also mimic acute appendicitis in dengue \\[ 16 \\]. One of these reported children had enlarged multiple mesenteric lymph nodes in the first abdomen ultrasound, and subsequent ultrasound only showed ruptured acute appendicitis with abscess formation. The initial ultrasound findings misguided the clinical presentation as mesenteric adenitis and poorly visualized appendix instead of ruptured appendix. The pathophysiology of appendicitis in the context of dengue fever and its recovery is not clearly understood \\[ 17 \\]. One potential etiology is lymphoid hyperplasia and mesenteric adenitis present in the febrile phase of dengue fever. The pathophysiological changes that occur during the onset of dengue hemorrhagic fever including systemic inflammatory response syndrome and plasma leakage are also likely to contribute to the development of acute abdomen including appendicitis \\[ 16 \\]. Plasma leakage can result in an edematous appendix with luminal obstruction, promoting secondary bacterial infection and appendicitis \\[ 18 \\]. Direct viral invasion can also lead to acute appendicitis. Other proposed mechanisms include endotoxemia and ischemic reperfusion injury \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【28】A study in Pakistan showed that the incidence of acute abdomen in dengue fever had been 12% during the period of the dengue epidemic. Moreover, five of seven patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis underwent appendectomies, although histology did not favor their diagnosis. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is important to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures to reduce mortality \\[ 18 \\]. A previously reported child in Sri Lanka revealed an appendicular mass occurring simultaneously with dengue infection \\[ 16 \\]. Both of these children were diagnosed to have acute appendicitis during the recovery phase of DHF. The clinical presentation of case 1 was initially misinterpreted as acute bacillary dysentery due to high white blood cell count, high C-reactive protein, and normal abdomen ultrasound. However, careful consideration of alternative diagnoses and intense abdominal pain directed authors to repeat the ultrasound, which detected acute appendicitis. In the second case, although the first ultrasound was commented as acute mesenteric adenitis, increased abdominal pain and increased septic markers made the authors repeat the ultrasound by consultant radiologist.\n\n【29】Analyzing the clinical presentations of the two reported children in retrospect, it could be argued that the abdominal pain beyond the critical or viremia phase in dengue infection might be acute abdomen until proven otherwise. Therefore, an active survey of differential diagnoses is crucial to prevent morbidity and mortality of similar unexpected complications.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】Dengue fever is recognized to present with myriad atypical presentations, including the acute abdomen. Although precise pathophysiology and associations of the surgical abdomen with dengue fever remain to be elucidated, there are known factors in dengue fever that can potentially lead to secondary bacterial infections and surgical abdomen. Awareness and increased suspicion by the clinician are paramount to detect these complications early, especially in children, who demonstrate unusual clinical features during various stages of dengue infection.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】The data that support the findings of these case reports are available from Medical Records Department, Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current report and so are not publicly available.

The protocol for treatment in these previous cases varied considerably, partly due to the rarity of the disease and partly due to the different time periods of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 45-year-old Iranian woman presented to our University Hospital with a PNET of the cervix. After clinical staging and discussion at our Gynecology Oncology Multidisciplinary Team (GOMDT) meeting, treatment began.\n\n【12】Our patient was multiparous and had initially presented to a local regional facility with yellow purulent vaginal discharge for the last three months. Upon examination by a gynecologist, a biopsy was taken from a bulging cervical tumor, and a diagnosis of a small round cell malignant tumor was made based on analysis of the sample. Our patient was then referred to our center. Bimanual pelvic examination under general anesthesia revealed a 4 × 5 cm mass apparently arising from the anterior lip of the cervix, producing yellow vaginal discharge; the size of the uterus was around the size of a 10 week pregnancy. There was no extension of the lesion into the vagina, parametria, or adjacent organs including the bladder and rectum. The tumor was clinically at stage IB2. A repeat cervical biopsy was taken for confirmation of the tumor type, which was prepared and analyzed by an expert cytopathologist using immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\n【13】The slides of the biopsy taken in the regional hospital were revised, and additional tumor material from the second biopsy taken in our institute was examined. Both biopsies showed the same histological appearances: small blue-staining tumor cells with little cytoplasm lying closely packed in sheets without rosette or gland formation. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells was clearly shown to contain glycogen on staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Immunohistochemistry stains for a number of epithelial markers were negative including CD3, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), desmin, latent class analysis (LCA), neurofilament, CD10, CD20, cytokeratin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). However CD99, chromogranin, and synaptophysin showed strong positivity and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was focally positive. On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of PNET of the cervix was made.\n\n【14】Laboratory examination results from hematology, electrolyte, liver and renal function tests were normal. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the chest and abdomen showed multiple para-aortic adenopathies (20 mm in diameter). The results of rectosigmoidoscopy, as well as a whole body scan, were normal. There were no signs of lung or liver metastasis.\n\n【15】After discussion in our GOMDT meeting, it was decided to treat our patient in the following manner: (1) Initially, our patient would received a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine 2 g, adriamycin 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> (VAC) alternating with ifosfamide 1800 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> plus etoposide 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> during days 1 to 5; (2) then, surgical treatment would be performed consisting of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy depending on the findings at surgery; (3) finally, chemotherapy or radiotherapy depending on the findings at surgery and microscopic examination would be started. A decision regarding consolidation therapy would then ensue.\n\n【16】At the end of 12 weeks of chemotherapy, there was a complete response of the primary tumor, and enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes were revealed on CT scan. A radical hysterectomy was therefore performed involving the uterus and bilateral ovaries along with the proximal third of the vagina, and the bilateral parametrium, which were all removed. At the time of surgery there were no enlarged pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. As the para-aortic lymph nodes were not biopsied before chemotherapy due to our patient's condition, we decided to perform a complete para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy in addition to a radical hysterectomy. Unfortunately, our patient's general condition prohibited a complete para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy, so only sampling of the pelvic nodes was performed.\n\n【17】A macroscopic examination showed a tumor of 5 × 6 × 5 cm in the cervical location (Figure 1 ). Microscopic examination of the removed tumor tissue showed a small round cell tumor of the cervix with a depth of 8 mm to the stroma. In the histological examination of uterus, vagina and parametrium no malignancy was reported. No lymphovascular invasion was reported. Only three pelvic nodes from the pelvic left side and right pelvic nodes were found along with the specimen, which was negative for malignancy. All the pathology reports were reviewed by another expert pathologist (Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ).\n\n【18】**Figure 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Macroscopic view of the resected uterus** .\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Figure 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Positive MIC2 (CD99) expression in the tumor cells** .\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Figure 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Representative hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumor** .\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Figure 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Positive synaptophysin stain in the tumor** .\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】**Figure 5**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**Tumor cells shown to be chromogranin A positive** .\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】After surgery, the same chemotherapy protocol was continued for another 12 weeks. Finally, after completion of the treatment, chest and abdomen CT scans consistently showed no enlargement of lymph nodes and no sign of tumor.\n\n【39】Over more than four years of follow-up in our out-patient clinic (every month for three months, then every three months for the first year, then every six months to date by the gynecologic oncologist and medical oncologist) there was no recurrence of the disease seen on either physical examination or CT imaging.\n\n【40】Discussion\n----------\n\n【41】Our patient was diagnosed as having at least clinical stage IB2 cervical cancer at the time of presentation. From the results shown in Table 1 , it seems that PNET of the cervix can happen at any age. In a literature review performed by Snijders-Keilholz _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\], the range of age at diagnosis of the disease was between 21 and 60 years. PNET of the uterine cervix belongs to the Ewing's sarcoma family \\[ 10 \\]. Although such tumors usually occur in younger adults, often around the shoulder or hip, they can arise at many other sites including the uterine cervix. Cytogenetic studies now indicate that Ewing's sarcoma and PNET have similar histological features and should be considered as one entity \\[ 10 \\]. In our patient's case, we did not have the facilities to test for the t(11;22) translocation found in Ewing/PNET. However, strong membranous staining with CD99 was very characteristic and sensitive. Chromogranin and synaptophysin test results were also positive. Furthermore, negative staining for a wide variety of other markers including CD3, TdT, desmin, LCA, neurofilament, CD10, CD20, cytokeratin, and CEA excluded other types of small, blue, round cell tumor that entered the differential diagnosis.\n\n【42】**Table 1 Management of nine patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the cervix, as published in the English literature (1987 to 2008)**\n\n【43】Full size table\n\n【44】Ewing's sarcoma must be considered as a systemic disease without adequate treatment in which more than 90% of patients die from secondary hematogenous metastases, occurring mainly in the lung. Therefore, the five-year survival rate can increase to 55% to 60% with dose-intensive cytotoxic treatment regimens in localized disease; the three-year disease-free survival rate was reported to be 15% to 22% among patients with detectable metastases at time of diagnosis \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【45】As shown in Table 1 , in earlier reports the approach to treatment of uterine cervix PNET was optimal local surgical treatment followed by additional treatment such as irradiation and/or chemotherapy. Recently however, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local treatment has been favored because of improved results from the addition of systemic therapy. Optimal management must be based on a GOMDT decision. As all 10 cases were at stage IB and mostly with no metastasis at the time of diagnosis, it is assumed that a tumor in this location produces symptoms at an early stage. Although, as can be seen from Table 1 , one patient as well as our patient underwent chemotherapy first because the tumor was too large to perform initial radical surgery, the other cases had primary local treatment mainly consisting of primary surgery (except in one patient which was first treated with radiotherapy) followed by additional local radiotherapy or systemic treatment. Metastatic disease developed after three years in one case, and this patient died after a year.\n\n【46】It might be considered that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an overtreatment for the management of PNET. However, as Snijders-Keilholz _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] mention, up to now duration of follow-up of the reported cases is too short (five to 42 months) to prove or reject this discussion. As with Ewing's sarcoma of other sites, we showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy in metastatic cases could change an inoperable presentation to an operable state for successful local and/or regional treatment.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【48】Patients with localized PNET of the cervix should be treated with dose-intensive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local treatment, and chemotherapy thereafter. Our patient was treated with a multimodal therapy regime resulting in a disease-free state for at least four years after diagnosis.\n\n【49】Consent\n-------\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The patient will be kept under review in the oral medicine department because the progression of the lesion on the left buccal mucosa requires active monitoring owing to the potential for malignant change. The patient also requires regular review in the dermatology and ophthalmology divisions.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Nevus of Ota or “oculodermal melanocytosis” is a rare congenital hamartoma of dermal melanocytes causing a blue-gray hyperpigmentation of the eye and surrounding structures \\[ 1 \\]. Originally described by Ota and Tanino in 1939, it mainly affects the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and is most prevalent in the Japanese population, with an incidence reported between 0.2% and 1% \\[ 2 \\]. Oral involvement of the nevus of Ota is very rare \\[ 3 \\]. We describe the first reported case of unilateral oculodermal melanocytosis with oral buccal mucosal involvement in a Caucasian woman. It is important to be aware that nevus of Ota can present orally.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 48-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to the oral medicine department at the University of Liverpool School of Dentistry with new-onset oral pigmentation to the left buccal mucosa. Her past medical history revealed a diagnosis of “oculodermal nevus.” She recalled having pigmentation in her left eye from birth and pigmentation of skin of the left face since the age of 13 years, for which she received laser treatment for cosmetic purposes. The patient also reported annual monitoring of a benign intracranial tumor along with close monitoring by ophthalmology and dermatology divisions. She did not take any regular medications. She did not smoke or consume alcohol. She is single and lives on her own with no dependents. She lives close to her mother, who attended the appointments with her.\n\n【12】On examination, a subtle but diffusely speckled bluish pigmentation was observed to the left midface involving the infraorbital and zygomatic regions. A post–laser therapy yellow hue was noted on the left periorbital skin. Pigmentation of the sclera and conjunctiva was also observed. Intraorally, an inhomogeneous, blue-gray, diffuse hyperpigmentation affecting the entire left buccal mucosa was noted. Mild pigmentation of the left hard palate was also noted (Figs. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Naevus of Ota affecting the left buccal mucosa\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Naevus of Ota affecting the left buccal mucosa and palate\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Naevus of Ota affecting the left Infra-Orbital and Zygomatic region\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Post laser scarring in the left Infra-Orbital region\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 5**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Naevus of Ota afffecting the sclera of the left eye and post laser scarring\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】An incisional biopsy of the left buccal mucosa was completed. The report stated that histological and immunohistochemical features were in keeping with a blue nevus, but within the context of the preexisting occulodermal pigmentation, a diagnosis of oculodermal melanocytosis, also known as “nevus of Ota,” was made. No other investigations were required. The patient will be kept under 6-monthly review with the oral medicine department because the progression of the lesion on the left buccal mucosa requires active monitoring owing to the potential for malignant change.\n\n【34】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【35】Nevus of Ota represents a unilateral dermal melanosis in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, where it is usually confined to the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions. The forehead, temple, periorbital area, cheek, and nose are most commonly involved. Melanin pigmentation involves the eye in about 50% of cases \\[ 4 \\]. Rarely is the pigmentation bilateral with large areas of the face and oral mucous membranes being affected \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【36】A literature search of PubMed and Embase revealed only two cases (in India) of nevus of Ota affecting the buccal mucosa \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Intraoral presentations more frequently involve the palatal mucosa.\n\n【37】The prevalence of this condition is greatest in the Asian continent, affecting up to 1% of the Japanese population \\[ 2 \\]. One study has reported an incidence of 0.038% in Caucasians, although this is poorly documented \\[ 7 \\]. About 85% cases of nevus of Ota occur in females.\n\n【38】Use of lasers for treatment of nevus of Ota has become helpful in the management of dermal nevi. Currently, Q-switched lasers are the most studied, and they have demonstrated positive results for nevus of Ota \\[ 8 \\]. Lasers are more effective in light-skinned individuals; however, recurrence can be more common and may result in a darker hue.\n\n【39】Our patient had received laser therapy 20 years earlier and had a good outcome. She has also been referred to the cosmetic camouflage clinic. The patient has seen a makeup artist and uses cosmetics to cover the pigmentation. Long-term follow-up, especially in the ophthalmology division (6-monthly) \\[ 9 \\] and neurosurgery division, is required because of the risk of ocular melanoma and central nervous system neoplasia, although this is rare. The patient’s intracranial lesion is unrelated to the nevus of Ota. There is also an increased risk of glaucoma associated with nevus of Ota in 10% of patients \\[ 10 \\]. A number of cases of malignant melanoma are also reported in the literature, and careful observation is necessary, particularly in Caucasians, in whom malignant degeneration seems to occur with a disproportionate frequency \\[ 11 \\]. It is recommended that these patients be reviewed annually by a dermatologist. It is also of note that there are possible molecular explanations for the risk of malignancy, including mutations of _GNAQ_ and _BAP1_ genes \\[ 12 \\]. This will require further research.\n\n【40】Change history\n--------------\n\n【41】*   ### 07 August 2019\n    \n    In the publication of this article \\[1\\], the figures were accidentally omitted due to an error.

Most breast lymphomas are classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas or as mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Concurrent cases of breast lymphoma and cervical cancer are extremely rare.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 46-year-old woman of unknown ethnic origin diagnosed with concurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the breast and squamous cell cancer of the cervix that was detected and followed with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and/or computed tomography (PET/CT). The metastatic pattern of this case of breast lymphoma is similar to that of a typical metastatic breast carcinoma. These findings have never been described in the literature. PET/CT also demonstrated an incidentally intense FDG focus in the uterine cervix ultimately leading to the pathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. An appropriate staging of breast lymphoma and cervical cancer with FDG PET/CT is important because of therapeutic consequence. This case report and review of the literature highlights the role of FDG PET/CT in staging and restaging of both breast lymphoma and cervical cancer.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We report a case of a breast lymphoma with a metastatic pattern similar to that of typical metastatic breast carcinoma. The FDG PET/CT scan also diagnosed a rare case of concurrent breast lymphoma and cervical cancer. This concurrence has not been reported previously in the medical literature.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Breast lymphoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) \\[ 1 \\] and approximately 0.1% of all cases of patients with breast neoplasms \\[ 2 \\]. Most breast lymphomas are either classified as diffuse large B-cell (DLBC) lymphomas (as with the case of our patient) or as mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. The prevalence of breast lymphoma is much less compared to that of cervical cancer. In the USA, there were an estimated 11,070 new cases of invasive cervical cancer in 2008. As a result, 3870 cancer-related deaths are expected. This represents approximately 1% of cancer deaths in women \\[ 3 \\]. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and/or computed tomography (PET/CT) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis, staging and restaging of various cancers with accuracies ranging from 80% to 90% \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【9】We describe the staging and restaging findings of FDG PET/CT scans in a patient with synchronous breast lymphoma and cervical cancer and highlight this rare clinical occurrence. To the best of our knowledge, concurrent breast lymphoma and cervical cancer have not been reported in the literature.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 46-year-old woman of unknown ethnic origin presented to her primary doctor with a one-month history of a painless left breast lump without associated nipple discharge that was noticed by the doctor on examination. She was otherwise healthy with no other relevant history. Physical examination revealed a large, non-tender, freely movable mass in the left breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. Our patient reported no systemic B symptoms such as fever or weight loss. A biopsy of her left breast mass revealed a DLBC lymphoma. Our patient was then referred for staging with F-18 FDG PET/CT that was acquired from base of skull to upper thigh with the CT being low-dose and unenhanced. The PET/CT scan revealed a 8 × 10 cm hyperdense and intensely FDG-avid mass occupying almost the entire left breast with maximum standard uptake value (SUV) of 21 (Figure 1 ). In addition, several left axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 5 cm in size and several left sub-centimeter internal mammary lymph nodes showed intense FDG avidity (Figure 2 ), with SUV values of 33 and 3.3. However, PET/CT findings were suggestive a breast carcinoma rather than a lymphoma, based on the location and distribution of the lesion. Because of the rarity of breast lymphoma, it would be unusual to consider metastatic breast lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors. As a result, it would have been impossible to distinguish breast lymphoma from breast carcinoma through PET/CT. An incidental finding of intense FDG uptake in the uterine cervix, SUV of 8, led to the subsequent pathologic diagnosis of a previously unsuspected squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 3 ). The lesion appeared to involve the proximal third of the vagina and the corpus uterine, but a tumor extension to the parametrial soft tissue was not noticed.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**(A) Axial computed tomography (CT) and (B) axial positron emission tomography (PET) images of pre-treatment PET/CT scan showed an intense FDG avid mass in the left breast (arrowhead)** . **(C)** Axial computed tomography (CT) and **(D)** axial positron emission tomography (PET) images of post-treatment PET/CT, three months after completion of chemotherapy, showed resolution of previously fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avid breast lesion.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Maximum intensity projection (MIP) PET images** : (A) Pre-therapy scan again showed the fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avid mass occupying almost the entire left breast (large arrowhead), further left axillary lymph node conglomerates (short arrow) and two left internal mammary lymph nodes (long arrows), all demonstrating high FDG avidity. An intense FDG focus in the right pelvic sidewall (small arrowhead) was a corpus luteal cyst verified by diagnostic computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound. Three months after completion of chemotherapy, a PET/CT scan **(B)** showed resolved FDG avidity of all previously described lesions in the left breast, left axilla and left internal mammary region, suggestive of complete remission of breast lymphoma. Spontaneous resolution of the corpus luteal cyst was also noticed.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Figure 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**(A) Axial computed tomography and (B) axial positron emission tomography images of pre-treatment PET/CT scan showed an intense FDG focus in the uterine cervix (short arrow) with soft tissue fullness on CT (long arrow)** . **(C)** Axial CT and **(D)** axial PET images of post-treatment PET/CT, three months after completion of chemotherapy, showed resolution of previously FDG avid cervical lesion.\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Our patient underwent chemotherapy for NHL of the breast and cervical cancer as well as afterloading brachytherapy to the uterine cervix. A repeat FDG PET/CT three months after completion of therapy showed resolved FDG avidity of all previously described lesions (Figures 1 , 2 , 3 ).\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】### Breast lymphoma\n\n【27】DLBC lymphoma is an NHL that usually presents with a rapidly enlarging mass. Systemic B symptoms (that is fever and weight loss >10% of body weight) may occur in approximately 30% of patients \\[ 5 \\]. Large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of NHL; its prevalence is about 30% of all NHL patients. Also, large B-cell lymphoma accounts for approximately 40% of patients with extra-nodal NHL \\[ 2 , 6 \\]. Extra-nodal sites may be of lung, pleura, thymus, breast, spleen, liver, pancreas, musculoskeletal system, or central nervous system \\[ 2 \\]. Primary breast lymphoma is a rare disease and presented only 0.1% of the more than 25,000 primary malignant tumors of the breast treated during a 30-year period in a single institution \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【28】There are only a few reports of FDG-PET findings of extra-nodal breast lymphoma \\[ 7 – 10 \\]. Kumar _et al_ . reported the findings of FDG-PET in a case of a patient with DLBC lymphoma that presented as intense and diffuse FDG uptake in dense breast tissue and was not detectable by diagnostic CT \\[ 7 \\]. Bakheet _et al_ . reported a patient with breast lymphoma mass that had intense FDG uptake in the rim and photopenic center suggestive a tumor with central necrosis \\[ 8 \\]. Nihashi _et al_ . described the FDG uptake as intense, round and homogeneous, but, unfortunately, there were no CT images for correlation \\[ 9 \\]. Another case reported a patient with concurrent breast lymphoma and multiple nodular adenosis \\[ 10 \\]. In that case, an FDG PET scan after one cycle of chemotherapy showed diffuse moderate FDG uptake in the right breast which might have reflected good response to therapy based on FDG intensity. In the current case, a large, intensely FDG avid, hyperdense tumor mass infiltrated almost the entire soft tissue of the left breast which was not described previously. In addition, the FDG avid lymph nodes in the ipsilateral axillary and internal mammary regions showed a metastatic pattern similar to that of typical metastatic breast cancer. These findings have not been reported in the literature.\n\n【29】The role of FDG PET in the diagnosis, staging and restaging of lymphoma has been established \\[ 2 , 11 \\]. Integrated PET/CT increases the sensitivity and specificity compared to FDG PET alone. In Hodgkin's lymphoma or high-grade NHL, the sensitivity of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT for lymph node involvement was found to be 94% and 88%, respectively, while the specificity was 100% and 86%, respectively \\[ 11 \\]. For extra-nodal disease, PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT had a sensitivity of 88% and 50%, and a specificity of 100% and 90% \\[ 11 \\]. The degree of FDG uptake can distinguish indolent from aggressive NHL \\[ 12 \\]. An SUV >10 was found to have high likelihood for aggressive disease. In our patient, SUV was 21 in the breast mass and there was associated locoregional lymphadenopathy suggestive of aggressive disease. Early FDG PET/CT scan can be carried out after first-line chemotherapy to increase the prognostic value by assessing the degree of interval SUV decrease, with event-free survival improving from 65% to 76% in patients with DLBC lymphoma when quantitative SUV analysis was added to a visual assessment \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【30】The Ann Arbor staging system developed in 1971 for Hodgkin's lymphoma was adapted for staging of NHL \\[ 14 \\]. Based on the present FDG PET/CT findings, our patient had stage II disease because there was involvement of two lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm besides the primary breast lesion.\n\n【31】### Cervical cancer\n\n【32】The incidental detection of a second malignancy in cancer patients undergoing FDG PET/CT staging is not uncommon \\[ 15 \\]. However, the FDG PET/CT scan diagnosed a rare case of concurrent breast lymphoma and cervical cancer that has never been reported in the literature. It seems unlikely, though, that the breast lymphoma and the cervical cancer of our patient are caused by one or the other.\n\n【33】The International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Cancer (IUCC) are the most common staging systems for cervical cancer \\[ 16 \\]. The FIGO staging system is largely based upon physical examination. Thus, a good pelvic examination is important. Tumor size and parametrial involvement are best assessed by rectovaginal examination. Colposcopy, cystoscopy, and proctoscopy can be used to assess adjacent areas. Optional procedures include ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and FDG PET or PET/CT, and can be of value for treatment planning.\n\n【34】FDG PET has been used in initial staging and monitoring of therapy in patients with cervical cancer \\[ 17 \\]. In a review article, the sensitivity and specificity for pelvic involvement with newly diagnosed cervical cancer were 79% and 99% for FDG-PET, and 72% and 96% for MRI; for CT the sensitivity was 47%, the specificity could not be accurately determined. For para-aortic node metastasis, FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 84%, and a specificity of 95% \\[ 17 \\]. The diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET in lymph node staging, however, might be lower in women with early stage diseases \\[ 18 \\]. This is partly attributed to the low-dose and unenhanced CT of the PET/CT scan that is sub-optimal for detecting sub-centimeter nodal disease. Of note, the CT was sub-optimal in the current patient as well. But PET/CT scan is increasingly being carried out with intravenous contrast media.\n\n【35】In our patient, FDG PET/CT findings suggested a T2 tumor that involved the proximal third of the vagina and the corpus uterine. There was no evidence of parametrial tumor invasion. An intensely FDG avid soft tissue density seen in the left pelvis was thought to be either lymph node metastasis or physiologic ovarian FDG uptake. Subsequent ultrasound and diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT confirmed the presence of a corpus luteal cyst that sometimes may cause false-positive interpretation because of the FDG avidity \\[ 19 \\]. Based on imaging findings, the cervical cancer was T2N0M0, stage II. The degree of FDG uptake has prognostic significance in cervical cancer and was found to negatively correlate with treatment response and prognosis \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】This case report shows a breast lymphoma case of a patient with a metastatic pattern similar to that of typical metastatic breast carcinoma. Also, the FDG PET/CT scan diagnosed an extremely rare case of concurrent breast lymphoma and cervical cancer. FDG PET/CT has advantage over other imaging modalities because of its whole-body scanning that offers detection of metastasis and any previously unknown malignancy.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written consent for publication could not be obtained despite all reasonable attempts.

However, there is no consensus regarding the course of treatment after the onset of anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors related drug-induced interstitial lung disease.\n\n【3】Here, we present a case of successful lorlatinib treatment after the onset of drug-induced interstitial lung disease caused by alectinib.\n\n【4】### Case presentation\n\n【5】A 57-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with stage IVB non-small cell lung cancer by bronchoscopy, but gene mutation testing could not be performed because of the small amount of specimen. After diagnosis, first-line therapy with cisplatin/pemetrexed was initiated, but the patient developed renal dysfunction. Bronchoscopy was performed again to guide further treatment, and the non-small cell lung cancer was found to be anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive. Alectinib was started after the onset of progressive disease, but it resulted in drug-induced interstitial lung disease, necessitating alternative treatments. He subsequently received nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel, which was halted in view of the renal dysfunction. Thereafter, lorlatinib was administered, which was continued without drug-induced interstitial lung disease relapse.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Since alectinib can occasionally cause drug-induced interstitial lung disease, as in the present case, lorlatinib may be an option to continue treatment in patients without other treatment alternatives.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】With the identification of gene abnormalities in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), effective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have been developed for treatment. ALK-TKIs are more effective than cytotoxic chemotherapy, and long-term treatment with TKIs has been shown to prolong the overall survival of patients. Lorlatinib is a novel third-generation ALK TKI that has been shown to be more potent than second-generation TKIs in biochemical and cellular assays and has the broadest coverage of the identified ALK resistance mutations. Additionally, it was designed to cross the blood–brain barrier so as to achieve high exposure levels in the central nervous system (CNS) \\[ 1 \\]. Because of its efficacy, lorlatinib is the standard treatment option for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC for whom one or more ALK-TKIs have failed.\n\n【11】However, it is unclear whether lorlatinib can be used after discontinuation of another ALK-TKI owing to adverse events, for example, in cases of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD). Here, we present a rare case showing the feasibility of continuing lorlatinib after the onset of DILD caused by alectinib.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 57-year-old Japanese man with a chief complaint of hoarseness visited the Otolaryngology Department at our hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor, with its major axis measuring approximately 40 mm in the left upper lobe of the lung. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also swollen (Fig. 1 a). Primary lung cancer was suspected, and the patient was directed to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day that he was admitted to the Otolaryngology Department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) for the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the mediastinal lymph nodes 1 week after the first visit. Genetic mutation testing was not performed because the sample was insufficient. Subsequently, <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ( <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG PET/CT) was performed, and abnormal accumulation was observed in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. The results of the <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG PET/CT and other findings led to the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma \\[cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB\\]. We recommended rebiopsy considering the possibility of a genetic mutation, but the patient refused the examination because of strong coughing during the first bronchoscopy and progressive symptoms of hoarseness. The patient strongly desired an early treatment, so we initiated first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) 3 weeks after the first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction \\[creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> \\], making it difficult to continue the therapy (Fig. 1 b). We informed the patient about the need for a second bronchoscopy for consideration of further treatment and obtained his consent. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and the patient was diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization, 56%). In addition, progressive disease was noted (Fig. 1 c). Development of progressive disease required approximately 9 months, and cisplatin and pemetrexed were administered over four cycles, after which pemetrexed alone was administered over five cycles. Thereafter, second-line therapy with alectinib (300 mg/day) was initiated. Three months after starting alectinib, chest CT showed that the primary lesion had shrunk, and we judged it to be a partial response, but the ground-glass opacities and infiltration continued to spread on both sides (Figs. 1 d, 2 ). At this time, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion, and his saturation of percutaneous oxygen was approximately 82% in room air. Blood gas analysis showed that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 58.2 torr, indicating respiratory failure. A pulmonary function test revealed restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a vital capacity (VC) of 2.11 L and a %VC of 57.1%. A diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.84 mL/min/mmHg and a %DLCO of 22.8% indicated diffusion disorder. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Fig. 3 a) and TBLB samples (Fig. 3 b) were obtained at this time. The BALF showed an increased lymphocyte ratio (34.4%), and pathological analysis of the TBLB specimen revealed an organizing pneumonia (OP)/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) overlapping pattern. On the basis of the chest CT results, we suspected alectinib-induced DILD. However, we also considered respiratory infection or cancerous lymphangiopathy with cancer progression in the differential diagnoses. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9300/µL and a C-reactive protein level of 1.41 mg/dL. The BALF culture results were negative. The BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and no findings suggestive of cancer infiltration were observed in the TBLB specimen. On the basis of these results, we excluded the other conditions evaluated in the differential diagnosis. Our final diagnosis was alectinib-induced DILD. On the basis of the results of chest CT and bronchoscopic pathology, methylprednisolone was prescribed (1 g/day for 3 days). The patient then received oral prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day), which was gradually reduced, and he was administered steroids for about 3 months. Third-line therapy with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel)  (100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) was initiated after treatment with steroids. However, 3 months later, obstructive pneumonia associated with an increase in the size of the primary lesion was observed (Fig. 1 e). Moreover, mild renal dysfunction persisted (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ). Because of this complication and upon the patient’s request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was administered as fourth-line therapy. Treatment with antibiotics and lorlatinib reduced the lesion’s shadow, and no recurrence of DILD was observed. Thirty-three months after the start of treatment, stable disease has been maintained, and lorlatinib has been continued (Figs. 1 f, 4 ).\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Treatment course. First-line treatment with cisplatin/pemetrexed shrunk the primary lesion and mediastinal lymph nodes ( **a** , **b** ), but PD was noticed 9 months after the beginning of treatment ( **c** ). Re-biopsy performed during treatment with cisplatin/pemetrexed indicated that the tumor was ALK-positive. Therefore, second-line treatment with alectinib was subsequently initiated. Although alectinib treatment was successful, the patient developed DILD 4 months after the start of treatment ( **d** ). After DILD was relieved upon treatment with steroids, third-line treatment with nab-paclitaxel was initiated, but PD was observed 4 months later ( **e** ). Thereafter, fourth-line treatment with lorlatinib was started and has been continued for more than 33 months while maintaining SD ( **f** ). _PD_ progressive disease, _ALK_ anaplastic lymphoma kinase, _DILD_ drug-induced interstitial lung disease, _SD_ stable disease, _nab-paclitaxel_ nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Thin-slice CT before and after the onset of DILD. Prior to the onset of DILD ( **a** ), a shadow of the primary lesion was observed in the left upper lobe of the lung. No abnormal shadow was seen in the lung field.

For ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib was more effective than crizotinib in phase III trials (ALEX study) and is, therefore, widely used for first-line treatment \\[ 2 \\]. Lorlatinib and ceritinib are effective against alectinib-resistant lung cancer and have been used in second-line treatments, based on the status of the resistance gene \\[ 3 \\]. Lorlatinib, which is derived from crizotinib, is structurally optimized to inhibit mutations conferring resistance, including G1202R, and those with a high rate of migration to the CNS \\[ 3 \\]. In the CROWN trial, the intracranial response among patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 82%, with a complete intracranial response rate of 71%. In the global ALEX, ALTA-1L, and eXalt3 trials, the corresponding complete intracranial response rates with alectinib, brigatinib, and ensartinib were 38%, 28%, and 27%, respectively \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. Moreover, in the CROWN trial, lorlatinib significantly decreased the cumulative incidence of CNS progression, which suggests that the prolonged progression-free survival seen with lorlatinib may be partly due to the prevention of CNS metastases \\[ 1 \\]. In the CROWN trial, progression-free survival was significantly longer among patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who received first-line lorlatinib than among those who received crizotinib. In untreated patients, lorlatinib may eliminate rare preexisting subclones harboring ALK resistance mutations or prevent the emergence of such resistant subclones \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【32】However, a molecular-targeted drug with a clear antitumor effect may still have to be discontinued upon the occurrence of side effects. The overall frequency of DILD associated with ALK-TKIs is 2.14% \\[ 5 \\]. Although the incidence of DILD secondary to ALK-targeted therapy is low, it carries a 50% risk of mortality according to a previous case series \\[ 6 \\]. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment approach for ALK-TKI-induced DILD or continued treatment for NSCLC after remission of DILD. A limited number of previous case reports have described the successful administration of crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who have recovered from DILD secondary to ALK-targeted therapy \\[ 7 \\]. A report of two cases showed that treatment with lorlatinib was successful after treatment with steroids for DILD caused by alectinib \\[ 7 \\]. However, bronchoscopy, including BALF and TBLB, was not performed in these two patients because their respiratory condition was poor. Therefore, this is the first case in which lorlatinib was administered after treatment with steroids for DILD caused by alectinib after other diseases, such as cancerous lymphangiopathy and infectious diseases, could be ruled out by BALF and TBLB to some extent. In this case, alectinib-induced DILD showed an organizing pneumonia with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia overlapping pattern (OP/NSIP) on chest imaging findings, the BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and the TBLB findings were also consistent with OP/NSIP. Therefore, we expected that steroids would be effective, and when we administered steroids, the DILD improved and we were able to continue treatment for NSCLC.\n\n【33】As of August 2022, no previous study has reported serious lung disease induced by lorlatinib, and it can be administered in normal doses even to patients with renal dysfunction \\[ 8 \\]. As seen in the present case, alectinib can sometimes cause DILD. Therefore, lorlatinib is a viable alternative. Despite their side effects, ALK-TKIs prolong overall survival. The use of an alternative ALK-TKI with proper management of side effects may extend the positive effects on overall survival. Evidence from future studies will help determine the optimal chemotherapy regimen after the onset of ALK-TKI-associated DILD.\n\n【34】In summary, in patients with driver mutation-positive NSCLC, continuation of treatment with TKIs to the maximum extent possible is essential to improve the prognosis. Even after TKI-induced DILD, another TKI may be considered as a treatment option.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】The dataset used and analyzed during the current study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】ALK:\n\n【39】Anaplastic lymphoma kinase\n\n【40】TKIs:\n\n【41】Tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n\n【42】NSCLC:\n\n【43】Non-small cell lung cancer\n\n【44】DILD:\n\n【45】Drug-induced interstitial lung disease\n\n【46】CNS:\n\n【47】Central nervous system\n\n【48】CT:\n\n【49】Computed tomography\n\n【50】TBLB:\n\n【51】Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\n【52】<sup>18 </sup> F-FDG PET/CT:\n\n【53】<sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography\n\n【54】VC:\n\n【55】Vital capacity\n\n【56】DLCO:\n\n【57】Diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide\n\n【58】BALF:\n\n【59】Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid\n\n【60】OP:\n\n【61】Organizing pneumonia\n\n【62】NSIP:\n\n【63】Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This association poses dilemmas in management. We present two such cases (of Indian origin), and briefly discuss the pertinent literature and measures to prevent unfavorable outcome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Case 1: a 1-month-old preterm (1300 g) male neonate belonging to Hindu (Indian) ethnicity presented with recurrent bile-stained vomiting, non-passage of stools and epigastric fullness. A babygram and upper gastrointestinal contrast studies revealed situs inversus and suggested proximal jejunal obstruction with midgut volvulus. Exploration confirmed situs inversus totalis along with reverse rotation and midgut volvulus. There was a small gangrenous area in the proximal jejunal loop. A Ladd’s procedure, resection of the gangrenous jejunal loop, and jejunojejunal anastomosis was performed. Note was made of the unusual appearance of the intestines suggestive either of fibrous or fatty infiltration. Postoperatively, our patient developed septicemia and died.\n\n【5】Case 2: a 4-day-old female neonate belonging to Hindu (Indian) ethnicity, small (1320 g) for gestation, presented with history of non-passage of meconium since birth, refusal to accept feeds, and episodes of recurrent bilious vomiting with abdominal distension. A plain radiogram revealed situs inversus and proximal jejunal obstruction. Ultrasonography of her abdomen revealed renal dysplastic changes in both her kidneys. Laparotomy confirmed multiple jejunoileal atresias with situs inversus totalis. Resection anastomoses was performed for multiple atresias. Our patient passed a few pellets of meconium stools postoperatively; feeds were started gradually on the sixth day. Our patient gradually developed oliguria and renal failure, followed by respiratory distress and generalized edema requiring ventilatory support. She died later due to multiorgan failure.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Clinicians should have high index of suspicion for malrotation with midgut volvulus or intestinal atresias in neonates of situs inversus presenting with bilious vomiting. The surgical treatment should follow the same surgical principles. In situs inversus, because of transposition of viscera, midgut volvulus may occur in an anticlockwise direction, hence derotation is performed clockwise. Prognosis was poor in our series because of low birth weight, late presentation, presence of gangrenous locus in the small bowel and development of septicemia in our first case and multiorgan fibrosis/dysplasia in our second case. Early diagnosis and timely referral is paramount for favorable outcome.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】Situs inversus is a rare condition (1 in 8,500 people) causing mirror image positioning of thoracic and abdominal organs \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Situs inversus abdominus also known as situs inversus with levocardia or left-located heart is a condition with right-to-left reversal limited to the abdomen \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. In situs inversus totalis, other structural malformations are uncommon in most individuals, but they are slightly more frequent than in people with situs solitus \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Many people with situs inversus are unacquainted of their unusual anomaly until they are evaluated medically for unrelated conditions. Situs inversus totalis complicating neonatal intestinal obstruction is very rare and presents dilemmas in management \\[ 5 \\]. We describe two neonates with neonatal intestinal obstruction in association with situs inversus totalis, briefly discuss the pertinent literature and measures to prevent unfavorable outcome.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Case 1: a 1-month-old preterm, very low birth weight (1300 g), male neonate belonging to Hindu (Indian) ethnicity, presented to our hospital with recurrent bile-stained vomiting, non-passage of stools and epigastric fullness for the last 2 weeks. Antenatal ultrasounds had not been done. On examination, the neonate was afebrile, moderately dehydrated with a pulse rate of 170 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 62 breaths per minute. Chest auscultation revealed cardiac apex on the fifth right intercostal space along the midclavicular line. The abdomen was soft and distended and nasogastric aspirate was bilious. Laboratory investigations revealed a total lymphocyte count (TLC) of 16,200 mm <sup>3 </sup> , a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g, and raised C-reactive protein levels. A babygram revealed dextrocardia, liver opacity on the left side of his abdomen, a splenic shadow and stomach bubble on the right side, which was suggestive of situs inversus totalis. There were few dilated bowel loops in his upper abdomen with a paucity of distal gas shadows (Fig. 1a ). Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast studies suggested a proximal jejunal obstruction and midgut volvulus (Fig. 1b, c ). Preoperative optimization was performed and consent was taken for surgical intervention. Laparotomy findings confirmed situs inversus totalis with his liver and duodenum on the left side, his stomach and spleen on the right side of his abdomen along with malrotation and midgut volvulus with reverse rotation; the caecum and appendix were present in his left upper abdomen (Fig. 2a-c ). There was a small gangrenous area in the proximal jejunal loop. A Ladd’s procedure was performed along with resection of the gangrenous jejunal loop (a few centimeters) and jejunojejunal anastomosis. Note was made of the unusual appearance of his intestines suggestive of either fibrous or fatty infiltration. Postoperatively, our patient passed greenish mucoid stool on the fourth postoperative day, but later developed septicemia with a precipitous downhill course, and finally died on the sixth postoperative day.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Babygram ( **a** ) showing dextrocardia (cardiac apex pointing to the right), liver opacity on the left side, a splenic shadow and stomach bubble on the right side of his abdomen suggestive of situs inversus.

There was no history of consanguinity. On examination, the neonate was hemodynamically stable, dehydrated, and mildly icteric with a pulse rate of 162 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute. There was upper abdominal distension with visible dilated bowel loops. Plain radiographs revealed dextrocardia, liver opacity on the left side of her abdomen, and a stomach bubble on the right side suggestive of situs inversus totalis. There were few dilated bowel loops in her upper abdomen with absence of distal gas shadows (Fig. 3a ). Laboratory values revealed grossly deranged renal functions with abnormally raised urea (89 mg/dL) and creatinine levels (3.5 mg/dL), initially considered to be due to dehydration. Our patient was stabilized and resuscitated; a renal profile showed slightly improved creatinine levels (2.9 mg/dL). Ultrasonography of her abdomen revealed renal dysplastic changes in both kidneys. After optimization, an informed written consent was taken for an operative procedure. Abdominal exploration confirmed multiple jejunoileal atresias with situs inversus totalis (Fig. 4 ). The proximal 15 cm of the dilated jejunum was resected and multiple anastomoses with end-to-back and end-to-end anastomoses and a Heineke–Mikulicz repair were performed for multiple atresias and webs. Our patient passed a few pellets of meconium stools on the fourth postoperative day. Oral feeding was initiated on the sixth day with gradual increments. Our patient passed a few pellet-like meconium stools every second or third day. She did not develop any episode of postoperative vomiting or abdominal distension. Later, our patient redeveloped oliguria with deranged renal parameters (renal failure), respiratory distress, and generalized edema requiring ventilatory support. A chest radiograph performed on the 13 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day revealed infiltration of the lung fields (Fig. 3b ), which was hypothesized as pneumonitis. Our patient died on the 18 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day due to multiorgan failure.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Plain roentgenograms of her chest and abdomen revealing dextrocardia, liver opacity on the left side of her abdomen, and a stomach bubble on the right side suggestive of situs inversus.

It is also known as situs inversus viscerum or situs transversus, or opposites \\[ 1 \\]. The normal anatomical position of internal organs is termed as situs solitus \\[ 3 \\]. Situs inversus was first described in humans by Fabricius, while Vehemeyer gave the radiological diagnosis \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In situs inversus totalis, there is complete right to left reversal of all of the viscera including dextrocardia; the morphologic right atrium is on the left and the left atrium is on the right. The normal pulmonary anatomy is reversed such that the left lung has three lobes and the right lung has two. The liver and gallbladder are located on the left, and spleen and stomach are on the right side \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Associated anomalies with situs anomaly are congenital heart disease (CHD) or splenic malformations \\[ 2 , 8 \\]. Situs inversus may be asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally during laparotomy or autopsy \\[ 8 \\]. But, when associated with midgut volvulus or atresias, it would present early in the neonatal age, as seen in the present series \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【32】Heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguous (4 per 1 million live births) is defined as the abnormal arrangement of organs and vessels as opposed to the orderly arrangement in situs solitus or situs inversus \\[ 10 \\]. It has three major subtypes based on the spleen: (a) asplenia (right atrial isomerism), (b) polysplenia (left atrial isomerism), (c) normal spleen located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It is more commonly associated with CHD (50–90%), malrotation (70–100%) with or without midgut volvulus, and other visceral defects \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【33】Etiologic factors implicated in situs inversus are autosomal recessive gene, maternal diabetes, cocaine abuse, retinoic acid exposure, conjoined twinning, consanguinity and familial (multiple inheritance patterns) \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 12 \\]. There was no history of consanguinity, family history of congenital anomalies, or drug exposure in our series. There is no sex predilection, but in situs ambiguous boys predominate \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【34】Situs inversus presenting in the neonatal period with gastrointestinal complaints is typically an abdominal emergency \\[ 13 \\]. The diagnosis of situs inversus in association with neonatal intestinal obstruction is suggested by radiographs and confirmed by upper gastrointestinal contrast studies, as performed in case 1 \\[ 13 \\]. Ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen may reveal the inverse relationship of superior mesenteric vessels in patients with malrotation; a whirlpool sign is seen in midgut volvulus \\[ 14 \\]. Situs inversus represents a spectrum of rotational anomalies of gastrointestinal tract \\[ 8 \\]. Differential diagnosis includes multiple organ malrotation syndrome \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【35】Echocardiography is important to evaluate CHD. It could not be performed due to resource limitations in our series. An easy way of predicting the likelihood of CHD in a neonate with a situs abnormality (excluding situs ambiguous) is to observe the laterality of stomach and cardiac apex. If the both are on the same side of the body, the risk of associated CHD is relatively low, whereas if they are on opposite sides, the risk is relatively high. Thus, severity of CHD is proportional to the failure of cardiac shift with respect to the cardiac situs within the thorax \\[ 10 \\]. CHD is associated with poor survival in neonates with situs abnormality.\n\n【36】The association of neonatal intestinal obstruction (midgut volvulus or multiple intestinal atresias) with situs inversus abdominus is rare, but its association with situs inversus totalis is extremely rare \\[ 6 , 9 , 16 \\].The presence of multiple jejunoileal atresias in our second case could be due to vascular insult as a consequence of the situs anomaly. Malrotation and midgut volvulus in our first case occurred anticlockwise as compared to a clockwise rotation in classical volvulus.\n\n【37】Gastrointestinal anomalies associated with situs inversus are duodenal atresia, annular pancreas, biliary atresia, preduodenal portal vein, diaphragmatic hernia, lung cyst, genitourinary anomalies, ear, eye, and vertebral defects \\[ 13 \\]. Association of situs inversus totalis with a varying spectrum of renal dysplasia, pancreatic dysplasia/fibrosis/cysts, interstitial (lung fibrosis), and intrahepatic biliary dysgenesis and meconium ileus have been reported earlier \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. The second case in our series had intrauterine growth retardation, bilateral renal dysplastic changes, passed pellets of meconium stool (as seen in meconium ileus), and developed infiltration of the lung fields. Although an exact pathological diagnosis could not be established (with the parents not consenting to an autopsy), gross abnormalities indicated a diagnosis of multiorgan fibrosis/dysplasia, similar to the Japanese report \\[ 17 \\]. Intrauterine growth retardation was also seen in cases reported by Balci _et al._ \\[ 20 \\]. This syndrome had an unfavorable outcome in most patients \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. Antenatal diagnosis of this syndrome with its known lethality (as seen in our second case) should raise the question of continuation of such pregnancy.\n\n【38】The treatment of neonatal intestinal obstruction associated with situs inversus totalis should follow the same surgical principles as performed for classical cases. Appropriate incision placement is required. Elective intervention is always better tolerated than an emergency surgery \\[ 11 \\]. The classic treatment for malrotation is the Ladd procedure \\[ 21 \\]. In situs inversus, because of transposition of viscera, the direction of rotation should be checked as midgut volvulus may occur in an anticlockwise direction, necessitating derotation in a clockwise manner (as performed in our first case) \\[ 6 , 16 \\].\n\n【39】In our series, unfavorable outcome in our first case was due to a combination of factors, like late presentation, low birth weight, presence of gangrenous locus in the small bowel, superimposed by septicemia. Thus, early diagnosis and timely referral along with strict asepsis is paramount for a favorable outcome. In our second case, we believe that, because of the presence of other severe anomalies, the condition was incompatible with life and further research is required to come to any final conclusion.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】Clinicians should have high index of suspicion for neonatal intestinal obstruction in a situs inversus patient presenting with bilious vomiting. In contrast, clinicians should look for situs anomaly when viewing plain radiographs of pediatric patients with malrotation or jejunoileal atresias. The surgical treatment should follow the same surgical principles as performed for classical cases. In situs inversus, because of the transposition of viscera, midgut volvulus may occur in an anticlockwise direction, hence derotation is performed clockwise. Prognosis was poor in our series because of low birth weight, late presentation, presence of gangrenous locus in the small bowel, and development of septicemia in our first case and multiorgan fibrosis/dysplasia in our second case. Early diagnosis and timely referral is paramount for a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In parental alienation, one parent, the alienating parent, forms an alliance with the child involved in the custody dispute and manages to effectively alienate the targeted parent completely. The child and the alienating parent manifest a form of _folie à deux_ and, hence, are in complete synchrony in the hatred and denigration of the targeted parent. Issues, such as potentially false allegations of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse of the child by the targeted parent, arise. The child and the alienating parent become mutually convinced of the targeted parent’s transgressions. Consequently, it becomes difficult for the courts and psychiatric professionals to differentiate true abuse from parental alienation.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In this case study, we aimed to conduct an in-depth psychological and psychiatric evaluation of a Lebanese family (white race) where a father was wrongly accused by the mother and his 11-year-old white boy of both physical and sexual abuse. The data for this study were collected through unstructured and semi-structured interviews, observations, and psychological tests (Rorschach test for the parents and Blacky test for the child), and through the analysis of documented evidence presented in the trial.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case manifested most criteria set forth for the diagnosis of parental alienation and created serious doubt regarding the validity of the allegations set forth by the mother and the child. Uncovered parental alienation often misleads mental health professionals at the expense of the child’s mental health .\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】In the early 1970’s, a new law was established in Michigan to protect the best interest of the child and grant minor children the rights of a relationship with both parents during a custody dispute. Thus, the “tender years presumption,” which assumed that the mother knows best, was replaced by the “best interest of the child” presumption, which is based on the idea that the best parent is “both parents” \\[ 1 \\]. This law has led to custodial arrangements that benefit the child by ensuring the receipt of emotional (love, affection, and so on) and basic life needs (food, clothing, medical care, and so on) from both parents. However, this is not always the case; custodial arrangements could have more precarious effects when parents are at war over the custody of a child. As a result, one parent may try to damage the relationship of the child with the other parent and turn the child’s emotion against that other parent.\n\n【10】By the 1980’s, Dr. Richard Gardner, a forensic psychiatrist, began to observe a previously and rarely described disorder in which the child is being turned against one parent in extended custody litigation \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. He was the first to identify and name this phenomenon as parental alienation syndrome (PAS). Later, during 1986, two psychologists in Michigan, Blush and Ross, who were unaware of the publications and research of Gardner, published the first of several papers on sex abuse allegations in divorce (SAID) syndrome \\[ 4 \\]. They outlined typologies for the accused parent, the child involved, and the falsely accusing parent, the latter parent frequently being the mother. Subsequently, Jacobs in New York and Wallerstein in California published case reports of what they called Medea syndrome \\[ 5 , 6 \\], mothers who took their revenge on their former husbands by depriving them of their children. Jacobs commented on Gardner’s work on PAS in his study (1988) of a mother with Medea syndrome, a severe form of alienation. So did Turkat when he described divorce-related malicious mother syndrome, where the divorced or divorcing parent tends to harm the child so that the other parent may look bad, as an abnormal behavior during divorce \\[ 7 \\]. It must be noted that fathers too have been described to have this disorder \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【11】Throughout the years, many authors went on to omit the term “syndrome,” describing parental alienation (PA) as a disorder arising primarily in the context of child custody disputes \\[ 9 \\]. However, PA does not exist in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) or in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR). The main reason behind its non-classification is the lack of studies in the scientific literature that strengthen the validity of this concept. Subsequently, many definitions of parental alienation have been offered; however, the most compelling definition is still the one from Dr. Richard Gardner since it includes the causes of PA. As per Gardner, PA is primarily manifested as the preoccupation of the child with the deprecation and criticism of one parent, where the denigration of the targeted parent is unjustified and/or exaggerated \\[ 10 \\]. The campaign of condemnation of the parent results from a combination of brainwashing or programming of the child by the accusing parent and the child’s own contribution to the slander of the targeted parent. These two factors may, and usually do, mutually reinforce one another.\n\n【12】As a consequence, Harman showed in his review that PA is still socially and politically denied and highlighted the need for better diagnostic tools to recognize and intervene early to benefit the alienating child \\[ 11 \\]. Based on their understanding of the components of PA, Bernet and Greenhill established the Five-Factor Model (FFM) to aid in diagnosis. These factors consist of (1) the child’s avoidance of one of the parents; (2) the presence of a prior positive relationship between the child and the alienated parent; (3) the absence of abuse, deficient parenting, or neglect by the alienated parent; (4) the use of multiple alienating behaviors on the part of the alienating parent; and (5) the child’s exhibition of many alienating behavioral signs \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【13】Families affected by PA experience some degree of trauma. The alienating child lives in what is essentially a cult, whose main objective is the alienation of the targeted parent. Therefore, those who are charged with the investigation of allegations of child abuse must be very sensitive to the situation and always consider the best interest of the child, without causing damage to potentially innocent families or parents against whom accusations are made.\n\n【14】The scientific literature suggests that PA is a real phenomenon that affects the mental health of thousands of children and their families. However, PA is not recognized in many countries including Great Britain, and evidence-bases interventions specifically for PA do not exist. Moreover, there is not enough published research to support the inclusion of PA in the DSM 5-TR or the ICD-11. Our aim is to contribute to the scientific literature on PA and highlight the importance of early recognition by showing its psychological repercussion. Only after PA is recognized can proper treatment take place.\n\n【15】Our manuscript is the first Lebanese case report of parental alienation. We conducted an in-depth psychological and psychiatric investigation of a case where the father was accused by the mother and the child of physical and sexual abuse of the latter. The father claimed that he was wrongly accused of this crime. We will also speak about the consequences suffered by the accused parent while trying to illustrate the measures that were taken to ensure the best interest of the child.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】Data were collected through unstructured and semi-structured interviews, observations, psychological tests (Rorschach test for the parents and Blacky test for the child), and analysis of documented evidence that was presented in the trial. Written consent was obtained from the parents.\n\n【18】### The accused parent’s account of the events\n\n【19】Mr. R is the second of a family of five children who had a calm and pleasant childhood and adolescence. He met Mrs. R, his wife, who supported him leaving to go to Argentina in 2000 to work as a courier following the economic difficulties in Lebanon. They got married in 2003 in Turkey. The husband reported that the wife spent the honeymoon in tears, as she was very upset about leaving her family. He stated that he supported his wife during this phase since she was an only child and very attached to her parents. A few days after, Mr. and Mrs. R moved to Argentina together.\n\n【20】Mr. R. was a hard worker and reached the position of operation manager in his company. Four years later, during Mrs. R’s fifth month of pregnancy, she decided to leave her husband in Argentina and come back to Lebanon to deliver their first son, J. However, she refused to rejoin her husband in Argentina after her delivery, claiming that he had mistreated her and that she wanted to stay in Lebanon. Conflicts started between the couple; as a result, Mr. R decided to file for a divorce. Following this decision, Mrs. R allowed her husband to listen to J’s breathing and crying through phone calls. However, when he refused to return to Lebanon, she forbade him from speaking with the child. She even took legal actions to prohibit Mr. R from seeing his son in case he decided to return to Lebanon. During the 3-year divorce process, she refused to give Mr. R the right to speak to his son, until he was able to secure a court order of his own, allowing him to return and see his son. Despite the court order, the mother refused to give Mr. R the right to see the child until the court imposed a term of imprisonment if she refused to comply with the court order. Therefore, Mr. R’s first meeting with J was held in the house of a relative of the child’s mother when J was 3 years old.\n\n【21】Three years later, in 2014, Mrs. R suggested bringing J to Argentina for a 2-week vacation with his father. The vacation was an outstanding success, and the bond between J and his father strengthened. In 2016, Mrs. R proposed returning to live in Argentina with Mr. R, who accepted for the sake of the child. However, soon after the reunion of the family, Mr. R noticed that Mrs. R was frequently using a nonverbal language with J that he could not understand, which made him feel excluded. As a result, the relationship between the father and his son began to deteriorate.\n\n【22】After spending a year in Argentina, the family decided to visit Lebanon for a summer vacation and return to Argentina afterwards. However, while packing up their luggage, Mrs. R left J’s favorite toy, his PlayStation, at his maternal grandparents’ house, and packed J’s clothes into a separate suitcase. As a consequence, J manifested an overt tantrum and started squealing loudly at the airport that he wanted to be protected from his father. Mr. R was shocked and ashamed of his child’s behavior and left his family at the airport. Following this incident, Mrs. R and J refused to speak or see Mr. R when he returned to Lebanon and accused Mr. R of physically and sexually assaulting J. Mr. R was not allowed to see his son through all the trials and tribulations.\n\n【23】### The mother’s point of view\n\n【24】During the interview, Mrs. R accused her husband of physically abusing her shortly after their wedding. She claimed that her husband lied about living with her in Lebanon, the reason why she was asking for divorce. In her allegations during the divorce process, Mrs. R did not mention any physical assault by her husband. On the contrary, she claimed that she stayed in touch with Mr. R for the sake of J until “her husband stopped calling her.” She admitted refusing to give Mr. R the right to see J alone, under the pretext of protecting her child from any harm/endangerment. She described their lives in Argentina as horrible and disclosed thoroughly the situation they were living in. She characterized Mr. R as a brutal man who was very aggressive with J.\n\n【25】According to her, Mr. R was beating J and molesting him by touching him on his breast area and licking his ears with excitement. She claimed that she could not protect herself or J because Mr. R did not let her interfere in the father–son relationship. As a result, she claimed that J refused any contact with Mr. R to keep himself and his mother safe from the relentless behavior of his father. She also attested that Mr. R would physically abuse J by hitting and spanking him violently. Consequently, J had pain in his hands and body, which prevented him from being able to write in school. She claimed that she took J once to the police station, where the police officers recommended arresting Mr. R. However, she refused to take further legal actions in the interest of protecting her family and because she was not willing to end up living in Argentina alone with no friends or family members.\n\n【26】She also reported that, following the child’s nervous breakdown at the airport, symptoms of fatigue, sadness, lack of concentration, social withdrawal, isolation, anhedonia, and unjustified fears began to appear. He was diagnosed later on with anxious–depressive disorder and was prescribed clomipramine 10 mg twice daily and diazepam 2.5 mg in the evening and 5 mg at bedtime. She claimed that the psychiatrist and psychotherapist reported physical violence but no sexual assault, and that J’s psychiatrist revealed in a private call with her that the child reported some sexual abuse by his father.\n\n【27】Mrs. R implored the sparing of her son of any questions and interviews concerning this matter, as J was too sensitive when asked about this story. J, who was present at the time of the interview with his mother, showed signs of anxiety, fatigue, and physical signs of nausea and abdominal pain. Mrs. R said that her son was not feeling any better, despite taking his psychiatric treatment, especially when he knew about the return of his father to Lebanon. He felt afraid and refused to leave his house, preferring to play computer games in his room. She added that J had thrown away his PlayStation, as it is a gift from his father. She also told us that J was willing to change his last name to his mother’s family name. In fact, Mrs. R presented her son with her family name instead of his father’s last name upon introducing J to us. She claimed that she was doing that to protect her son from his father, and that she is quite capable of raising her son with her parents’ help without any intervention from Mr. R.\n\n【28】### J’s story\n\n【29】J, the son of Mr. and Mrs. R, considered himself a particularly good student, having only a few difficulties in Arabic courses after returning to Lebanon from Argentina, since he did not take any Arabic courses in Argentina. In school, he preferred acting classes as an extracurricular activity. He claimed that he had made good friends with his maternal cousins and was happy living with his maternal grandparents. He said that he always considers his maternal grandfather to be his real father and Mr. R to be his uncle.\n\n【30】When speaking about his father, he stated weak, illogical reasons for his anger and fear towards his father. J was very confident about these negative feelings and confessed that he wanted to see his father dead. He even claimed that he would kill himself or his father if he was forced to see him.\n\n【31】He declared that no one instructed him about what to say, and he was only expressing his feelings about this matter. He said that he was physically assaulted by his father, and he was beaten up daily for no specific reason. He alleged that his father took him twice to strip shows in Argentina and forced him to watch pornography.\n\n【32】He described scenes where his father would abuse him physically and sexually every single day. When confronted with photos in which J appeared happy and smiling with his father, he said that he was obliged by his father to smile for the camera. He insisted that he was permanently sad in Argentina because of his father’s abuse.\n\n【33】J showed no regret or guilt towards his father but felt constantly guilty towards his mother because he was the one who accepted to go to Argentina and live with his father in the first place. He refused to see his father’s family because they were unpleasant towards him and reminded him of his father. J seemed fearful when speaking about his father and showed constant refusal to speak when asked about the whole story. He just wanted to forget his father and change his father’s family name to his mother’s. He showed some resistance and an overt refusal to visit his father, even when reassured that the visit would be supervised and safe.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】This is the first reported case in Lebanon regarding a parental alienation case that occurred in the context of custody disputes during and after parental divorce, in which the mother intended to destroy the relationship of the child with his father by manipulating the child so that he would demonize his father. This paper focuses on the psychological motives behind the PA during divorce litigation of the alienated parent, the alienating parent, and the child, which seems to be important for optimal intervention for the child’s profit.\n\n【36】In opposition to the alienating parent, the alienated parent tends to describe their distress because their child is rejecting them. They usually describe how close their relationship was with the child and how distraught they felt when they attempted to approach or visit their son or daughter. Most targeted parents agree that their children should be raised in a loving environment, away from parent’s animosity and conflict. As a result, the targeted parents are usually not responsible for being rejected by the child, and therefore, do not usually exhibit any psychopathology \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【37】However, some targeted parents describe alienating behavior as family violence, and negative automatic thoughts and feelings tend to be described by them \\[ 14 \\]. In fact, about one-third of targeted parents report having attempted suicide \\[ 15 \\]. However, in our case, the targeted parent tried to avoid being overly influenced by negative emotions by showing some control over them during interviews. This is a common active coping behavior style, which can be quite effective, especially if the person is flexible about its use, for a preservation of their self-image \\[ 16 \\]. In fact, the father’s psychological assessment in our study showed that he is a very communicative and cooperative person. He was eloquent and direct in all his answers throughout the interviews and tended to describe events thoroughly. He stayed calm and self-controlled even when he was put in the accused position. He did not appear impulsive or carried away by his reactions or emotional expressions at any time. Ordinarily, he appeared to be intellectual, with preference to delay decisions or behaviors until he had considered various opinions. He strives to be logical and relies on his own internal evaluations rather than external feedback when making decisions. This strategy shows clear, reasonably sophisticated, and often creative thinking that reinforced the active role of the targeted parent to help his child’s independence and emancipation \\[ 17 \\], as shown by the Rorschach test results in our study.\n\n【38】The alienating parent, however, usually justifies their doings by focusing on what is the best to be done in the interest of the child. Douglas Damal described such behavior in alienators as obsessions, where the alienating parent tends to rationalize their behavior by believing that the child is a victim of abuse \\[ 18 \\] and, as a result, tends to destroy the relationship with the targeted parent. Such behavior usually relies on pathological personality traits or mental illness, showing a lack of personal self-control with a defensive attitude, which reinforces the delusion exhibited by the alienating parent of reasonably fearing and hating the nonpreferred parent \\[ 19 \\]. In fact, the psychological assessment of Mrs. R showed an excessively inflexible, unrealistic, egocentric, self-centered attitude, with explicit contradictions in her ideas and expressions. Such a defensive attitude during clinical interviews creates doubts about the validity of her claims, not only among clinicians but also in court. In fact, courts had credited the mother’s claim of child abuse only one-third of the time \\[ 20 \\]; child sexual abuse claims in custody litigation are rarely accepted when presented in courts compared with physical abuse claims alone \\[ 21 \\]. Another study found that when allegations from the alienating parent are mixed, the odds of losing custody increase 2.5 times when claiming both sexual and physical abuse toward the child compared with sexual allegations only \\[ 8 \\]. Our results were consistent with the results of this prior study, with no clear reasons behind this.\n\n【39】Mrs. R also lacks insight into herself and the ability to engage in self-criticism. She was completely and totally convinced that her allegations were justified and was totally committed to estranging her son from his abusive father. Obsessed alienators also tend to entrap their children’s beliefs into their own, projecting their own irrational delusions on the child and gaining a feeling of control of the situation \\[ 22 \\]. In fact, Mrs. R has an excessively dependent and overprotective relationship with the child. The overall clinical and psychological assessment showed a paranoid personality disorder, frequently found among alienating parents \\[ 14 , 23 \\]. In addition, quenchless anger has been reported among obsessive alienators, who show poor coping skills and impulsive behavior, especially when put under stress \\[ 18 \\]. The psychological testing of Mrs. R revealed some weakness in the control of affective and behavioral impulses, leading to expression of aggression and authoritarian behavior toward others. She lacked any impulse control and appeared very rigid and self-confident, features of grandiose and narcissistic behavior. She also tried to control the other parent \\[ 24 \\]. Parents divorcing often realize that they still need to communicate with each other to ensure the child’s ordinary activities such as school functions, activities, and so on \\[ 25 \\]. This is usually not the case in parental alienation, and the alienating parent does not believe anymore that they must communicate with the other parent for the best interest of the children, which could explain the narcissistic traits found in Mrs. R. In fact, she had found a way to express her anger through the child, using the child as a messenger to manifest feelings of revenge towards his father. As a matter of fact, Mrs. R’s psychological testing revealed her tendency to express aggressiveness without any significant provocation, with a restricted ability to show empathy and warm affect. Her inaptitude for self-criticism during interviews lead her to an explosive emotional outburst, making her look aggressive and unpleasant. One study found similar characteristics among alienated mothers, who show hostile impulses and unrestricted blame toward the targeted parent \\[ 26 \\].\n\n【40】Since the alienated child was freely expressing hostile feelings toward the targeted parent, focusing on the psychological aspects of the child and his parental relationships could help the professional involved in the custody dispute to differentiate parental alienation from simple parenting divorce. After exhibiting refusal behavior in the first stage of custody dispute, J seemed to enjoy the company of his father while passing the holidays in Argentina. However, the relationship of J with his father strongly deteriorated after his return to the alienated parent, accusing his father of physically and sexually abusing him, even if the physical assessment of J did not show any sign of recent or old physical abuse. This is consistent with Joseph Goldberg’s assertion that the visitation process goes through three stages: resistance, pleasure, and confliction \\[ 27 \\]. In fact, the alienating parent usually use strategies of threats and intimidation against the child whenever pleasure is felt during the visit of the alienated parent \\[ 28 \\], removing by that any good feeling that could have arisen during the visitation’s pleasure phase. In doing so, the alienated child learns somehow to express rejection toward the alienated parent, avoiding the alienating parent’s negative reaction.\n\n【41】In addition, the alienated child usually lacks feelings of guilt and ambivalence towards the alienated parent \\[ 16 \\] and finds it difficult to be separated from the alienating parent since the rejected parent is slowly being pushed out of his parental role. In fact, the psychological assessment of J showed a symbiotic relationship with his mother. He is bonding with her and finds himself unable to be separated from his mother. Thus, J, who was totally relying on his mother to have his needs met, could not develop a separate identity from her. J continued to be dependent on his mother, which encouraged the development of a complex mother-to-son relationship that motivated the denigration of his relationship with his father, by exhibiting his severe oppositional behavior toward him.\n\n【42】The symbiotic bonding of the child with the alienating mother is sometimes described as a Stockholm syndrome \\[ 29 \\]. Imitating the alienating parent is one method used by the alienated child to survive the alienating parent’s psychological pressure, to regain their worthiness in the eyes of the alienating parent. Thus, maintenance of the negative emotional climate when around the alienated parent is essential to gain the trust of the alienating parent. Soon, the child will generalize their negative emotions to anything that relates to the alienated parent. In fact, such defamation leads to the loss of the children’s loving care and attention from the targeted parent, resulting in behavioral problems including attention difficulties, anxiety, depression, and aggression \\[ 30 \\], and experiencing substantial losses across their lives later \\[ 31 \\]. Studies show that adults who were child victims of parental alienation report low self-esteem, mood disorders, attachment, and interpersonal relationship problems \\[ 32 , 33 , 34 \\]. They also tend to describe experiencing abuse by the alienating parent \\[ 34 \\]. In our case, J had a nervous breakdown at the airport and was treated with antidepressants and anxiolytics after his psychiatric consultation, which shows the possibility of developing a mood disorder in adulthood.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【44】The data from the case study appear to be in line with Gardner’s observations of PA \\[ 10 \\]. The mother turned the child against his father through powerful emotional manipulation techniques designed to bond with the child at the expense of excluding his father. The mother–son relationship did not encourage independent thinking skills in the child but rather motivated an unhealthy dependence toward her instead, satisfying through these means the emotional needs of the mother rather than the developmental needs of the child. The evaluation concluded that the mother’s inability to differentiate her own needs from those of the child led the child to target his father, characteristics found and confirmed in parental alienation.\n\n【45】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】Not applicable.\n\n【47】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【48】PA:\n\n【49】Parental alienation\n\n【50】PAS:\n\n【51】Parental alienation syndrome", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Combining programmed death-1 inhibitor with stereotactic body radiotherapy showed a slight toxicity and good benefits in recent clinical trials. However, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were excluded from most trials because it was assumed that their anti-tumor immunity was compromised compared with immunocompetent patients.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In June 2016, a 52-year-old Chinese man presented with human immunodeficiency virus and lung adenocarcinoma (T1bN3M1b). From November 2016 to December 2016, systemic chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis of femoral neck were carried out, but the tumor progressed. In January 2017, after immunochemistry detection of programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 expression (both > 50%), pembrolizumab was started. Three weeks after pembrolizumab, we combined stereotactic body radiotherapy for the primary lung tumor. He received no comfort and his CD4 lymphocyte count was stable. Human immunodeficiency virus-ribonucleic acid remained below the limits of detection. In March 2017, after three cycles of pembrolizumab and 5 weeks of stereotactic body radiotherapy therapy, he suddenly presented with palpitations. Emergency computed tomography scanning showed massive pericardial effusion and interstitial pneumonia. So we interrupted the pembrolizumab use and initiated treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg; however, the tumor progressed. Then, his CD4 lymphocyte count declined. Finally he died in June 2017 due to dyscrasia.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Pembrolizumab combined with SBRT therapy for patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and non-small cell lung cancer may lead to serious immune-related adverse events and more clinical trials are needed.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Pembrolizumab, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has significantly improved outcomes in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \\[ 1 \\].Combining PD-1 inhibitor with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) showed a slight toxicity and good benefits in recent clinical trials \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. However, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were excluded from most trials, because it was assumed that their anti-tumor immunity was compromised compared with immunocompetent patients.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Here, we report the case of a patient with HIV and advanced NSCLC who was treated with PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) combined with SBRT.\n\n【12】In June 2016, a 52-year-old Chinese man who had never smoked tobacco, who had an initial diagnosis of HIV infection in 2013 with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, was diagnosed as having advanced lung adenocarcinoma (T1bN3M1b) with _KRAS_ mutation (exon 2 deletion). From November 2016 to December 2016, systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin/pemetrexed for two cycles) and palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis of femoral neck (intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 48 Gy/16 fractions) were carried out, but the tumor progressed with new metastatic lymph nodes (Fig. 1a ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**a** Before treatment, tumors of the lung (posterior segment of upper lobe of right lung) and the ipsilateral femoral neck, as well as a small amount of axillary and cervical lymph nodes, were found by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. **b** After chemoradiotherapy, the tumors in the lung and femoral neck were controlled. However, the tumor of axillary and cervical lymph nodes progressed. Meanwhile, immunochemistry detection showed that programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 expression were more than 50% in the tumor cells and immune cells of biopsy tissues of the cervical lymph node and primary lung tumor. **c** After three cycles of pembrolizumab and 5 weeks of stereotactic body radiotherapy therapy, the patient presented with pericardial effusion and interstitial pneumonia. _PD-1_ programmed death-1, _PD-L1_ programmed death-ligand 1, _SBRT_ stereotactic body radiotherapy\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】In January 2017, after immunochemistry detection of PD-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (both > 50%, Fig. 1b ), pembrolizumab was started (2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks). Three weeks after pembrolizumab, we combined SBRT for the primary lung tumor (50 Gy/five fractions, every other day). Our patient received no comfort and his CD4 lymphocyte count was stable. Human immunodeficiency virus-ribonucleic acid (HIV-RNA) remained below the limits of detection.\n\n【18】In March 2017, after three cycles of the pembrolizumab and 5 weeks of SBRT therapy, he suddenly presented with palpitations. Emergency computed tomography (CT) scanning showed massive pericardial effusion and interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 1c ). So we interrupted the pembrolizumab use and initiated treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg; however, the tumor progressed. Then, his CD4 lymphocyte count declined. Finally he died in June 2017 due to dyscrasia.\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】The use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy has prolonged the survival of patients with HIV, which increased the incidence of HIV-related malignancies, including lung cancer \\[ 4 \\]. The treatment of patients with HIV infection and NSCLC has rapidly gained attention. Both mechanisms of pembrolizumab and SBRT therapy aroused anti-tumor effect of immunity cells \\[ 5 \\]. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on treating patients with HIV infection and NSCLC by combining pembrolizumab with SBRT consecutively.\n\n【21】The latest two case reports on PD-1 inhibitor in treating patients with HIV infection and NSCLC were inconsistent. Regarding the tumor response, one case had complete remission \\[ 6 \\], but the other progressed \\[ 7 \\]. Our results were in line with the latter. One reason might be that the anti-tumor effect of immunity cells was weakened after chemoradiotherapy. We also thought that impaired bone marrow reserve resulting from chemoradiotherapy may have contributed to the CD4 cell decline.\n\n【22】It seems that HIV status has no impact on the local tumor immune microenvironment, including immune cell subset (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD68) infiltration or PD-L1 expression \\[ 8 \\]. However, it is difficult to explain the mechanism of rapid immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). The latest retrospective controlled study ( _n_ \\= 164) showed that thoracic radiotherapy did not increase the risk of interstitial pneumonia \\[ 9 \\]. In this case, we report other IRAEs of pericardial effusion. It is essential to select defining biomarkers that predict immunotherapy response and IRAEs \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【23】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【24】Pembrolizumab combined with SBRT therapy for patients with HIV infection and NSCLC may lead to serious IRAEs and more clinical trials are needed.\n\n【25】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【26】IRAEs:\n\n【27】Immune-related adverse events\n\n【28】NSCLC:\n\n【29】Non-small cell lung cancer\n\n【30】PD-1:\n\n【31】Programmed death-1\n\n【32】PD-L1 :\n\n【33】Programmed death-ligand 1\n\n【34】SBRT:\n\n【35】Stereotactic body radiotherapy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Favorable outcomes can be achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Cervical disc herniation is generally caused by degeneration of the cervical vertebrae. Symptomatic cervical disc herniation is a common cause of radiculopathy, and there is a clear peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades \\[ 1 \\]. Because disc degeneration advances with age, the development of a symptomatic herniated cervical disc before the age of 20 is extremely rare. All of the sporadically reported cases with cervical disc herniation before the age of 20 had underlying disease, such as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) \\[ 2 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, symptomatic cervical disc herniation occurring in teenaged patients without underlying disease has not been previously reported in the English literature. We report herein two cases of symptomatic cervical disc herniation with no trauma or underlying disease in teenaged patients.\n\n【11】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A 19-year-old Asian man was experiencing pain in his upper left scapula. One week after the onset of the pain, he had difficulty lifting his left arm and visited our clinic. The pain radiated from the left side of his neck through the scapular region with neck extension, and was controlled with analgesic medication. He had no relevant family history, such as congenital spine abnormalities, and had no past history of trauma or birth injuries. Neurological examination showed weakness of the left deltoid and biceps brachii muscles (power, 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 5, respectively), decreased sensation of his left lateral upper arm, and a hypotonic left biceps tendon reflex. The Spurling test, which is positive if the patient produces symptoms when the patient laterally flexes and extends the neck with the examiner applying axial pressure on the spine, was positive on the left side. Cervical radiculopathy score, an assessment system proposed by Tanaka evaluating pain, disability, and neurological status on a 20-point scale, with 20 being no pain, disability, and neurological findings, was 5 out of 20 \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【14】Plain radiography was normal with no evidence of degeneration or calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a herniated intervertebral disc in the left C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (Figure 1 a, b). C5 radiculopathy by soft disc herniation at C4-C5 was diagnosed.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**Case 1.** Left parasagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the cervical spine **(a)** and axial T1-weighted MRI scan at the C4-C5 level **(b)** showing a herniated intervertebral disc in the left C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (arrows).\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Initial management consisted of pharmacologic pain control, relative rest, and a hard cervical collar worn in a position to maximize arm pain reduction. Mechanical traction was not applied. However, since there were no signs of improvement in muscle weakness despite conservative treatment for two weeks following admission, microsurgical posterior foraminotomy was performed \\[ 4 \\]. The patient’s pain and motor strength improved gradually after surgery. The patient had recovered completely eight weeks after the surgery. Cervical radiculopathy score was 19 at the final follow-up three years after surgery.\n\n【20】### Case 2\n\n【21】A 15-year-old Asian man experienced sudden neck pain on the right side and had difficulty lifting his right arm when he woke up one morning. The symptoms continued for two weeks and he presented to our clinic. His neck pain increased with neck extension. He had no relevant family or past history that included congenital abnormality or trauma. Neurological examination showed weakness of the right deltoid and biceps brachii muscles (power, 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 5, respectively), and a hypotonic right biceps tendon reflex. No obvious sensory loss was present. Cervical radiculopathy score was 13 out of 20. Plain radiography showed no abnormality. An MRI scan demonstrated a herniated intervertebral disc in the right C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (Figure 2 a, b). The herniated disc showed partial contrast enhancement after administration of Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (Figure 2 c).\n\n【22】**Figure 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Case 2.** Right parasagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the cervical spine **(a)** and axial T1-weighted MRI scan at the C4-C5 level **(b)** showing a herniated intervertebral disc in the right C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (arrows). The herniated disc is partially enhanced after contrast medium **(c)** (arrow).\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Since the muscle weakness improved within the first week after admission, the patient was treated conservatively and put under observation only. Muscle strength had recovered to 4 by the third week, and after eight weeks, the patient had completely recovered. Cervical radiculopathy score was 20 at the final follow-up of two years.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Cervical disc herniation, a well-known cause of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy, is more common in men and often occurs in those 40 to 60 years of age, with an average age of around 50 years. C5-C6 is frequently involved in the case of cervical myelopathy, whereas C6-C7 is more common in radiculopathy \\[ 5 \\]. In both cases presented, C4-C5 was the affected level, with deltoid muscle strength of 2 and difficulty in arm lifting (using the positive drop-arm sign). Since C4-C5 is the level with the greatest rotation and lateral flexion movement among the middle and lower cervical vertebrae \\[ 6 \\], and since mobility of the cervical vertebrae tends to decrease with advancing age \\[ 7 \\], it is possible that this level was affected due to the tendency for C4-C5 to be vulnerable to loading in young people with no degeneration.\n\n【29】There have been scattered reports of cervical disc herniation occurring in young people \\[ 2 , 8 , 9 \\]. However, all of the previously reported cases had underlying disease, that is, a complication of intervertebral disc calcification or KFS \\[ 2 \\]. Samartzis _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] reported a 16-year-old KFS boy with occipitalization of C1 and fusion of C2-C3, and C4-T1 showed cervical disc herniation at his hypermobile segment of C3-C4. In an extensive search of the literature, there were no reports of symptomatic cervical disc herniation occurring in teenaged patients without underlying disease. In this regard, the two cases presented here are extremely rare.\n\n【30】In general, cervical disc herniation responds well to conservative treatment. Saal _et al_ . reported that herniated cervical disc with radiculopathy was successfully managed in 93% of the patients with nonoperative management, including relative rest, cervical collar, analgesic medicine, traction, and physical training \\[ 10 \\]. The authors described that no patients had progressive neurological loss or reached a neurological catastrophe. However, the timing of the surgical intervention for the patient with motor deficit is still unclear. The patient in Case 1 underwent surgical decompression because there were no signs of improvement in motor and sensory function after two weeks of conservative treatment. Posterior decompression was selected rather than ventral decompression and fusion. The advantages of foraminotomy are to preserve the motion segment and to minimize the future risk of adjacent segment disorder for this younger age. Another advantage is to reduce the period of postoperative management in contrast with the latter procedure.\n\n【31】Cervical disc herniation is known to resolve spontaneously in the same way as lumbar disc herniation \\[ 11 \\]. In Case 2, the herniation was enhanced on an MRI scan after Gd-DTPA administration, indicating that spontaneous resolution could be anticipated, and muscle strength improved within a week after admission. Therefore, surgery was not indicated, and a favorable outcome was obtained with conservative treatment.\n\n【32】In both cases, a favorable outcome was achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation, but differences in pathology compared with the common middle-aged onset of this disorder remain a question for future investigation.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】Although extremely rare, symptomatic cervical disc herniations may occur even in the younger population under the age of 20 without any trauma or underlying disease. Favorable outcomes can be achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Case 1: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Due to reduced (or even null) enzyme activity, glycosaminoglycans (mainly dermatan sulfate) accumulates, leading to a multisystemic disease. Mucopolysaccharidosis VI induces reduced growth, coarse face, audiovisual deficits, osteoarticular deformities, and cardiorespiratory issues, hampering the quality of life of the patient. Enzyme replacement therapy with galsulfase (Naglazyme, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA) is the specific treatment for this condition. Although studies have shown that enzyme replacement therapy slows the progression of the disease, the effects of long-term enzyme replacement therapy remain poorly understood.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 29-year-old, Caucasian, male patient diagnosed with mucopolysaccharidosis VI was treated with enzyme replacement therapy for over 15 years. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated when patient was 13 years old. The patient evolved multiplex dysostosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, thickened mitral valve, and hearing and visual loss.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Although enzyme replacement therapy did not prevent the main signs of mucopolysaccharidosis VI, it slowed their progression. Additionally, enzyme replacement therapy was associated with a longer survival compared with the untreated affected sibling. Taken together, the results indicate that enzyme replacement therapy positively modified the course of the disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that are part of the lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), and are classified into 11 main types (I, II, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IIID, IVA, IVB, VI, VII, and IX) in accordance with the deficient enzyme. Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome, also known as MPS VI, is due to the deficiency of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) \\[ 1 , 2 \\], which leads to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout the body, particularly dermatan sulfate. This condition, which was originally described by the French physicians Pierre Maroteaux and Maurice Lamy in 1963, is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner \\[ 3 \\]. Although MPS VI is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of 1.3–4.5 in 100,000 births \\[ 4 \\], it is more frequent in some parts of the world, and there is a city in Brazil (Monte Santo, Bahia) where the incidence is nearly 1: 5000 live births \\[ 5 \\]. Unfortunately, there are currently no regular newborn screening programs for MPS VI \\[ 6 \\], although limited programs are in place in specific high-incidence areas \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【10】The age of presentation and clinical manifestations of MPS VI may greatly vary. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes may include an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the skull, coarse facial features, thick eyebrows, ocular proptosis, broad nasal bridge, thick lips, ogival palate, badly implanted teeth, macroglossia, short neck, narrow shoulders, globular abdomen, fingers and toes in a semi-flexion position, single palmar fold, short stature, dysostosis multiplex, generalized hypertrichosis, valgus knees, flat and thick feet, and less elastic skin \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Despite the clear physical changes, the disease does not cause intellectual disability, unlike several other MPS types \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【11】Cardiovascular lesions are frequent in MPS VI and constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. In fact, the deposition of GAGs in the myocardium and in blood vessels may result in progressive aortic and/or mitral valves degeneration, stenosis, and/or valvar insufficiency. The progression of these cardiac abnormalities may cause left ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent pulmonary congestion and heart failure \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【12】Regarding the skeleton and the osteoarticular system, short stature and joint stiffness are the main manifestations of MPS VI. These symptoms are progressive and limiting due to the metaphyseal involvement and thickening and fibrosis of the joint capsule. Joint mobility is worse with increasing patient age. Thus, evaluation of mobility of the knees, hip, and elbows are considered a good marker of MPS VI evolution \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. Thoracolumbar kyphosis and oval vertebral bodies with inferior protrusion can also be verified in patients with MPS VI \\[ 13 \\]. Wrists and hands may be affected by the enlargement and shortening of the metacarpals and phalanges, leading to flexure contracture of the fingers and a claw-hand aspect \\[ 1 , 12 \\].\n\n【13】Patients with MPS VI are more likely to present with glaucoma (50%) and progressive corneal opacification (95%) \\[ 6 , 7 , 12 \\]. Abnormalities in the optic nerve may occur due to accumulation of GAGs in ganglion cells, compression of the optic nerve due to thickening of the dura mater and increased intracranial pressure. Alterations in the optic disc accompanied by mild to moderate edema has also been verified in 50% of patients with MPS VI \\[ 7 , 12 \\].\n\n【14】Not only the clinical manifestations may vary, but also the rate of progression of the disease, which may advance slowly, moderately, or rapidly. Within this context, the severe form commonly has its onset at the age of 2 years and a rapid progression is observed; the moderately and slow progressive forms are generally diagnosed later in adolescence or even in adulthood, having a more attenuated phenotype \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【15】For many years, as MPS VI disease progressed, it was fatal to most of the patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) became a therapeutic alternative to counteract the disease progression but is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), available since 2005, constituted a significant improvement in terms of therapy, changing the natural history of this illness \\[ 13 \\]. The objective of this study is to report the clinical history of a patient with MPS VI treated with ERT for 15 years.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】A 29-year-old, Caucasian, male patient, born to nonconsanguineous parents, was referred for evaluation due to suspicion of being affected by an LSD as was his older brother in 1994, who presented a similar phenotype and has been investigated for MPS. The pregnancies were uneventful, and all prenatal evaluations were reported as normal. There was no exposure to teratogenic agents during pregnancy.\n\n【18】During infancy and childhood, there were no reports of delays in achieving motor skills. As the patient presented phenotypic traces of an LSD and his brother was diagnosed with MPS VI, he was also subjected to biochemical investigation for MPS (Table 1 ) and skeletal X-rays.\n\n【19】**Table 1 Laboratory results**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】He received the confirmatory diagnosis of MPS VI at the age of 2.5 years (September 1994). Genotyping indicated compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation (p.R315Q9) and a frameshift mutation (c.1534del23) in the _ARSB_ gene. As the phenotypic traces of MPS continued to progressively evolve, the patient was followed-up by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare specialists. The older brother died in 1995, at the age of 6 years, due to MPS-associated respiratory complications.\n\n【22】During clinical follow-up visits, the patient was physically examined to evaluate growth (weight, height, and cephalic perimeters), pulmonary and cardiac auscultation, mobility and gait, and organomegaly. The clinical progression of the disease was characterized by growth deficiency, joint contractures, and coarse facial features. In addition, abnormalities in cardiac valves, and conductive hearing loss and, due to chronic cranial hypertension, the patient developed bilateral optic atrophy and irreversible vision loss.\n\n【23】In October 2003, the patient was enrolled in a phase III clinical trial with ERT using a recombinant arylsulfatase B (galsulfase, Naglazyme, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA), and continued to receive weekly infusions of galsulfase, 1.0 mg/kg, when the study was completed.\n\n【24】In more than 15 years of ERT, the patient’s clinical condition was kept stable, with improvement of some parameters, such as hearing. Unfortunately, as his blindness was a consequence of optic nerve atrophy due to hydrocephalus, ERT failed to revert it.\n\n【25】At the age of 28 years, the patient displayed height below the third percentile, weight between the 75th and 90th percentiles, cephalic perimeter between the 50th and 95th percentiles, facial coarseness, depressed nasal bridge, thick lips, muscular contracture and joint stiffness, clawed hands, thick skull hair, umbilical hernia, hepatosplenomegaly, osteotendinous reflexes in upper and lower limbs grade 3, exhaustible clonus in lower limbs, and cutaneous-plantar reflex in extension.\n\n【26】Regarding the complementary exams, a radiographic study showed signs of dysostosis multiplex. Echocardiogram revealed a thickened mitral valve and electromyography showed the presence of multiple sites of nerve compression compatible with carpal tunnel syndrome. Finally, audiometry revealed conductive hearing loss.\n\n【27】Despite the important manifestations of the disease, the patient graduated in law, works regularly, and was taking classes in the business school, showing no intellectual deficit, as is expected in MPS VI. His survival is much longer compared with his untreated affected sibling and also to historical untreated controls \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】As in most genetic conditions, there is no cure to MPS VI yet. Two therapeutic strategies have been employed to reduce disease manifestations and increase the quality of life of patients: HSCT and ERT. HSCT has rarely been employed in MPS VI, with a small case series reported. The results have shown that, in spite of an increase in arylsulfatase B activity, skeletal abnormalities were not corrected. In addition, the mortality risk associated to the treatment itself is nearly 30% \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The infusion of the recombinant human enzyme arylsulfatase B has become the first line of pharmacological treatment for MPS VI since its first approval in 2005. Especially when initiated early, studies have shown a delay in the involvement of cardiovascular system, facial dimorphism, hepatomegaly, and physical development. Skeletal and ophthalmologic abnormalities, however, continue to progress \\[ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 \\].\n\n【30】There is growing evidence that early initiation of ERT in young patients has clear benefits in preventing the progression of the main disease manifestations \\[ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. In this regard, Horovitz and colleagues \\[ 16 \\] described the effects of ERT for 6 years on four unrelated patients who started the therapy in their first year of life. These authors reported that many aspects of the condition were still present in the treated patients (as neurological, cardiac, and orthopedic manifestations) but with a reduced rate of progression, demonstrating that the age of ERT initiation is critical for a better prognosis. Corroborating this, Furujo and coworkers \\[ 17 \\] demonstrated that 10 years of ERT in two Japanese siblings produced better results in the younger one, who initiated therapy at 6 months of age and did not display the typical symptoms of MPS VI (facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, and auditory impairment), but skeletal changes such as the claw hands and opacity of the cornea progressed. These results reinforce the need of increasing awareness among the healthcare professionals to reduce the age of diagnosis, favoring the effects of ERT on MPS progression.\n\n【31】Although the patient was one of the first patients to initiate ERT in Brazil in 2003, he could not fully benefit from the treatment because he was 13 years old at the time and the progression of some clinical aspects of his condition were already considered irreversible, such as growth deficit, joint contractures, bilateral optic atrophy, and corneal opacity. Even in this limited scenario, the patient’s quality of life significantly improved, and he could recover much of his hearing ability. Despite dysostosis multiplex, the patient was able to graduate in law and has a relatively normal life with his family.\n\n【32】It has been reported that ERT may also improve endurance and respiratory capacity. Twenty-four weeks of ERT improved the performance in both 6- and 12-minute walk tests, as well as in the stair climbing test in patients with MPS VI aged between 6 and 22 years. Additional improvements in the 12-minute walk and in the stair climbing tests were obtained after 48 weeks of treatment. Joint pain and stiffness were also improved by 24-week ERT treatment \\[ 18 \\]. Similarly, patient endurance was significantly improved by ERT. Before ERT, the patient was not able to stand or walk, using a wheelchair for locomotion. With ERT, the patient abandoned the wheelchair and can walk without support. The range of motion of the joints are still limited.\n\n【33】One of the most significant concerns of MPS VI is myelopathy of the spinal cord compression, which is potentially life-threatening and debilitating. ERT has not been successful in preventing cervical myelopathy; surgical decompression is required to achieve a satisfactory outcome and early surgery may be crucial \\[ 21 \\]. Of note, detailed neurological evaluation should be performed in patients treated with ERT, especially in the period of improvement of the osteoarticular condition. The presence of neurological abnormalities (quadriparesis and/or spasticity, urinary retention secondary to neurogenic bladder, hyperreflexia with or without clonus, history of decreased tolerance to exercise or difficulty in getting up) should alert the physicians to a possible need for surgical decompression \\[ 21 \\]. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard examination for the diagnosis of cervical cord compression. Surgical interventions may be challenging due to management of the airways and anesthesia during surgery \\[ 22 \\]. In fact, clogged airways, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart problems, and cervical instability may contribute to an increased risk of complications associated with anesthesia. Careful preoperation, anticipation of problems, and involvement of anesthesiologists with the physician accompanying the case may be critical to minimize the risk of preoperative mortality \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【34】Improved quality of life and life expectancy of patients with MPS VI, as illustrated here, may draw attention to other disease-related complications, such as myelopathy of the spinal cord compression.

Patients often suffer from diagnostic gaps and are misdiagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), as AATD may present with nonspecific respiratory symptoms. It is never too late to suspect AATD, especially in a patient with an unusual medical history. In recent years, evidence is beginning to emerge that there may be value in identifying and treating patients who do not already have deterioration of functional parameters.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We describe a case of a 69-year-old Caucasian female patient, late diagnosis of AATD, with both severe bronchial hyperreactivity and numerous exacerbations due to the peculiar clinical history and the presence of a rare mutation; although not presenting forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) between 30 and 65%, the patient was treated with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy and achieved clinical and functional improvement.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】AATD should always be suspected. The Alpha-1 Foundation recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AATD in adult patients indicate that treatment should be provided for patients with FEV <sub>1 </sub> between 30 and 65%. It may be useful to evaluate and treat patients based on clinical symptoms, even outside the established parameters, in particular cases.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) causes different respiratory manifestations, including pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and bronchiectasis. AATD is a rare lung disease, with a progressive clinical course, and early diagnosis enables patients to make lifestyle changes and initiate therapy to decelerate or prevent further loss of lung tissue. However, AATD goes largely unrecognized; evidence from screening programs in the United States shows that less than 10% of individuals with AATD are clinically diagnosed with the disorder \\[ 1 \\]. Patients often suffer from diagnostic gaps and are misdiagnosed with COPD, asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), as AATD may present with nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Some authors have suggested that AHR, wheezing and dyspnea may be susceptibility phenotypes for the development of respiratory disease, especially in the context of cigarette smoking. In their group of patients, 25% had an increase of at least 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ), and this reversibility has been associated with lower lung functionality \\[ 2 \\]. Emphysema or COPD may be initially and incorrectly diagnosed as asthma in adults with AATD; a diagnosis of childhood asthma would be unlikely due to emphysema or COPD. In Sweden, individuals with AATD have been identified as part of neonatal screening; 15% were diagnosed with asthma by age 22, and 29% had self-reported recurrent wheezing episodes. The study noted that a medical diagnosis of asthma before age 16 was linked to reduced FEV <sub>1 </sub> and severe COPD in adulthood, which could indicate that asthma or asthma-like symptoms may result in a subset of particularly susceptible AATD patients \\[ 2 \\]. Therapeutic diagnostic delay can lead to a complex clinical course.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】We describe the case of a 69-year-old Caucasian female patient, housewife and mother of three daughters, in apparent good health, who had never smoked. The patient reported six episodes per year of exacerbation of respiratory failure documented over the previous 10 years. Respiratory symptoms were resolved with steroids and antibiotics. The patient had been hospitalized twice in the last 3 years for acute respiratory failure. She was discharged with a diagnosis of \"acute respiratory failure exacerbated by COPD.”\n\n【12】Due to persistence of respiratory symptoms characterized by dyspnea and a dry cough, the patient visited the pulmonary clinic of our department, and a functional assessment was carried out. At a young age, she reported occasional wheezing, sporadic episodes of respiratory exacerbation, especially during the three pregnancies, and intense dyspnea and asthma-like symptoms. She had undergone spirometry several years earlier, for which no written documentation was generated. The patient was being treated with an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist twice daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist twice daily, theophylline 200 mg orally twice a day, and montelukast 10 mg per day orally.\n\n【13】The patient complained of worsening dyspnea with wheezing. Spirometry performed at the first visit showed forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.17 (120%), FEV <sub>1 </sub> 1.64 (113%) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.11 mmol/(minute KPa), 80%. Spirometry performed at the second visit showed FVC 1.95 (100%), FEV <sub>1 </sub> 1.44 (100%), Tiffeneau index of 75% and DLCO 4.11 mmol/(minute KPa), 80%. The six-minute walk test was normal. She was subjected to a methacholine challenge test, which was positive for severe hyperreactivity. Allergic skin tests for inhalants and foods were negative. A paper radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST) showed a level of 39 U/mL. The blood tests were normal except for serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) of 67 mg/L (normal value is 0.90–2.00 g/L). Chest computed tomography scan revealed the presence of small areas of air trapping and diffuse bronchiectasis (Fig. 1 ). Sputum cultures performed to exclude colonization of potentially pathogenic microorganisms that could be the cause of exacerbations were negative.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Chest computed tomography scan showed the presence of small areas of air trapping and diffuse bronchiectasis\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Genetic screening was performed for the AATD inheritance and showed compound heterozygosity for deficient alleles pis and Pi <sub>Lowell </sub> .\n\n【19】After informed consent was obtained from the patient, we started intravenous augmentation therapy with human AAT at a dosage of 60 mg/kg every 7 days. At the request of the patient and her family, and after having monitored serum AATD, therapy was performed every 14 days. At 20 months of treatment, the patient showed no exacerbation, dyspnea exertional resolution and stable improvement in respiratory parameters.\n\n【20】After subsequent revaluation diagnostics, this patient, with a rare double heterozygous mutation, was treated with augmentation therapy, obtaining clinical and functional improvement without exacerbation over 2 years of treatment.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】A review by Eden \\[ 3 \\] examined the contention that individuals with severe AATD were particularly susceptible to AHR, which was associated with the reactivity of bronchodilators, asthma and allergies. This review summarizes evidence to suggest that the development of AHR related to asthma and reversible bronchospasm in AATD is a risk factor for progression to COPD. Different genetic factors are involved in the development of asthma, such as atopy, and increase the predisposition to the disease \\[ 3 \\]. The different phenotypes of asthma depend on the interaction between heredity and the polygenic environmental complex \\[ 4 \\]. Atopic asthma originates from a genetic predisposition, characterized by allergic manifestations, response to skin tests, eczema and rhinitis, and the response to triggering actors can cause attacks of wheezing and shortness of breath. Gastroesophageal reflux can also trigger AHR in susceptible individuals. AATD as a predisposing factor may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma due to the lack of anti-neutrophil elastase of the airways; this results in a condition of chronic inflammation which can stimulate an acute reaction in response to various agents \\[ 5 \\]. Asthma exacerbation can be caused by upper respiratory tract infection, obesity or exposure to allergens, including in the workplace \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. With airway inflammation of neutrophils in asthma and chronic bronchitis, both total and active proinflammatory elastase increases in the airways. There is a compensatory development in airway AAT, but an excess of elastase indicates protease/anti-protease imbalance \\[ 8 \\]. Studies have revealed that the presence of asthma with frequent exacerbations is a risk factor for an accelerated decline in FEV <sub>1 </sub> \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【23】For over 10 years, the patient had respiratory symptoms variously diagnosed as episodes of acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis. There were no professional or lifestyle risk factors, and the patient had never smoked; thus AATD was never suspected. However, despite maximizing drug treatment, the clinical conditions worsened, with an increase in the frequency of episodes of bronchial exacerbation. In the most recent few months, exertional dyspnea had arisen, but the basal functional evaluation and allergology tests carried out on the occasion of different re-evaluations determined nothing pathological. At the time of our first evaluation, the finding of lower than normal serum AAT level necessitated a genetic study documenting the heterozygous presence of a pis and Pi <sub>Lowell </sub> mutation. The evolution of lung disease in people with AATD would appear to be aggravated by the presence of gene interactions that are not yet clearly understood. Presumably, atopy, modifier genes and extrinsic influences, environmental factors and cigarette smoking work together to increase airway hyperreactivity and asthma, contribute to the decline of lung function in AATD, and play a role in exacerbation \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【24】It is interesting to observe that in our case, the patient at the second evaluation showed a significant reduction in respiratory function compared to her previous parameters, while remaining in the normal range of respiratory function. During the months of augmentation therapy, our patient did not show any bronchial exacerbation; the dyspnea index was reduced as assessed by the six-minute walk test and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale (Table 1 ). The role of the distinct mutations of the gene for AAT and their combination is still an ongoing study. Different clinical pictures of different severity are described in the literature in patients with the same mutation or with rare mutations in combination. Serum AAT levels should be measured at least once in all patients with asthma and COPD, as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), as a large number of patients receive the diagnosis too late for effective treatment measures \\[ 12 \\]. The latency time for diagnosis of congenital AATD is greater than 10 years. According to the Italian registry data, the diagnostic delay is about 8–9 years, which is greater than that for the United States and Germany (about 6 years) \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【25】**Table 1. Respiratory parameters measured during visit 1 and visit 2**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】These data strongly support a recommendation to always suspect AATD in the presence of respiratory symptoms at any age, and above all to promote greater awareness of this genetic condition, which is still under-recognized more than 50 years after its discovery. The exclusion of a genetic component linked to AAT is indicated in all patients with respiratory symptoms, asthma or COPD, and it is important to evaluate each case for the possible indication and potential advantages of AAT augmentation therapy.\n\n【29】The latest Alpha-1 Foundation recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AATD in adult patients supports replacement therapy in individuals with FEV <sub>1 </sub> of 30–65% \\[ 14 \\], but emerging data showing that it can be useful for diagnosis and treatment of patients outside of previously established parameters \\[ 15 \\]. Data on these cases need to be collected to better understand the role of augmentation therapy. Large-scale screening in the general population, infants and blood donors, or in targeted populations such as COPD and asthma patients, which can lead to the early identification of patients in need of treatment, would be helpful. Although AAT augmentation therapy is the only treatment available that addresses the underlying cause of AATD, symptomatic therapy and lifestyle changes may be of benefit to all patients.\n\n【30】Availability of supporting data\n-------------------------------\n\n【31】All data are available c/o UOC Pathophysiology and Respiratory Rehabilitation, Intensive Care Department, Monaldi Hospital, Naples, Italy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Clinical findings, diagnostics, and therapy are well described. Instead, the list of documents describing dislocations of the posterior tibial tendon is short. We found no case in which a dislocation of both long peroneal tendon and posterior tibial tendon is described.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a case of a 29-year-old male patient who sustained an ankle injury after a fall at a boulder gym. He admitted himself with severe pain, tenderness, and swelling of his left ankle. Dislocation of the posterior tibial tendon and simultaneous dislocation of the long peroneal tendon was diagnosed using x-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Transosseous suture repair with periosteal augmentation of the flexor retinaculum was performed at the medial malleolus. At the lateral malleolus, transosseous suture was used to repair the superior retinaculum. The ankle was immobilized following surgery. The patient underwent physical therapy afterwards. The treatment resulted in good recovery, and the patient returned to the same level of performance at rock climbing.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Our novel finding is that simultaneously sustained dislocations of the posterior tibial tendon and the long peroneal tendon may occur and can be successfully treated as if each injury is treated individually. _Level of evidence_ Level V, case report.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Posterior tibial tendon dislocation and long peroneal tendon dislocation by themselves are rare traumatic injuries \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Nonoperative treatment of long peroneal tendon dislocation bears the risk of a high rate of redislocations \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Repair of the superior retinaculum in peroneal tendon dislocations with or without fibular groove deepening leads to good clinical results \\[ 4 \\]. In case of posterior tibial tendon dislocations, surgery consisting of fixation of the flexor retinaculum or using a periosteal flap technique for tendon sheath stabilization is recommended \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【10】To our knowledge, no case of a dislocated peroneal tendon with a simultaneously dislocated posterior tibial tendon has been published in contemporary literature. We present such an injury sustained due to hyperextension in the ankle joint following a fall and the treatment the patient received at our institution.\n\n【11】Case report\n-----------\n\n【12】A 29-year-old male patient injured his left ankle after a 2-m fall while bouldering in a climbing gym. During the fall, his left foot caught on a climbing hold, resulting in hyperextension of his ankle joint. He presented himself in the university hospital 2 days after the trauma because of persistent pain and loss of full weight-bearing ability. Severe tenderness at the medial and lateral malleolus was noted during palpation of the ankle joint. Neurovascular function of the foot and ankle was normal, and the skin was uninjured. The patient had never injured his ankles before, and he had not suffered any chronic disease or instability before.\n\n【13】Clinical examination showed the posterior tibial tendon palpable mobile on top of the medial malleolus. Specific tests for tendon instabilities such as provocation test according to Orthner and manual dislocation tests \\[ 6 , 7 \\] could not be performed due to severe pain. X-rays of the ankle as well as computed tomography showed a bony avulsion of the superior retinaculum at the lateral malleolus (Fig. 1 ). This has been described as “fleck sign” and is highly indicative for peroneal tendon dislocation \\[ 8 \\]. No further fractures were found. The peroneal groove at the lateral malleolus was concave. Therefore, no bony correction, such as groove deepening, was planned. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the posterior tibial tendon still being dislocated anteriorly (Figs. 2 , 3 ). The long peroneal tendon was no longer dislocated and positioned anatomically behind the lateral malleolus. No tendon lesions were found. An avulsion of the anterior talofibular ligament and a partial lesion of anterior deltoid ligament fibers were found as concomitant injuries. The syndesmotic ligament showed minor sprain but no rupture.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Mortise view x-ray showing a pathognomonic bony avulsion next to the lateral malleolus, the pathognomonic “fleck-sign”\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Ultrasound of the left ankle showing the posterior tibial tendon (TP) on top of the medial malleolus. _D_ flexor digitorum tendon\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】MRI showing the posterior tibial tendon on top of the medial malleolus. _TP_ tibial posterior tendon, _D_ flexor digitorum tendon, _VN_ neurovascular bundle, _H_ flexor hallucis longus tendon, _P_ long peroneal tendon\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Surgery was postponed until soft-tissue swelling had subsided and a “wrinkle sign” was present 17 days after trauma. Clinical examination showed that the passive sagittal motion was normal, and the hindfoot motion was restricted in inversion and eversion. Active motion was unpleasant due to pain.\n\n【27】The preoperative American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Score “Ankle Hindfoot Scale” after injury showed a value of 21 out of 100 points (0 pain points, 11 function points, and 10 alignment points).\n\n【28】An 8 cm curved skin incision alongside the posterior tibial tendon was performed behind the medial malleolus.\n\n【29】The flexor retinaculum was found to be ruptured and deficient.\n\n【30】The posterior tibial tendon was dislocated anteromedially and found on top of the medial malleolus owing to a posterior tibial tendon dislocation Type 3, according to Strydom (Table 2 ) \\[ 9 \\] (Fig. 4 ). The tendon was repositioned to its anatomical position. The remaining retinacular fibers were reattached to the posterior aspect of the medial malleolus via two drill holes using a nonabsorbable thread. A periosteal flap augmentation on top of the retinacular flap in vest-over-pants technique completed the procedure (Fig. 5 ).\n\n【31】**Fig. 4**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】The posterior tibial tendon (PTT, marked yellow) found on top of the medial malleolus\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】**Fig. 5**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】The posterior tibial tendon is seen on the left (PTT, marked yellow), the switched periosteal flap is marked in green in the middle (PF). Distally, the flexor retinaculum (RF, marked blue) is shown already sutured back to the bone entrapping the PTT\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】An 8 cm posterolateral incision alongside the peroneal tendons was made behind the lateral malleolus. The bony avulsion of the superior retinaculum was verified. The peroneal tendons were found behind the lateral malleolus, but the long peroneal tendon was unstable and could be dislocated with gentle pressure. The injury was classified as an Eckert and Davis Grade 3 \\[ 10 \\]. The bony rim and the superior peroneal retinaculum were sutured to the bone through drill holes in the posterolateral aspect of the fibula. Thereby the tendon was stabilized in its anatomic position.\n\n【40】A below-knee cast was applied for 8 weeks postoperatively.\n\n【41】The patient suffered from a punctiform wound healing disorder of 3 × 5 mm size at the distal part of the lateral approach, which was successfully treated with oral antibiotics and needed no operative revision. No further complications occurred.\n\n【42】Initially, no weight-bearing was allowed for the first 6 weeks after surgery. At week 7, full weight-bearing was allowed in the cast. After cast removal, the patient underwent intensive physical rehabilitation. At 3-month follow-up, the patient showed no gait abnormalities. Minor restrictions in range of motion could be observed during physical examination. He was able to follow daily activities and reported no pain. He started to do light sports activity and training. Six months after surgery, the patient reached his preinjury level in climbing and other sports without any noticeable pain and mild restriction due to flexibility while bouldering. He showed no gait abnormality. On clinical examination, we found moderate limitation of sagittal and hindfoot motion. The stability, both subjective and objective, was good. AOFAS-Score “ankle and hindfoot scale” showed a value of 90 out of 100 points (40 pain points, 40 function points, and 10 alignment points).\n\n【43】Although we found mild limitations in mobility on clinical examination, based on patient satisfaction, we decided to adopt a wait-and-see procedure.\n\n【44】Ultrasound investigation showed the posterior tibial tendon as well as the long peroneal tendon in their former position (Fig. 6 ).\n\n【45】**Fig. 6**\n\n【46】 \n\n【47】The posterior tibial tendon is seen on the left (TP) behind the medial malleolus\n\n【48】Full size image\n\n【49】Until 1 year follow-up, the patient showed no redislocation of both tendons. He had no pain but reported slight limitation of sagittal movement that was not disturbing in any recreational or all-day activities. AOFAS-Score “ankle and hindfoot scale” showed a value of 96 out of 100 points (40 pain points, 46 function points, and 10 alignment points).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Dislocations of the peroneal tendons as well as the tibialis posterior tendons are both rare traumatic injuries. They are often overseen and misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain \\[ 2 , 11 \\].\n\n【52】Eckert and Davis describe three grades of injury in peroneal tendon dislocation presented in Table 1 . Major symptoms are pain and tenderness behind the lateral malleolus. The long peroneal tendon can easily get dislocated by a stress test, performed by elevation of the lateral foot in a squatting position \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In grade 3 injuries, the x-ray shows a bony avulsion, the pathognomonic “fleck sign.” According to Toussaint, the “fleck sign” is evidence of the presence of a peroneal tendon dislocation with a specificity of 98% \\[ 12 \\]. Grade 1 and 2 injuries are often not visible on native radiological imaging.\n\n【53】**Table 1 Eckert and Davis Classification for peroneal tendon dislocation \\[ 10 , 14 \\]**\n\n【54】Full size table\n\n【55】Even though randomized trials are missing, surgical repair of the retinaculum with or without deepening of the fibular groove leads to good clinical outcome. Oesman depicts it as “a logical, anatomic \\[…\\] technique” \\[ 13 \\]. In the most recent literature, Bakker _et al._ elaborated the plaster cast for 6 weeks as an alternative to operative treatment, but it still correlates with a high rate of failure \\[ 11 \\]. On the other hand, van Dijk and colleagues also determined that an operative treatment leads to good clinical results and high satisfaction of the patients \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【56】Strydom suggested a classification for posterior tibial tendon dislocations in 2017, presented in Table 2 .\n\n【57】**Table 2 Strydom classification and suggested treatment for posterior tibial tendon dislocation \\[ 9 \\]**\n\n【58】Full size table\n\n【59】The leading symptom is medial ankle pain with tenderness behind the medial malleolus. Persistent swelling and events of snapping and clicking are described as well as sensations of instability and weakness of supination \\[ 9 \\]. Due to swelling and pain, a clinical examination is often not possible. MRI can lead to diagnosis in these cases. It can also show concomitant injuries. A dynamic ultrasound investigation can demonstrate dislocations during provocation.\n\n【60】In current literature, operative treatment in tibialis posterior tendon dislocations is recommended predominantly \\[ 5 \\]. In the case of an anatomic reposition of the tibial tendon, early diagnosis and consecutive early immobilization and nonoperative treatment can be successful \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【61】Strydom classification supposes a treatment for each type (Table 2 ) \\[ 9 \\]: Nonoperative treatment is considered only in type 1b, even though sufficient evidence is missing. The group further suggests surgical repair of the retinaculum (type 2) or reattachment with transosseous sutures (type 1a). In the case of deficient tissue, a periosteal flap technique is suggested (type 3). They recommend to perform a groove deepening in addition to the executed procedure, if the posterior tibial groove is shallow \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【62】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【63】Simultaneous dislocations of both the long peroneal and posterior tibial tendons are possible in cases of intensive and powerful dorsiflexion of the ankle.\n\n【64】In cases of discrepancies of clinical findings and severity of the trauma, further thorough examination and diagnostic steps such as CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI are indicated.\n\n【65】Even though there was no previous report of such a case, we were able to show that a combination of established treatment concepts for each injury can lead to a good result.\n\n【66】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【67】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This entity comprises carcinoïd tumors and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, mainly those of the small-cell type. Large-cell-type primitive tumors are exceptional, and only nine cases are reported in the literature. Similar to neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, large-cell-type primitive tumors may be observed in the context of conventional adenocarcinoma during androgen deprivation therapy or as prostatic metastasis of a distant neuroendocrine tumor, mainly pulmonary neoplasms.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a Caucasian case of a mixed prostatic carcinoma, with the largest component being the large-cell neuroendocine carcinoma, in a patient who underwent a total prostatectomy for a localized cancer. Diagnostic, histological, therapeutic and evolutive aspects are reported and discussed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Large-cell primitive prostate neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare but aggressive histological entity, which can be associated or not with an adenocarcinomatous component. Mixed forms have a better outcome, mainly when diagnosed at an early stage.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The 2016 World Health Organization’s histological classification of prostate cancer includes well-differentiated carcinoid tumors and small- or large-cell poorly differentiated tumors within the category of neuroendocrine tumors \\[ 1 \\]. Only 20 cases of large-cell neuroendocrine prostate tumors are described in the literature, among which are nine cases of primary tumors \\[ 2 \\]. Large-cell neuroendocrine prostate tumors are a rare histological entity whose evolutive profile and therapeutic potential differ from those of conventional adenocarcinoma. Primary prostate neuroendocrine tumors can be pure or associated with an adenocarcinomatous component. Mixed forms have better prognosis when diagnosed early at a localized stage.\n\n【10】Clinical case\n-------------\n\n【11】A 68-year-old Caucasian patient presented in September 2015 due to an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Past medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and mild renal failure. The PSA was 6.67 ng/ml in February 2015 and 9.65 ng/ml in September 2015. Upon clinical examination, a medium-sized prostate was determined, with a palpable induration of the left lobe, clinically classified as a stage T2b cancer. Twelve ultrasound-guided prostate core biopsies were taken in October 2015. All biopsied tissue from both lobes was found to have tumor infiltration by a large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma associated with acinar adenocarcinoma with Gleason score 7(3 + 4), with perineural invasion and without capsule infiltration. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in December 2015 showed a prostate that weighed 43 g with a suspicious lesion in the posterior peripheral zone, between the apex and the midgland of the left lobe, classified as Pi-Rads 5/5, without infiltration of seminal vesicles and without capsular invasion or pelvic adenopathy. A bone scan in November 2015 showed no bone secondaries.\n\n【12】Given that the majority component revealed on the biopsies was the neuroendocrine component, a <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (\\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT) was performed in November 2015, showing a prostate metabolic hyperfixation without suspicious distant fixation (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】<sup>18 </sup> F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography: isolated metabolic uptake of the left lobe of the prostate\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Taking into consideration the rarity of the histological entity and the localized tumor character, we decided to carry out curative surgical treatment by radical prostatectomy with bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Surgery was performed in January 2016. Operative exploration revealed that the prostate tumor had invaded the bladder neck and trigone. Radical prostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and partial cystectomy involving the bladder neck and trigone in macroscopically tumor-free limits and bilateral ureterovesical reimplantation were performed.\n\n【18】Based on histology, we was concluded that this tumor was a bilateral mixed prostate carcinoma that had invaded 80% of the gland. The large-cell neuroendocrine component comprised 70% of the tumor and the acinar adenocarcinoma component accounted for the remaining 30%. Gleason score of the adenocarcinomatous component was 7(3 + 4). There was capsular infiltration at the base of the right lobe. The bladder neck and seminal vesicles were invaded as well as the neurovascular bands. There was also perineural invasion and vascular embolus (Fig. 2 ). The large-cell neuroendocrine component was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with labeling by synaptophysin and chromogranin A, with a strong proliferative activity, as Ki67 expression was at 80% (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Operative specimen from total prostatectomy: hematoxylin and eosin staining.

The tumor was then classified as pT4 N1 (1/13) R1. Postoperative PSA was 0.01 ng/ml. Following a multidisciplinary medical consultation, it was decided to treat the patient with chemotherapy (etoposide carboplatin \\[VP16\\]) as an adjuvant treatment, followed by radiotherapy of the prostatic bed and pelvis.\n\n【28】A \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan performed in September 2016 showed the absence of any hyper-metabolic site.\n\n【29】Chemotherapy with etoposide carboplatin (VP16) was started in February 2016, then interrupted in May 2016 following the second cycle due to renal toxicity.\n\n【30】The \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan performed in June 2016, 6 months following surgery, showed two left latero-aortic hypermetabolic lymph nodes despite a PSA of 0.01 ng/ml. The \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan in August 2016, 4 months after the end of chemotherapy, showed a significant decrease in the metabolic character of the left latero-aortic infracentimetric lymph node and the absence of a second suspicious hypermetabolic lesion; PSA was 0.01 ng/ml. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; 6 MV photons) of the prostatic bed was performed between November and December 2016, with 70 Gy, given in 35 sessions.\n\n【31】The follow-up was then planned based on the PSA level for the adenocarcinoma component and the \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT findings for the large-cell neuroendocrine component. In July 2017 the patient presented with an elevated PSA of 2.75 ng/ml; in November 2017 the PSA was 4. 77 ng/ml. The \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan in November 2017 showed bilateral supracentimetric iliac lymph nodes, poorly hypermetabolic, that were more indicative of the adenocarcinomatous component. Androgen deprivation therapy with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist triptorelin was started in December 2017. The biological response was favorable; the PSA was 0.01 ng/ml and testosterone was 0.2 ng/ml 3 months after the first injection of triptorelin. The \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan in June 2018, 6 months after the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy, indicated a complete metabolic response.\n\n【32】The follow-up was biological, with PSA measurement every 3 months for the adenocarcinomatous component and metabolic imaging with \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT every 6 months for the large-cell neuroendocrine component. Currently, after 54 months of follow-up, the patient is still receiving androgen deprivation therapy with triptorelin with complete biological and metabolic response. At the last check-up in March 2020, PSA was 0.01 ng/ml and the \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]FDG PET/CT scan showed a complete metabolic response.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】The first descriptions of neuroendocrine system cells are relatively recent, dating from the middle of the twentieth century. Neuroendocrine cells are usually present in prostate tissue and increasing in number after puberty. They are less frequent in acini, from which conventional adenocarcinoma of the prostate can develop. Neuroendocrine cells play a role in the growth and secretory functions of prostatic epithelium \\[ 3 \\], and they are recognizable by the absence of androgen receptors and through labeling by certain immunohistochemical markers, such as chromogranin and synaptophysin. PSA negativity in immunohistochemistry is a fundamental criterion of neuroendocrine cell recognition \\[ 4 \\]. It is important to note that a focal expression of PSA can be observed within neuroendocrine tumors and that high-grade acinar adenocarcinoma can also express neuroendocrine markers, thus enabling differential diagnosis with large-cell neuroendocrine tumors \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【35】The incidence of neuroendocrine cells in conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma varies in the different studies that have histologically assessed primitive tumors and metastases \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【36】Focal neuroendocrine features in prostatic adenocarcinoma are correlated to high-grade and undifferentiated tumors. As adenocarcinomatous and neuroendocrine cells can share hybrid immunohistochemical features in some cases, it is important to consider the classical morphological aspects of neuroendocrine tumor cells. Large neuroendocrine cancer cells are usually in large nests with peripheral palisading \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【37】Heterogeneity in defining the neuroendocrine status in prostatic tumors can also be related to the increase in life expectancy and the awareness in detecting focal neuroendocrine foci in prostatic adenocarcinoma. Therapies based on androgen receptor signaling inhibition may also interfere with the detection of neuroendocrine features, as in the case of metastases biopsy \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【38】Two mechanisms are described in the pathogenesis of prostate neuroendocrine tumors. The first, most frequent, is the transdifferentiation of an acinar adenocarcinoma under long-term hormone therapy, with loss of androgen receptors. Neuroendocrine manifestations of prostate cancer are increasing because of the prolongation of survival and the use of new hormone therapies. The second mechanism is a malignant transformation of neuroendocrine cells usually present in prostatic glands \\[ 9 \\]. This mechanism of de novo tumors is supported by carcinogenesis animal models of prostate neuroendocrine cells \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【39】Given the limited number of published cases and series, the risk factors predisposing to the development of de novo neuroendocrine tumors has not been established \\[ 2 \\]. The 2016 histological classification of tumors of the urinary and genital system described three entities of prostate neuroendocrine carcinoma: neuroendocrine differentiation of adenocarcinoma, well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors or carcinoid tumors and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine small- or large-cell tumors. The recognition of neuroendocrine tumors rests on morphological, functional and immunohistochemical criteria \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【40】Neuroendocrine tumors differ from adenocarcinoma by the absence of PSA secretion, resistance to hormone therapy, early metastasis and rapid progression \\[ 4 \\]. Small-cell tumors are by far more frequent than large-cell tumors which remain exceptional. The coexistence of the two forms within the same tumor can be observed \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【41】Large-cell de novo tumors are rare. The most recent review of the literature, published in 2019, lists only around 20 cases, of which 17 are about primitive prostate tumors, including seven de novo and eight following hormone therapy. Among the cases of large-cell de novo tumors, only three observations report mixed tumors with two components, neuroendocrine and adenocarcinomatous. These three cases responded favorably to hormone therapy \\[ 2 \\]. De novo neuroendocrine tumors, either small or large cells, associated with an adenocarcinomatous component seem to have a better prognosis than pure forms because of a certain degree of hormone sensitivity. This notion of androgen dependence or resistance determines the difference in prognosis between the two forms \\[ 11 \\]. Because of PSA secretion, mixed forms are susceptible to early diagnosis at the localized stage, providing thus the possibility of curative treatment.\n\n【42】Pure forms, not secreting PSA, are often diagnosed at an advanced stage.\n\n【43】Xiang Tu _et al._ report three cases of de novo large-cell pure neuroendocrine tumors, diagnosed following trans-urethral resection of the prostate, with an unfavorable course under chemotherapy \\[ 2 \\]. Evans _et al._ report a similar case with a tumor classified pT3a after radical prostatectomy, with the patient presentinglocal and metastatic cerebral recurrence under adjuvant chemotherapy \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【44】Therapeutic possibilities are similar to thosee of lung large-cell neuroendocrine tumors and essentially involves chemotherapy given the hormone therapy resistance. The prognosis is usually unfavorable in the locally advanced and metastatic stages, with a very limited survival \\[ 12 , 13 \\].\n\n【45】The case we report was diagnosed at a locally advanced stage following ultrasound-guided biopsies. Considering the rarity of the histological type and the moderate renal failure that limited the possibilities of subsequent chemotherapy, we opted for radical prostatectomy rather than radiotherapy. \\[ <sup>18 </sup> \\]F-FDG PET/CT follow-up was justified for a better detection of neuroendocrine cell metabolism, in comparison with choline. The favorable and complete response to hormone therapy, after ganglionic recurrence, can be explained by the presence of an adenocarcinomatous component coexisting with the neuroendocrine component within the same tumor. Complete remission and relatively long survival in comparison with the previously published cases strongly depend on early diagnosis, curative initial surgical treatment and also regular imaging during the follow-up allowing an early detection and adapted treatment of lymph nodes recurrence.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【47】Large-cell primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate is an aggressive and a rare histological entity. Curative surgery should be envisaged in localized and locally advanced forms. Hormone resistance in the pure forms limits the therapeutic arsenal for metastatic forms. The association with a hormone-sensitive adenocarcinoma component improves prognosis. The development of nuclear imaging modalities allows a better follow-up and early diagnosis of recurrence, with substantial optimized care.\n\n【48】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】The authors make readily reproducible and freely available the materials described in the manuscript to any scientist wishing to use them, without breaching confidentiality.

One of the main differences between these two entities is the chronicity and progressive neurological disability in MS, while ADEM is self-limiting, non-recurrent, and rarely produces neurological disabilities \\[ 1 \\]. However, when there are multiple ADEM attacks followed by optic neuritis (ON), it is defined as ADEM-ON \\[ 2 \\]. It is widely known that the clinical presentation of ADEM is an inflammatory process, and it is preceded by vaccination or infections. However, some cases are secondary to a fever of unknown origin \\[ 3 , 4 \\], which raises the question if a periodic fever syndromes (PFS) could be the recurrent trigger of the CNS inflammatory process in ADEM-ON as has been previously reported in MS \\[ 5 \\]. _NLRP12_ \\-associated autoinflammatory disorder (NLRP12AD) is a type 2 familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS2), and part of the PFS \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. It is an immune-mediated disease characterized by the presence of recurrent fever (of unknown origin) and other autoinflammatory features such as mouth ulcers and headaches \\[ 10 \\]. Here, we describe a patient diagnosed as having ADEM-ON who also presented with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) for whom we used whole exome sequencing (WES) to dissect possible variants in a non-HLA set of genes that could explain the patient’s clinical features (immunological and neurological).\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient is a 12-year-old Ecuadorian Hispanic boy from unrelated Hispanic parents; he presented to the pediatric department of the “Hospital de los Valles” with mouth ulcers, bilateral vision loss, headache, fever, lethargy, ataxia, dizziness, and left-sided hemiparesis. A clinical examination did not reveal any identifiable cause of fever. His familial history was unremarkable except for his maternal grandfather, who had type II diabetes mellitus. Our patient’s past medical history revealed a 10-year history of several episodes of pharyngitis, mouth ulcers, headaches, dizziness, fevers of unknown origin, and tonsillitis. These symptoms commonly preceded the appearance of neurological symptoms such as delayed speech, hypotonia, vision loss, ataxia, lethargy, and left hemiparesis. This pattern had been consistent and often required hospitalization for the treatment of neurological manifestations. The treatment consisted of corticoid therapy, which offered rapid improvement. Moreover, he has significant endocrine features, including small stature, delayed bone age, obesity, small hands, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Although Prader–Willi syndrome was suspected, genetic analysis ruled this out. Ophthalmological imaging studies at his first hospitalization 10 years ago were consistent with a demyelinating and axonal lesion of the left optic tract, which is compatible with ON. In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory index, was elevated at every hospitalization. The following laboratory studies, which were carried out on several occasions, had results within the normal range: complete blood count (CBC); serum chemistry; urine and blood culture; strep test; throat swab; serology for cytomegalovirus, (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV), rubella, and toxoplasmosis; immunologic screening for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatologic factor, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antiphospholipids; thyroid hormones; cortisol; and insulin. He also underwent the following examinations: chest and abdominal X-rays which were normal; pathergy test which was negative; brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2 sequences which showed multiple hyperintense lesions throughout the years (Fig. 1 ); spinal cord MRI studies that did not disclose any lesion; and cerebrospinal fluid analyses which were consistently normal with negative oligoclonal bands. MS was ruled out because he did not meet the McDonald diagnostic criteria for this disease. In addition, anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4), and anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) were ordered but failed to disclose the diagnosis. Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was ordered, and the titer was 1:80 (considered negative); however, he was in treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at the time of the anti-MOG evaluation. Given the unusual phenotype, we decided to perform a WES via a commercial service offered by the Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories. A list of variants potentially associated with the neurologic and immune features of our patient are listed in Table 1 . A WES was not performed on his parents due to financial reasons. Even though the results were not conclusive, we found variants in genes associated with both autoinflammatory ( _NLRP12_ ) and neurological ( _POLR3A_ ) phenotypes that could be related to the disease pathogenesis being a polygenic rather than monogenic trait.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery T2 sequences showing multiple hyperintense lesions through the years. **a** 2008: Multiple injuries, mainly subcortical in temporal and occipitotemporal gyrus, and in the white matter of the corona radiata and semioval center.

For the past year, our patient has remained on a monthly therapy with IVIG 500 mg/kg and orally administered colchicine (0.5 mg daily). With this treatment, he has remained free of new autoinflammatory and neurological episodes and has not required corticoids. An MRI study performed 7 months after the start of IVIG and colchicine showed an absence of new lesions.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】ADEM is considered an autoinflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS and is often secondary to infections \\[ 1 \\]. However, some cases have been associated with recurrent inflammation and absence of known infections \\[ 3 , 4 \\], raising the question if autoinflammation could trigger CNS demyelination as has been previously reported in MS \\[ 5 \\]. It could be expected to be of genetic origin – probably with a monogenic basis – based on the common origin of both diseases (that is, autoinflammation and ADEM-ON) and the early onset of manifestations. Although none of the variants can be considered to be the sole cause of the disease, we hypothesize that the presence of polymorphisms in _NLRP12_ and _SIAE_ (Table 1 ) trigger systemic autoinflammation, and such inflammation could influence the demyelination process in an unknown fashion. NLRP12AD, part of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), has been associated with several autoinflammatory conditions that are similar to the immunological features of our patient \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no cases of NLRP12AD and inflammatory diseases in the CNS of humans. Interestingly, the role of _NLRP12_ in inflammasome activation in the brain of murine models, including a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, has been recently described \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\]. In addition, _SIAE_ has also been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases \\[ 16 \\]. However, this association has been questioned \\[ 17 \\]. Although we failed to find a candidate gene or a genetic link with the neurological manifestations, the variant in _POLR3A_ is important because bi-allelic mutations on this gene are associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 7 (HLD7) \\[ 18 \\]. Interestingly, our patient presents hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is one of the hallmarks of HLD7; however, the other clinical features and the MRI pattern are barely compatible with HLD7. Although only one of the _POLR3A_ alleles is mutated, a new association between heterozygous mutations in _POLR3A_ and susceptibility to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection (including encephalitis) was described recently. However, our patient did not show any evidence of VZV infection. Furthermore, these cases presented incomplete penetrance in healthy carriers \\[ 19 \\]. Thus, we cannot rule out a possible influence of the _POLR3A_ in the clinical features presented by our patient. High doses of IVIG are broadly used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases of different etiologies, including ADEM \\[ 20 \\]. However, the use of low doses of IVIG in ADEM-ON has not been extensively documented. Recently, a cohort of patients with multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM), of whom some received monthly IVIG treatment, was described \\[ 21 \\]. These patients showed improved clinical manifestations, similar to our case. Our patient has had recurrent autoinflammatory symptoms leading to neurologic episodes every 6 months on average. Since the treatment with low-dose IVIG and colchicine was started, he has not presented any autoinflammatory or neurologic symptoms. It is known that IVIG at high doses works as an immunosuppressant to treat several autoimmune diseases. This effect is probably mediated by scavenging of complement and blockade or modulation of Fc receptors. At low doses, it is used as a prophylactic treatment in patients with immunodeficiencies in part by neutralizing the antigens. This could be a possibility in this patient because it could be neutralizing the virus or antigens. Therefore, this treatment prevents potential infections that usually trigger the autoinflammation and neurological manifestations, as is broadly known in ADEM or MDEM \\[ 1 \\]. In any of these two scenarios, the IVIG and colchicine are preventing the inflammation that precedes the neurological manifestations. Typically, FCAS is treated with interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors such as anakinra, rilonacept, or canakinumab \\[ 22 , 23 \\]. However, given the difficulty of finding these drugs in Ecuador and our patient’s economic inability to acquire them, colchicine was prescribed. This medication has a widespread effect on autoinflammatory disorders and has been widely accepted as a treatment in other PFS, such as in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) \\[ 22 \\]. Apart from some minor gastrointestinal side effects, the medication has been well tolerated by our patient, and he has not presented any autoinflammatory or neurological symptoms.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【21】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of _NLRP12_ \\-associated autoinflammatory disease with neurological manifestations. We suggest that patients with ADEM-ON should be evaluated for autoinflammation (including variants in _NLRP12_ ) in the absence of documented infections.\n\n【22】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【24】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【25】ADEM:\n\n【26】Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\n\n【27】ADEM-ON:\n\n【28】Multiple acute disseminated encephalomyelitis attacks followed by optic neuritis\n\n【29】AQP4:\n\n【30】Aquaporin 4\n\n【31】CAPS:\n\n【32】Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes\n\n【33】CBC:\n\n【34】Complete blood count\n\n【35】CMV:\n\n【36】Cytomegalovirus\n\n【37】CNS:\n\n【38】Central nervous system\n\n【39】CRP:\n\n【40】C-reactive protein\n\n【41】EBV:\n\n【42】Epstein–Barr virus\n\n【43】FCAS:\n\n【44】Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome\n\n【45】FCAS2:\n\n【46】Type 2 familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome\n\n【47】FLAIR:\n\n【48】Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery\n\n【49】FMF:\n\n【50】Familial Mediterranean fever\n\n【51】HLD7:\n\n【52】Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 7\n\n【53】HSV:\n\n【54】Herpes simplex viruses\n\n【55】IgA:\n\n【56】Immunoglobulin A\n\n【57】IgM:\n\n【58】Immunoglobulin M\n\n【59】IL-1:\n\n【60】Interleukin-1\n\n【61】IVIG:\n\n【62】Intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【63】MAG:\n\n【64】Myelin-associated glycoprotein\n\n【65】MBP:\n\n【66】Myelin basic protein\n\n【67】MDEM:\n\n【68】Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis\n\n【69】MOG:\n\n【70】Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein\n\n【71】MS:\n\n【72】Multiple sclerosis\n\n【73】NLRP12AD:\n\n【74】_NLRP12_ \\-associated autoinflammatory disorder\n\n【75】ON:\n\n【76】Optic neuritis\n\n【77】PFS:\n\n【78】Periodic fever syndromes\n\n【79】VZV:\n\n【80】Varicella-zoster virus\n\n【81】WES:\n\n【82】Whole exome sequencing", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia experience unspecific physical discomfort or asymptomatic disease. These patients are typically characterized by mild to moderately increased blood ionized calcium and a normal to slightly elevated serum parathyroid hormone.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Four female patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia with inactivating mutations in the _CaSR_ gene were included in the treatment study. Three patients were related: two were siblings and one was the daughter of one of these. The ages of the related patients were 51 years, 57 years and 35 years. All three patients were carriers of the same mutation. The fourth patient, unrelated to the others, was 53 years old, and a carrier of a novel and previously unknown mutation leading to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. All four patients were Caucasians of Danish nationality. Biochemically, all patients had elevated blood ionized calcium, serum parathyroid hormone, serum magnesium and total serum calcium, except one, whose serum parathyroid hormone was within the normal range prior to treatment. All patients were treated with cinacalcet in a dosage of 30 mg to 60 mg per day.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Three months after the initiation of cinacalcet treatment, all our patients experiencing clinical signs of hypercalcemia had improved in self -reported well-being and in biochemical parameters. None of our patients suffered adverse events to cinacalcet treatment. Biochemical markers of calcium homeostasis were improved and remained stable during the observation period of 12 months (two patients), 24 and 36 months, in both the symptomatic and the asymptomatic patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare, benign syndrome affecting the regulation of calcium metabolism. FHH is an autosomal-dominant genetic disease with high penetrance, caused by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding the calcium sensing receptor, _CaSR_ . The loss-of-function leads to decreased sensitivity of the CaSR to ionized calcium (Ca <sup>++ </sup> ), shifting the set-point for Ca <sup>++ </sup> \\-regulated parathyroid hormone (PTH) release to the right \\[ 1 \\]. This set-point shift is followed by an increased circulating level of PTH and subsequent hypercalcemia. However, blood (B)-Ca <sup>++ </sup> is usually only moderately elevated in FHH patients, as is the level of serum (S)-PTH. In FHH, urinary calcium excretion is reduced and the renal tubular reabsorption of Ca <sup>++ </sup> and ionized magnesium (Mg <sup>++ </sup> ) is increased. Patients with FHH usually present with S-Mg <sup>++ </sup> concentrations in the upper end of the normal reference interval or it is only mildly elevated. In most cases, they do not experience as severe symptoms of hypercalcemia as those seen in primary hyperparathyroidism: cognitive dysfunction, kidney stones and skeletal complications. In most cases, patients with FHH are asymptomatic, or have a history of only mild symptoms, described as vertigo, uneasiness, feeling faint, tartar, muscle soreness or poor memory \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】Calcimimetics are allosteric modulators of the CaSR. They increase the sensitivity and the expression of the CaSR, thus enhancing the CaSR signal transduction. Cinacalcet induces a transient left-shift of the calcium set-point by increasing the sensitivity of the receptor to Ca <sup>++ </sup> , thereby decreasing the level of S-PTH \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. For several years, the calcimimetic cinacalcet (Sensipar or Mimpara) has been used for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid adenomas \\[ 5 , 6 \\], parathyroid hyperplasia due to kidney disease \\[ 7 \\] and parathyroid cancer \\[ 8 \\]. It has been shown that, after one year of treatment, the average pre-dose reduction in S-PTH is 7.6% in PHPT patients \\[ 5 \\]. In a five-year PHPT treatment study, cinacalcet treatment maintained a reduced S-calcium and S-PTH in the patients \\[ 9 \\]. The effect of cinacalcet on S-calcium and S-PTH has also been shown to persist for at least three years of treatment without dose modifications in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) \\[ 7 \\]. However, no significant effect has yet been seen on bone mineral density (BMD) after long-term treatment of PHPT or SHPT patients with cinacalcet \\[ 5 , 10 \\].\n\n【11】Cinacalcet is potentially a useful treatment of patients with intractable hypercalcemia caused by mutations in the _CaSR_ gene \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In three patients with FHH with the amino acid changes _F809L_ \\[ 11 \\], _R220W_ \\[ 12 \\] and _R220Q_ \\[ 13 \\], and in one patient with neonatal hyperparathyroidism with the mutation _R185Q_ \\[ 14 \\], a significant reduction of hypercalcemia was observed during cinacalcet treatment.\n\n【12】In the present study, the clinical and biochemical effects of cinacalcet treatment from 12 months to 36 months are assessed in four female patients with FHH.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】Four female patients with FHH were referred to our outpatient clinic at the Research Centre of Ageing and Osteoporosis. Three of the patients carry the previously reported inactivating mutation ( _R220W_ ) in the _CaSR_ gene \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【15】### Case 1\n\n【16】Case 1 (I-1) was a 51-year-old Caucasian woman of Danish nationality. She presented with elevated B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-calcium <sub>(total), </sub> together with slightly elevated S-PTH. Her calcium/creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01 and she was a carrier of the inactivating ( _R220W_ ) mutation in the _CaSR_ gene. She experienced muscle cramps and muscle aches and poor memory. Furthermore, she suffered from paresthesia in her extremities, uneasiness and osteoporosis of the spine, with a BMD T-score (mean of lumbar vertebrae, L1-L4) of -3.1 prior to cinacalcet treatment.\n\n【17】### Case 2\n\n【18】Case 2 (I-2) was a 57-year-old Caucasian woman of Danish nationality. She presented with elevated B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-calcium <sub>(total), </sub> together with slightly elevated S-PTH. Her calcium/creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01. This patient was a carrier of the inactivating ( _R220W_ ) mutation in the _CaSR_ gene and was the sister of patient I-1. She also experienced muscle cramps and muscle aches and poor memory prior to cinacalcet treatment.\n\n【19】### Case 3\n\n【20】Case 3 (II-1) was a 35-year-old Caucasian woman of Danish nationality, and the daughter of Case 2 (see the pedigree in Figure 1 ). She presented with elevated B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-calcium <sub>(total), </sub> normal values of S-PTH. Her calcium/creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01. This patient was a carrier of the inactivating ( _R220W_ ) mutation in the _CaSR_ gene. She was asymptomatic with normal BMD and no cognitive symptoms or other clinical signs of hypercalcemia.\n\n【21】**Figure 1**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Pedigree of the three related individuals diagnosed with FHH and carrying the** **_R220W_** **mutation** . Ι-1 and Ι-2 are symptomatic and have osteoporosis. ΙΙ-1 is asymptomatic with normal BMD. The amino acid substitution was found in the affected proband in Ι-2 and the same mutation was revealed in Ι-1 and ΙΙ-1. The filled symbol illustrates the individuals carrying the _R220W_ mutation.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】All three related patients initiated cinacalcet treatment in a dosage of 30 mg once daily. After one to three months of treatment, all of them had their dose increased to 30 mg twice daily. Due to adverse events, such as eye palpitation, the dose for patient I-1 was reduced to 30 mg once daily. The eye palpitation disappeared within days.\n\n【26】The biochemical data are presented in Table 1 . In all cases, their B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> was found to be significantly lowered (range of reduction of 11% to 13%, _P_ < 0.01) at first measurement (data not shown). The significant B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> lowering persisted after one year ( _P_ < 0.01) and, in patient I-2, after three years ( _P_ < 0.01). In all three cases, their S-PTH levels were significantly decreased after one year of treatment ( _P_ < 0.05) and, in case I-2, after three years ( _P_ < 0.05) (Table 1 ). In patient I-1 and I-2, spine and hip BMD were re-evaluated after one year and three years of treatment. No significant improvement could be detected upon treatment.\n\n【27】**Table 1 Biochemical data of the four patients treated with cinacalcet.**\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】Prior to treatment, patient I-1 and patient I-2 suffered hypercalcemic symptoms. Both patients reported improved well-being after only a few months of cinacalcet treatment. They also no longer reported muscle cramps or muscle ache. However, the degree of reduced memory was unchanged. Patient I-1, who suffered paresthesia in her extremities and uneasiness, reported that her symptoms had disappeared upon treatment.\n\n【30】### Case 4\n\n【31】Case 4 was a 53-year-old Caucasian woman of Danish nationality. She presented with elevated B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-calcium <sub>(total), </sub> together with elevated S-PTH. Her calcium/creatinine clearance ratio was < 0.01. Patient was carrier of a novel heterozygous _de novo_ inactivating mutation in the _CaSR_ gene leading to FHH. This mutation was a missense mutation caused by a substitution of amino acid glycine (G) for arginine (R) in the transmembrane codon 613. This mutation has not yet been published. Patient 4 suffered clinical symptoms of tartar, vertigo and constipation. Measurement of her BMD showed values within normal range.\n\n【32】Patient 4 was initially treated with 30 mg cinacalcet once daily but the dosage was increased to 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily from month three.\n\n【33】The biochemical measurements are presented in Table 1 . Her B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> was significantly lowered by 11% ( _P_ < 0.01) after one month of treatment (data not shown). This significant B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> decrease was maintained at a level even lower after increased the dosage and her B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> was 19% below baseline ( _P_ < 0.01) after the second year (Table 1 ). Our patient's S-PTH was also significantly reduced ( _P_ < 0.05) (Table 1 ). After two years of cinacalcet treatment, her BMD was unaltered as compared to baseline.\n\n【34】Patient 4 also reported improved well-being after only a few months of cinacalcet treatment, with the disappearance of symptoms of tartar, vertigo and constipation. In addition, she reported no adverse events.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】In the present series of cases, we observed significant improvement in the calcium homeostasis as evaluated by measurements of B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> , S-calcium <sub>(total), </sub> S-magnesium and S-PTH, which is in accordance with other case reports \\[ 11 – 13 \\]. Furthermore, the observations are in line with observations from PHPT patients with a cinacalcet treatment of up to five years duration \\[ 5 \\]. In our case series, after observing for one year in two patients, two years in one patient and three years in the fourth patient, cinacalcet treatment was well tolerated without significant side effects. However, in one case, eye palpitation was reported at a dosage of 30 mg twice daily; this symptom disappeared immediately after dosage reduction. This observation is in accordance with previous studies published on PHPT \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In the three patients experiencing symptoms of hypercalcemia prior to cinacalcet treatment, we observed self-reported improvement. For the patient who did not report any hypercalcemic symptoms prior to treatment, no change in well-being was reported.\n\n【37】Thus, our biochemical data confirms the observations of Timmers _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\], Festen-Spanjer _et al_ . \\[ 12 \\], Alon and Vandevoorde \\[ 13 \\] and Reh _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\], who all reported an effect of cinacalcet on biochemical parameters during short-term observation. Our long-term data show that the biochemical improvement towards normalization of B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-PTH persists for at least 36 months without side effects or the need for a change in dosage, as observed in one patient case.\n\n【38】In contrast, BMD did not improve in our observed patients treated with cinacalcet. However, the short observation time in two patients and only two and three years of observation in the remaining two patients may account for this. Although BMD data are sparse, our BMD data are in accordance with the observations of BMD reported on cinacalcet treatment in PHPT \\[ 5 , 10 \\].\n\n【39】Our study does have limitations. The data presented are based on only four FHH cases of an open-label uncontrolled treatment and changes of hypercalcemic symptoms are based on self-reported life quality. However, our four cases are all clinically and biochemically very well described \\[ 15 \\]. They have been followed in our outpatient clinic for more than 15 years.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【41】In conclusion, in four females with FHH we observed improvement in their B-Ca <sup>++ </sup> and S-PTH upon cinacalcet treatment, without significant side effects. The improvement of the calcium homeostasis persisted for up to three years without the need for dose escalation. However, BMD does not seem to be improved during treatment. In addition, self-reported symptoms of hypercalcemia in three symptomatic patients improved or even disappeared whereas one asymptomatic patient did not report any changes in wellbeing. However, in order to fully document the usefulness of cinacalcet treatment in FHH, a randomized controlled trial is warranted.\n\n【42】Consent\n-------\n\n【43】Written informed consent was obtained from the four patients for publication of this case series and any accompanying images.

Hormonal therapies have been associated with an increased risk of prothrombotic states. This case report documents a portomesenteric venous thrombosis in a postmenopausal woman with testosterone implant for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire and discusses the importance of identifying hypercoagulable risk factors before initiating hormone replacement therapy. We want to improve the awareness of an unusual medical complication associated with hormone replacement therapy and shed light on how testosterone implants could facilitate a thrombotic event related to other risk factors such as obesity and chronic hypoxic states, as well as the importance of differential diagnosis in the evaluation of postmenopausal women on testosterone replacement therapy presenting with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 55-year-old obese postmenopausal Hispanic female with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents with intractable abdominal pain, is found to have elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, and an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan revealing portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Further evaluation excluded inherited and acquired thrombophilia but revealed elevated testosterone levels. The patient was treated with anticoagulation, which resulted in recanalization of the portal and superior mesenteric veins.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Supraphysiologic levels of testosterone caused by testosterone implants as a treatment of hypoactive sexual desire in postmenopausal women can contribute to thrombotic events in the presence of additional prothrombotic risk factors. Therefore, testosterone therapy should include a thorough risk assessment for prothrombotic states, be tailored to patients’ physiologic testosterone levels, and have close follow-up with testosterone level monitoring.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a vascular disease that result from mechanical obstruction to the portal vein by a thrombus. Occasionally, the thrombus can extend towards the mesenteric and splenic veins \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. A feared complication is intestinal infarction, which requires prompt surgical exploration \\[ 6 \\]. Although uncommon, PVT should be included in the differential diagnosis in the evaluation of postmenopausal women on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) presenting with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【10】The diagnosis is clinically supported by imaging findings. Ultrasound is the initial examination of choice, with computed tomography (CT) scan providing additional information \\[ 3 \\]. PVT most commonly presents in patients with liver disease, malignancy, and also inherited or acquired prothrombotic states \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Some medications such as those used for hormonal therapy including testosterone have been associated with increased hypercoagulability \\[ 7 \\]. TRT has been used on postmenopausal women to increase libido \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. A 2019 global consensus position statement by an international expert panel recommended against the use of testosterone formulations, including pellets that may cause supraphysiologic levels, because of the possibility of adverse effects, including increased prothrombotic state \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【11】Management of PVT consists of investigating possible causes such as liver disease, malignancy, and prothrombotic states. Additionally, treatment with anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or thrombectomy should start as soon as possible to improve outcomes \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Prompt diagnosis and treatment lead to a favorable prognosis and reduce the risk of acute and chronic complications such as intestinal infarction and portal hypertension \\[ 3 , 6 , 11 \\].\n\n【12】We report a case that describes portomesenteric venous thrombosis in a postmenopausal female on testosterone therapy to treat hypoactive sexual desire. This case demonstrates that testosterone treatment with supraphysiologic levels can facilitate a thrombotic event in the presence of additional prothrombotic risk factors and highlights the importance of its early detection and treatment.\n\n【13】Case report\n-----------\n\n【14】A 55-year-old obese postmenopausal Hispanic female, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , presented to the emergency department in January 2019 with a 2-day history of diffuse and cramp-like abdominal pain that was worsened by eating. She denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the stool, abdominal trauma, recent surgery, and traveling. Medical history revealed moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without a history of recent exacerbation. Medications included Ventolin as needed, Symbicort, Spiriva without any new adjustments, and testosterone pellets implanted 2 months prior for treatment of reduced libido. She denied smoking, alcohol, and drug use. Family history was unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient had oxygen saturation of 95% on ambient air, heart rate 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 135/80 mmHg, and temperature 97.7 °F. Moreover, she exhibited unlabored bilateral breathing with good air entry, and her lungs had bibasilar reduced breath sounds, no chest wall retractions, and no use of accessory muscles.\n\n【15】The abdomen was soft, distended, tender to palpation in the mid-abdomen and right subcostal area, reduced bowel sounds throughout, and no rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin 17.5 g/dL, hematocrit 52%, leukocytes 9600 per μL, aspartate aminotransferase 55 units per L, alanine aminotransferase 62 units per L, lactic acid 1.4 mmol/L, lipase 98 units per L, a negative fecal occult blood test and basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and PT/PTT within normal limits. Abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast revealed portal vein thrombosis extending to the mesenteric vein (Fig. 1 ). Further evaluation excluded known causes of inherited and acquired prothrombotic states. Additionally, testosterone levels were 182 ng/dL. Hematology–oncology suggested a developed prothrombotic state possibly precipitated by TRT, chronic hypoxia, and obesity. Patient treatment consisted of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, which gradually improved her abdominal pain. A follow-up abdominal CT scan on day 3 of anticoagulation showed partial portomesenteric vein recanalization (Fig. 2 ). The patient was later discharged with rivaroxaban for 6 months of anticoagulation therapy and was advised against further HRT. Three months after discharge, she had hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL and no evidence of prior symptoms or signs of portal hypertension.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Coronal ( **a** ), sagittal ( **b** ) and cross-sectional ( **c** ) views of abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with contrast demonstrating portal vein thrombosis (white arrows) with extension to the superior mesenteric vein\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Cross-sectional views of abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with contrast comparing thrombosis of the portal vein (red arrows) before treatment and partial recanalization (white arrows) 3 days after beginning treatment\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】PVT is an uncommon medical condition with potentially devastating consequences if not recognized early. It has an annual incidence of 0.7–1:100,000 and a lifetime risk in the general population of 1%. Prevalence is higher in males between 45 and 60 years \\[ 1 \\]. PVT is defined as the partial or complete thrombotic occlusion of the portal vein, sometimes with extension towards the mesenteric and/or the splenic veins. It tends to be more frequent in patients with liver disease but is also seen in patients without liver disease and usually associated with an inherited or acquired prothrombotic state. Presentation of disease can be acute or chronic, with portal hypertension being a complication of chronic disease \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. In more than 90% of cases, acute PVT manifests with progressive abdominal pain and distention. Other commonly accompanying symptoms are fever and ascites. In extreme cases, the patient may present signs of acute abdomen and shock indicating bowel infarction \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 \\].\n\n【26】The initial diagnostic examination of choice is ultrasound of the portal vein, which can show partial or complete filling of the vein with a solid isoechoic or hypoechoic material. Ultrasound has a sensitivity and specificity range of 80–100%. CT and angiography provide additional information on clot extent and presence of intestinal infarct that helps in the diagnosis with a sensitivity close to 90% \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Radiological features of acute versus chronic PVT are high luminal density in the thrombosed vessel, lack of porto-portal collaterals, normal spleen size, no myeloproliferative disease, signs of intestinal wall edema, mesenteric vein anomaly, and filling defect \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【27】As previously mentioned, in patients without liver cirrhosis or malignancy, PVT may occur due to inherited or acquired prothrombotic states. Inherited prothrombotic states are caused by genetic mutations. These mutations include factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and deficiencies of proteins C, S, and antithrombin III. Acquired prothrombic states are caused by changes in substances that affect coagulation and may be secondary to immobilization, trauma, surgery, pregnancy, malignancy, and medications. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, and myeloproliferative diseases are additional examples \\[ 7 \\]. Medications that have been associated with prothrombotic states include hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone), and tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator). Additionally, anabolic steroids, methotrexate, erythropoietin, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors have also been associated with elevated hypercoagulability \\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【28】Testosterone has been used for many years to improve libido in postmenopausal women \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Testosterone pellets work by releasing small amounts of testosterone in the subcutaneous tissue, presumably over the span of 3–6 months. Testosterone pellets are still not well regulated; for instance, they are very difficult to remove once inserted and can lead to levels higher than those found in premenopausal women, for which women need to be closely monitored. In 2019, a global consensus position statement for the use of testosterone therapy in women diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and sexual arousal disorder did not recommend the use of any preparation that results in supraphysiologic concentrations of testosterone, including pellets and injections \\[ 10 \\]. However, no significant association with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism has been seen with TRT. The etiology behind this increased risk is still unknown, although it is hypothesized to involve interactions with undiagnosed procoagulable factors \\[ 11 \\]. Another possibility is testosterone's known effect stimulating erythropoietin secretion, which leads to increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and possibly blood viscosity. Nevertheless, these events represent a low risk of inducing prothrombotic events by themselves unless other risks such as chronic hypoxemia as seen in sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, COPD, or smoking coexist \\[ 1 , 12 , 13 \\]. A study conducted to investigate an association between secondary polycythemia and the risk of venous thromboembolism did not show clearly that polycythemia secondary to COPD or other chronic hypoxic conditions independently increases the risk of thrombosis. However, the authors did note that patients in the study with venous thromboembolism had significantly higher BMI \\[ 12 \\]. The dangers of venous thromboembolism by testosterone most probably depends on the patient’s age, weight, hormonal status, and additional prothrombotic risk factors.\n\n【29】Management of PVT involves investigating probable causes such as malignancy, liver cirrhosis, hereditary and acquired prothrombotic states, and treatment consisting of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, heparin, and Coumadin, or new oral anticoagulants. Additional treatment options are intravenous thrombolysis and thrombectomy \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Intravenous thrombolysis and thrombectomy can be considered if symptoms began within 12–18 hours before presentation. The treatment goal is to restore the portal vein circulation, thus preventing intestinal infarction and the eventual development of portal hypertension. Prompt treatment is essential because the thrombosed vessel rarely recanalizes spontaneously. Studies have shown favorable outcomes with early anticoagulation showing recanalization in the first week of diagnosis. Recanalization rates were complete in 38.3% and partial in 14% of patients \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. The extent of the thrombosis, the presence of ascites, and prothrombotic states are negative predictors for recanalization. After treatment has begun, close monitoring for symptomatology indicating intestinal infarction is important. Improvement in abdominal pain and the presence of bowel sounds are indicators of good response to treatment. Persistent abdominal pain and bloating despite anticoagulation can indicate intestinal infarction, and prompt surgical exploration may be necessary to reduce mortality \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【30】Studies have recommended anticoagulation for no less than 6 months in patients diagnosed with PVT with no specific cause identified. Long-term or life-long anticoagulation may be recommended if the patient persists in a hypercoagulable state, has recurrent episodes, or has a personal or family history of deep venous thrombosis \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【31】The prognosis for PVT is favorable if diagnosed early, and anticoagulation started promptly. The 5-year survival rate in this scenario is more than 85% \\[ 3 , 11 \\]. Complications are mostly related to either other predisposing conditions, late presentation, or surgery. The most feared complication is intestinal infarction because of its high morbidity and mortality of 20–50% \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\].\n\n【32】In the present case, our patient started improving after day 2 of anticoagulation. Repeated abdominal CT revealed signs of portal vein recanalization (Fig. 2 ). The patient was later discharged on rivaroxaban for 6 months, was closely monitored with no recurrence and no evidence of portal hypertension, and was advised against any further TRT in the future.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】We can conclude that, before starting TRT in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire, it is essential to do a thorough risk assessment for medical conditions as well as inherited and acquired prothrombotic states that may further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. In addition, testosterone treatment should be tailored to the female physiologic testosterone levels and include close monitoring of pre- and post-treatment testosterone levels. Hopefully, the benefits and risks of TRT for postmenopausal females will continue to be investigated. Finally, PVT is a rare but serious life-threatening event if not recognized and treated early. Therefore, the suspicion index should be high for clinicians evaluating severe abdominal pain in women on TRT.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】PVT:\n\n【39】Portal vein thrombosis\n\n【40】HRT:\n\n【41】Hormone replacement therapy\n\n【42】CT:\n\n【43】Computed tomography\n\n【44】TRT:\n\n【45】Testosterone replacement therapy\n\n【46】BMI:\n\n【47】Body mass index\n\n【48】COPD:\n\n【49】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Serositis is one of the systemic lupus erythematosus presentations, but peritonitis is a relatively rare presentation. Particularly, it is extremely rare to observe peritonitis as the first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Here, we present a case of peritonitis without other symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, in a patient who was finally diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Our patient was a 27-year-old Persian/Caucasian male with fatigue, weakness, weight loss, abdominal distension, massive ascites, and normocytic hemolytic anemia. He did not mention any prior medical conditions and did not use any drugs. There were no signs of thyroid dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, cancers, infectious diseases, hepatitis, kidney diseases, or other diseases. Low-gradient, high-protein ascites fluid, and positive antinuclear antibody and anti-double stranded DNA were in favor of systemic lupus erythematosus. Corticosteroid pulse therapy led to resolution of ascites, and the patient was discharged with prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Peritonitis is a rare presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly as the first presentation and in the absence of other signs and symptoms; however, systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered as one the differential diagnoses for peritonitis when other etiologies have been ruled out.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease that involves the joints, skin, cardiovascular system, lungs, central nervous system, and kidneys \\[ 1 \\]. SLE peritonitis is one of the rarest manifestations of SLE, and presents as painless ascites, concurrent with other known symptoms of SLE \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. The occurrence of SLE ascites is typically associated with nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, and constrictive pericarditis. The occurrence of ascites and peritonitis as primary manifestations of SLE is extremely rare \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】In this case report, we present a young man with ascites and lupus peritonitis as the first manifestations of SLE.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient was a 27-year-old Persian/Caucasian man with no medical history, who experienced 2 months of abdominal distension and weakness, with concurrent 10 kg unintentional weight loss. He did not mention nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, diarrhoea, cough, dyspnea, night sweats, or chills. He had no gastrointestinal complaints except feeling fullness. The patient was normoglycemic and had no history of hepatitis, jaundice, diabetes, drug abuse, or alcohol use. On presentation, his blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg and his body temperature was 37 °C. Abdominal ascites was apparent, with no icterus or edema. There were no signs of cheilosis, glossitis, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly on physical examination. Serological tests for viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative.\n\n【13】Laboratory findings are presented in Table 1 .\n\n【14】**Table 1 Laboratory findings at admission**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】The patients reticulocyte production index was more than 2.5. The 24-hour urine test detected 250 mg of protein. Color Doppler ultrasonography of abdominal vessels was normal. Abdominal, pelvic, and chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pleural effusions and massive ascites. The patient underwent abdominal paracentesis, which revealed a low-gradient, high-protein fluid. Ascites fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) and QuantiFERON test results were negative. In addition, PCR test was negative for tuberculosis. Furthermore, cytological test showed no evidence of malignancy. No signs of cardiac dysfunction were detected in his echocardiography. In addition, his thyroid function test, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and chest X-ray were normal.\n\n【17】Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsy were also negative for malignancy. With the exclusion of other etiologies of ascites, rheumatologic tests were requested. His ANA and anti-dsDNA were reported high. Due to positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-dsDNA, as well as low levels of complement C3 and C4, the patient was diagnosed with lupus peritonitis. Initially, he was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1000 mg/day for three consecutive days) and then with high-dose prednisolone of 60 mg/day, which was finally tapered to 7.5 mg/day. The initial corticosteroid pulse therapy markedly improved ascites, and the patient was discharged with prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine. He was followed-up in the outpatient clinic up to 3 months. His symptoms did not return up to 3 months. He was not accessible after 3 months of follow-up.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】SLE is an autoimmune, multiorgan disease \\[ 5 \\]. One of the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE is pleural and pericardial inflammation, which is nonspecific but prevalent \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Serous membrane inflammation involving the pericardium, pleura, and peritoneum can cause pain, fluid accumulation, adhesions, and even fibrosis \\[ 2 \\]. A European study with a 10-year analysis of 1000 patients with SLE follow-up found that serositis occurred in nearly 16%; however, peritoneal involvement was extremely rare \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【20】In an autopsy study of patients with SLE, 60–70% had peritoneal involvement, whereas only 10% showed clinical manifestations throughout their lives \\[ 9 \\]. Ascites in SLE is rarely massive; it is often painless, has a gradual onset, and is rarely reported as the first manifestation of SLE, usually following other symptoms. In addition, ascites can be a result of nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, or constrictive pericarditis \\[ 10 \\]. However, ascites appeared as the first presentation of SLE in our patient.\n\n【21】The first step in ascites treatment is the correct diagnosis of its etiology. Portal hypertension and peritoneal disease can lead to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity through activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, sodium and water retention, increased plasma volume, and fluid secretion into the serosa-lined cavity \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【22】The first step in diagnosing the etiology of ascites is fluid analysis. In portal hypertension, ascites results from vascular hydrostatic pressure, which leads to the formation of transudate fluid. On the other hand, in inflammatory or neoplastic peritoneal disease, changes in the permeability of vascular membranes result in the production of protein-rich exudative fluid \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【23】The mechanism of ascites development in lupus peritonitis has not been fully identified; however, there are two theories. One is the production of autoantibodies by B-lymphocytes. These autoantibodies precipitate in the peritoneum and cause local inflammatory reactions through binding to antigens and forming immune complexes. Another theory attributes ascites to inflammation of peritoneal vessels or serous membranes surrounding abdominal organs. Due to peritoneal involvement in patients with SLE in both conditions, ascites fluid is exudative \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【24】Lupus peritonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with exudative ascites after exclusion of other more common causes, including peritoneal carcinomatosis, primary mesothelioma, peritoneal pseudomyxoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, peritoneal tuberculosis, HIV-associated peritonitis, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, and severe malnutrition \\[ 11 \\]. Our patient had massive ascites without typical symptoms of SLE as defined by the American College of Rheumatology. During his workup, there were no findings in favor of other more common etiologies of ascites, and his laboratory findings were suggestive of SLE. Despite previous studies, this rare case of SLE shows that SLE can present with massive ascites as the first presentation. The absence of other clinical findings cannot completely rule out SLE and it should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses.\n\n【25】The prognosis of lupus peritonitis is usually good when appropriate treatment is initiated. The treatment is based on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. In refractory cases characterized by persistent fluid accumulation in the serosal cavity, immunomodulators or immunosuppressants, particularly pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide, can be used \\[ 2 , 8 , 10 , 13 \\]. Similarly, our patient responded to initial corticosteroid pulse therapy and his ascites volume decreased within a few days.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】Serositis is a common finding in SLE; however, peritoneal involvement is extremely rare, particularly as the first presentation of the disease. SLE peritonitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with exudative ascites after exclusion of other causes. This rare case of SLE shows that peritonitis can be the first clinical presentation of SLE, and the absence of typical symptoms of SLE cannot rule out the disease. The prognosis of SLE peritonitis is usually good, and treatment is based on NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants should be considered for refractory SLE peritonitis.\n\n【28】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】Not applicable", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

As a consequence, continuous renal replacement therapy and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were started. Methylene blue administration to reverse vasoplegia was decided, but unfortunately, Patent Blue V was erroneously administered, resulting in a severe clinical picture of methemoglobinemia and tissue hypoxia. As a therapeutic intervention, CytoSorb hemoadsorption was initiated, and rapid and significant reduction in plasma methemoglobin, accompanied by improved hemodynamics and normalization in plasma lactate levels, was observed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This is the first case describing the application of CytoSorb hemoadsorption in a patient with ecstasy intoxication complicated by iatrogenic administration of Patent Blue V. There is a potential role for CytoSorb in drug intoxication, which needs to be confirmed in larger series.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Since the late 1980s, the synthetic amphetamine derivative 3.4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has gained substantial popularity as a recreational drug, particularly among young party-goers at electronic dance music venues. Individuals who take MDMA describe a sense of euphoria, wakefulness, intimacy, sexual arousal, and disinhibition \\[ 1 \\]. Initially developed in 1914 as an appetite inhibitor but never approved for marketing, MDMA is primarily used for recreational purposes, and the potential for abuse was quickly recognized. Its neurochemical effects are comparable to amphetamines and methamphetamines and include stimulation of catecholamine release (that is, norepinephrine and dopamine) and blockage of their presynaptic re-uptake. Moreover, this drug also enhances both serotonergic and dopaminergic release, as well as inhibition of serotonin re-uptake \\[ 2 \\]. The widespread popularity of ecstasy is based on the misguided assumption that this drug is associated only with little potential toxicity. However, ecstasy has addictive psychoactive properties, and its abuse has led to an alarming increase of admissions to emergency departments worldwide. Indeed, complications are frequent and range from minor side-effects, such as bruxism, tachycardia, and trismus, midweek “lows” and a prolonged “hangover,” to severe and potentially life-threatening complications including hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), serotonin syndrome, acute panic disorder, hyponatremia with cerebral edema, and sudden cardiac death \\[ 3 \\]. MDMA may also occasionally have an impact on systemic hemodynamics, triggering capillary leakage syndrome and shock states, which are refractory to standard resuscitation. In this context, methylene blue (that is methylthioninium chloride) may be a potential treatment for refractory shock, as it prevents nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and contributes to maintaining adequate organ perfusion \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Another medically used dye is Patent Blue V, that is, sodium compound of (diethylamino-4-phenyl)(hydroxy-5-disulfo-2,4-phenyl) methanol, which is routinely used in lymphangiography and sentinel node biopsy as a dye to color lymph vessels. In some cases, its application can lead to skin sensitivity, rash, itching, and nausea but also urticaria, hypotension, and bronchospasm \\[ 5 \\]. In the circulation, the dye is highly protein-bound to albumin, excreted in the urine within 24–48 hours but also into the bile, and exerts an inhibitory effects on the mitochondrial function of human cells. Markers for intoxication with Patent Blue are significantly increased plasma levels of methemoglobin (metHb) and metabolic acidosis. In severe cases and if not rapidly eliminated from the plasma, this can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\n\n【11】A new hemoadsorption device named CytoSorb, initially intended for the treatment of critically illness associated with elevated cytokine levels (that is, sepsis, after cardiac surgery), has been recently proven to effectively reduce circulating levels of several medications for which no valid antidote is available (that is, ticagrelor and rivaroxaban) \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. The adsorption process is dependent on hydrophobic interactions and molecular size, and is also concentration dependent. In the absence of effective measures to quickly reduce toxic plasma levels of Patent Blue, CytoSorb could serve as a potential therapy.\n\n【12】We report herein a case of severe MDMA intoxication resulting in capillary leakage syndrome and shock refractory to standard resuscitation. Instead of methylene blue administration, Patent Blue V was erroneously administered to counteract shock, resulting in a severe clinical picture of methemoglobinemia and tissue hypoxia, which was successfully treated by CytoSorb hemoadsorption.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A previously healthy 27-year-old Asian woman (original from Vietnam) (body weight 45 kg) was admitted to the emergency department of a peripheral hospital in Brussels due to intoxication of unknown origin. The patient had no past medical history, no previous pregnancies, and a degree in economic sciences, and had been working in an economic consulting agency since 3 years previously; she had no chronic medical therapy prior to this intoxication, did not smoke, and rarely consumed alcohol. Also, no particular medical history from her family was reported. On the day of admission, she had been in a nightclub and was found on the floor with rigor, tachycardia, hypertension (190/100 mmHg), hyperthermia (41.6 °C), agitation, and altered consciousness. Direct intubation was performed; blood and urine drug screening checked positive for 3.4-methylendioxy- _N_ \\-methylamphetamine without concomitant alcohol intake. Upon admission to the emergency department, she was sedated and paralyzed and had dilated pupils; no abnormalities were found on lung, abdominal, cutaneous, and joint examination. No other focal neurological signs were observed (that is, asymmetric reflexes or pyramidal syndrome). Heart rate was 130 bpm, blood pressure dropped to 75/35 mmHg, and body temperature increased to 41.8 °C. She showed no signs of cyanosis or hypoperfusion. Initial echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%; chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates (probably due to aspiration), while electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Initial blood gas indicated the following: pH 7.28, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 32 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 182 mmHg (on FiO <sub>2 </sub> 100%), lactate 3.0 mmol/L, base excess −10.9 mmol/L, and metHb 1.1%. Laboratory tests showed: creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, glucose 55 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 4.9 mg/L, creatine kinase (CK) 3800 IU/L (Table 1 ). Over the next 2 hours she developed a severe shock state necessitating initiation of norepinephrine infusion. Meanwhile, serum lactate levels increased to 8.5 mmol/L and the patient exhibited diffuse bleeding in the throat, on puncture sites, the bladder probe but also from her rectum. Initial therapy consisted of fluid administration (that is 6000 mL crystalloids within 3 hours), intravenous glucose, and norepinephrine at 0.4 µg/kg/minute; also, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, tranexamic acid, and fibrinogen were given. At that point, the patient had hepatic failure, distributive shock, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【15】**Table 1. Results from main biological tests**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】Due to the option for potential liver transplantation, the patient was transferred to the Department of Intensive Care at Erasme Hospital, Brussels. On admission, she exhibited severe ARDS (pH 7.19, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 33 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 72 mmHg on FiO <sub>2 </sub> 100%, lactate 5.5 mmol/L, and metHb 1.2%), hemodynamic instability (that is, requirement for vasopressors), and persistent capillary leakage. Ongoing therapies included: propofol (2.0 mg/kg hour via continuous intravenous infusion—ivc), sufentanil (0.2 μg/kg hour ivc), norepinephrine (1.3 µg/kg/minute ivc), pantoprazole (20 mg iv q24h), cisatracurium (0.03 mg/kg ivc), and _N_ \\-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg day ivc). Results of blood samples are presented in Table 1 . As a consequence, antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2 g q8h) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated; the device was set in hemodiafiltration mode with a blood flow rate of 160 mL/minute, a total CRRT dose (that is cumulative ultrafiltration and dialysate flows) of 55 mL/kg hour, and citrate anticoagulation. Additionally, administration of IV methylene blue (2 mg/kg one dose) was prescribed to reduce vasoplegia and to reduce the norepinephrine requirement. Nevertheless, immediately after dye injection, the skin of the patient became green/blue, oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) fell to 75%, and blood analysis revealed MetHb of 21% and lactate of 8.1 mmol/L, indicating severe tissue hypoxia. While the patient was rapidly treated with a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) device, it was discovered that Patent Blue V had been erroneously administered instead of methylene blue (both drugs being one beside the other in the pharmacy), resulting in life-threatening methemoglobinemia. As no significant improvement was observed on SpO <sub>2 </sub> and persistent metHb > 15% was observed after a few hours of ECMO and CRRT therapy, a CytoSorb adsorber (CytoSorbents Europe GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was installed into the extracorporeal CRRT circuit before the hemofilter (Fig. 1 ) and CRRT prescription remained unchanged. After 15 hours, the adsorber was changed and a second absorber was used for another 20 hours. This treatment resulted in a progressive and significant reduction in plasma metHb accompanied by a decrease in norepinephrine dose and of lactate levels (Fig. 2 ); removal of toxic Patent Blue V into the Cytosorb cartridge was also observed (Fig. 1 ). Analysis of urines (that is blood, proteins, and sediment), different serological tests (that is herpes virus, different hepatitis viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , _Treponema pallidum_ , _Coxiella burnetii_ , and _Rickettsia_ spp) and microbiological samples (that is, blood cultures, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, and urines) all tested negative. The follow-up period after cessation of CytoSorb treatment consisted of weaning from ECMO on day 5, from CRRT on day 7, tracheostomy on day 19, and weaning from mechanical ventilation on day 26. The patient was transferred to the ward on day 30 and was successfully weaned from tracheostomy on day 41, before being discharged to a rehabilitation facility on day 56 and finally back home on day 75. At 2 years after ICU admission, the patient presented full physical recovery and is dialysis independent. Since this event, methylene blue has been placed into the ICU pharmacy and Patent Blue V into the general hospital pharmacy.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Changes in skin color of the patient and appearance of the first CytoSorb adsorber after treatment (green color due to extensive patent blue adsorption).

Treatment was associated with a rapid and significant reduction in plasma metHb accompanied by improved hemodynamics and normalization of serum lactate levels. Moreover, treatment contributed to removal of circulating Patent Blue V.\n\n【28】As with any suspected drug ingestion, it is mandatory to obtain a detailed history to guide therapeutic interventions, including the type of drug, amount ingested, last ingestion time, frequency of usage, route, and co-ingested substances. However, this is often not possible due to the nature of the intoxication. Of note, MDMA is mostly manufactured illegally, thus its exact composition and purity are often difficult to determine. Importantly, it is not recommended to delay care before the identification of the causative substance or substances. Drug screening may be inaccurate or time-consuming, thus the recognition of a specific “toxidrome,” that is common symptoms suggesting potential intoxication from a group of different drugs, should result in urgent medical treatment to support failing organs. In our case, we initiated supportive care immediately after hospital admission, although different extracorporeal interventions were necessary to help the multiple organ dysfunctions.\n\n【29】The development of serious adverse effects from MDMA intoxication vary from individual to individual, with no established correlation between the amount of MDMA ingestion and the severity of the clinical manifestation, which is why individuals can die after consuming only a small dose of MDMA while others have survived despite consuming lethal doses \\[ 9 \\]. As mentioned, the user may present with a wide variety of mild to life-threatening complications; there is no antidote for MDMA intoxication, so treatment options remain limited to symptomatic interventions. The patient described herein exhibited severe hemodynamic instability and hyperlactatemia. As the CytoSorb hemoadsorption device has been described as having beneficial effects on hemodynamics as well as metabolic function (that is, metabolic acidosis), we applied this technique with the intention of reducing toxic Patent Blue V plasma concentrations. During the course of the two treatments, norepinephrine requirements could be decreased significantly, which was accompanied by a resolution of the metabolic acidosis. These findings are in line with several case reports and series in critically ill patients treated with CytoSorb, although most of them were related to infectious complications \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. The extent to which Patent Blue V was adsorbed by the CytoSorb device remains questionable, as it was not measured during the course of this epicrisis. However, Patent Blue has an average molecular weight that should theoretically fit the adsorption spectrum of the device (that is, removal of “toxins” with molecular weights ranging from 5 to 60 kDa). Furthermore, the physical appearance of the cartridge suggested that considerable amounts of the substance had been removed from the bloodstream. As such, one can argue that progressive removal of Patent Blue V by the cartridge led to a point where the endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent enzyme methemoglobin reductase, which is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin, was able to convert most of residual metHb level and reverse the detrimental process.\n\n【30】This is the first case report describing the combined application of multiple extracorporeal support combined with CytoSorb hemoadsorption in a patient with MDMA intoxication accompanied by iatrogenic intoxication with Patent Blue. Neither MDMA nor Patent Blue have any known antidotes; therefore, their rapid and effective removal by the CytoSorb cartridge based on clinical parameters offers a unique opportunity in such cases of acute intoxication. There is a potential role for CytoSorb in wider drug intoxications, but this needs to be verified in larger series. A list of drugs that can be removed by CytoSorb is presented in Fig. 2 .\n\n【31】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】Data are available on request to the authors.\n\n【33】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【34】ARDS:\n\n【35】Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【36】CRRT:\n\n【37】Continuous renal replacement therapy\n\n【38】DIC:\n\n【39】Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n【40】MetHb:\n\n【41】Methemoglobin\n\n【42】MDMA:\n\n【43】3.4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine\n\n【44】SpO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【45】Oxygen saturation\n\n【46】V-V ECMO:\n\n【47】Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This holds especially true for the rare cases with multiple small supernumerary marker chromosomes. Most such cases are reported to be clinically severely affected due to the chromosomal imbalances induced by the presence of small supernumerary marker chromosomes. Here we report the first case of a patient having four different small supernumerary marker chromosomes which, apart from slight developmental retardation in youth and non-malignant hyperpigmentation, presented no other clinical signs.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Our patient was a 30-year-old Caucasian man, delivered by caesarean section because of macrosomy. At birth he presented with bilateral cryptorchidism but no other birth defects. At age of around two years he showed psychomotor delay and a bilateral convergent strabismus. Later he had slight learning difficulties, with normal social behavior and now lives an independent life as an adult. Apart from hypogenitalism, he has multiple hyperpigmented nevi all over his body, short feet with pes cavus and claw toes. At age of 30 years, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 50,XY,+min(6)(:p11.1-> q11.1:),+min(8)(:p11.1->q11.1:),+min(11)(:p11.11->q11:),+min(12)(:p11.2~12->q10:), leading overall to a small partial trisomy in 12p11.1~12.1.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Including this case, four single case reports are available in the literature with a karyotype 50,XN,+4mar. For prenatally detected multiple small supernumerary marker chromosomes in particular we learn from this case that such a cytogenetic condition may be correlated with a positive clinical outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Multiple small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) with diverse sSMC derived from different chromosomal origin are rarely reported. According to Liehr \\[ 1 \\], up to now 46 such cases were reported: 33 cases with two different sSMC, four cases each with three or four different sSMC, two each with six and seven sSMC, and one case with five sSMC. Overall, only seven of the 46 cases (= 15%) were reported as without clinical signs (according to Liehr \\[ 1 \\] cases 2-14, 2-17, 2-23, 2-26, 2-29, 3-3 and 7-1).\n\n【10】Patients with multiple sSMC constitute a sub-group of patients with sSMC \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Little is known about the formation of sSMC in general \\[ 1 – 3 \\] or about multiple sSMC specifically \\[ 4 \\]. As reported previously, chromosomes 6, 3, 5, X, 1, 7, and 12 are over-represented in multiple sSMC compared to their contribution to single sSMC \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【11】Here we report the first case with four sSMC derived from chromosomes 6, 8, 11 and 12, with almost no clinical signs.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our patient was a 30-year-old Spanish Caucasian man; the third child from healthy and non-consanguineous parents. The first child was a healthy boy and the second child was also a boy who died after two days due to hyaline membrane disease and prematurity. Our patient was delivered by caesarean section after 39 gestational weeks because of macrosomy, with a weight of 4250 g and an Apgar score of three, thus, intensive reanimation was required. Within five hours of life he suffered apnea. He was also hypoglycemic and hypocalcemic, but responded well to treatment without suffering a recurrence. Clinical examination showed bilateral cryptorchidism. During her pregnancy our patient's mother was treated with diazepam towards the end of the pregnancy.\n\n【14】When our patient was 19 months old, his weight and length were two standard deviations below normal. During further development, he showed psychomotor delay and a bilateral convergent strabismus; also he started walking when he was 22 months old. At the age of 10 years, his testes were surgically descended. And at the age of 13 years the strabismus was corrected. At school he had slight learning difficulties, with normal social behavior. He later left studying to become a painter.\n\n【15】When he was 22 years old, he had no facial dysmorphism, he weighed 89 kg, his height was 165 cm and he had a corporal index mass of 32.7. He had hypogenitalism, with a short thick penis (6 cm), and testes of 8 and 10 cc. He has multiple hyperpigmented nevi all over his body, showing no sign of malignancy after biopsy (Figure 1A,C ). He also had a left vesicoureteral reflux grade III, with normal renal function. His cardiac, audition and fundus of the eye examinations were normal, as was his blood biochemistry. His feet are short with a pes cavus and claw toes (Figure 1B,C ). At this time, he was referred to a Genetic Laboratory and one sSMC was found in his karyotype, which was considered to be _de novo_ because his parents had normal karyotypes. Now, at the age of 30 years a new blood sample for cytogenetic analysis was requested. Surprisingly, the high resolution G-band karyotype attained from this sample showed the presence of a relatively big SMC, together with the presence of three additional tiny SMCs in most cells. This cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 50,XY,+mar1,+mar2,+mar3,+mar4.\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**View of the patient at age of 30 years** . (A) Multiple hyperpigmented nevi at the trunk. (B,C) Multiple hyperpigmented nevi at the foot which was too short, showed a pes cavus and claw toes.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】To further characterize the sSMC centromere-specific multicolor fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (cenM-FISH \\[ 5 \\]) was carried out. From this the chromosomal origin of the sSMC was determined as 6, 8, 11 and 12 (Figure 2A ). By sub-centromere specific M-FISH (subcenM-FISH \\[ 6 , 7 \\]) (Figure 2B-E ) it was shown that the sSMC derived from chromosomes 6, 8 and 11 do not contain any detectable euchromatic material. Only for the derivative of chromosome 12 centromere-near material in 12p12.1 could be detected. The final karyotype was 50,XY,+min(6)(:p11.1->q11.1:),+min(8)(:p11.1->q11.1:),+min(11)(:p11.11->q11:),+min(12)(:p11.2~12->q10:).\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**FISH results obtained on the chromosomes of the reported patient** . (A) cenM-FISH revealed that the four sSMC were derivatives of chromosomes 6, 8, 11, and 12. (B-E) subcenM-FISH revealed absence of euchromatic material in sSMC derived from chromosomes 6, 8 and 11 and presence of centromere near material on the sSMC(12).\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Here we report the fourth unusual case with four different sSMC and the 34th case with multiple sSMC. It is the eighth case with no or only minor clinical signs due to the sSMC presence. The only detectable sSMC-related chromosomal imbalance is a small partial trisomy 12p11.2~12.1. According to Liehr \\[ 8 \\] there are several cases with a partial trisomy 12p12 due to an sSMC which were all clinically normal. Thus, this region seems to be a potentially transmittable unbalanced chromosomal abnormality (UBCA) without causing clinical problems (see case 12-O-p11.1/1-1 \\[ 8 \\]). Similar UBCA were recently reported for a multitude of chromosomal regions \\[ 9 \\] and especially for the centromere near regions \\[ 3 \\]. Thus, it is not clear if the sSMC have a positive correlation with the observed clinical symptoms.\n\n【27】Moreover, it is interesting that the multiple sSMC derive in the present case from chromosomes 6, 8, 11 and 12. Chromosomes 6 and 12 are over-represented in multiple sSMC cases reported to date compared to their contribution to single sSMC \\[ 4 \\]. This might point towards a specific way of formation of multiple sSMC during meiosis \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】The present case confirms that multiple sSMC may be correlated with an almost normal clinical outcome. This is especially important for the correct genetic counseling of similar pre-natal cases. Furthermore, a small partial trisomy\n\n【30】12p11.2~12.1 seems to correlate largely to no clinical effects. Finally, involvement of chromosome 6 in sSMC formation seems to be correlated with the tendency of multiple sSMC formation.\n\n【31】Consent\n-------\n\n【32】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The disease is poorly understood, and immunopathogenesis is constantly evolving. Cytokine release syndrome remains central to pathology of coronavirus disease 2019. Antivirals, anticytokine treatment, and other pharmacological approaches have failed to treat it. CytoSorb, an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber that reduces the cytokine storm and other inflammatory mediators in the blood, seems promising in treating severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This article presents three cases of Asian ethnicity of severely ill adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to intensive care unit who were treated with CytoSorb therapy. All patients used single CytoSorb device. During their clinical course, all patients were prescribed tocilizumab (an interleukin-6 receptor blocker), antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other antibiotics and general antipyretic drugs. No vasopressor treatment was required. The patients’ average duration of stay in intensive care unit was 30 days; the average duration of stay in hospital was 31 days. All three patients showed significant improvement in biochemical parameters and clinical outcomes post CytoSorb therapy. C-reactive protein levels decreased by 91.5%, 97.4%, and 55.75 %, and mean arterial pressure improved by 18%, 23%, and 17 % in patient 1, 2, and 3, respectively, on day 7 post-therapy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】All three patients improved clinically and survived.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the biggest global crisis in recent times. The disease associated with COVID-19 not only has high infectivity and fatality but also resulted in universal economic burden and heavy financial losses \\[ 1 \\]. As per the latest (3 June 2021) World Health Organization (WHO) consensus data, 170,812,850 confirmed cases and over 3,557,586 deaths have been reported. In India, approximately 10–20% of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 3–10% of patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation \\[ 2 \\]. Among the critically ill patients, the mortality rate is 49% \\[ 3 \\]. Since its outbreak, concerted efforts are ongoing globally to develop new treatments to overcome the pandemic. Corticosteroids, antivirals, antibiotics, heparin, convalescent plasma, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blockers are a few possible therapeutic strategies that are being used in treatment of patients with COVID-19 \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Pharmacological approaches have shown suboptimal results in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The results of the RECOVERY trial showed that, in the patients hospitalized with COVID-19, dexamethasone (6 mg daily for 10 days) reduced 28-day mortality among those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen, but not for the patients who were not receiving respiratory support \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. On 10 April 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for emergency use of CytoSorb (M/s CytoSorbents, Inc., Seven Deer Park Drive, Suite K, Monmouth Junction, NJ 08852, USA), to treat patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure \\[ 4 \\]. On 6 May 2020, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency use of CytoSorb to reduce proinflammatory cytokines levels in patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure \\[ 7 \\]. CytoSorb is an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber designed to broadly reduce cytokine storm and other inflammatory mediators in the blood that could otherwise lead to uncontrolled systemic inflammation, organ failure, and death in many life-threatening illnesses. The device has been safely used worldwide in critically ill patients with COVID-19 \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Here, we present a case series of three patients who were admitted to ICU at our tertiary care hospital with COVID-19 and were treated with CytoSorb as an adjunct therapy.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Patient 1\n\n【13】A 66-year-old woman of Asian ethnicity, with complaints of fever, shortness of breath, and restlessness, was admitted to ICU. She was confirmed to be COVID-19-positive \\[reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\\] with symptoms of pneumonia and associated Guillain–Barre syndrome. Her demographic details and clinical conditions were recorded in case report form (CRF) at the time of admission **(** Table 1 ). Cytometric bead array (CBA) report revealed high level of interleukin 6 (IL-6), 460 pg/ml. The elevated IL-6, moderate hypoxemia requiring an FiO <sub>2 </sub> of 0.6, and tachypnea (20 breaths/minute) indicated the presence of critical illness. Further, her electroencephalogram (EEG) report suggested the presence of diffuse nonspecific neurophysiological dysfunction. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test found the evidence of severe sensorimotor neuropathy affecting all four limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of multiple small focal and patchy confluent areas of hyperintensity in white matter of both the cerebral hemispheres, though there were no signs of an acute infarct. Findings suggested chronic microvascular ischemic changes and chronic lacunar infarct in the left cerebral hemispheres. Based on the overall picture, CytoSorb therapy was commenced within 24 hours of admission to the ICU.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Patients’ demographic, clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】Details of CytoSorb treatment and its mechanism are given in Additional file 1 . Sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) single CytoSorb device was used for 10 hours with a pump flow rate of 150 ml/minute. By the end of treatment, a sharp decline ( \\\\(>\\\\) 90%) in C-reactive protein (CRP) values was recorded on the following day (day 1 post-therapy) compared with baseline. There was also a decrease in IL-10 levels (from 12 to 8 pg/ml) after CytoSorb therapy. Other parameters, including mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum lactate, and serum creatinine, continued to improve till end of therapy. At the end of therapy, PaO <sub>2 </sub> / FiO <sub>2 </sub> level also improved. Figures 1 and 2 summarize the change of these during the first 14 days after hemoadsorption therapy. The patient received the recommended therapies of COVID-19 treatment protocol that included injection tocilizumab, plasma therapy, and antibiotics. For Guillain–Barre syndrome, she was prescribed intravenous immunoglobulin (25 g intravenously once daily for 2 days). She was discharged in stable condition after 45 days in ICU.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【18】Changes in C-reactive protein, mean arterial pressure, and PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> in all patients from day 0 to post-therapy day 1, day 7, and day 14.

He tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. His demographic details and clinical conditions are presented in Table 1 . He initially required mechanical ventilation with an infusion of catecholamines. Due to poor response to ventilatory support and progressive hypoxia, (PaO <sub>2 </sub> / FiO <sub>2 </sub> : 158 mmHg), CytoSorb therapy was started within 72 hours of admission to ICU and continued for 8 hours, maintaining the flow rate at 150 ml/minute incorporating the CytoSorb device in the SLED circuit. Details of CytoSorb treatment and its mechanism are given in Additional file 1 . Post CytoSorb therapy, CRP values decreased on day 1 compared with baseline (51.2%) and day 7 (97.4%). Improvement was also observed in other parameters, which are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for day 1, day 7, and day 14 post-therapy. The patient was also prescribed tocilizumab (IL-6 blocker) and convalescent plasma therapy. Following the treatment, ventilatory support was discontinued on day 6, and the patient showed clinical recovery in 11 days. On discharge, his condition was stable. His oxygen saturation level was maintained at 96%. Overall, 25% improvement in PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> level was noted.\n\n【25】### Patient 3\n\n【26】A 42-year-old man of Asian ethnicity, known case of COVID-19 pneumonia, was admitted to the hospital. The patient had complaints of cough and fever for the last 4–5 days. His demographic details and clinical conditions were recorded in CRF at the time of admission (Table 1 ). At the time of admission, his SpO <sub>2 </sub> level was 92% on nonrebreather mask (15 L/minute). MRI brain showed no evidence of acute hypoxic-ischemic or acute metabolic encephalopathy. Chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion and multiple hazy opacities in bilateral lung fields. Right lung was comparatively more affected, showing total collapse and associated mild pleural effusion with interlobular septal thickening. He was admitted to ICU and was immediately started with a single CytoSorb device maintaining the flow rate at 110 ml/minute with HD for 7.5 hours. Details of CytoSorb treatment and its mechanism are given in Additional file 1 . Along with CytoSorb therapy, the patient was also given noninvasive mechanical ventilation support. Since he stayed hypoxemic, he was intubated and put on invasive mechanical ventilation. He required vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability, and also underwent percutaneous tracheostomy for prolonged ventilator need. During treatment, he developed polymicrobial sepsis and acute psychosis, which resolved by the end of drug therapy. Laboratory parameters were recorded on day 1, till day 14 post-therapy. IL-6 levels from baseline decreased by 24.5% (from 2256 to 2808 pg/ml), 65% (from 2256 to 776 pg/ml), and 30% (from 2256 to 1572 pg/ml) on day 1, day 7, and day 14 post-therapy, respectively. IL-10 levels also decreased from baseline by 37.5% (from 16 to 10 pg/ml) and 25% (16 to 12 pg/ml) day 7 and day 14 post-therapy, respectively. By the end of treatment, a sharp decline in CRP values, 56%, was recorded. Improvement was also reported in serum lactate values: 25% on day 1 post-therapy. An improvement was also observed in other parameters as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for day 1, day 7 and day 14 post-therapy. Drug therapy was prescribed as per the COVID-19 protocol. He was administered remdesivir, tocilizumab, and plasma therapy. The patient was kept in ICU for 34 days. At discharge, his condition was stable.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】In this case series, patients suffering from critical illness of different severities due to COVID-19 were treated with CytoSorb therapy. We aimed to observe the extent of improvement in laboratory and clinical parameters after hemoadsorption.\n\n【29】Before starting the therapy, their clinical conditions were matched with the criteria suggested as per the guidelines recommended by global COVID-19 associations/societies to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients \\[ 2 , 12 , 13 \\]. They were admitted to ICU on the basis of their severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and levels of biochemical parameters as defined by clinical guidelines. As per the position statement of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, ICU admission is recommended in cases of PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> < 300, tachypnea ≥ 30 breaths/minute, or oxygen saturation ≤ 94%. Respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction (MODS), and septic shock are considered as life-threatening conditions \\[ 2 \\]. All patients in this case series were admitted to hospital with PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> level < 150 and respiratory rate (RR) > 25 breaths/minute, clear indicators for admission in ICU. Among these, patient 2 had severe respiratory failure at the time of admission.\n\n【30】Critically ill COVID -19 patients often present with some sort of hyperinflammation (also called cytokine storm in the most severe cases) due to the dysregulated inflammatory response due to infection with excessive activation of immune cells and generation of proinflammatory cytokines; IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and others. Indeed, in critically ill patients with COVID-19, it is a frequently reported phenomenon \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. Our results are also in accord with this, indicating some sort of an increased proinflammatory hyperactivity based on elevated CRP and IL-6 values.\n\n【31】Our results are also consistent with a recently published prospective randomized proof of concept pilot study in patients in septic shock published by Hawchar _et al._ \\[ 16 \\], and with another study in which a patient with COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia was treated with the combination of tocilizumab and hemoadsorption \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【32】Use of anticytokine therapies, such as tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) has been suggested by some studies as a promising treatment, which may be capable of reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 \\]. According to a recent recommendation from Italy (Brescia Renal COVID Task Force of using CytoSorb in COVID-19 patients), the therapy should be started within the first 6 to maximum 24 hours after the start of standard therapy and should be continued for 24–48 hours after initiating tocilizumab treatment. As CytoSorb adsorbs molecules of 5–50 kDa, tocilizumab (148 kDa) is not removed by this therapy owing to its larger size. Therefore, it can be used along with CytoSorb therapy. In this case series, all patients were started on CytoSorb therapy within 72 hours of their admission to ICU depending on their critical level of illness and continued for 24 hours (Additional file 1 ). It has been reported that starting the therapy within 24–48 hours of a sepsis diagnosis could lead to decreased mortality in both medical and post-surgical patients \\[ 20 , 21 , 22 \\]. It is also acknowledged that, in some cases, the use of more than one adsorber may be necessary, given the individual patient’s response to therapy.\n\n【33】All three patients showed speedy recovery as the period of ICU stay was comparatively shorter. Similar findings are also reported in a systemic review conducted by Rees _et al_ ., which included 52 studies from inside and outside China to determine the length of stay (LOS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. The study reported median duration of 5–29 days of hospitalization. For critically ill patients, LOS was reported for more than 50 days \\[ 23 \\]. In this case series, all patients were discharged from ICU within 11–45 days in clinically stable condition. An improvement in other vital parameters like heart rate (HR), RR, blood pressure (BP), SpO <sub>2 </sub> , and body temperature was also reported.\n\n【34】Generally, patients with septic shock and sepsis are prescribed vasopressors or inotropes in order to maintain hemodynamic parameters \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【35】All three patients in our study had a history of hypertension. Two patients (1 and 3) had diabetes with septic shock and sepsis with MODS, respectively. Their blood pressure values were normal at the time of discharge (patient 1, 126/60 mmHg; patient 2, 120/59 mmHg; patient 3, 149/73 mmHg). This indicates that CytoSorb therapy helped to wean them from vasopressor support, hence improving their hemodynamic stability. For all three patients, clinical management included antibiotics; hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma therapy, and general antipyretic drugs (Table 1 ).\n\n【36】To date, the device has been used widely in more than 3000 critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 in 30 countries \\[ 25 \\]. Various clinical trials are ongoing globally to investigate the effects of CytoSorb in COVID-19 patients \\[ 8 \\]. In general, it has been used safely in more than 100,000 treatments worldwide, primarily in the treatment of systemic hyperinflammation in a wide variety of life-threatening conditions such as septic shock \\[ 26 , 27 \\], influenza, ARDS, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), trauma, liver failure, pancreatitis, and multiple organ failure \\[ 25 , 28 \\]. However, the use of CytoSorb is globally accepted by clinicians and researchers only to be employed as an adjunctive therapy to lower cytokine storm, but not as a primary intervention to remove the virus \\[ 8 , 17 , 29 \\].\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】Extracorporeal cytokine removal could be a useful adjuvant therapy to overcome hyperinflammation in critically ill patients. It could also be considered as a potential therapeutic option to manage the serious complications of hyperinflammation and cytokine release syndrome in critically ill COVID-19-infected patients. However, patients undergoing\n\n【39】CytoSorb therapy should be carefully monitored with drug levels (when possible), and supplemented with additional doses as needed.The encouraging results of our case series indicate its potential in COVID-19 patients, and suggest a prospective study to further emphasize its importance in managing conditions associated with exaggerated inflammatory response.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】The data were retrieved from medical files of the patients and case report forms.

It is characterized by continuous or episodic movement at the frequency of 2–3 Hz. The exact mechanism of bobble-head doll syndrome has not been elucidated. Endoscopic ventriculocisternostomy is the optimal treatment option. In a literature review, there were less than 75 cases of bobble-head doll syndrome with suprasellar arachnoid cyst.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 1.5-year-old Asian-Syrian girl who presented with a history of excessive head nodding for 3 months that increased with walking, emotions, and stress; decreased during periods of concentration; and was absent during sleep. On physical examination, she was alert and normal, with no medical history. Laboratory assessment and ophthalmological examination were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-defined thin-walled suprasellar arachnoid cyst measuring 3 × 5 × 7 cm that obstructed the foramina of Monro, with resulting hydrocephalus ventriculomegaly. The patient underwent endoscopic cystoventriculostomy and cystocisternostomy for the suprasellar arachnoid cyst. During the 6 months of follow-up, the head bobbing disappeared completely, and her growth was normal.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Despite the rareness of bobble-head doll syndrome, it is considered an important condition that must be investigated early to detect the cause and treated promptly to avoid potential complications.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Bobble-head doll syndrome (BHDS) is a rare and unique movement disorder most commonly affecting children less than 5 years of age, and characterized by continuous or episodic forward and backward head nodding (yes–yes), or sometimes a side-to-side movement (no–no), at the frequency of 2–3 Hz. These movements disappear with volitional activity and are absent during sleep \\[ 1 \\]. The first clinical case of the BHDS was noticed in 1966 by Benton in a child with hydrocephalus due to third ventricular cysts; fewer than 75 cases in children have been reported since then \\[ 2 \\]. In a literature review published in 2018, the causes are commonly associated with a lesion in or around the third ventricle, causing it to dilate. The most common lesions are suprasellar arachnoid or third ventricular tumors, followed by aqueductal stenosis. Other causes include cysts of the cavum pellucidum and interpositum, developmental cerebellar disorders, communicating hydrocephalus, trapped fourth ventricle, and third ventricular choroid plexus papilloma \\[ 3 \\]. The most common symptoms and signs, in addition to involuntary and repetitive movements, include developmental delay, macrocephaly, ataxia, optic disc pallor or atrophy, tremors, hyperreflexia, endocrine disorders (obesity, precocious puberty), headache, and vomiting \\[ 4 \\]. The exact mechanisms underlying this movement disorder have not been elucidated. There are two main possible theories; the first hypothesis published by Russo and Klindt in 1974 is that BHDS is associated with dorsomedial compression caused by an abnormal flow of fluids towards the medial side of the thalamic nuclei. However, there are many opponents to this theory as not all expansions of the third ventricle lead to BHDS, and the symptom of typical extrapyramidal rigidity is absent \\[ 5 \\]. The second hypothesis, by Wiese _et al._ in 1985, considers that an adopted motor automatism has been developed to decrease the pressure within the cyst \\[ 6 \\]. The underlying causes of BHDS can be detected by computed axial tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) either without or with contrast, which is the best modality for the delineation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways and soft tissue \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 1.5-year-old Asian-Syrian girl presented to the pediatric clinic with the chief complaints of gradual onset excessive head nodding (side-to-side movement) for 3 months. Movements increased with walking, emotions, and stress; decreased during periods of concentration; and were absent during sleep. There were no other complaints or headaches. There was no other significant history. Pregnancy and delivery were normal.\n\n【12】On physical examination, the child was alert, with normal cognitive function. Neurological examination was normal. She had normal growth (weight 8 kg, length 72 cm, head circumference 44.5 cm).\n\n【13】Initial laboratory assessment including complete blood count (CBC), hepatic and renal function, and endocrine function tests were normal.\n\n【14】An ophthalmological examination revealed normal eye movements with no papilledema. Cranial MRI imaging demonstrated a large left-hemispheric cystic process with a midline shift, well-defined thin-walled suprasellar arachnoid cyst measuring 3 × 5 × 7 cm that obstructed the foramina of Monro, with resulting hydrocephalus ventriculomegaly (Fig. 1 ). Based on the cranial MRI and symptoms, a diagnosis of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst with BHDS was made.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Cranial MRI imaging demonstrated a large left-hemispheric cystic process with a midline shift, well-defined thin-walled suprasellar arachnoid cyst measuring 3 × 5 × 7 cm causing hydrocephalus ventriculomegaly\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The patient underwent endoscopic cystoventriculostomy and cystocisternostomy for the suprasellar arachnoid cyst (Fig. 2 ). The surgery was performed through a small para coronal burr hole on the right side of the skull. Insertion of the endoscopic trocar identified clear CSF that appeared to be under pressure. Very quickly, the cyst jumped towards our lens due to the high intracystic pressure. This high pressure seemed to have been compensated by the back pressure of the CSF. The fenestration was done very quickly. The cyst fluid seemed very clear and under pressure. With the bipolar probe, we removed a large part of the wall. Many other small fenestration holes were made in the anterior direction and at the bottom. At the end of the procedure, we achieved normal pulsation of the ventricle, with a good flow of fluid around the remaining membrane.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Endoscopic imaging identified an arachnoid cyst with ventricle\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】At follow-up 6 weeks after the procedure, she had a reduction in both the frequency and intensity of head movements. During the 6 months of follow-up, the head bobbing disappeared completely, and her growth was normal.\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【26】The exact incidence of arachnoid cysts is unknown because many may be asymptomatic throughout life. However, symptoms can occur when the cysts enlarge or hemorrhage. Recorded cases account for approximately 1% of all intracranial lesions, and 9% of them are suprasellar. The association between BHDS and suprasellar arachnoid cysts is extremely rare, but has been described in the medical literature \\[ 7 \\]. Almost all the cases in the literature review were symptomatic of head movements, as in Table 1 ; this may be either due to the large size of the cyst or the delayed diagnosis.\n\n【27】**Table 1 Cases of BHDS with arachnoid cyst from the literature review**\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】Our patient had no significant history, with normal examination excluding excessive side-to-side head nodding. A diagnosis of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst with BHDS was made based on the cranial MRI and symptoms.\n\n【30】The treatment of BHDS is based on the treatment of the primary lesion, and is usually surgical. It was treated before establishing neuroendoscopic techniques, with open marsupialization or permanent ventriculoperitoneal or cystoperitoneal drainage \\[ 8 \\]. Nowadays neuroendoscopic interventions with ventriculocystocisternostomy have gained popularity as a favorable therapeutic option for arachnoid cysts owing to successful results, while being less invasive \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【31】In summary, we report our successful experience of neuroendoscopic interventions with ventriculocystocisternostomy for the treatment of arachnoid cysts in a newborn with BHDS. Despite the rareness of the BHDS, it is considered an important condition that must be investigated early to detect the cause and treated promptly to avoid potential complications.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "557a65b3-7211-4b9b-9f0d-e0785b3c81fd", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Ankyloglossia is commonly reported as one of the major causes of breastfeeding difficulty. There is a lack of research on infant growth and latching performance with clinical measures.\n\n【3】### Cases presentation\n\n【4】We describe a series of eight clinical cases (three female and five male infants) in a specialized breastfeeding center in a tertiary hospital in Northeast Brazil. The mothers were of mixed race and ranged from 13 to 41 years of age. Ankyloglossia was diagnosed within the first 48 hours after delivery. We measured the standards of growth, the mothers’ perception of breastfeeding, and a pain indicator, and performed an assessment of breastfeeding. The regularity of breastfeeding was maintained despite the early diagnosis of ankyloglossia. Growth indicators were not affected in the sixth month in any of the babies, with only one measuring below expectations in the third month, with no impact on general health.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In the cases reported in this paper, the infants overcame the initial difficulties in breastfeeding and maintained their normal growth course in the first 6 months of life.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Ankyloglossia has been recognized as one of the causes of breastfeeding issues due to the baby’s inability to perform or sustain latching, which can result in breast pain, nipple trauma, and early weaning \\[ 1 \\]. The scientific community frequently reiterates the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) until the sixth month of life, highlighting the importance of preventing illnesses and morbidities during this time \\[ 2 \\]. Healthcare providers who interact with the mother–infant dyad must be prepared to intervene in the most common lactation issues that may impede breastfeeding \\[ 3 \\]. The Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) adopted legislation that requires all maternity institutions in the country to adhere to a treatment regimen that ensures proper diagnosis and follow-up of babies with ankyloglossia (Federal Law 13.002/2014). The MH protocol recommends management during the perinatal hospitalization to avoid proximal outcomes associated with early weaning and distal outcomes on the prevention of tongue functional problems such as deglutition disorders, phonetics articulation, and malocclusions such as open bite, abnormal separation of incisors, and other mechanical problems associated with oral cleaning, as well as psychological distress \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【10】Ankyloglossia, whether symptomatic or not, has been related to early issues in breastfeeding (BF), including poor attachment and nipple trauma \\[ 6 \\]. However, investigations are usually inconclusive owing to diagnostic difficulties or limitations in research design \\[ 7 \\]. The symptomatic diagnosis of ankyloglossia can be skewed as the development of stomatognathic functions may result in an adaptive stage of the tongue, capable of performing all its functions without the need for immediate intervention \\[ 8 \\]. Although frenotomy is a straightforward and effective procedure for the vast majority of symptomatic patients, it has risks such as infection, minor bleeding, pain and discomfort, and salivary duct damage \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【11】The purpose of this study was to examine the development of growth in infants with ankyloglossia throughout the first 6 months of life.\n\n【12】Cases presentation\n------------------\n\n【13】We followed up on eight patients diagnosed with ankyloglossia who was born at the Maternal-Infant Unit of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Maranhão (HUUFMA), in São Luís. The projected population is 1,101,884, with a minimum wage of 1212,00 Brazilian Reais (R$). The HUUFMA is a state-recognized tertiary hospital specializing in maternity and child health care. The infants were assessed 48 hours after delivery by two speech therapists.\n\n【14】The Ethics Committee for Human Research gave its approval to this study (no. 3.052.208). All infants’ parents were informed about the study’s aims and protocols, and they were encouraged to sign the informed consent form to participate. This is the preliminary outcome of a large cohort study being conducted at the institution.\n\n【15】The Bristol Tongue Assessment Tool (BTAT) \\[ 9 \\], and the Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (HATLFF) were used to make the diagnosis \\[ 10 \\]. To avoid bias in case selection, ankyloglossia was evaluated when the child had a different score on both instruments (BTAT ≤ 5 on a scale of 0–8; the appearance test scores range between 0 and 10, where a score is considered altered if ≤ 8, and function score ≤ 11 on a scale of 0–14 for HATLFF).\n\n【16】Following the first evaluation, the infants were followed up monthly until they were 6 months old. The LATCH scale (latch, audible swallowing, type of nipple, comfort, hold) was used to assess breastfeeding performance at admission and after the follow-up period \\[ 11 \\]. Scores ≤ 8 indicate symptoms of breastfeeding problems.\n\n【17】The mothers’ assessment of the quality and the amount of pain felt while nursing was gathered during the first and last follow-up visits using the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale—Short Form (BSES-SF) \\[ 12 \\] and the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MGPQ) \\[ 13 \\]. The higher the score, the greater the mother’s assessment of the efficacy of breastfeeding and the greater the pain or discomfort experienced when nursing.\n\n【18】During all consultations, data on the infants’ weight and length were obtained, and body mass index (BMI) and weight gain between consultations were computed using this information. The newborns were weighed on the “Balmak ELP25BB” scale without diapers. Length was measured using the horizontal stadiometer “Seca Mod. 416” (child lying down).\n\n【19】The World Health Organization software was used to compute BMI and age index _Z_ \\-score data (WHO Anthro software v3.2.2). Weight gain was estimated by dividing the difference between the current weight and the previous weight by the number of days between visits.\n\n【20】Table 1 describes the basic characteristics of the patients who were followed. Male patients outnumbered female patients. The average maternal age was 28.1 years \\[standard deviation (SD) 7.43\\]. All the infants were delivered on time and without any abnormalities that may have hampered their growth.\n\n【21】**Table 1 Data from the eight cases included in the follow-up study**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】Case 2 demonstrated weaning from the first appointment, introducing formulas combined with breastfeeding. In addition to mentioning pain when latching, the mothers said that the infant had grown accustomed to taking supplements and could no longer be weaned from them. Case 1 stated that they weaned the infant at 2 months since the baby was hungry and could not survive solely on EBF. Case 5 reported poor milk supply at 5 months and began supplementing. All other dyads breastfed exclusively until the sixth month.\n\n【24】Table 1 also reveals that half the mothers experienced early nipple fissure issues. Only three patients had no family history of ankyloglossia . Natural childbirth and skin-to-skin contact were also prevalent. Only three patients reported breastfeeding in the first hour.\n\n【25】Table 2 shows how the evaluation instruments has changed over time. After the sixth month, only two cases were recommended for corrective surgery (cases 2 and 8). The causes for the behavior were, respectively, the persistence of pain when nursing (albeit it was not regarded as debilitating pain) and significant restriction of lingual mobility. The BTAT findings for case 8 revealed a wide restriction of functional characteristics, which was verified by HATLFF.\n\n【26】**Table 2 Values of breastfeeding self-efficacy, pain, and breastfeeding scores at start and end of follow-up**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】Although some cases had less weight gain for their age, no infant had a change in the BMI _Z_ \\-score of less than one standard deviation, indicating that all cases had weight and height deemed appropriate for their age. Case 5 was the sole exception, with not only minimum weight gain but also a standard deviation of less than 1, indicating thinness. This was the only case where the patient had used a pacifier since the beginning of follow-up, and the mother had reported poor milk supply.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】The goal of this case study was to record the progression of the growth of newborns diagnosed with ankyloglossia, to see if, after the initial difficulties characteristic of breastfeeding, the babies would display developmental alterations or other signs of difficulties in the future (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【31】**Fig. 1**\n\n【32】Timeline summary of infants’ management. _BF_ breastfeeding, _BTAT_ Bristol Tongue Assessment Tool, _HATLFF_ Hazelbaker Assessment Toll for Lingual Frenulum Function, _BSES-SF_ Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale—Short Form, _SF-MPQ_ Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, _LATCH_ latch, audible swallowing, type of nipple, comfort, hold\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Even after a positive diagnosis was made, the majority of the patients proceeded to EBF and grew normally.\n\n【35】Even though the diagnosis was given in the initial days of life, the nursing scores did not indicate any problems. The link between ankyloglossia and nursing difficulties is frequently reported in the literature because the bulk of research including the diagnosis takes place in the immediate postpartum period \\[ 3 , 14 \\]. However, there are claims of insufficient funds to carry out this type of analysis \\[ 15 \\]. The absence of experimental research, which is sometimes ethically conflicted, impedes the confirmation that ankyloglossia is the sole factor in initial difficulties observed in breastfeeding.\n\n【36】Observational studies have shown that tongue function is essential in developing proper suction during breastfeeding, and in this way ankyloglossia could prevent the infant from applying the proper mechanism \\[ 1 , 3 , 16 \\]. Sucking is a complex process that involves the tongue and jaw in a series of compression movements and differences in pressure that allow milk transfer and adequate development of the stomatognathic system \\[ 8 \\]. Successful breastfeeding involves a complex interplay of mother and child and correct coordination of sucking and swallowing by the infant \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【37】Indicators of pain did not affect the cases studied. The case with the highest indicator on the scale exhibited normal indicators of development and breastfeeding. Pain has been identified as an essential finding in these individuals because it is a debilitating factor that might impede the formation and maintenance of EBF \\[ 17 \\]. Ineffective sucking induced by ankyloglossia can cause discomfort and reduce weight gain, resulting in excessive breastfeeding and affecting early breastfeeding discontinuation \\[ 18 \\]. Other variables, such as attachment and position issues, might, however, impact the initial challenges of breastfeeding \\[ 19 \\]. In certain situations, the link between breastfeeding problems and ankyloglossia may be skewed, because most studies conduct an assessment with infants during a time when most mothers have breastfeeding issues.\n\n【38】Nonsurgical intervention has previously been demonstrated to be beneficial in lowering the number of procedures performed on newborns \\[ 20 \\]. As a result, pain markers cannot be used to compile a list of the effects of ankyloglossia during the puerperal phase.\n\n【39】In this research, there were no cases of complete weaning, and most patients breastfed exclusively until the sixth month. Weaning is caused by a multitude of factors, ranging from societal factors to the usage of artificial teats \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【40】The hospital where the monitored babies were delivered is a Baby-Friendly Hospital, an effort that has been shown to minimize weaning markers via the implementation of optimal prenatal care, delivery, and post-discharge follow-up procedures \\[ 21 \\]. With the advocacy of exclusive breastfeeding, families are constantly reminded of the dangers of early breastfeeding interruption. Even with a positive diagnosis, no case indicated an absolute inability to justify discontinuing exclusive breastfeeding or even early intervention, which contradicts the literature \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【41】Findings on the effect of changes in infant growth markers have been published, even if indirectly. A systematic review reported an increase in milk transfer and production in a group of six mothers \\[ 23 \\]. Low weight gain has also been observed in a retrospective study of frenotomy follow-up patients \\[ 18 , 24 \\]. The continual advice provided during consultations, as well as the fact that patients are monitored in a facility specializing in breastfeeding, can help to explain the lack of substantial changes in the children’s growth.\n\n【42】We emphasize that establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between ankyloglossia and the outcome commonly reported in the literature is not possible; however, it is noteworthy that this series of cases can suggest information about the intimate relationship between breastfeeding difficulties and ankyloglossia, stimulating scientific debate on the subject. More research, particularly experimental research, is needed to investigate the link between the various treatment choices for infants with ankyloglossia.\n\n【43】There are presently just five randomized controlled trials investigating the link between ankyloglossia and breastfeeding. There were only 317 patients in the research, and the usefulness of frenotomy in enhancing the success of breastfeeding reported by mothers was verified in four of them. No study presented data on nonsurgical treatments, the subject of this case study, which revealed that breastfeeding is often unaffected even when ankyloglossia is present \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【44】Extended follow-up appears to be an important component of efficient breastfeeding in babies with ankyloglossia, especially in the first months of life. In this study, patients were followed up by a multidisciplinary care team that comprised speech therapists, nurses, and a pediatrician. Patients were encouraged to continue exclusive breastfeeding for as long as possible unless they had a severe illness that justified abandoning the practice. Correct training for the teams who engage with these patients can aid in reducing diagnostic errors and, as a result, the frequency of unnecessary procedures \\[ 25 \\].\n\n【45】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【46】The cases described in this study show that newborns diagnosed with ankyloglossia in the immediate postpartum period can overcome the initial breastfeeding difficulties and attain normal development. This finding suggest that nonsurgical management could improve breastfeeding outcomes and reduce the number of unnecessary procedures.\n\n【47】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【48】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Angiosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm characterized by rapidly proliferating and extensively infiltrating anaplastic cells derived from vessels and lining irregular blood-filled spaces\\[ 1 \\]. Skeletal angiosarcoma generally affects young adults and elderly individuals, and age distribution shows a wide range with a nearly equal distribution from the second to the eighth decade of life\\[ 2 \\]. Angiosarcomas tend to affect long tubular bones of the extremities and the axial skeleton, mainly the spine. The bones of the lower limb, particularly the femur and the tibia, are most commonly involved, followed by the pelvis, vertebral column, and the bones of the upper limbs\\[ 3 , 4 \\]. We describe an extremely rare case of a woman with angiosarcoma of the humerus who underwent chemotherapy and wide resection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 65-year-old Japanese woman fell as she was getting out of bed and injured her left shoulder. Plain radiograph and computed tomography (CT) revealed an osteolytic lesion in her proximal humerus with a wide zone of transition between the tumor and uninvolved bone (Figures 1 and 2 ). The cortex of her proximal humerus was thinned, and a pathological fracture was also seen, but cortical expansion was absent in that lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion with low intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate intensity on T2-weighted images (Figure 3 ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images showed heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated no distant metastases. Open biopsy revealed a tumor composed of anastomosing vascular channels and cystic spaces lined by malignant cells (Figure 4 ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed CD31, CD34, and factor VIII RA positivity, confirming the vascular origin of the tumor, and a diagnosis of primary angiosarcoma of bone was made (Figure 5 ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Anteroposterior radiograph of the left shoulder shows a pathological fracture with an osteolytic lesion.**\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Computed tomography scan shows cortical destruction of the proximal humerus and a pathological fracture.** ( **A** ) Transverse view.

During the three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy, the size of the mass did not change, but her spontaneous pain decreased.\n\n【33】After pre-operative chemotherapy, en bloc resection of the tumor was performed by extra-articular humeral and glenoid resection (Figures 6 and 7 ). The clavicula pro humero method was initially planned for reconstruction, but the acromioclavicular joint was collapsed, and the distal clavicular end detached from surrounding soft tissue during osteotomy of the lower aspect of acromion. Therefore, reconstruction with this method failed, resulting in a flail shoulder. After surgery, our patient did not wish to receive additional reconstruction surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Two months after surgery, she had moderate function according to a Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and International Symposium on Limb Salvage\\[ 5 \\] evaluation; she had scores of five for pain, one for function, three for emotional acceptance, one for positioning of the hand, five for manual dexterity, and zero for lifting ability. The total score was 15 points (50%). Our patient did not complain of any pain. Impairment of activity of daily living was slight when a sling was used.\n\n【34】**Figure 6**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**Immediate post-operative radiograph of the left shoulder after wide resection.**\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Figure 7**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】**Excised specimen of the proximal humerus.** ( **A** ) Macroscopic appearance of resected specimen.

After surgery, our patient's upper limb was immobilized with a stockinette-Gilchrist bandage. Four weeks after surgery, CT scans of her abdomen revealed distant metastases in her liver and spleen (Figure 8 ). One cycle of post-operative chemotherapy using the MAID protocol was performed, but she discontinued additional post-operative chemotherapy. We did not see local recurrence until the final follow-up. Five months after surgery, she transferred to another hospital because she had changed residence.\n\n【43】**Figure 8**\n\n【44】 \n\n【45】**Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan shows metastatic tumors in the liver and spleen (arrows).**\n\n【46】Full size image\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Angiosarcoma of bone is a rare malignant neoplasm and represents the most malignant end of the spectrum of vascular tumors. Approximately 6% of all angiosarcomas are found in bone\\[ 2 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, angiosarcoma of the humerus is extremely rare; only five cases have been reported in the literature in English since 1953\\[ 6 – 10 \\] (Table 1 ). This is an aggressive malignancy characterized by frequent local recurrence and distant metastases. These lesions occur during the second to the seventh decades of life, although the peak is during the third to fifth decades\\[ 11 \\]. Men are affected with twice the frequency of women. The most common osseous lesions are the long bones (approximately 60% of cases), particularly the tibia (23%), femur (18%), and humerus (13%), as well as the pelvis (7%)\\[ 12 \\]. The two most common symptoms are local pain and swelling.\n\n【49】**Table 1 **Reported cases of angiosarcoma of the humerus****\n\n【50】Full size table\n\n【51】Radiographically, there is no specific finding associated with angiosarcoma of bone as opposed to other malignant bone tumors. Lesions are usually highly destructive and may grow too fast to invoke a periosteal reaction. They may be eccentric and may have a purely lytic or mixed lytic sclerotic pattern\\[ 13 \\]. More aggressive features include osseous expansion, cortical permeation, and an associated soft tissue mass\\[ 14 \\]. CT and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of angiosarcoma may also be non-specific\\[ 14 \\]. In general, pathological fractures of high-grade primary bone sarcomas occur either spontaneously or after minimal trauma. The incidence of pathological fracture at diagnosis in patients with angiosarcoma of bone is unknown.\n\n【52】Pathologically, these tumors may contain either hemangiomatous or lymphangiomatous cellular elements, which are often difficult or impossible to distinguish histologically, particularly with higher degrees of anaplasia. Identification of vascular channels allows diagnosis; thus, the term angiosarcoma is preferable to hemangiosarcoma or lymphangiosarcoma for these malignant vascular neoplasms\\[ 15 \\]. Verbeke _et al_ .\\[ 16 \\] recently reported that primary angiosarcoma of bone exhibiting more than three mitoses per 10 high-powered fields (HPFs), a prominent nucleolus, and fewer than five eosinophilic granulocytes per 10 HPFs has a more aggressive course and worse outcome, indicating that these histological criteria have prognostic value.\n\n【53】In angiosarcoma, local recurrence is frequent, prognosis is notoriously poor, and early metastases develop. Metastases to the lungs and other parenchymal organs are found in about 66% of cases\\[ 15 \\]. It is reported that the majority of patients die within one year of diagnosis, and this shows that angiosarcoma of bone is an aggressive high-grade tumor\\[ 17 \\]. In our case, one month after surgery, multiple distant metastases were observed, despite three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy (MAID).\n\n【54】The treatment of angiosarcoma is often quite challenging. The cornerstone of treatment is en bloc resection followed by as much adjuvant radiation therapy as possible\\[ 18 \\]. Surgery combined with immediate post-operative radiation therapy could be an optimal treatment method, even if complete resection is possible\\[ 19 \\]. In our patient, adjuvant radiotherapy was not performed, because she refused.\n\n【55】The role of chemotherapy remains undefined\\[ 19 \\]. Several anticancer drug combinations, including cisplatin with doxorubicin, cisplatin plus paclitaxel, and cisplatin plus doxorubicin plus paclitaxel, have been investigated\\[ 20 \\]. Abraham _et al_ .\\[ 13 \\] reported that doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimens, which are commonly used for other sarcoma subtypes, have also been used for angiosarcomas. Patients were generally treated with doxorubicin-based regimens or vinorelbine, and 64% of patients had at least a partial response to at least one regimen. Given these data, a combination of mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine – that is, the MAID protocol – was administered to our patient before and after surgery. However, post-operative CT scans revealed distant metastases in her liver and spleen. Prolonged responses were uncommon, and better systemic agents are clearly needed.\n\n【56】Recently, a novel t (1; 14) (p21; q24) translocation was described in angiosarcoma of bone\\[ 21 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cytogenic aberration reported in angiosarcoma of bone. However, small series have shown the involvement of tumor-suppressor genes such as _p53_ and _p16_ , mainly in angiosarcoma of soft tissue, suggesting a possible role in tumorigenesis in a subset of angiosarcomas. It is still unclear whether primary angiosarcoma of bone is a true separate entity or is similar to primary angiosarcoma of deep soft tissues. Further molecular studies might be required in order to investigate the different therapeutic targets.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【58】We present an extremely rare case of angiosarcoma of bone with a pathological fracture. Our case adds to the limited literature on angiosarcoma of the humerus. The cornerstone of treatment is en bloc resection followed by as much adjuvant radiation therapy as possible. However, the role of chemotherapy remains undefined, and better systemic agents are clearly needed.\n\n【59】Consent\n-------\n\n【60】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and the accompanying images.

Further physical examination revealed the presence of two other ecchymoses: one at the inner face of the right forearm, starting at the wrist reaching the elbow and the other at the left flank of the abdomen. Diagnosis of AHA was based on clinical presentation and confirmed with prolonged a PTT, Factor VIII deficiency and the presence of an FVIII inhibitor. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids and low dose Rituximab.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Clinicians should consider AHA in front of prolonged aPTT with or without spontaneous bleedings even after inactivated virus COVID-19.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】In December 2019, a global health crisis arose due to the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Up-to-date, there is no effective drug for treating COVID-19 despite many trials \\[ 1 \\]. This resulted in an unprecedented race by pharmaceutical companies attempting to develop effective vaccines. Shortly after initiation of COVID-19 vaccination, a number of serious vaccine-related diseases such as myocarditis \\[ 2 \\], vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia \\[ 3 \\], and acquired hemophilia A (AHA) \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\] were reported. As opposed to congenital hemophilia, AHA is a rare autoimmune disease due to the production of IgG autoantibodies to coagulation FVIII that burdens high morbidity and mortality \\[ 8 \\]. The exact pathophysiology behind AHA remains uncertain, with a probable genetic predisposition, an association to certain underlying diseases (autoimmune disorders, respiratory diseases, allergic reactions, malignancies or hematologic malignancies) or to a triggering factor such as infections or pregnancies \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. The diagnosis is difficult in front of the lack of history of bleeding. It is presumed mainly on identifying an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), even without bleeding and is confirmed by determining a FVIII inhibitor \\[ 9 \\]. In this article we report a case of AHA occurring after an inactivated sinovac-coronavac COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 69-year-old Tunisian male patient consulted the emergency department at the month of June, for severe left leg pain limiting physical mobility due to a 5\\*6 cm large ecchymosis located at the left inner thigh, having spontaneously appeared 5 days prior consultation and without notion of trauma.\n\n【12】The patient had no known personal medical history, a family history of gastric cancer (father) and no psycho-social relevant history. He had received the second dose of CoronaVac-SinoVac vaccine 30 days prior to consultation. The patient reported a small ecchymosis appearing and disappearing spontaneously 3 weeks after the vaccination.\n\n【13】Further physical examination at the the emergency department (ED) revealed the presence of two other ecchymoses: one at the inner face of the right forearm, starting at the wrist reaching the elbow, measuring 15 \\* 5 cm and the other at the left flank of the abdomen reaching the left iliac crest, measuring 40 \\* 12 cm (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Ecchymotic spot on the left flank of the abdomen reaching the left iliac crest\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Both of these were secondarily reported by the patient as having spontaneously started 5 days ago, with no context of trauma. Soft tissue ultrasound performed in regard of the initial ecchymosis at the left inner thigh because of a 5 cm-asymmetry between the two thigh sizes revealed a hyper echoic infiltration of soft tissue located at the left inner tight.\n\n【19】The complete blood count showed marcrocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin at 8.4 g/dl; mean corpuscular volume at 103 fl; mean corpuscular hemoglobin at 32 pg/cell, hyper-reticulocytosis at 130 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and a normal platelet count at 475 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l.\n\n【20】The determination of Prothrombin Time (PT), of aPTT and of coagulation factors were performed by coagulometric technique on ACL TOP. In our patient’s case, coagulation tests showed an isolated prolonged a PTT (100 s) which was not corrected on the mixing study.\n\n【21】In front of the presumptive diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (AHA), treatment by systemic corticotherapy of 80 mg/die of prednisolone for 3 days was immediately initiated and switched by oral corticotherapy at the dose of 1 mg/kg. The patient received also tranexamic acid 3 g/die and red blood transfusion to correct the anemia. Bypass therapy was not considered if front of the absence of life-threatening bleeding.\n\n【22】In front of the patient’s age, the absence of history of bleeding or heparin-based treatment and the spontaneous occurrence of hematomas and ecchymoses associated with the isolated prolonged a PTT, specific determination of coagulation factors was conducted (available 13 days later), revealing an isolated decrease of factor VIII (FVIII) activity (F VIIIc equal to 1%).\n\n【23】FVIII deficiency was confirmed on two separate samples. The presence of an FVIII inhibitor was confirmed and titrated by the modified-Bethesada assay (BA) = 121 Bethesada units/ml, affirming the diagnosis of AHA.\n\n【24】The diagnosis of AHA was confirmed. After 17 days of corticosteroid treatment, the patient continued to show minimal improvement although the progressive shortness of aTTP and a course of rituximab 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly for four consecutive weeks was initiated.\n\n【25】To exclude possible secondary organic causes of hemophilia A, CT-total body was performed with no signs of malignancy. Screening for autoimmune (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-extractable nuclear antigen, anti-double-stranded DNA), lupus anticoagulant studies, and chronic infectious diseases also resulted negative. There was also no history of illicit drug intake or recent medication.\n\n【26】The patient was later discharged after the first dose of rituximab and followed-up weekly at the out-patient clinic. After the second dose of rituximab, we noticed a prolongation of a TTP without worsening of the hemorrhagic syndrome not leading us to the interruption of treatment given its delayed effect. Follow-up showed a significant clinical (healing of the ecchymoses and no reoccurrence of further signs of bleeding) and normalization of a PTT 18 days of treatment with corticosteroids associated with rituximab. The detailed therapeutic schedule along with the biological improvement trends over 63 days are displayed in Fig. 2 . There were no treatment-related adverse effects.\n\n【27】**Fig. 2**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Timeline treatment/aPTT\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】AHA is a rare autoimmune disorder resulting from the production of autoantibodies against FVIII affecting mainly the elderly with an incidence of around 1.4 cases per 1.000.000 \\[ 10 \\] and leading to high morbidity and mortality especially if untreated. AHA should be suspected in front of an isolated prolonged a PTT with or without bleeding and confirmed by detecting a FVIII inhibitor \\[ 9 \\]. Mostly with no identifiably trigger (43.6% to 51.9% of cases) \\[ 9 \\], AHA has been described to be associated with genetic predispositions, certain underlying diseases (such as autoimmune disorders, respiratory diseases and malignancies) and infections or pregnancies \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【33】Up-to-date, there is no effective drug for treating COVID-19 despite many trials \\[ 1 \\]. This resulted in an unprecedented race by pharmaceutical companies attempting to develop effective vaccines \\[ 11 \\]. This promptitude along with the emergency use authorization accorded to many vaccine led people to question vaccination safety and policy \\[ 12 \\]. In the literature, there have been many cases of AHA occurring after COVID-19 vaccination \\[ 4 , 7 \\]. Evidence about the causality of COVID-19 vaccines in the occurrence of a particular auto-immune phenomena thus causing autoimmune still remains unclear and debated \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【34】The strength of this study is that, to the best of our knowledge, it reports the first occurrence of AHA after an inactivated COVID-19 vaccination (Sinovac-CoronaVac). In this case, it occurred 30 days after the second dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine. Although it is very difficult to certainly conclude the causal relationship between the vaccines and AHA, and that the development of FVIII inhibitors post vaccination could be only a coincidental event, we believe that the association is valid in the reported case following a bundle of anamnestic, clinical, biological data as well as the timing between symptom-onset and vaccination. This is supported by absence of the common causes of AHA in our patient who did not have history of previous bleeding with negative autoimmune screen and no malignancies.\n\n【35】This study has some limitations. First, it reports the case of only one patient. Second, although the probable causal relationship between the AHA and the vaccine, eliminating a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was not possible retrospectively.\n\n【36】Currently, no post-vaccination surveillance programs recommends screening for clinical or biological signs of AHA, nor any other of the rare autoimmune disorders potentially linked to COVID-19 vaccines. Attention needs to be paid in the post-vaccine period mainly based on auto-surveillance. Apart from presentations with spontaneous or uncontrolled bleeding, clinicians must consider the diagnosis of AHA when faced with isolated prolonged a PTT. Treatment is focused on symptomatically treating any bleeding along with etiological treatment. In urgent situations such as uncontrolled bleeding, the administration of recombinant FVII activated or the activated prothrombin complex can help control bleeding \\[ 9 , 14 \\]. The main treatment of AHA focuses on inhibitor eradication relying on immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, rituximab and cyclophosphamide \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. In the current case, the patient was treated by low dose rituximab (100 mg/week for 4 weeks) associated with corticosteroids. This regimen is preferred than the standard dose (375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) to limit occurrence of side effects, mainly neutropenia, potentially dangerous to the elderly who have increased sensibility to infections \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】This article further highlights potential safety concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination.

One such disease is childhood primary angiitis of the CNS (cPACNS), which is described principally in the rheumatological literature. Primary blood vessel inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord is the hallmark of cPACNS \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Different phenotypes have been described, including angiography-positive nonprogressive (APNP) and angiography-positive progressive (APP) disease, which affect large/medium-sized vessels, and angiography-negative (AN) disease, which affects small cerebral vessels. Each phenotype has distinct treatment regimens and prognosis \\[ 2 , 4 \\]. Certain CNS complications of cPACNS include diffused or focal neurological deficits, stroke, impaired vision, and seizures \\[ 5 \\]. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is an established phenomenon in children that can lead to overwhelming consequences. Elevated ICP course and management, including decompressive craniectomy (DC), have been well described after failure of medical therapy to control the disease in the setting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) \\[ 6 \\]. Elevated ICP in the setting of inflammatory brain diseases has not been reported in children, and only scarcely reported in adults \\[ 7 \\]. In cPACNS, there is evidence of vascular inflammation, with elevated proinflammatory cytokines, notably interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both pathological and immunological causes may contribute to elevated ICP \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【10】We report a rare pediatric case of APP-cPACNS with refractory elevated ICP that required measures for elevated ICP management, including decompressive hemicraniectomy with a favorable neurological outcome.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A previously medically and surgically healthy 5-year-old Saudi girl presented with neck swelling and fever. She lived with her parents and siblings with good socioeconomic status. Parents are nonconsanguineous. Her initial vital signs during first presentation were a temperature 36.6 °C, blood pressure 85/53 mmHg, heart rate 101 beats/minute, and respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute on room air. She was admitted and diagnosed with right medial clavicular sterile osteomyelitis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scan. She was treated for 2 weeks with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin (see Additional file 1 : list of laboratory results and medications). Her symptoms resolved a few days after management initiation, and she was discharged in normal physical and neurological condition with oral sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Two months after her initial presentation, she was brought again to the pediatric emergency department (PED) febrile, with generalized tonic clonic status epilepticus (SE), which was aborted with lorazepam and phenytoin. She had no prior history of trauma, speech disturbance, limb weakness, behavioral changes, confusion, or febrile convulsions.\n\n【13】In the PED, she was tachypneic, tachycardic, and ill appearing. Her fever was 39 °C, blood pressure 131/94 mmHg, heart rate 142 beats/minute, respiratory rate 36 breaths/minute, and saturation 95% on non-rebreather face mask. Upon physical examination, she exhibited poor neurological responses, with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9/15, bilaterally reactive and symmetric pupils, strong gag and cough reflexes, and no focality, or neurocutaneous stigmata. Other systems examination including heart, lung, abdomen, skin, and musculoskeletal system was unremarkable. After SE treatment, she developed hypoventilation requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n\n【14】Initial investigations showed unrevealing extensive infectious work-up including serological and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tuberculosis and brucellosis, and noninfectious causes including metabolic, hematological, immunodeficiency, and genetic diseases. Genetic investigations included both patient and her parents, and was nonrevealing, comprising primary immune deficiency (PID) panel and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Immunological investigations comprised immunoglobin levels, oxidative burst assay, and lymphocyte markers. Initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and preliminary inflammatory analyses are summarized in Table 1 . Of note, von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels were elevated, and declined with disease improvement. She was started on empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy including meropenem, vancomycin, and acyclovir (see Additional file 1 : List of laboratory results and medications).\n\n【15】**Table 1 Laboratory investigations timeline**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】Initial brain computed tomography (CT) revealed no acute brain insult, and initial electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffused nonspecific slowing with no epileptiform discharges. She was then shifted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\n\n【18】On hospital day (HD) 1, the patient’s course was complicated with increased right focal seizures and signs of elevated ICP (fixed dilated pupils, bradycardia, and hypertension). She was managed with hyperventilation, 3% intravenous sodium chloride (NaCl) 5 mL/kg, and intravenous mannitol 1 g/kg. After treatment began, an ophthalmological examination showed unequal pupil diameters, 5 mm right and 3 mm left, with bilateral papilledema with blurred disc margins. Repeated brain CT angiography showed multiple hypodensities associated with diffuse brain edema with a midline shift of 5 mm and impending right uncal herniation. Due to clinical and radiological findings of brain edema, first-tier elevated ICP therapy was initiated, comprising medical neuroprotection with osmotic, sedative, and inotropic therapies: head elevation at 30°, adequate sedation, target arterial partial pressure of CO <sub>2 </sub> (PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 35–40 mmHg, target serum sodium of 145–155 mmol/L with 3% NaCl infusion, targeted mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg, and normothermia. Vasculitis treatment was also started, and she received her first intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) of 1 g/kg and was started on induction intravenous methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/day for 5 days. The patient then continued maintenance 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone in addition to intravenous 250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> cyclophosphamide monthly for 6 months.\n\n【19】On HD 4, magnetic resonance angiography/venography (MRI/MRA/MRV) (Fig. 1 A–C) showed significant changes in herniation. With acute status epilepticus presentation and bilateral vessel involvement at onset, she was diagnosed with APP-cPACNS. Despite first-tier neuroprotective measures, she was still showing signs of refractory elevated ICP with clinical and radiological signs of herniation. As such, second-tier therapy was commenced, and she underwent an emergency right frontal decompressive hemicraniectomy, with intraparenchymal ICP monitor insertion. A simultaneous brain biopsy and right upper abdomen quadrant implantation of a bone flap was also performed. Intraoperatively, the ICP ranged from 30 to 35 mmHg. The patient was shifted back to the PICU, where medical therapy and treatment of elevated ICP were continued, with a target ICP < 20 mmHg, which was successfully achieved 17 hours later by a thiopental-induced coma. Histopathology showed neutrophil vacuolation. There were few mitotic figures in the white matter and gliosis with prominent clasmatodendrosis.\n\n【20】**Fig. 1**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**A** Coronal T2 showing diffuse cortical swelling with T2 high signal intensity involving a large portion of the right cerebrum (star) along with a subsequent midline shift to the left, right uncal, right subfalcine, and tonsillar herniation (arrows). **B** Vessel wall image showing mild vessel wall enhancement involving the middle cerebral arteries (arrows). **C** Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) showing minimal irregularity involving the M1 and M2 segments of both the middle cerebral arteries (arrows)\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】On HD 6, the immune therapy was intensified. She received plasmapheresis daily for a total of five sessions, in addition to the maintenance intravenous methylprednisolone. On HD 15, the sedation and thiopental-induced coma were gradually tapered off, and the patient was extubated after clinical and radiological improvement. She was transferred out of the PICU to a high-dependency unit. On HD 60, she underwent cranioplasty using the autologous bone flap from the abdomen. On HD 81, she was discharged conscious and alert, with fluent speech and intact comprehension, and sat independently, but could not walk. She also had oropharyngeal agnosia evident by moderate-to-severe weakness in lingual movement, weak oral bolus manipulation, and delayed oral swallow initiation with oral residue, and laryngeal excursion to palpation was inconsistent and delayed with reduced laryngeal range of motion. She was discharged on levetiracetam, phenytoin, aspirin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone. Follow-up MRI/MRA/MRV 6 months later showed marked improvement of vascular enhancement (Fig. 2 A and B). Serial monthly clinical follow-ups in an outpatient clinic by multiple teams showed gradual progressive improvement allowing her to regain cognitive and speech abilities. One year after her initial presentation, she had appropriate cognition and speech for her age, normal cranial nerves and cerebellar examinations, and a mild motor deficit (4/5) with left hemiparesis.\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**A** Follow-up coronal T2 revealed right cerebral multifocal (mainly parietal and occipital) encephalomalacia (star) with _ex vacuo_ dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle (arrow). There were also small anterior and slightly larger posterior right pericerebral extra-axial collections (arrowhead). **B** Follow-up axial FLAIR revealed right posterior cerebral encephalomalacia (star) with _ex vacuo_ dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle (arrow)\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】To our knowledge, this case is the first report of pediatric APP-cPACNS with substantial CNS inflammation resulting in significantly elevated ICP. The elevated ICP also led to right uncal, right subfalcine, and tonsillar herniation that required decompressive hemicraniectomy.\n\n【31】Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a treatment for other diseases in children, such as infectious encephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, and cerebral sinus thrombosis \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. Omay _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] and Shah _et al_ . \\[ 15 \\] both reported a case series of children who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy due to malignant cerebral infarction, and ischemic stroke, respectively, who had satisfactory outcomes. The benefit of DC over other therapies is the rapid decline in ICP, maintenance of neurologic status, and the ease of performing neurological examination \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【32】There is no consensus regarding the ideal timing of DC; however, it may be predicated by neurologic examination, an incidence of neurologic deterioration, the degree of initial ICP, or the refractoriness of ICP to medical treatment \\[ 6 \\]. Taylor _et al_ . compared medical therapy versus medical therapy combined with DC in children with TBI and found encouraging results, indicating that earlier DC may be advantageous \\[ 17 \\]. During the early stages of our patient’s course and despite maximum neuroprotective measures with first-tier therapy and immunological therapy, including induction pulse corticosteroids and IVIg for the inflammation, her neurological status continued to deteriorate and cerebral edema with a midline shift progressed to herniation. The decision to proceed with hemicraniectomy was multidisciplinary to avoid significant morbidity and mortality. Her overall hemodynamic and neurological status improved thereafter.\n\n【33】Due to our patient’s past history of sterile osteomyelitis, an autoinflammatory disorder, predisposing her to other autoinflammatory disorders \\[ 18 \\], presenting clinical condition with SE and elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), vWF, and radiographic signs of vasculitis, while excluding other differential diagnoses, inflammatory brain diseases were investigated. She was diagnosed according to the Calabrese criteria \\[ 19 \\], which had been adopted for use in children > 1 month and < 18 years of age by Benseler _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\]. She had a newly acquired diffused neurologic deficit with angiographic evidence of large-vessel cerebral vasculitis. There was no evidence of a systemic underlying condition known to cause CNS vasculitis, as indicated by negative serology and major vessel, renal, and liver venous and arterial ultrasound Doppler.\n\n【34】Our patient presented with SE but exhibited effective neurological, serological, and radiological responses. Her course correlated with a previous report by Celluci _et a_ l. \\[ 20 \\] stating that patients with AN-cPACNS experience a smaller decline in disease activity following treatment compared with those with AP disease. Seizures at diagnosis also predicted higher levels of disease activity over time.\n\n【35】From the start of the case, the approach of a multidisciplinary team was undertaken. Due to the patient’s radiological finding of two major vascular territory involvement and unique bilateral signal intensity MRI changes, she was treated as having APP-cPACNS, which warranted aggressive antiinflammatory management. No management guidelines were available for cPACNS, but a review by Beelen _et al_ . \\[ 21 \\] suggested a treatment strategy depending on phenotype, consisting of induction pulse corticosteroid therapy followed by maintenance for 6 months, along with early initiation of monthly cyclophosphamide and IVIg, which we believe provided a favorable overall outcome.\n\n【36】The diagnostic yield of brain biopsies in children presenting with neurological symptoms is around 48.5% \\[ 22 \\], but biopsies are crucial to exclude mimics such as malignancy \\[ 23 \\]. Elbers _et al_ . \\[ 24 \\] suggested that nonlesional biopsies can be successful in establishing small-vessel cPACNS. Our patient’s lesional nonviable brain biopsy showed white-matter gliosis and widespread macrophages, with activated microglia but no nodules, and no hemophagocytic histiocytosis (HLH) features. We hypothesize that the diagnostic yield of our patient’s biopsy was lower than expected owing to the nonviability of the sample.\n\n【37】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【38】Decompressive craniectomy might be considered in cases of angiography-positive progressive childhood primary angiitis of the CNS (cPACNS) with elevated ICP refractory to medication. A multidisciplinary approach for the decision of decompressive craniectomy is advised to ensure patient safety and avoid possible morbidities and mortality.\n\n【39】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【40】Please contact the corresponding author for data requests.\n\n【41】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【42】ICP:\n\n【43】Intracranial pressure\n\n【44】cPACNS:\n\n【45】Childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system\n\n【46】CNS:\n\n【47】Central nervous system\n\n【48】APP:\n\n【49】Angiography-positive progressive\n\n【50】AN:\n\n【51】Angiography-negative\n\n【52】DC:\n\n【53】Decompressive craniectomy\n\n【54】TBI:\n\n【55】Traumatic brain injury\n\n【56】TNF:\n\n【57】Tumor necrosis factor\n\n【58】MRI:\n\n【59】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【60】NSAIDs:\n\n【61】Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs\n\n【62】PED:\n\n【63】Pediatric emergency department\n\n【64】SE:\n\n【65】Status epilepticus\n\n【66】CSF:\n\n【67】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【68】vWF:\n\n【69】von Willebrand factor\n\n【70】CT:\n\n【71】Computed tomography\n\n【72】EEG:\n\n【73】Electroencephalogram\n\n【74】PICU:\n\n【75】Pediatric intensive care unit\n\n【76】HD:\n\n【77】Hospital day\n\n【78】PaCO2:\n\n【79】Arterial partial pressure of CO <sub>2</sub>\n\n【80】MAP:\n\n【81】Mean arterial pressure\n\n【82】IVIg:\n\n【83】Intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【84】MRA/MRV:\n\n【85】Magnetic resonance angiography/venography.\n\n【86】RBC:\n\n【87】Red blood cell\n\n【88】WBC:\n\n【89】White blood cell\n\n【90】ESR:\n\n【91】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【92】CRP:\n\n【93】C-reactive protein\n\n【94】HLH:\n\n【95】Hemophagocytic histiocytosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Its pathological features include the presence of lipoprotein embolus in the loop cavity of glomerular capillaries. It is believed that apolipoprotein E gene mutation is the initiator of the disease. Since the discovery of lipoprotein glomerulopathy, 16 different apolipoprotein E mutations have been reported worldwide, but most of these cases are sporadic. Here we report two cases of lipoprotein glomerulopathy, a Chinese son and his father, with a novel apolipoprotein E mutation, ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys).\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Case 1, a 33-year-old Chinese man, was hospitalized on 3 March 2014 owing to edema and weakness of facial and lower limbs for 1 month. Laboratory data showed urine protein 3+, hematuria 2+, serum creatinine 203 μmol/L, uric acid 670 μmol/L, total cholesterol 12.91 mmol/L, triglyceride 5.61 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein 1.3 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein 7.24 mmol/L, apolipoprotein B 2.48 g/L, and lipid protein (a) 571 mg/L. Renal tissue examined by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy indicated lipoprotein glomerulopathy. Case 2, 55-year-old father of case 1, was hospitalized on 12 January 2016 owing to edema of his lower extremities for 6 months. Laboratory data showed urine protein 2+, hematuria 2+, serum creatinine 95 μmol/L, uric acid 440 μmol/L, total cholesterol 4.97 mmol/L, triglyceride 1.91 mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein 1.18 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein 3.12 mmol/L, apolipoprotein B 2.48 g/L, and lipid protein (a) 196 mg/L. Renal tissue examined by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy indicated lipoprotein glomerulopathy. Apolipoprotein E mutation test showed that they had the same gene mutation, a novel type of apolipoprotein E mutation.\n\n【5】Based on their clinical presentation and examination findings, they were diagnosed with lipoprotein glomerulopathy. Case 1 was treated with prednisone and dual plasma replacement, followed by simvastatin, nifedipine, triptolide, and angiotensin II receptor blocker drug therapy. After 1 month, the edema symptoms of the patient were alleviated, and urinary protein, serum creatinine, and uric acid were quantitatively reduced. Case 2 was treated with _Tripterygium wilfordii_ and angiotensin II receptor blocker drugs for 3 weeks, and his edema symptoms were alleviated, and urinary protein, serum creatinine, and uric acid were quantitatively reduced.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】The apolipoprotein E mutation in the two cases we reported was a familial aggregation phenomenon, and the mutation is a novel type, which we named ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys). The location of the gene mutation is close to the most common mutation type of lipoprotein glomerulopathy, ApoE Kyoto (Arg25Cys), so we speculate that its pathogenic role might be the similar to that of ApoE Kyoto (Arg25Cys).\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a new type of glomerular disease characterized by lipid deposition in the glomeruli. As early as 1987, renal lipidosis was described in a review by Faraggiana _et al_ ., but was not considered an independent glomerular disease at the time \\[ 1 \\]. In the same year, Saito _et al_ . reported this disease in the 17th Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Nephrology, and 2 years later, the disease was determined to be an independent disease and named LPG \\[ 2 \\]. Since the discovery of LPG, 16 different apolipoprotein E (ApoE) mutations have been reported worldwide \\[ 3 \\], most of which were from East Asian countries such as Japan \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\] and China \\[ 7 , 8 \\].There were also a few reports on ApoE mutations of LPG from European \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\] and American \\[ 14 , 15 , 16 \\] countries. However, the exact pathogenesis of the disease has not been fully elucidated.\n\n【11】Here, we report two patients with LPG, a Chinese son and his father, with a novel apolipoprotein E mutation, ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys).\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Case 1\n\n【14】A 29-year-old Chinese male was admitted to the Department of Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University for edema of face and lower limbs. Physical examination results showed that he had 167 cm body length, 54.5 kg body weight, and 184/110 mmHg blood pressure. He had slightly swollen eyelids, no xanthoma, no Achilles tendon thickening, no abnormalities in heart, lung, or abdomen, and mild edema of lower limbs.\n\n【15】Laboratory examination results are presented in Table 1 . After admission, he was orally given prednisone with dosage of 55 mg/day. One week later, a renal biopsy was collected and 17 glomeruli were examined under light microscope. It was found that one glomeruli was hardened, the rest were enlarged, and the capillary loops were highly dilated (Fig. 1 A). Fibrosis around glomerular balloon was also observed (Fig. 1 B). There was dilation of capillary loops, and thrombotic substances were found in the lumen (Fig. 1 C). There was no obvious polyhemoglobin deposition in the glomeruli (Fig. 1 D). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that immunoglobulin A (IgA) was positive (not shown). Electron microscopy results showed capillary endothelial cells with obvious vacuolar degeneration and a large number of lipid vacuolar protein substances in the cavity (Fig. 1 E).\n\n【16】**Table 1 Results of patients’ laboratory examination**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Histological analysis for the renal biopsy specimens in case 1 under light microscope. **A** Hardened glomerulus \\[hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, ×200\\]. **B** Glomerular periballoon fibrosis \\[periodic acid–Schiff–methenamine (PASM) staining, ×200\\]. **C** Dilation of capillary loops and presence of thrombotic substances in the lumen \\[periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining, ×200\\]. **D** Polyhemoglobin deposition in the glomeruli (Masson staining, ×200). **E** Electron microscopy results showing capillary endothelial cells with obvious vacuolar degeneration and a large number of lipid vacuolar protein substances in the cavity (scale bar, 5 μm)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Based on the above clinical manifestations and examination results, the patient was diagnosed with LPG. The dose of prednisone was rapidly reduced to 15 mg for oral maintenance in a short period of time. Meanwhile, double plasma replacement was performed, and simvastatin lipid-lowering drug triptolide (60 mg/day) and blood-pressure-lowering drug angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were administered. The patient has been receiving dialysis treatment in our hospital since discharge.\n\n【23】We did not perform ApoE gene mutation test for this patient at that time. About 2 years later when his father was diagnosed with LPG, we decided to examine genetic factors for these two individuals. Kidney genomic DNA was collected from these two and sequenced. The results showed that nucleotide 127 of the ApoE-gene-encoding region was mutated from cytosine to thymine (g.127C>T), which resulted in a missense mutation of amino acid 43 from arginine to cysteine (Fig. 2 ). His father had the same ApoE mutation, while his mother had no mutation. This is a novel mutation in ApoE gene, and we named it ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys). We searched the GnomAD database for this DNA sequence variant, and found that this mutation was most common in East Asia and Europe (Finland), with frequencies of 0.00005445 and 0.00004654, respectively. We investigated his family history and found that his mother, sister, and daughter had no symptoms of LPG (Fig. 3 ). Therefore, he obtained the gene mutation from his father, and the disease is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】DNA sequence analysis for ApoE mutation. ApoE gene was sequenced in genomic DNA from both patients ( **A** , case 1; **B** , case 2) and a family member ( **C** , mother of case 1). Both patients had a heterozygous ApoE mutation of C-to-T transition in exon 3 that changed the amino acid at position 43 of the mature protein from arginine to cysteine.

Physical examination showed that he had 167 cm body length, 56.5 kg body weight, and 139/88 mmHg blood pressure. He had no edema in the face, no abnormal heart, clear breathing sound but audible moist rales in both lungs, no abnormal abdomen, and no percussion pain in the renal area. He had slight edema of lower limbs.\n\n【33】Laboratory examination results are presented in Table 1 . Renal biopsy revealed four glomerular scleroses (Fig. 4 A) and one glomerular segmental sclerosis (Fig. 4 B). It was found that the capillary loops of the rest of the glomerulus without sclerosis were highly dilated, and the cavities were filled with lightly stained, vacuolated thrombotic substances. Oil Red O staining results of kidney were positive (data not shown). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that ApoE was positive (Fig. 4 C). Electron microscopy showed that capillary endothelial cells were obviously degenerated (Fig. 4 D), and a large number of lipid vacuolar protein substances were found in the cavity (Fig. 4 E). ApoE gene sequencing revealed that he had the same mutation, ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys), as his son (Case 1) (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【34】**Fig. 4.**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】Histological analysis of the renal biopsy specimens in case 2. **A** Hardened glomerulus under light microscope (PASM staining, ×200). **B** Glomerulus with segmental sclerosis under light microscope (PASM staining, ×200). **C** Immunofluorescence microscopy results showing positive ApoE. **D** and **E** Electron microscopy results showing capillary endothelial cells with obvious vacuolar degeneration, and a large number of lipid vacuolar protein substances in the cavity (scale bar, 2 μm for **D** and 0.5 μm for **E** )\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】According to the clinical manifestations and examination results, the patient was diagnosed with LPG and given _Tripterygium wilfordii_ (60 mg/day), ARB drugs, and other treatments. His condition is stable at present.\n\n【39】### Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【40】Case 1 developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 4 years after discharge and underwent maintenance hemodialysis until now. Case 2 was followed up for 4 years and his renal function is stable at present.\n\n【41】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【42】The exact pathogenesis of LPG has not been fully elucidated, but ApoE gene mutation was recognized as one of causes of the disease. ApoE is a glycoprotein whose mature form consists of 299 amino acid residues (molecular weight ~ 34 kD) (Fig. 5 A). ApoE contains several primary domains, including LDL-receptor binding site (LRBS, amino acids 136–150), hinge site (HR, amino acids 192–215), and lipid binding region (LBR, amino acids 244 to 272) \\[ 3 \\]. ApoE is mainly composed of HDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). By binding with LDL or LDL-related protein, it mediates the uptake of lipoprotein (mainly triglyceride) by cells, and plays an important role in the metabolism of blood lipid. The genotypes of ApoE are 2, 3, and 4, and their corresponding monomer phenotypes are E2, E3, and E4, respectively. The difference between them lies in the distinction of amino acid residues at positions 112 and 158. Both are cysteine in E2, and arginine in E4, but arginine and cysteine locate in E3. Human ApoE consists of two monomer phenotypes, and the most common phenotype is ApoE3/3.\n\n【43】**Fig. 5**\n\n【44】 \n\n【45】Structure and mutations of ApoE. **A** Important regions of ApoE and the difference among E2, E3, and E4 at positions 112 and 158. **B** Seventeen different ApoE mutations reported, and a novel mutation, ApoE Ganzhou (Arg43Cys), marked in red. _LRBS_ LDL-receptor binding site, _HR_ hinge region, _LBP_ lipid binding position, _Cys_ cysteine, _Arg_ arginine, _Glu_ glutamic acid, _Lys_ lysine, _Pro_ proline, _Gly_ glycine, _Leu_ leucine, _Ser_ serine, _del_ deletion, _Ala_ alanine, _Gln_ glutamine, _Asp_ aspartic acid, _Tyr_ tyrosine\n\n【46】Full size image\n\n【47】Various ApoE gene mutations have been found in patients with LPG. The first reported mutation was ApoE Sendai (Arg145Pro) \\[ 2 \\]. So far, 16 different types of gene mutations have been reported worldwide (Fig. 5 B). Nearly half of mutations occurred in the LDL-receptor binding site (LRBS), such as ApoE Sendai (Arg145Pro) \\[ 2 \\], ApoE Chicago (Arg147Cys) \\[ 16 \\], ApoE Guangzhou (Arg150Pro)\\[ 17 \\], ApoE Modena (Arg 150Cys) \\[ 11 \\], ApoE Okayama (Arg150Gly) \\[ 18 \\], ApoE Tokyo (Del 141-143) \\[ 19 \\], and ApoE Maebasi (Del 142-144). These mutations might result in reduced binding capacity of ApoE protein to LDL receptor. Other mutations locate outside of LRBS, such as ApoE5 (Glu3Lys) \\[ 20 \\], ApoE Kyoto (Arg25Cys) \\[ 21 \\], ApoE Tsukuba (Arg114 Cys) \\[ 22 \\], ApoE Las Vegas (Ala152Asp) \\[ 14 \\], ApoE1 (Del 156-173) \\[ 23 \\], ApoE Osak/Kurashiki (Arg158 Pro) \\[ 24 \\], ApoE Toranomon (Gln187Glu) \\[ 25 \\], ApoE Toyonaka (Ser 197Cys) \\[ 26 \\], and ApoE Hong Kong (Asp230Tyr) \\[ 27 \\]. These mutations may change the spatial conformation and stability of ApoE protein.\n\n【48】LPG has a wide range of age distribution, and occurs in all patients aged 4–69 years old. However, recent cases have also been reported in newborn baby and people in their seventies \\[ 28 \\]. The incidence of LPG is approximately 2:1 in men and women. In previous literature reports, most cases were sporadic, and some cases were familial \\[ 7 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 \\]. Patients presented with varying degrees of proteinuria, mostly with nephrotic syndrome, and a few with only mild proteinuria. About one-half of patients developed end-stage renal disease with varying durations. Some patients presented with hypertension, arteriosclerosis, liver function abnormality, and other systemic manifestations, but the degree was very light. Most patients with LPG had abnormal lipoprotein and dyslipidemia, similar to type III hyperlipoproteinemia \\[ 3 \\]. Histological features are the most important evidence for the diagnosis of LPG \\[ 2 \\]. Under light microscopy, the capillary lumen is typically highly dilated and filled with lightly stained reticular material. Mesangial dissolution and light to moderate mesangial hyperplasia are often seen. Some mesangial matrix may be inserted into the basement membrane of the glomeruli, forming a double orbital sign. Oil Red O staining shows the presence of lipid droplets in the capillary lumen. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows positive staining of ApoE and ApoB in lumen thrombotic substances. The capillary cavity is filled with lipid vacuoles under electron microscope.\n\n【49】At present, there is no specific treatment for LPG, and adrenal corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, and anticoagulants have no obvious effect. Lipid-lowering therapy has been reported to relieve hyperlipidemia and proteinuria \\[ 2 \\], while plasmapheresis or LDL removal therapy has also been reported to reduce proteinuria and proteinuria deposition, but the effect on long-term prognosis of patients is unknown.\n\n【50】In summary, the ApoE mutation in the two patients we reported was a familial aggregation phenomenon, and the mutation is a novel type, which we named ApoE Ganzhou (Arg25Cys). SIFT and PolyPhen were used to predict the effect of the mutation, and the predicted scores were 0.008 and 0.999, respectively, indicating that the mutation was harmful to the function of ApoE protein. Also, the location of the gene mutation is close to the most common mutation type of LPG, ApoE Kyoto (Arg25Cys), so we speculate that its pathogenic role might be the similar to that of ApoE Kyoto (Arg25Cys). From the medical history, the son (case 1) had earlier onset, presenting as nephrotic syndrome, poor response to hormone and immunosuppressive therapy, rapid disease progression (entering end-stage renal disease in 3 years), and concurrent renal replacement therapy. However, the onset time of the father (case 2) was late, and the disease was relatively mild. The father was followed up for 4 years, and the renal function is stable at present. Although the proband’s sister and daughter are currently asymptomatic, we cannot rule out that they carry the mutant gene because they have refused to undergo genetic testing. However, given the wide distribution in age of patients who have been diagnosed with LPG, we urge them to come to the hospital regularly for physical check-ups.\n\n【51】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【52】The datasets used and analyzed during the current case report are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【53】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【54】LPG:\n\n【55】Lipoprotein glomerulopathy\n\n【56】Apo E:\n\n【57】Apolipoprotein E\n\n【58】LRBS:\n\n【59】LDL-receptor binding site\n\n【60】HR:\n\n【61】Hinge site\n\n【62】ESRD:\n\n【63】End-stage renal disease\n\n【64】UP:\n\n【65】Urine protein\n\n【66】RFT:\n\n【67】Renal function test\n\n【68】Scr:\n\n【69】Serum creatinine\n\n【70】UA:\n\n【71】Uric acid\n\n【72】ALT:\n\n【73】Alanine transaminase\n\n【74】AST:\n\n【75】Aspartate transaminase\n\n【76】A:\n\n【77】Albumin\n\n【78】LFT:\n\n【79】Live function test\n\n【80】TC:\n\n【81】Total cholesterol\n\n【82】TG:\n\n【83】Triglyceride\n\n【84】HDL:\n\n【85】High-density lipoprotein\n\n【86】LDL:\n\n【87】Low-density lipoprotein\n\n【88】ApoB:\n\n【89】Apolipoprotein B\n\n【90】LP:\n\n【91】Lipid protein\n\n【92】ARB:\n\n【93】Angiotensin II receptor blocker", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b6864632-9c82-478f-b1c2-6a53f6fe14f2", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a chronic condition characterized by sporadic attacks of weakness associated with acute hypokalemia. Attacks are typically associated with specific triggers, such as prolonged rest following exercise or consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal. Most commonly, this condition is caused by an autosomal dominant calcium channel mutation, and patients typically have an established family medical history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Long-term complications include the development of progressive proximal myopathy. Oral potassium chloride may be considered for the treatment of an acute attack, with administration of acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide as long-term prophylaxis. Nephrologists can play an important role in the recognition and treatment of previously undiagnosed hypokalemic periodic paralysis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We summarize the case of a 19-year-old white man who presented to the emergency department with undiagnosed attacks of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and who reported, at follow-up, improvement in the severity and frequency of attacks with dichlorphenamide.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case demonstrates the crucial role nephrologists can play, not only in the diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, but also in the ongoing management of this condition. Patients should be advised to regularly follow up with their nephrology team for evaluation due to the risk of developing myopathy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Periodic paralyses are a rare group of disorders characterized by sudden and sporadic episodes of flaccid paralysis \\[ 1 \\]. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the most commonly occurring subtype, has an estimated prevalence of 1:100,000 \\[ 1 \\]. Onset of hypokalemic periodic paralysis typically occurs between 5 and 35 years of age, with most attacks occurring between 15 and 35 years of age \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The frequency of attacks typically decreases after 40 years of age \\[ 3 \\]. Attacks involve episodes of muscle weakness, often localized proximally, in the lower limbs, which occur sporadically with a duration ranging from hours to several days \\[ 2 , 4 \\]. Attacks typically occur in the early morning or in the middle of the night \\[ 3 \\]. Common triggers include rest after prolonged exercise and carbohydrate-rich meals \\[ 3 \\]. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant inherited genetic disorder \\[ 1 \\]. Indeed, two of three missense mutations of the gene coding the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle L-type calcium channel ( _CACN1AS_ ) are associated with ~70% of cases of hypokalemic periodic paralysis; a point mutation in the skeletal muscle sodium channel ( _SCN4A_ ) gene accounts for 10–20% of cases \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Patients with severe hypokalemia may experience respiratory failure due to paralysis, which can be fatal \\[ 5 \\]. Most patients eventually develop progressive proximal myopathy, most severely in the proximal limbs and pelvic girdle \\[ 2 , 6 \\]. However, development of myopathy is not associated with the number or severity of weakness episodes during the lifetime of a patient \\[ 2 \\]. Given the impact of hypokalemic periodic paralysis attacks on patients, proper diagnosis and management of this condition is paramount \\[ 4 \\]. We present a case report to highlight the important role of nephrologists in the recognition and treatment of previously undiagnosed hypokalemic periodic paralysis.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 19-year-old white man presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of weakness, nausea, and vomiting that began 2 days prior (Fig. 1 ). The patient had a personal medical history of chronic hypokalemia and his father had been diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis; there was no other family history of renal or neurologic disease. Similar episodes had occurred since the onset of puberty at age 11 years. These episodes are presumed to be associated with exposure to cold weather, intense physical activity, or rest for prolonged periods, with the long-term history of hypokalemia. The patient reported occasional marijuana use and was previously counseled about the possibility of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome causing symptoms. He denied illicit drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. Laboratory testing was conducted in the ED, with the only markedly abnormal result being a serum potassium level of 2.2 mmol/L, indicating hypokalemia. This electrolyte imbalance resulted in a nephrology consult. Serum magnesium, chloride, and glucose levels were elevated (1.7 mg/dL, 111 mmol/L, and 104 mg/dL, respectively). Cannabinoid testing was positive. Serum blood urea nitrogen (10 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (0.98 mg/dL) were normal. Physical examination was notable only for generalized muscle weakness.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Timeline of patient visits. _bid_ twice daily, _BUN_ blood urea nitrogen, _ED_ emergency department, _IV_ intravenous, _pt_ patient\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】The patient was previously prescribed oral potassium chloride 20 mEq/15 mL daily during acute attacks, which improved weakness within ~1–2 hours. The patient reported previous hospitalizations for intravenous potassium chloride administration for attacks of weakness due to severe nausea, which prevented oral potassium chloride ingestion, as was the case during this current visit. The frequency of hypokalemic attacks and hospitalizations related to these attacks have increased with the patient’s age. The patient reported numerous hypokalemic attacks, with ten resulting in ED visits in the previous year. The patient presented with a potassium level of 1.8 mmol/L at one of these visits.\n\n【17】For the current attack, the patient’s condition improved with potassium repletion (100 mEq) and several liters of intravenous fluid over several days during hospitalization. His condition improved in 2 days, and he was advised to follow a high-potassium diet. During follow-up in the nephrology outpatient clinic, the patient presented with a low potassium level (Fig 1 ). Since hospital discharge, he began taking dichlorphenamide tablets, which he received from his father, 50 mg once daily at bedtime for 2–3 weeks. He noted less frequent and severe symptoms. Although he reported improvement with dichlorphenamide, his insurance required an initial trial of acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily, which he received at discharge. At this time, the patient noted that his father had previously received acetazolamide but experienced no symptom improvement, warranting a switch to dichlorphenamide. A few weeks later, the patient stated that his condition was not well controlled with acetazolamide, and he was prescribed dichlorphenamide 50 mg daily, which improved the intensity and frequency of weakness. In his most recent nephrology follow-up, the patient reported continued symptom improvement. At follow-up, his serum potassium level was 3.2 mmol/L. Genetic testing is pending.\n\n【18】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【19】This case report underscores the important role nephrologists can play in the recognition and chronic management of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Although this patient did not have abnormal kidney function or renal disease, nephrologists consulted for acute electrolyte management made the connection between the patient and family medical histories to establish the diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Given the association of hypokalemic periodic paralysis with potassium imbalance and acute attacks of weakness, this is a condition that nephrologists may encounter in clinical practice.\n\n【20】Differential diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis includes syndromes that cause acutely low potassium levels, including type I or type II renal tubular acidosis. Type I renal tubular acidosis is a distal tubular disorder marked by hydrogen ion secretion impairment, which can be caused by genetic defects, autoimmune conditions, or medications (e.g., lithium, amphotericin B) \\[ 7 \\]. However, type I renal tubular acidosis can be distinguished from hypokalemic periodic paralysis by alkaline urine, despite a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【21】Type II renal tubular acidosis is a proximal tubular disorder characterized by impaired bicarbonate resorption \\[ 8 \\]. Similar to type I renal tubular acidosis, patients experience normal anion gap metabolic acidosis; however, patients with this disorder can acidify urine \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Patient medical history can be considered when distinguishing type II renal tubular acidosis from hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Type II renal tubular acidosis is associated with conditions that include cystinosis, Lowe’s syndrome, and Wilson’s disease, and with the use of some medications (i.e., cisplatin, topiramate, valproate) \\[ 9 \\]. In contrast, hypokalemic periodic paralysis is associated with specific triggers and a strong family medical history \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【22】Other differential diagnoses that need to be considered include other conditions characterized by muscle weakness (e.g., myasthenia gravis) \\[ 10 \\]. However, unlike the episodic muscle weakness associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the weakness associated with myasthenia gravis tends to be predictable in that it is typically preceded by exertion and, unlike hypokalemic periodic paralysis, involvement of extraocular and bulbar muscles is common \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Other myopathies that can be considered include botulism, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and tick bite-related paralysis \\[ 10 \\]. These myopathies can be differentiated from hypokalemic periodic paralysis by obtaining a thorough patient history (e.g., travel, known insect bite, sensory changes). It is also important to rule out hyperthyroidism, a potential cause of acquired hypokalemic periodic paralysis.\\[ 10 \\]. In contrast to patients with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis, patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis experience acute attacks during a hyperthyroid state, and symptoms discontinue once the hyperthyroidism is adequately treated.\n\n【23】Hypokalemic periodic paralysis should be considered in patients with a medical history of chronic hypokalemia or intermittent episodes of acute weakness associated with a trigger(s) \\[ 2 \\]. Nephrologists should query patients regarding family medical history and previous hospitalizations for similar symptoms. Previous use of potassium chloride or patient familiarity with acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide may be indicative of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Nephrologists who manage patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis should recommend genetic counseling and ensure patients understand the heritability of the disease. Because most cases are attributed to an autosomal dominant mutation, patients of child-bearing age or those with children need to understand the increased likelihood of their offspring having the same condition. A review of the early-stage symptoms that may present is important to include in patient education and ongoing discourse with families. Additionally, nephrologists should emphasize the importance of routine follow-up visits for ongoing evaluation and disease management.\n\n【24】When patients present with muscle weakness, hypokalemia, and a family medical history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, further diagnostic testing is not required. Genetic testing may not always be definitive due to potentially unidentified genetic mutations that cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Electromyography could demonstrate reduced compound muscle action potential during acute attacks or during an exercise test in which the electrical activity of the muscle is recorded \\[ 2 , 10 \\]. A decrease of ≥40% in compound muscle action potential amplitude from its maximum value during or after exercise is considered indicative of hypokalemic periodic paralysis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【25】Treatment of acute attacks of hypokalemic periodic paralysis includes oral potassium chloride 1 mEq/kg body weight per day, with the potential for an additional 0.2–0.4 mEq/kg body weight if patients do not experience improvement within 30 minutes (maximum, 200–250 mEq/day) \\[ 2 \\]. For patients who cannot swallow oral tablets, intravenous potassium chloride may be administered \\[dosing not to exceed 40 mEq/L (maximum, 20 mEq/h and 200 mEq/d)\\] \\[ 2 \\]. Because of the range of change in potassium levels that can occur during an acute attack of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, it is important to routinely monitor for electrocardiogram changes (e.g., ST-segment depression, U waves, and T-wave inversion and flattening) that are associated with hypokalemia.\\[ 12 \\]\n\n【26】Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can be used as prophylactic therapy, is effective in approximately half of patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis \\[ 2 , 13 \\]. It is hypothesized that the systemic acidosis created by facilitating sodium bicarbonate excretion can reduce susceptibility to attacks, although the mechanism is unclear \\[ 2 \\]. Twice-daily dichlorphenamide, another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, significantly decreased the median number of attacks, severity-weighted attack rate, and duration of attacks compared with placebo in a 9-week randomized, controlled study ( _p_ \\= 0.02, all comparisons) \\[ 14 \\]. Dichlorphenamide significantly improved several aspects of patient quality of life compared with placebo \\[ 14 \\]. Furthermore, efficacy was maintained with long-term (up to 1 year) open-label dichlorphenamide treatment \\[ 14 \\]. Nephrolithiasis is a common adverse effect associated with acetazolamide and, rarely, with dichlorphenamide, and may warrant further management by nephrologists \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【27】In conclusion, nephrologists play a key role in the diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a condition that is associated with multiple hospitalizations before patients receive appropriate treatment. Educating patients on the importance of genetic counseling and testing is critical. Furthermore, due to the risk of developing myopathy, it is critical that patients regularly follow up with their nephrology team for evaluation.\n\n【28】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】Not applicable.\n\n【30】Code availability\n-----------------\n\n【31】Not applicable.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】bid:\n\n【34】Twice daily\n\n【35】BUN:\n\n【36】Blood urea nitrogen\n\n【37】ED:\n\n【38】Emergency department\n\n【39】IV:\n\n【40】Intravenous\n\n【41】pt:\n\n【42】Patient", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Further research is needed to establish causality and management.\n\n【7】### Trial registration\n\n【8】Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02582021 .\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cardiovascular disease remains the number one cause of death in the USA \\[ 1 \\]. Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is common in women with evidence of ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) \\[ 2 \\]. Previous studies have shown that these women have a higher risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in comparison to asymptomatic healthy women and are more likely to be readmitted for angina or for acute coronary syndrome within 180 days of having normal coronary angiography \\[ 3 \\]. These women also experience unexpectedly higher rates of heart failure hospitalizations \\[ 3 \\]. Remarkably, a previous report from the Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study revealed that in women with signs and symptoms of INOCA hospitalized for heart failure, 90% had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Although the prevalence of CMD in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is currently unknown, exercise studies have indicated that vascular stiffness, impaired exercise vasodilation, and impaired diastolic reserve may be related to endothelial and microvascular dysfunction \\[ 4 \\]. This has led to the hypothesis that CMD may contribute to the development of HFpEF \\[ 5 \\]. The following case highlights some of the first empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis.\n\n【12】This case demonstrates that progression to HFpEF may occur parallel with common pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors of CMD. To date, there has been indirect and limited clinical evidence of CMD as a novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HFpEF. This case underscores the importance of investigating the link between these two conditions. Understanding the correlates associating CMD in HFpEF could provide additional insight into the mechanisms of HFpEF, improve health outcomes for patients with CMD, and help in the design and development of future preventative pharmacotherapies.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Initial presentation\n\n【15】A 55-year-old, Caucasian woman was referred to our tertiary women’s heart center for persistent chest pain, palpitations, and dyspnea. Her medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic anxiety, and bilateral non-obstructive carotid atherosclerosis. She had no prior history of diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, alcohol or substance abuse, or adverse pregnancy outcomes. Her family history was significant for premature coronary artery disease. Her father had a history of hypertension and had a myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 39. Her brother had a history of coronary artery disease and also had a MI at the age of 40. Her occupational history indicated that she had been working in the field of psychology and was still an employee in the same job at the time of the hospital visit and follow-up care.\n\n【16】Table 1 summarizes the general symptoms and characteristic signs of our patient for the onset of CMD and her progression to HFpEF. She had undergone an exercise treadmill test which revealed ischemic ECG changes and dyspnea. Her initial echocardiogram demonstrated a LVEF of 67%, mild diastolic dysfunction, mild left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, no significant valvular heart disease, and no pulmonary hypertension. Subsequent invasive left heart catheterization was performed and it showed normal epicardial coronary arteries without angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic plaque. She continued to have exertional symptoms and angina-like chest pain and was subsequently referred to our center for further evaluation of suspected INOCA. During her evaluation and treatment she continued to experience stable angina and exertional dyspnea despite initial management with atorvastatin 20 mg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. She had a poor clinical response to sublingual nitroglycerin. Due to her persistent symptoms and abnormal stress testing, she was referred for coronary reactivity testing (CRT) to establish the diagnosis of CMD.\n\n【17】**Table 1 Timeline of coronary microvascular disease onset, progression to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and therapy**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】### Diagnosis of CMD\n\n【20】Our patient underwent invasive CRT, as previously published \\[ 6 \\]. Testing demonstrated normal coronary flow reserve (CFR) in response to intra-coronary adenosine (CFR 3.1; normal ≥ 2.5), abnormal macrovascular endothelial function to intra-coronary acetylcholine (− 6% change in coronary diameter, constriction; normal, dilation), abnormal microvascular endothelial function (coronary blood flow change 48%; normal ≥ 50%), and abnormal non-endothelial function to intra-coronary nitroglycerin (coronary diameter change + 0%; normal dilation) (Table 2 ). She also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) with perfusion imaging at rest and with adenosine stress (140 μg/kg per minute) which showed circumferential subendocardial perfusion defect at stress, normal LV end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area (EDVi) of 56.4 mL/m <sup>2 </sup> , LV mass index 42.3 grams/m <sup>2 </sup> , and no LV hypertrophy (septum 7.2 mm and lateral wall 6.0 mm). The myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) was 1.8 which was considered borderline abnormal \\[ 7 \\] (Table 3 ). There was no evidence of myocardial scar.\n\n【21】**Table 2 Results of coronary reactivity testing**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】**Table 3 Changes in left ventricular morphology**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】The diagnosis of CMD was established by the coronary endothelial dysfunction observed with invasive CRT, and carvedilol and eplerenone 25 mg daily were added to her regimen. She was followed regularly in clinic with good control of her blood pressure and serum lipid levels. She reported improvement of her angina and dyspnea along with reduction in the duration and frequency of these episodes.\n\n【26】### Diagnosis of heart failure\n\n【27】Ten years after her initial diagnosis of CMD, our patient was hospitalized due to symptoms of dyspnea. She was found to have elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels of 406 pg/mL and normal LVEF. She had a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of her chest to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, which was negative but revealed bilateral pulmonary edema. She was treated with intravenously administered furosemide for pulmonary edema and diagnosed as having HFpEF. Subsequently, she was discharged with instructions to increase her eplerenone.\n\n【28】She continued to experience worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated normal LV systolic function with an LVEF of 64%, and diastolic dysfunction as evidenced by decreased lateral E′ velocity (4.2 cm/s, indicating impaired myocardial relaxation) and elevated E/E′ ratio 12.9 (suggestive of increased LV filling pressure). She underwent coronary CT angiography which showed absence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque and a coronary calcium score of 0. She was diagnosed as having HFpEF based on clinical symptoms, preserved ejection fraction of 64%, elevated BNP, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【29】As part of the WISE – Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (WISE-CVD) Continuation Study (NCT00832702), she underwent a repeat rest-stress CMRI to assess myocardial structure, function, perfusion, and scar, and <sup>13 </sup> C magnetic resonance (CMR) spectroscopy. Compared to her prior CMRI 7 years ago, she had an increase in LV wall thickness in both the septum and lateral wall (Table 3 ). On CMR spectroscopy, the myocardial triglyceride content was elevated (0.83%) compared to normal control women (mean 0.43%), suggesting myocardial steatosis which is consistent with an ischemia-induced metabolic shift and HFpEF phenotype \\[ 8 \\]. Adenosine stress first pass-perfusion CMRI again showed circumferential subendocardial hypoperfusion (Fig. 1 ) and her MPRI worsened from 1.8 to 1.1, consistent with severe CMD \\[ 7 \\]. There was no evidence of scar on late gadolinium enhancement imaging.\n\n【30】**Fig. 1**\n\n【31】Baseline ( **a, b** ) and 10-year follow-up ( **c, d** ) adenosine stress first-pass perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showing evidence of circumferential subendocardial hypoperfusion at stress, consistent with coronary microvascular dysfunction-related ischemia. Myocardial perfusion reserve index decreased from 1.8 to 1.1 over 10-year period, indicating worsened ischemia\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】This case documents, in a 55-year-old woman, the progression of CMD diagnosed with invasive CRT to HFpEF over a span of 10 years despite well-controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although we and others have previously hypothesized that CMD may contribute to progression to HFpEF \\[ 9 , 10 \\], we are not aware of case examples of CMD progressing to HFpEF reported in the literature. While existing cross-sectional registry studies cannot determine whether primary CMD leads to ventricular remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and HFpEF or whether these findings observed in HFpEF lead to secondary CMD \\[ 11 \\], the current case example provides evidence that CMD may contribute to the development of HFpEF.\n\n【35】HFpEF has often been referred to as “diastolic heart failure” and is characterized by impaired LV relaxation and elevated LV filling pressures \\[ 12 \\]. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging and currently accounts for approximately half of all cases of heart failure \\[ 12 \\], with morbidity and mortality rates similar to those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. Previous research has observed an increased incidence of CMD as evidenced by abnormal CFR and index of microvascular resistance (IMR) after adenosine administration in patients with HFpEF compared with normal reference control individuals \\[ 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【36】At present, there are insufficient prospective studies to confirm that CMD contributes to progression to HFpEF, nor putative mechanistic pathways. Previous studies have identified common inflammatory markers as contributing to the progression to heart failure \\[ 17 \\]. Systemic inflammation may lead to reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, expression of growth factor-β, activation of cardiac fibroblasts, and an increase in collagen type 1 formation \\[ 18 \\]. In addition, this process may lead to interstitial fibrosis contributing to high diastolic LV stiffness and eventual progression to HFpEF \\[ 18 \\]. There are currently no evidence-based treatments for CMD or HFpEF. Understanding the links and disease pathophysiology between CMD and HFpEF may lead to the development of preventive and treatment strategies \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【37】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【38】This case report of a patient with HFpEF and antecedent CMD is in line with our hypothesis that CMD may contribute to the development of HFpEF \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. In an individual patient, whether these are causally related, whether they are simply related to similar underlying risk factors, or whether they represent unrelated presences of two common disorders is the subject of current research. Further evaluation of the association between CMD and HFpEF will be necessary to prove our hypothesis.\n\n【39】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【40】BNP:\n\n【41】Brain natriuretic peptide\n\n【42】CFR:\n\n【43】Coronary flow reserve\n\n【44】CMD:\n\n【45】Coronary microvascular dysfunction\n\n【46】CMR :\n\n【47】<sup>13 </sup> C magnetic resonance\n\n【48】CMRI:\n\n【49】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【50】CRT:\n\n【51】Coronary reactivity testing\n\n【52】CT:\n\n【53】Computed tomography\n\n【54】HFpEF:\n\n【55】Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\n\n【56】IMR:\n\n【57】Index of microvascular resistance\n\n【58】INOCA:\n\n【59】Ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease\n\n【60】LV:\n\n【61】Left ventricular\n\n【62】LVEF:\n\n【63】Left ventricular ejection fraction\n\n【64】MI:\n\n【65】Myocardial infarction\n\n【66】MPRI:\n\n【67】Myocardial perfusion reserve index\n\n【68】WISE:\n\n【69】Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation\n\n【70】WISE-CVD:\n\n【71】Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation – Coronary Vascular Dysfunction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Altered consciousness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 encephalitis is a very threatening condition if not treated immediately.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 34-year-old Asian female who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection using a nasopharyngeal swab sample and presented with acute changes in consciousness without typical respiratory symptoms. Empiric therapy was immediately and simultaneously given with cerebrospinal fluid analysis using polymerase chain reaction, which later also showed positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】It is important to consider the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 encephalitis when a patient presents with acute altered consciousness and no typical respiratory symptoms. Early empiric therapy can improve patient outcomes.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】On June 2021, the second wave of increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection cases in Indonesia is emerging. The first case was confirmed in March 2020, and the rate of incidence has continued to increase. A significant increase in the number of patients is followed by various clinical manifestations, including neurological.\n\n【10】Many studies have already described the neuroinvasive potency of SARS-CoV-2, such as the study by Mao _et al_ . (2020), who reported some neurological manifestations, including acute cerebrovascular diseases in 5.7% of cases, reduced consciousness (encephalitis and encephalopathy) in 14.8% of cases, and muscle injuries in 19.3% of cases. The same study also found that these neurological symptoms were found in patients with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In a study conducted in Spain by Abildua _et al_ . (2020), 51 patients had encephalitis or encephalopathy. Lumbar punctures were performed in 31 patients, and only 1 patient had a confirmed case using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on cerebrospinal fluid samples \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【11】In Indonesia, there are many cases of suspected encephalitis in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasopharyngeal swab samples; however, when we started writing this report, there were no confirmed case reports using PCR on cerebrospinal fluid samples.\n\n【12】We hereby report a case of SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis that was confirmed using PCR assay on cerebrospinal fluid samples from a young female patient who came with acute behavioral changes without any typical respiratory symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 34-year-old Asian female first experienced flu-like symptoms of nasal congestion and a mild cough at the end of June 2021 (day 1) with history of close contact with a family member who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and lived in the same house. The patient then sought treatment and underwent a nasopharyngeal swab test, with a positive result. Afterward, she received treatment at the closest healthcare facility (day 3) and was treated with oseltamivir, azithromycin, steroids, vitamin C, and zinc for 5 days. The patient felt that her symptoms had resolved after she had taken her medication.\n\n【15】On day 14, the patient underwent another nasopharyngeal swab test, and the result was still positive; therefore, she returned for self-isolation. On day 17, the patient started experiencing pain throughout her body without any respiratory symptoms. On day 18, she had the same symptoms; mid-day, the patient could still communicate with her family about her symptoms, but then she did not remember any of the subsequent events. Based on the information provided by her family member, they found that within approximately 4 hours after the patient complained of pain throughout her body, she started to become verbally aggressive and had a fever of 39 °C. She also had urinary incontinence without any motor seizures. Any history of comorbidities, alcohol intake, or substance abuse was denied. The patient was then taken by her family to the Emergency Department of Pondok Indah – Bintaro Jaya Hospital.\n\n【16】When she was admitted to the Emergency Department, she did not have a fever (body temperature 36.5 °C), her pulse rate was 85 beats/min, her blood pressure was 136/65 mmHg, her respiratory rate was 19 breaths/minute, and her oxygen saturation on room air was 97%. The patient was in the obese category (BMI 43.8 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) with body weight of 115 kg and height of 162 cm. Her general status was within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed altered consciousness (GCS of E3M5V3) with a propensity for fluctuation and aggressive behavior. Cranial and motor nerve examination found no lateralization. It was difficult to evaluate meningeal irritation signs at this time.\n\n【17】Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis (17,900/UL), neutrophilia (84%), relative lymphopenia (10.1%), increased C-reactive protein level (25.75 mg/L), and increased D-dimer level (600 ng/mL). Evaluation of anti-HIV, HbSAg, and anti-HCV showed nonreactive results. RT–PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples showed positive results. Chest X-ray revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity of the left lung with suspected etiology of asymmetrical lung edema and a differential diagnosis of left pleural effusion and left lung pneumonia. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal image; i.e., no lesion or intracerebral or intracerebellar pathological enhancement was found.\n\n【18】Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid sample obtained from lumbar puncture revealed that the cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless. Pleocytosis was found (leukocyte count 157/µL) with 99% mononuclear and 1% polymorphonuclear cells, with increased protein levels (108 mg/dL), while the glucose level was within the normal limit (glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid 63 mg/dL, serum glucose level 104 mg/dL). Gram and Ziehl Neelsen staining revealed no bacteria or acid-fast bacilli (AFB). PCR examination for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) showed negative results, while RT–PCR for SARS-CoV-2 revealed positive results.\n\n【19】The patient was admitted to the SARS-CoV-2 isolation unit. Primary care was started in the Emergency Department, including nasogastric tube and Foley catheter insertion and nasal cannula as well as intravenous fluid supplementation. The patient received empiric treatment based on her clinical manifestation using 750 mg acyclovir three times daily, as her prior PCR result on cerebrospinal fluid samples showed viral encephalitis. The treatment was also continued using intravenous remdesivir at a dosage of 200 mg once daily on the first day, which was continued at 100 mg once daily from the second to fifth day. The patient also received 40 mg methylprednisolone twice daily and 0.4 cc enoxaparine sodium.\n\n【20】After 2 days of treatment, the patient regained consciousness with GCS of E4M6V5 and no aggressive behavior. Neurological examination on the third day of treatment revealed that all test results were within normal limits. Treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and acyclovir treatment were continued. Positive SARS-CoV results in the cerebrospinal fluid sample were obtained on the 8th day. On the 10th day, RT–PCR of SARS-COV-2 was performed again on samples from both the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The results were negative. The patient was then discharged with a condition of full recovery and continued her treatment at the outpatient clinic.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain parenchyma characterized by neurological symptoms with acute onset. SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Its incidence is relatively low (1%) but increases significantly up to 6.7% in patients with severe manifestations. Some risk factors for developing SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis are advanced age and presence of comorbidities \\[ 4 \\]. According to Siow _et al_ ., approximately 71.7% of patients had at least one type of comorbidity, the most common being hypertension (45.5%), hyperlipidemia (24.0%), and diabetes mellitus (16.0%). In this case, the patient was still young at 34 years old, but she had a comorbidity of obesity \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【23】The main suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis in this case was based on acute behavioral alterations with history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the initial result of cerebrospinal fluid analysis (pleocytosis found with mononuclear cell domination, increased protein level, glucose level within normal limits, and no bacteria or AFB), and the possibility of encephalitis caused by other viruses was considered. In this case, the normal result of contrast-enhanced brain MRI could not exclude the diagnosis of encephalitis. The symptoms presented in this case were consistent with those described in the systematic review and metaanalysis by Siow _et al_ ., which demonstrated that the common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis were reduced consciousness (77.1%), altered mental status (72.3%), seizure (38.2%), headache (27.3%), and weakness (15.4%). Moreover, Siow _et al_ . found that encephalitis usually occurs on day 14.5 (day 10.8–18.2) after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. In this patient, encephalitis occurred on the 18th day.\n\n【24】The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the central nervous system is still not fully understood. Scoppettuolo _et al_ . divided the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis into two categories, i.e., direct and indirect neuroinvasion. Direct neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 can occur through two pathways, i.e., the transneuronal retrograde pathway (such as through olfactory cells) and the hematogenous pathway with transcytosis through direct infection of blood–brain barrier endothelial cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors. The indirect mechanism is correlated with the activation of the immune system or postinfectious neurological syndrome (PINS). In this case, RT–PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on cerebrospinal fluid sample showed positive results, and abnormal results of the cerebrospinal analysis support the presence of blood–brain barrier dysfunction; therefore, the probable underlying pathogenesis is hematogenous direct invasion by SARS-CoV-2 \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【25】Several case reports of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis using PCR on cerebrospinal fluid samples have been reported previously. A case report by Moriguchi _et al_ . from Japan in February 2020 described a patient with reduced consciousness and seizures with positive findings of SARS-CoV-2 for the cerebrospinal fluid sample, but negative findings for nasopharyngeal swab samples \\[ 7 \\]. Another case report, similar to this case report, was presented by Kamal _et al_ . from the UAE in May 2020. They reported a patient with sudden behavioral changes with positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and cerebrospinal fluid samples \\[ 8 \\]. Note that, in both case reports, as well as in our case illustration, respiratory symptoms, which are the typical of COVID-19, were peculiarly nondominant compared with neurological symptoms. In these three case reports, the patient received treatment for their emergency situation with treatment focused on suspected viral encephalitis without excluding the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis since the beginning of their illnesses, and all three case reports showed good outcomes.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation, it is important to consider the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis as well as encephalitis caused by other viruses when a patient presents with sudden behavioral changes but has no typical respiratory symptoms. Obtaining cerebrospinal fluid samples and administering empiric therapy early for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis are key measures for establishing a diagnosis and providing optimal therapy, which can improve patient outcomes.\n\n【28】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【29】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The present work is an investigation of immunosenescence parameters, such as quantity of naive and CD28 <sup>- </sup> T cells, T cell receptor excision circles, relative telomere length and alterations of peripheral T cell replication, and was performed via comparison of a case of acute exacerbation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis against six patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis with disease remission and six age-matched healthy donors over a follow-up course of 12 months.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Phenotypical T cell characterization and intracellular interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 2 production were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seven patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and six healthy control donors, with findings determined by flow cytometry. T cell receptor excision circles and relative telomere length quantification were performed on deoxyribonucleic acid isolated from naive (CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> ) T cells and investigated via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Ki67 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry on naive T cells. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test for two independent groups of variables were used to compare healthy donors with patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. During follow-up, patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis showed lower total counts of naive and CD28-expressing T cells compared to healthy donors. Acute exacerbation led to low naive and CD28 <sup>+ </sup> T cell populations and elevated proportions of Ki67-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> naive T cells. In conditions of exacerbation, T cell receptor excision circle numbers were in the lower range in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and increased after follow-up. Healthy donors showed significantly higher relative telomere lengths compared to patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This investigation illustrates that the changes in T cell homeostasis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis may be the result of several mechanisms, such as diminished thymus function and peripheral exertions to maintain the peripheral T cell pool. The results also demonstrate that hallmarks of immunosenescence such as decreased naive T cell levels and lower T cell receptor excision circle numbers can only be interpreted together with replication markers such as relative telomere length or Ki67 expression.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Common to all seven subtypes of JIA, disease onset is prior to the age of 16 years and is characterized by a chronicity of at least six weeks. For adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it has been suggested that T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Patients with RA present with immune system abnormalities that resemble the typical characteristics of immune dysfunction described in older patients \\[ 1 \\]. Immunological investigations of patients with RA have revealed disturbed T cell homeostasis and diminished thymus output, which was characterized by decreased amounts of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and compensatory peripheral T cell proliferation with telomere shortening \\[ 2 \\] and loss of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28, a typical sign of replicatively stressed cells \\[ 3 \\]. Patients with JIA demonstrate premature immunosenescence of the CD4 <sup>+ </sup> naive T cell pool with age-inappropriate low TREC numbers, shortened telomere lengths and increased peripheral replication of peripheral naive T cells \\[ 4 \\]. TRECs are stable deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) episomes forming during T cell receptor rearrangement. TRECs are not replicated during mitosis and are diluted out during cell divisions. Therefore, TREC counts in naive T cells are not only recognized as a marker for recent thymic emigrants (RTE), but are also influenced by peripheral replication of naive T cells \\[ 5 \\]. Telomeres are TTAGGG-rich repeats located at the ends of chromosomes and play an important role in DNA replication and preservation of chromosome integrity. Telomere erosion has been considered a mitotic clock, with the telomere length approximately reflecting the life history of divisions of individual cells \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【10】The influence of clinical disease activity on these parameters is still unclear in JIA. The present investigation of immunosenescence parameters was performed via comparison of a case of acute exacerbation of JIA against six patients with JIA with disease remission and six age-matched healthy donors (HD) over a follow-up course of 12 months.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Materials and methods\n\n【13】#### Study population\n\n【14】Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from seven patients with JIA (all girls), specifically with extended oligoarticular JIA. All patients were tested and found to be rheumatoid factor (RF) negative and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive, and fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification for JIA \\[ 7 \\]. PMBCs were also obtained from six age-matched and sex-matched healthy donors (HD) (Table 1 ). All donors were recruited at the Department of Pediatrics, Medical University Innsbruck.\n\n【15】**Table 1 **Matching of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) group (patients 1 to 6), our patient with JIA with acute exacerbation (patient 7), and healthy donors (patients 8 to 13)****\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】One of the patients with JIA was a 16-year-old girl (patient 7 in Table 1 ), with extended oligoarticular JIA (ANA positive test result, 1:320; RF negative test result) with disease onset at three years of age. Our patient presented with acute disease exacerbation at the time of evaluation. She was classified as in clinical remission off medication for over 12 months, as according to published criteria for disease remission \\[ 8 \\]. Disease exacerbation at the time of evaluation was verified by clinical examination (extended oligoarthritis with painful joints of the upper and lower extremities) and increased laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein level \\[CRP\\] 5.14mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate \\[ESR\\] 99mm/first hour, 152mm/second hour; ANA 1:640). After acute exacerbation, our patient was treated with indometacin (2mg/kg/day) and prednisolone (1mg/kg/day) for four weeks. Methotrexate was administered (10mg/m <sup>2 </sup> body surface/week) orally. Over a six-month period, our patient showed disease remission on methotrexate and prednisolone (<0.1mg/kg/day) treatment (that is, remission on medication) \\[ 8 \\]. A 12-month follow-up sample was taken under conditions of disease remission off medication for at least five months.\n\n【18】Patients 1 to 6 (see Table 1 ) were in clinical remission off medication for at least 12 months \\[ 8 \\]. The criteria for disease remission included the following: no active arthritis, no fever, no rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA, no active uveitis, normal ESR or CRP level, and a physician global assessment of disease activity indicating clinical disease quiescence. After 12 months of follow-up, patients 1 to 6 were still in remission off medication \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【19】Controls were healthy according to World Health Organization (WHO) definition. None of the HD had a personal or family history of inflammatory disease or received medications. Unfortunately, HD blood samples were not collected after 12 months because donors refused to have samples taken. However, significant changes to the investigated immunosenescence parameters were not expected in healthy young individuals during this period of time. Therefore, recruitment of the original HD group did not appear to be mandatory to fulfill the scope of the study and the missing follow-up data for HD were neglected. The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki (2000) and approved by the local ethics committee (Medical University Innsbruck). All patients with JIA and HD gave their written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\n【20】#### Separation of T cell subsets\n\n【21】PBMCs were isolated by using LymphoPrep™ (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> (naive) T cells were separated by positive selection using CD4, CD45RA, CD28 antibodies labeled with magnetic beads and an autoMACS™ with sterile columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Teterow, Germany). The purity of separated CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells was checked using four-color flow cytometry (FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer; Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and ranged from 97 percent to 99 percent.\n\n【22】#### Quantification of T cell subsets\n\n【23】PBMCs were incubated with monoclonal mouse antibodies (mAbs) specific for CD3, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD4, CD8, CD28, CD25, CD45RA, CD45RO, and CD62L labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex (PerCP) or allophycocyanin (APC) (all antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen™, San Jose, CA, USA) for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, red blood cell lysis was performed with FACS™ Lysing Solution (BD Pharmingen™, San Jose, CA, USA). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2 percent paraformaldehyde. All analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer utilizing CellQuest™ software (DB Pharmingen™, San Jose, CA, USA). According to phenotypic CD markers, CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> and CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> CD62L <sup>+ </sup> T cells were characterized as naive, CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> as memory T cells and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD25 <sup>+ </sup> CD62L <sup>+ </sup> as regulatory T cells.\n\n【24】#### Quantification of TREC numbers\n\n【25】TREC numbers within CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells were assessed. DNA was extracted from separated CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells using QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA). Signal-joint TREC concentrations were determined by quantitative SYBR® Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the coding TREC sequence using an iCycler iQ™ Real-Time Quantitative PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Canada). We designed primers to amplify a DNA fragment of 82bp across the remaining recombination sequence δrec/ψalpha (5’-CACATCCCTTTCAACCATGCT-3’ and 5’-GCCAGCTGCAGGGTTTAGG-3’). For quantification we used the internal standard as previously described \\[ 9 \\]. To avoid bias by different numbers of naive T cells, TRECs were calculated in relation to CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cell numbers.\n\n【26】#### Telomere length analysis\n\n【27】Determination of relative telomere length (RTL) was performed in separated CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells by calculating the ratio of a quantitative PCR reaction product from the same sample using specific primers for telomeres and a single copy gene. Quantitative PCR is the method of choice for determining telomere lengths in small extractable quantities of DNA, as was the case in our study.\n\n【28】#### Ki67 staining\n\n【29】Naive T cells in the cell cycle were identified by expression of the Ki67 nuclear antigen. Determination of Ki67 expression on CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells was performed by cytospin preparation (Shandon Cytospin® 4, Waltham, MA, USA) of 5×10 <sup>3 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells and permeabilized with TRITON™ X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in a fully automated NexES® IHC system (Ventana Medical Systems, AZ, USA). For microscopic orientation counterstaining was performed with Hematoxylin Counterstain and Bluing Reagent (Ventana Medical Systems, AZ, USA). Stained sections were examined by two independent investigators (MP and AB) by light microscopy (Eclipse 800, Nikon, Japan). Percentages of Ki67 <sup>+ </sup> cells were calculated per total CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cell counts on each cytospin preparation.\n\n【30】#### Intracellular cytokine production\n\n【31】For intracellular staining, cells were stimulated with 25ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1μg/mL ionomycin in the presence of 10μg/mL brefeldin A for four hours (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). After cell surface staining for CD4, CD8 and CD45RA with subsequent fixation and permeabilization, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-interferon (IFN)γ, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, and anti-interleukin (IL)-2, antibodies or control immunoglobulin (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). For intracellular cytokine staining, additional markers for naive T cells, such as CD28, could not be implemented because of technical limitations. Final fixation was achieved using 1 percent cell fix (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were analyzed using WinMDI software (V. 2.8, Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA).\n\n【32】#### Statistical analysis\n\n【33】The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for two independent groups of variables was used to compare HD with patients with JIA (SPSS V.15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The non-parametric Wilcoxon test for pair differences was used for two dependent groups of variables (JIA and JIA follow-up). A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\n【34】### Results\n\n【35】#### Lower naive T cell counts in patients with JIA\n\n【36】CD45 isoforms and CD28 surface marker expression were used to define naive and memory T cells in peripheral CD4 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> subsets in our patient with acute exacerbation, patients with JIA in remission at the beginning and over a 12-month follow-up study and age-matched HD (Tables 1 and 2 ). Lack of CD28 expression on both CD4 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells has been associated as a biological indicator of aging of the immune system upon continuous antigen stimulation and subclinical inflammation \\[ 10 \\] and was therefore included in the study. There was a significantly lower number of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells (P=0.02) and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells (P=0.04) (Table 2 ) in the follow-up evaluation of patients with JIA compared with HD (Figure 1 A, Table 2 ). Patients with JIA showed significantly lower numbers of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28-expressing cells as compared with HD (P=0.01), and the difference was more pronounced after 12 months (P=0.004) (Figure 1 B). The same effect was also observed in CD8 <sup>+ </sup> CD28-expressing cells (P=0.02) (Table 2 ). In the acute exacerbation stage in our patient (patient 7), this effect was more dramatic. Our patient showed low numbers of CD45RA-expressing and CD28-expressing T cells at the beginning and at follow-up (Figure 1 A,B), and also showed lower percentages of CD28 <sup>+ </sup> T cells within the CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cell pool at acute exacerbation (27.8 percent) and at follow-up (33.3 percent) compared to patients with JIA (mean 95.7 percent; at follow-up 96.6 percent) and HD (96.9 percent).\n\n【37】**Figure 1**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】**Lower naive T cell counts in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).** Lower CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> ( **A** ) and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> T cell counts ( **B** ) in patients with JIA are shown.

Therefore, TREC numbers should be interpreted in correlation with replicative markers, such as telomere length or Ki67 expression. Proliferative status, relative telomere length (RTL), and TRECs were assessed in peripheral blood samples from our patient with acute exacerbation, patients with JIA, and HD.\n\n【45】An increased proportion of Ki67-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> naive T cells (1.68 percent) and a relatively low proportion of replicating cells after remission (0.15 percent) was determined in our patient with acute exacerbation (Figure 2 A). In contrast, in patients with JIA (patients 1 to 6 in Table 1 ), the proportion of replicating cells (Ki67 <sup>+ </sup> ) increased after 12 months (0.43±0.40 percent to 0.66±0.41 percent after follow-up) (Figure 2 A). Relative low Ki67 expression (0.23±0.19 percent; not significant) was detected in HD (Figure 2 A).\n\n【46】**Figure 2**\n\n【47】 \n\n【48】**Proliferative measures in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients.** Ki67-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells ( **A** ), T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) ( **B** ), and relative telomere length (RTL) ( **C** ).

A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\n【49】Full size image\n\n【50】With regard to TREC numbers, no changes were observed in patients with JIA in remission at first evaluation (1649±586 per 10 <sup>4 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells) or after 12 months (1424±384 per 10 <sup>4 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells) (Figure 2 B), while TREC number dramatically increased in our patient with acute exacerbation after 12 months (exacerbation: 737 per 10 <sup>4 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells; follow-up: 3749 per 10 <sup>4 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells) (Figure 2 B). Slightly higher TREC numbers were detected in naive T cells (3685±2264 per 10 <sup>4 </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells) in HD (Figure 2 B). Moreover, our patient (patient 7 in Table 1 ) during exacerbation and after 12 months showed lower RTL (during exacerbation: 0.67; follow-up: 0.37) compared to patients with JIA (patients 1 to 6 in Table 1 ) in remission (0.90±0.12; JIA follow-up: 0.69±0.38) (Figure 2 C). Significantly higher RTL were determined in HD (2.45±1.27; P=0.04) (Figure 2 C).\n\n【51】#### Disturbed cytokine production in our patient with acute exacerbation of JIA\n\n【52】TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-2 production was determined in CD45RA-expressing and CD45RO-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> and CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells at acute exacerbation of our patient by intracellular cytokine analysis. No significant differences were determined in the cytokine production in the four T cell subpopulations in patients with JIA or HD (Table 3 ). However, a higher proportion of IL-2 producing CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> and CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> T cells were detected in patients with JIA compared with the HD group (Table 3 ). Remarkable increased proportions of TNFα, IFNγ and IL-2 producing CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> T cells were determined in our patient with acute exacerbation (Table 3 ).\n\n【53】**Table 3 **Intracellular cytokine production during acute exacerbation****\n\n【54】Full size table\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】Our patient’s case gives an impression of disturbed peripheral CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cell homeostasis under the condition of acute disease exacerbation and underlines the importance of considering disease activity when evaluating immunological aging markers. Although limited by a small number of patients with JIA, the present study corroborates the fact that markers of immunosenescence such as decreased naive T cells and lower TREC numbers can only be interpreted correctly together with replication markers such as telomere length or Ki67 expression. Intracellular cytokines may be supportive parameters but are shown to be too variable to act as reliable markers to study clinical aspects of disease activity.\n\n【57】Loss of CD28 expression has been suggested as a marker of replicative senescence for T cells \\[ 10 \\]. A clonal expansion of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>- </sup> T cells was found in older people \\[ 10 \\] and individuals with RA \\[ 3 \\]. The data from the follow-up cohort confirm the findings of an accelerated decrease of naive T cells in patients with JIA with advancing chronological age \\[ 4 \\], which was also demonstrated for patients with RA \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. However, this comparison is limited as we were not able to provide follow-up data of the HD group. Although acute exacerbation did not change the total counts of CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD28 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> or total CD28-expressing T cells, percentages of CD28-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were significantly decreased in our patient with acute exacerbation, whereas percentages of CD28-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were different between JIA follow-up and HD.\n\n【58】TRECs were evaluated to estimate thymic output and peripheral T cell turnover under the condition of acute disease exacerbation. TREC numbers were lower in patients with JIA compared to HD and unaltered by follow-up in the JIA group. These results corroborate the findings that patients with JIA show age-inappropriate lower TREC numbers but with no correlation with chronological age \\[ 4 \\]. Our patient with acute exacerbation showed relatively low TREC numbers during the acute exacerbation period compared to patients with JIA with disease remission. In our patient with acute exacerbation, enhanced TREC numbers and even higher TREC numbers than the other patients with JIA were found after disease remission, suggesting recovery of thymus function after successful treatment. This is in accordance with findings in children and younger adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) under highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) \\[ 11 \\] in whom recovery to higher levels than before HAART was found. The study suggested that ongoing production of naive CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells in the thymus is most active during the earlier stages of HAART and declines later during HAART. However the precise timing of when children show maximum thymic output during HAART remains unclear. An increase in the fraction of TREC <sup>+ </sup> T cells per naive T cell, which was equivalent to a faster growth of TREC <sup>+ </sup> T cells versus total naive T cells was also found for CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells following initiation of HAART \\[ 12 \\]. When discussing the TREC dynamics in our patient with acute exacerbation, we cannot sufficiently answer the question as to whether our patient already had low TREC numbers before exacerbation, as found in children with AIDS before initiation of HAART.\n\n【59】However, TREC numbers are also influenced by peripheral proliferation and, therefore, dilution of TRECs may be caused by increased replication of peripheral CD4 <sup>+ </sup> naive T cells, which may be confirmed by enhanced Ki67-expressing T cells during acute exacerbation in our patient. Additionally, decreased thymic output will induce compensatory autoproliferation, a process that contributes to TREC dilution. Chronic T cell stimulation induces increased T cell turnover in patients with JIA, as demonstrated by age-inappropriate short T cell telomere lengths in patients with JIA. Age-inappropriate thymic involution and increased peripheral T cell turnover may each contribute to the lower TREC numbers observed in patients with JIA. These data highlight the pitfalls of interpretation of TREC data \\[ 13 \\], therefore, replication markers such as Ki67 expression and RTL were considered in our study. TREC numbers were calculated to CD4 <sup>+ </sup> naive T cell counts, the latter unaltered by acute exacerbation. In view of these results it has to be considered that the peripheral naive T cell pool consists of two subsets of cells, namely RTE and peripheral replicating cells. Increased replication of naive T cells may be the crucial factor in acute exacerbation and disease activity. However, despite high replication activity increased amounts of naive T cells were not found in the peripheral blood samples from our patient with acute exacerbation, possibly due to accumulation in other compartments, (for example, the inflamed joints). Maturation of naive T cells to CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> memory T cells may be a possible explanation for disappearance of peripheral blood naive T cells despite increased replicative activity. This was also assumed for a model describing naive T cell dynamics in children and younger adults receiving HAART \\[ 12 \\]. Increased priming into memory T cells may be also true for our patient with acute exacerbation, who showed markedly increased CD8 <sup>+ </sup> CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> counts. During remission, enhanced thymus output of RTE, decreased replication activity of naive T cells, priming into memory T cells and/or depletion of peripheral blood naive T cells by accumulation in other sites may have contributed to the increased TREC numbers in naive T cells seen in the 12-month follow-up of our patient.\n\n【60】There was a tendency to lower RTL in the 12-month follow-up of patients with JIA compared to HD. Although limited by missing follow-up data from HD, these results fit with the tendency of increased Ki67-expressing CD4 <sup>+ </sup> naive T cells in patients with JIA compared to HD \\[ 4 \\]. Telomeric erosion was also clearly accelerated in patients with RA \\[ 2 \\], which was explained as a consequence of compensatory cell renewal.\n\n【61】Cytokines have been implicated in driving homeostatic T cell replication. Their most likely disease-related production could enhance T cell proliferation and exhaust the replicative potential \\[ 14 \\]. JIA has been associated with high serum or intra-articular levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β or TNFα \\[ 15 \\]. In fact, our study demonstrated an increase in the levels of TNFα, IFNγ and IL-2 in both CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> and CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> , CD4/CD8 T cell subpopulations in patients with JIA. Moreover, high levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in our patient with acute exacerbation during the exacerbation state, suggesting a Th1 cytokine-driven mechanism supported by an accumulation of CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> memory T cells and the reduction in the naive T cell population. Interestingly, classical cytokines for memory and effector T cell responses, such as TNFα and IFNγ, were increased in the CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cells. One may ask the question whether CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> alone is a reliable marker for naive T cells, as effector T cells also express CD45RA but lose CD28 surface expression. For this reason it may be more likely that the proportions of increased TNFα and IFNγ within the CD45RA <sup>+ </sup> T cell pool are predominately caused by activation of effector T cells.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【63】Our patient’s case supports the notion that changes in T cell homeostasis in JIA are down to the effect of several mechanisms such as diminished thymus function and peripheral exertions to maintain the peripheral T cell pool \\[ 4 \\]. The findings also demonstrate that quantitative T cell measurements or TRECs alone are insufficient to explain the immunological process in acute exacerbation of the disease or in remission. The results should only be interpreted together with data on replication. As, for the most part, the interpretation of the alterations found in our patient’s case remains speculative, there is increased demand for a prospective evaluation of the influence of disease activity as well as of therapy on thymus function and reconstitution of the naive T cell immune system in JIA.\n\n【64】Consent\n-------\n\n【65】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this report and accompanying images.

Causes can be classified as benign or malignant, or as extra- or intraluminal. Gastrojejunostomy is a well-recognised surgical procedure performed to bypass gastric outlet obstruction. A bezoar occurs most commonly in patients with impaired gastrointestinal motility or with a history of gastric surgery. It is an intestinal concretion, which fails to pass along the alimentary canal.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 62-year-old Asian woman with a history of gastrojejunostomy for peptic ulcer disease was admitted to hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting and dehydration. All investigations concluded gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a \"stricture\" at the site of gastrojejunostomy. Subsequent laparotomy revealed that the cause of the obstruction was a bezoar.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Many bezoars can be removed endoscopically, but some will require operative intervention. Once removed, emphasis must be placed upon prevention of recurrence.

There are benign and malignant causes. In the past, peptic ulcer disease was more prevalent than malignant causes, currently, it only accounts for 5% of all cases of GOO \\[ 1 \\]. With the advent of proton pump inhibitors and _Helicobacter pylori_ eradication therapy, this benign cause has become less common. Andersson and Bergdahl reported \\[ 2 \\] that 67% of patients have GOO secondary to malignancy. Other benign intraluminal causes in adults include gastric polyps, caustic ingestion, gallstone obstruction (Bouveret syndrome), and bezoars.\n\n【10】Bezoars, concretions of indigestible material in the gastrointestinal tract, have been known to occur in animals for centuries. The incidence of bezoars in adult patients has increased as a result of operative manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although bezoars are often recognised radiologically, endoscopy provides the most accurate means of identification. Many bezoars can be removed endoscopically, but some will require operative intervention. Once removed, emphasis must be placed upon prevention of recurrence. Surgeons must learn to recognise and classify bezoars in order to provide the most effective therapy.\n\n【11】We report a case of a 62-year-old Asian woman with a history of gastrojejunostomy, who was admitted to hospital with GOO secondary to a bezoar. We present the case, discuss management and review the literature.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 62-year-old Asian woman presented acutely to the emergency department with a 1-day history of colicky epigastric pain and postprandial vomiting. She had been tolerating only liquids rather than solid food for 2 months. There was no history of weight loss, but she did report early satiety and loss of appetite.\n\n【14】This woman had a history of peptic ulcer disease over 20 years ago in Kenya. It had led to GOO requiring truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy. In order to investigate the cause of her dysphagia and loss of appetite, she had undergone an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 3 weeks before this admission. This showed inflammation and oedema at the anastomotic site of the gastrojejunostomy, but no evidence of obstruction or stricture (Figure 1 ). She was then prescribed daily omeprazole, which was the only medication she was taking on admission.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**Image taken during upper endoscopy** . a) Oedema present at the anastomotic site of the gastrojejunostomy. b) No evidence of obstruction beyond the anastomosis.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The patient was clinically dehydrated on examination. She had a very thin body habitus. Her abdomen was soft, but mildly tender over her epigastrium. Succussion splash was demonstrated and a 10 cm × 8 cm mass was palpable just right of the umbilicus. Bowel sounds were scanty. There were no clinical signs for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【20】Her admission blood profiles were essentially unremarkable. There was no biochemical evidence of fluid shifts or dehydration. Plain abdominal radiograph did not show any diagnostic features. However, her erect chest radiograph showed an air-fluid level within a dilated stomach (Figure 2a ).\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Imaging** . a) Erect chest radiograph showing an air-fluid level within a dilated stomach. Lung fields were clear. There is no air under the diaphragm. b) Contrasted abdominal computed tomography showed possible stricture at the site of the gastrojejunostomy.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】In view of the examination and chest radiograph findings, she had a nasogastric tube and urinary catheter inserted for gastric decompression and urine output monitoring, respectively. An urgent contrasted computed tomography of the abdomen was arranged. Meanwhile, the nasogastric tube successfully prevented further vomiting, and there was little drainage from it. She was commenced on intravenous omeprazole and fluid therapy.\n\n【26】The abdominal computed tomography (Figure 2b ) showed a fluid filled, non-dilated stomach. The anastomosis between the proximal jejunum and body of the stomach was shown to be patent. The afferent loop was not dilated but the efferent loop was dilated. Just past the midline, approximately 20 cm from the anastomotic site, there was a change in calibre of the bowel with the jejunum becoming significantly narrowed. The bowel distal to this site was collapsed. The proposed diagnosis was a stricture at the site of the gastrojejunostomy, but the exact cause was uncertain.\n\n【27】The patient provided consent for expedited laparotomy and relief of obstruction. Intra-operatively, the jejunum was found to be dilated from the duodenojejunal flexure to a large bolus obstruction. A conical mass suspicious of a bezoar was found measuring 10 cm in length, situated 20 cm beyond the gastrojejunostomy. The small bowel distal to this site was collapsed. Attempts to break up this hard bolus mass externally were unsuccessful. The bezoar eventually had to be removed in whole via an enterotomy. Careful examination confirmed that it was indeed a phytobezoar (Figure 3 ).\n\n【28】**Figure 3**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】**A 10 cm conical phytobezoar was found 20 cm distal to the gastrojejunostomy.** It was removed by an enterotomy.\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home 1 week after surgery. Before discharge, she was seen by the dietician with regard to different types of fibre diet. She was also advised on the importance of longer mastication of food.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】A bezoar is also known as an enterolith, a concretion of foreign or indigestible matter found in the alimentary canal. There are two main types of bezoars: trichobezoar – a bezoar formed from hair and phytobezoar – formed by indigestible cellulose. Rarely, pharmacobezoars from masses of tablets are found.\n\n【35】This was an unusual presentation of symptoms and signs of GOO secondary to a phytobezoar, in that this woman had already had a gastrojejunostomy to bypass previous GOO caused by peptic ulcer disease. The oedema seen in her upper endoscopy 3 weeks before admission may have been the result of a distal subacute obstruction. Postprandial non-bilious vomiting is the cardinal symptom of GOO, which may lead to electrolyte abnormalities. The frequency of vomiting puts patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia. Early satiety and better tolerance to liquid than solid food may represent gastric dilatation, which may be appreciated by succussion splash. Management includes identification of the cause and reversal of any complications of GOO such as metabolic alkalosis, electrolyte abnormalities, and aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis can result from upper endoscopy or imaging studies.\n\n【36】Regardless of the cause, 75% of all cases of GOO require surgical intervention \\[ 3 \\]. Definitive treatment consists of laparotomy with milking of the contents to the caecum, or enterotomy. Medical treatment is usually inadequate. Recently, the laparoscopic approach has become increasingly popular. A recent study compared laparoscopic versus open treatment for bezoar-induced small bowel obstruction \\[ 4 \\]. The report concluded that laparoscopy is safe and effective and is associated with a better postoperative outcome and a shorter hospital stay. One author describes how a jejunal bezoar in a 59-year-old man was laparoscopically milked into the caecum through the ileocaecal valve \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【37】Bezoars tend to be rare, except in patients with previous gastric surgery \\[ 6 \\] or gastrointestinal dysmotility. In a 10-year retrospective review of all patients with small bowel obstruction in a hospital in Hong Kong, the incidence of bezoar was reported as approximately 2% \\[ 7 \\]. A 4-year study in an Italian unit confirmed a similar incidence with nine of 369 patients having bowel obstruction secondary to bezoars \\[ 8 \\]. It appears that geographical or dietary variation does not participate in the risk of developing bezoar obstruction.\n\n【38】Delayed gastric emptying and abnormal gastric motility patterns were prominent in one series of patients with bezoars, suggesting that these events were the underlying factors \\[ 9 \\]. There was another series of patients with bezoar obstruction, who had had pyloroplasty for peptic ulcer disease. These patients did not demonstrate delayed gastric emptying when assessed by technetium-99m-labelled studies \\[ 10 \\]. However, Cifuentes _et al._ \\[ 11 \\] reported that 84% of cases of bezoar obstruction occurred in those who had had a bilateral truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty. The authors proposed that, in this acid reducing procedure, there is hypochlorhydria, which reduces gastric antral motility and gives poor degradation of food. This predisposes to the formation of a ball of sticky concretions, which pass into the duodenum and jejunum unfragmented.\n\n【39】More evidence has since emerged supporting this theory. Another study \\[ 12 \\] involving 117 patients with gastrointestinal bezoars revealed that 87% occurred in the small bowel and 30% in the stomach. Furthermore, 70% of patients had previous surgery for peptic ulcer disease, and 80% of these patients had a bilateral truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty. Of the 87 patients presenting with intestinal bezoars, excessive intake of dietary fibre occurred in 40%, and 24% had alterations of mastication and dentition. There are other risk factors for bezoar obstruction. Children themselves are at higher risk than adults in that they have smaller gastrointestinal lumens, especially with trichobezoar obstruction. There is also an association between bezoar obstruction and mentally retarded patients \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【40】As discussed, patients with bezoars often present with symptoms and clinical or radiological signs of bowel obstruction. Dilated small bowel loops may be seen in plain abdominal radiographs. In one retrospective study, the abdominal computed tomography scan was declared to be the most useful imaging modality for detecting bezoars \\[ 14 \\]. The study advocated that abdominal computed tomography should be performed early in patients at higher risk of developing bezoars. The classical appearance of a bezoar on computed tomography is a well-defined ovoid intraluminal mass with mottled gas pattern at the site of obstruction.\n\n【41】Besides obstruction and its associated complications, other complications of bezoars include ulceration, intussusception, and bowel perforation. Intraluminal bezoar is a serious condition, with a mortality rate as high as 30% being reported in a retrospective analysis of 34 cases \\[ 15 \\]. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment is the key to successful management of the condition, which is curable.\n\n【42】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【43】Bezoar induced bowel obstruction is uncommon and remains a diagnostic challenge. It should be suspected in patients with an increased risk, such as those with previous gastric surgery, poor dentition, mental retardation and a suggestive history of increased fibre intake. Computed tomography of the abdomen should be performed early in these at-risk patients presenting with symptoms of GOO or small bowel obstruction in order to reduce unnecessary delays before appropriate surgical intervention. Bezoar is a curable condition but can potentially cause significant morbidity and mortality.\n\n【44】Consent\n-------\n\n【45】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Oxidization of the ferrous iron (Fe <sup>2+ </sup> ) to ferric iron (Fe <sup>3+ </sup> ) produces methemoglobin \\[ 1 \\]. Methemoglobin is incapable of binding, transporting, and releasing oxygen into the tissues effectively, resulting in hypoxia and functional anemia \\[ 2 \\]. Physiological mechanisms and enzymatic systems protect the red blood cells against oxidative stress and try not to let the methemoglobin levels exceed 1–2% of the total hemoglobin \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Methemoglobinemia, which means high levels of methemoglobin in the blood, is a rare but life-threatening condition, presenting in hereditary or acquired forms \\[ 4 \\]. Hemoglobin M disease, cytochrome b <sub>5 </sub> reductase deficiency, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are causes of hereditary methemoglobinemia \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, some drugs, such as dapson, nitroglycerine, nitroprusside, nitric oxide, sulfanamides, phenazopyridine, chloroquine, lidocaine, prilocaine, and benzocaine, may cause acquired methemoglobinemia \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Cocaine-derived anesthetics, including lidocaine and benzocaine, are extensively used in medical procedures, such as endoscopy and bronchoscopy \\[ 6 \\]; moreover, they may be used topically \\[ 6 \\]. In this study, we present a unique and atypical case of methemoglobinemia and hemolysis induced by self-administration of topical lidocaine and benzocaine.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 25-year-old self-employed Persian male with no past medical history presented to the hospital with generalized weakness, dizziness, and headache for almost 7 days. After an accurate history taking, he also reported some genital warts that appeared starting 3 weeks ago. He started self-treatment of the warts with podophyllin, which is an over-the-counter topical ointment. Self-administration of the excessive podophyllin caused severe pain and itching of the genitalia. To reduce the noticed symptoms, he started using over-the-counter topical anesthetics, such as benzocaine and lidocaine, for approximately 2 weeks. The patients surprisingly reported that he used four ointment tubes daily: two tubes of benzocaine ointment 5% (60 g/10 g) and two tubes of lidocaine ointment 5% (70 g/10 g). He did not smoke, and his family history of polycythemia and hematologic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary disorders was negative. On physical examination, he was alert and not distressed, and skin pallor and perioral and acral cyanosis were remarkable. Examination of the heart and lungs was normal. The vital signs revealed 37 °C (98.6 °F), blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and respiration of 18 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) was 75% on room air, increasing to almost 85% when using an oxygen mask. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory findings indicated that anemia and renal and liver functional tests and inflammatory markers \\[erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)\\] were normal. Additionally, the urine analysis was not remarkable, and the urine culture was negative. G6PD was sufficient. Viral markers, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ab, hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, hepatitis B surface (HBS) Ag, and HBS Ab were nonreactive. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were normal. Furthermore, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the total and direct bilirubin increased up to 3500 U/L, 2.8 mg/dL, and 1.2 mg/dL, respectively. The arterial blood gas (ABG) had chocolate-brown appearance and measured pH of 7.51, pCO <sub>2 </sub> 26.8 mmHg, pressure of O <sub>2 </sub> (pO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 189.2 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> of 21.1 mEq/L, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 99.4%. CO-oximetry revealed total calculated hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, oxyhemoglobin of 70.9%, carboxyhemoglobin of 8.2%, and methemoglobin of 19.5%. Considering that abnormal LDH and bilirubin levels may be due to hemolysis, direct and indirect Coombs tests were taken, which were negative, and splenomegaly was not detected in abdominopelvic ultrasonography. Considering the normal cardiovascular and pulmonary findings (ECG and chest X-ray) and according to the excessive application and the discrepancy between SaO <sub>2 </sub> and SpO <sub>2 </sub> , the final diagnosis was lidocaine- and benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. According to the hemolysis, methylene blue was not the choice of the treatment. The anesthetic ointment was discontinued, and 3 g ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was intravenously administered daily for 3 days. After 2 days, repeated CO-oximetry showed decreased methemoglobin (12.3%) and increased oxyhemoglobin (76.1%). The cyanosis and hemolysis symptoms disappeared within 3 and 5 days, respectively. At the time of discharge, all signs and symptoms were resolved so that SpO <sub>2 </sub> was 97–98%, LDH and bilirubin levels returned to normal ranges, methemoglobin was 0.3%, and oxyhemoglobin increased up to 91.6%.\n\n【12】Discussion\n----------\n\n【13】The acquired form of methemoglobinemia may be induced by medication overdose following ingestion, skin absorption, and inhalation \\[ 4 \\]. Drugs may oxidize the hemoglobin directly or indirectly by producing superoxide free radicals \\[ 4 \\]. Route of administration, prolonged use, body surface area, age, accompanying use of oxidative drugs, comorbidity, and high doses of oxidizing drugs are related to the occurrence and severity of methemoglobinemia \\[ 4 \\]. A methemoglobin level up to 15% of total hemoglobin is asymptomatic in healthy patients; headache and fatigue is associated with a level ranging from 15% to 30%; dizziness, dyspnea, and syncope occur at levels of 30–50%; and at levels higher than 50%, central nervous system (CNS) depression, coma, and death are expected \\[ 2 , 7 \\]. Symptoms may be worsened due to cardiovascular, hematologic, and pulmonary disorders, as well as infection and renal or liver failure \\[ 4 \\]. Prilocaine, lidocaine, and benzocaine are anesthetics that may cause methemoglobinemia \\[ 8 \\]. In the current case, the excessive use of topical benzocaine and lidocaine resulted in methemoglobinemia presenting with dizziness, cyanosis, and generalized weakness. Nappe _et al._ reported a case of methemoglobinemia in a patient who used benzocaine gel three times daily for 3 days \\[ 7 \\]. The gel was self-administered to reduce the toothache \\[ 7 \\]. One study conducted by Hahn _et al._ demonstrated that the use of five tubes of EMLA cream (lidocaine and prilocaine) before laser epilation resulted in methemoglobinemia \\[ 9 \\]. Furthermore, Lavergne _et al._ \\[ 10 \\] presented a case of methemoglobinemia and acute hemolysis induced by tetracaine lozenges. Several studies reported methemoglobinemia induced by inhalation of anesthetics \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. Methemoglobinemia is diagnosed by pulse oximetry, patient symptoms, and ABG with CO-oximetry \\[ 7 \\]. Oxygen saturation gap between SaO <sub>2 </sub> measured in ABG and SpO <sub>2 </sub> predicts methemoglobinemia \\[ 7 \\]. In calculating SaO <sub>2 </sub> , all the hemoglobin is assumed normal, whereas SpO <sub>2 </sub> shows the percentage of oxyhemoglobin compared with the total hemoglobin \\[ 7 \\]. In this regard, methylene blue and ascorbic acid are used to treat hyperoxia \\[ 2 \\]. Methylene blue, which is not used in hemolysis and G6PD deficiency, oxidized the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and reduced to leukomethylene blue, which turns methemoglobin to hemoglobin \\[ 7 \\]. Ascorbic acid acts directly as an electron donor and reduces methemoglobin to hemoglobin \\[ 2 \\]. Considering the strengths of the current study, in this case acquired methemoglobinemia was accompanied with hemolysis, which was not detected in previous studies and is more likely to be noticed in patients presenting with methemoglobinemia. At first, due to cultural concerns, the patient avoided letting us know about the genital warts, and this could have deviated us from the correct diagnosis; thus, cultural differences should be observed.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【15】Commonly used drugs may cause acquired methemoglobinemia. Over-the-counter topical anesthetics, including benzocaine and lidocaine, are supposed to induce methemoglobinemia. Self-administration of these drugs is an important issue that may cause life-threatening conditions. Thus, methemoglobinemia should be considered in patients presenting with dyspnea, dizziness, hypoxia, and cyanosis.\n\n【16】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【17】The datasets analyzed in the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【18】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【19】OTC:\n\n【20】Over the counter\n\n【21】ABG:\n\n【22】Arterial blood gas\n\n【23】Hb:\n\n【24】Hemoglobin\n\n【25】G6PD:\n\n【26】Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\n\n【27】SpO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【28】Saturation of peripheral oxygen\n\n【29】ECG:\n\n【30】Electrocardiogram\n\n【31】ESR:\n\n【32】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【33】CRP:\n\n【34】C-reactive protein\n\n【35】HIV:\n\n【36】Human immunodeficiency virus\n\n【37】HCV:\n\n【38】Hepatitis C virus\n\n【39】HBS:\n\n【40】Hepatitis B surface\n\n【41】PT:\n\n【42】Prothrombin time\n\n【43】APTT:\n\n【44】Activated partial thromboplastin time\n\n【45】INR:\n\n【46】International normalized ratio\n\n【47】LDH:\n\n【48】Lactate dehydrogenase\n\n【49】pCO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【50】Pressure of CO <sub>2</sub>\n\n【51】pO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【52】Pressure of O <sub>2</sub>\n\n【53】SaO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【54】Arterial oxygen saturation\n\n【55】CNS:\n\n【56】Central nervous system\n\n【57】NADPH:\n\n【58】Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is essential to understand reinfection symptoms and, importantly, the lived experience.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Case study design is the best method for understanding this contemporary pandemic and rare occurrence of reinfections. A 19-year-old White Non-Hispanic woman presented with presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection 6 weeks after initially mild symptomatic infection and consistent repeat negative results. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from saliva was used for detection. Twice-weekly saliva samples were collected (a) before initial infection, (b) resumed on day 10 after initial infection until reinfection was detected, and (c) resumed on day 10 post-reinfection. A 1.5-hour virtual interview was conducted, transcribed, and independently analyzed by two researchers. Four themes emerged: (1) perceived invincibility or inevitability and subsequent immunity increases risk of transmission via inconsistent preventive behaviors; (2) normalcy desires, trusted others, and implicit social pressures to not wear masks and distance increase one’s coronavirus disease 2019 risk; (3) physical symptoms are more severe with reinfection compared with first infection; and (4) mental health sequelae (trauma and stigma) are more severe and enduring than physical health outcomes.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Unmasked social interactions contradicting public health recommendations were rationalized by social circle members with heavy reliance on feeling asymptomatic, lacking a positive test (testing negative or not testing), or attributing symptoms to allergies. Stigma of testing positive and consequences of not conforming to social group behaviors is overwhelming and creates pressure to take risks. This case study provides insights and lessons learned relevant for public health messaging and continued preventive behaviors.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】As of 22 February 2021, over 112 million people globally \\[ 1 \\] and nearly 28 million in the USA \\[ 2 \\] have tested positive at least once for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reinfection prevalence is unknown. As of 20 December 2020, a total of four viral genome sequence confirmed reinfection cases have been reported in the empirical literature (Hong Kong, Nevada, Belgium, Ecuador) \\[ 3 \\]. Of these four, two presented worse symptoms upon reinfection \\[ 4 \\]. Cases occurred within less than 90 days (one within 48 days) of initial infection \\[ 3 \\]. With emergency vaccine dissemination, anticipated decreases in masking and distancing, and variants of concern that may reinfect persons who already had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reinfection has become a larger concern than initially thought \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Psychosocial factors have been ignored in previous reinfection studies that exclusively present biological factors. It is essential to understand reinfection not only in terms of symptoms but, more importantly, the lived experience. The goal of this case study is to describe and explain the lived experience of a participant with COVID-19 reinfection. Given that COVID-19 reinfection cases are rare, their study is time-sensitive given the just-in-time nature of this pandemic, and the descriptive and exploratory focus of the case study methodological approach is best suited to understand this phenomenon \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Further, this case study provides insights and lessons learned relevant for public health messaging and continued preventive behaviors.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Case history\n\n【13】A 19-year-old White Non-Hispanic female student with no underlying health conditions and no past psychiatric illness attending a Midwestern public university moved to campus on 17 August 2020 to begin the 2020–21 academic year. All students were required to take two saliva virus (PCR) tests weekly. The timeline of testing, symptom onset, isolation, and retesting is shown in Fig. 1 . She had two negative results during her first 7 days on campus and first tested positive on 24 August with no symptoms. She isolated in an apartment with three female friends who also tested positive (creating an isolation “Pod”). During isolation (25 August–3 September), she reported mild physical symptoms consistent with viral infection (headache, aches and pains, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and diarrhea). She reported that her Pod peers experienced worse physical symptoms than herself. Her symptoms resolved by the end of isolation, and she resumed testing. She consistently tested negative twice weekly from 8 September until 5 October, when she received her second positive result. Two days prior to her second positive test, she began exhibiting many of the same symptoms she experienced with her first infection. Compared with her previously mild symptoms, her reinfection symptoms were moderate to severe and included more impacts (severe: coughing and loss of appetite; moderate: stuffy nose, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of sleep; mild: shortness of breath and difficulty thinking). She began self-isolation on 6 October (e.g., stopped sharing a bathroom with roommates) and isolated in a hotel 7–14 October. Her physical symptoms resolved during isolation except for a persistent cough.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Timeline of testing, symptom onset, isolation, and retesting\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】### Procedures\n\n【19】The participant provided written consent to be part of this case study and for the findings to be published. The UIUC Institutional Review Board confirmed the case study status of this work.\n\n【20】Saliva for each test was collected via an observed self-collection, in which the participant would drool into a 50 mL conical tube. A direct saliva RT-qPCR process was used for detection \\[ 8 \\]. All positive samples were retested, and results were reviewed by laboratory personnel. Any positive results following isolation were also reviewed by the ordering physician to confirm reinfection as opposed to recurrent noninfectious positive results.\n\n【21】The interview was conducted via video conferencing by a trained mixed methodologist. A semi-structured interview \\[ 9 \\] protocol was used to ensure major topics were discussed including: timing of testing and positive results; degree of symptom severity (scale: none, slight/mild, moderate, severe, very severe) at first infection and reinfection; information sources; self, peer, and family members’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors; mental health concerns; and advice for peers, family members, older adults, health officials, and others. The 90-minute interview was audio recorded and transcribed.\n\n【22】The case study—an inductive qualitative analytic approach—is justified given the exploratory nature of this contemporary and real-time wicked problem \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The goal of this case study is to describe and explain the lived experience of COVID-19 reinfection. A holistic analysis was conducted. First, the case context is described regarding chronological events. Then, themes emerging from the case are detailed. Last, the themes are interpreted, and parallels are drawn to other public health epidemics. Two researchers independently read the transcript and initially identified major and subthemes. Through an iterative process of reviewing summaries and discussions, the final version of themes and descriptions were agreed upon \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【23】Results\n-------\n\n【24】Four themes emerged from this case study.\n\n【25】### Theme 1: Perceived invincibility or inevitability and subsequent immunity increases risk of transmission via inconsistent preventive behaviors\n\n【26】Perception played an important role in this participant’s COVID-19-related preventive behaviors. When the pandemic first impacted her life, the severity became reality when she was not allowed to return to campus after spring break (March 2020). Rather, she was forced to live with her family as a result of the stay-at-home order March through June 2020. During the summer, her social interactions were relatively controlled: outside gatherings with distancing and limited to friends who claimed to heed public health recommendations of wearing masks and limiting social interactions.\n\n【27】Despite the excitement of returning to school, she arrived at campus believing becoming infected with the virus was inevitable. As she stated: “ _I was really excited \\[to return to school\\]. Like obviously very nervous too 'cause I knew the chances of me getting it were so high. I knew I was bound to get it at least once.”_\n\n【28】She was eager to leave her parents’ home and return to school despite the increased risk of contraction. She understood the seriousness of the virus and followed many of the guidelines for prevention (e.g., mask-wearing to varying degrees, keeping her social circle small). She, however, felt strongly about hanging out with friends and not letting fear determine all of her behaviors. As she described,\n\n【29】> _I can’t not live my life because I’m in fear all the time. I have to learn to live with this virus eventually. Like obviously just be very cautious. Don’t do anything that could put you at risk. But, you can’t just sit in your room alone all night and not go out and see anyone 'cause then what’s even the point of being here?_\n\n【30】Perceived illness inevitability and mindset that one cannot live in fear promoted inconsistent preventive behaviors, which was further compounded by an _initial_ disbelief that reinfection was possible and _subsequent_ belief that immunity would last at least 90 days. As she stated “ _No, I wasn’t concerned about getting reinfected. I didn’t think it was possible, especially within the 90 days_ .” After her first isolation, she engaged in riskier behaviors compared with when she first returned to campus. She was less disciplined about wearing her mask around friends, even in larger groups.\n\n【31】This placed her at greater risk because she interacted with friends who were convinced they were physically robust and could not get sick. These friends were not consistently testing or engaging in preventive behaviors because they were asymptomatic and felt invincible. When she was reinfected, her friend tested and was positive. As she remembered,\n\n【32】> _Looking back at it now, they \\[friends\\] were having symptoms before I was. So I think I got it from them, not them getting it from me. They went home and …when they came back, they were coughing. And they kept telling me ‘it's just a cough. It’s allergies.’ His cough wasn’t as bad as mine was. It wasn’t as frequent and as loud. So he was like, ‘really, I can’t get \\[sick\\].’ He had been exposed a lot of times and had never gotten it. So this was his first time having it even though he had known so many people at the beginning of the year who had it. So he was like ‘I can’t get it.’_\n\n【33】These varied perceptions—inevitable illness, invincibility, and immunity—coupled with inconsistent risk-taking behaviors creates a perfect storm for transmission, infection, and reinfection. This participant, after reinfection, developed an appreciation for testing, noting _“I think the testing is really great and it makes me feel like maybe even though I have had it makes you feel a little bit more safe.”_\n\n【34】### Theme 2: The perils of normalcy desires, trusted others, and implicit social pressures to not wear masks and physically distance\n\n【35】The participant expressed a clear desire to protect her family (and herself, especially after her second infection) from infection. However, her desire for close proximity to her friends, without masks, was a stronger determinant of her behavior. She admits that she and her peers were so focused on establishing a sense of normalcy that they risked becoming sick. As she aptly described:\n\n【36】> _We were just trying to live normal life, like last year. We wanted so badly to have the same experience that we did last year and for it not to be different. We tried to do everything we could to make it like that. I guess in the process we weren’t being the smartest, obviously since we got it._\n\n【37】The participant spoke about feeling safe around her trusted friends. She tried to limit the size of her social circle. She spent most of her time with female housemates and with male friends who lived in one house. She did not visit other friends’ apartments, houses, or dorms. She assumed each person in her trusted circle was taking the same precautions she was. As she described:\n\n【38】> _I was wearing a mask in common areas but in their personal rooms where we were hanging out I took it off most of the time 'cause I felt comfortable. I didn’t feel like they were exposed. I didn’t think I was exposed. But they were also not really wearing masks. I didn’t really do social distancing that much with them either._\n\n【39】The level of preventive behaviors in the two houses shifted over time. She described first following the public health recommendations in areas with more traffic and not in personal rooms:\n\n【40】> _I guess at times I just feel safe. I’m gonna take it \\[mask\\] off to talk to people and I’ll put it on when I go walk and there’s no one in the halls. Sometimes in the personal rooms it would be really crowded, and I would hold my mask. I was wearing it but then I’d pull it down and talk to people_ .\n\n【41】Behaviors progressively shifted from strict mask-wearing and distancing to greater exceptions being made, especially at the time of her reinfection. She admitted rarely wearing masks or practicing distancing with her trusted circle. They had an understanding that, if everyone was comfortable, they would all remove their masks.\n\n【42】> _It \\[wearing masks\\] started out really strict. It’s gotten progressively lenient and it’s more of a comfort base now. If everyone in the room that you’re in is comfortable without masks on, then you take them off. But if someone’s not comfortable, you keep them on, sure. But at the beginning, it was everyone wears masks at all times unless you’re in your room or you’re in a friend’s room who says you can take it off._\n\n【43】She trusted her close circle of friends to adhere to prevention guidelines _outside_ the circle in order to keep themselves safe, which in turn would keep her safe. Because her network of friends perceived they were not interacting with others outside their circle and therefore assumed minimal risk of infection, they stopped regular testing. As she described:\n\n【44】> _Because we don’t go to that many buildings, I don’t think that they get tested that often, unfortunately. So I just think they don’t really care as much. They do \\[get tested\\] but not as often as I do. \\[It’s\\] not like they don’t do it. They just go when they wanna go. They don’t go when they’re required to go… I didn’t really know they weren’t complying until I realized that I probably got it from one of them. For the second time, I just think they don’t really care, they don’t really want to take the time out of their day to go. Think it’s kind of inconvenient sometimes._\n\n【45】She and her friends rarely wore masks when together because they felt “comfortable” that none of them had been exposed elsewhere. When she reflected back on September and October, she admitted that she did not know how safe her male friends were being and concluded that she most likely contracted the virus from them both times. Inconsistent testing coupled with pressures to relax preventive behaviors increases the risk of transmission.\n\n【46】### Theme 3: Physical symptoms are more severe with reinfection compared with first infection\n\n【47】This participant reported experiencing no symptoms before her first positive test. Testing regardless of symptomatology likely increased virus detection among presymptomatic individuals. She also offered that, despite having a headache and mild aches after her first positive test, she would not have known she had COVID-19 without the positive test result.\n\n【48】She was asked to rate the severity of a list of symptoms during her first infection and reinfection using a scale of “not at all” to “very severe.” As shown in Table 1 , she did not experience most symptoms during first infection and reported only mild shortness of breath/ trouble breathing, chest pain, and diarrhea and moderate fatigue during isolation.\n\n【49】**Table 1: Physical symptom severity ratings at first and reinfection**\n\n【50】Full size table\n\n【51】She remembered that her symptoms began on 3 October, 2 days before her second positive test. She reported having a severe cough, a stuffy and runny nose, mild shortness of breath, moderate fatigue, moderate diarrhea, moderate abdominal pain, severe loss of appetite, mild difficulty thinking, and moderate loss of sleep. At the time, she did not attribute her symptoms to a COVID-19 reinfection because she believed she could not become reinfected for at least 90 days.\n\n【52】> _So on the 3rd and the 4th \\[of October\\] I was coughing a lot. I had a lot of symptoms that I didn’t realize were symptoms: coughing, stuffy nose, runny nose. And just not feeling 100%. I thought that they were allergies or that they were just the weather changing 'cause last year I had also gotten a cold and I had a cough for so long… I had an appointment on the 5th with a doctor from home, a Skype call, and they told me they thought they were just allergies too. Not Corona._\n\n【53】Her saliva test on 5 October revealed she was positive for the second time. The symptoms mimicking common cold and allergy symptoms meant that this participant and her primary care physician did not attribute her symptoms to COVID-19 without positive test results.\n\n【54】### Theme 4: Mental health sequelae are more severe than physical health outcomes—trauma, stigma, and creative coping with isolation pods\n\n【55】Humans are social and emotional beings. Social isolation is a long-standing form of torture. The Public Health Department mandated 10-day physical isolation requirement post-positive test result was the hardest part of this woman’s entire COVID-19 experience. During her first isolation, she shared a short-term apartment rental with three COVID-positive friends. This creative coping strategy protected her from the full magnitude of social and physical separation from peers and family. She reported being anxious and stressed during her initial isolation, but extremely anxious and traumatized as a result of reinfection. Given her limited resources during reinfection, for a week she had to isolate alone in a hotel room, funded by the local Public Health Department. As she described:\n\n【56】> _I cried a lot that whole week. I was really anxious, and I’ve never been an anxious person. I started to become extremely anxious all the time. I was always sad. I was a lot more anxious and sad than I was the first time and than I ever was even in my life._\n\n【57】Even though she became aware of another woman isolating at the same time in the hotel and arranged to watch a movie in the evenings, the cumulative impact of two isolations and distancing recommendations is long term and traumatizing.\n\n【58】> _The mental impact has obviously been a lot worse ‘cause it’s lasted a lot longer than the physical symptoms. I had them \\[physical symptoms\\] for a few days and now they’re not as bad. \\[But\\] the mental stays with me throughout and it’s probably never gonna go._\n\n【59】She characterized the traumatization as follows: “ _I would never wish this on anyone else. What happened to me was awful and I would never wish on my worst enemy to get it twice; to even get it once._ ” The continuous and compounding social stigma she experiences exacerbates the mental health consequences of COVID-19. As she noted “ _I do think I’ve been a little stigmatized. About what happened to me._ ” Testing positive negatively impacted her friendships. At the time of the interview, 1 month after testing positive the second time, she was still being stigmatized. Nearly 2 weeks following her second isolation, she continued to feel anxiety about her friendships and in social situations.\n\n【60】> _“I get really anxious and nervous not just about COVID but I feel like it’s affected my friendships. I’ve been getting really anxious about friendships like when people are upset with me or mad at me. I think that it’s affected everything in my life… I’ve been a lot more cautious, obviously about wearing my mask. I wear it everywhere. I barely ever take it off and when I do, after the fact if something happens, I get really anxious about it._\n\n【61】Discussion\n----------\n\n【62】This case presents a rare opportunity to deepen our understanding of a person’s experience with COVID-19 upon initial infection and reinfection. In another context, this participant would not have undergone testing and therefore would not have known of her initial positive status. This is consistent with warnings that reinfection numbers are grossly underestimated.\n\n【63】Four main themes emerged: (1) perceived invincibility or inevitability and subsequent immunity increases risk of transmission via inconsistent preventive behaviors; (2) a desire for normalcy, assumed health and safety of trusted others, and implicit social pressures discourage mask wearing and distancing; (3) physical symptoms are more severe with reinfection compared with first infection; and (4) mental health sequelae (trauma and stigma) are more severe and longer lasting than physical health outcomes.\n\n【64】The COVID-19 pandemic poses a tension between preventive behaviors (specifically mask-wearing and distancing) and risk perceptions (e.g., inevitability or invincibility) and the importance of face-to-face social interaction. This is particularly challenging for people who seek, are accustomed to, or expect an active social life. Observing trusted friends and family members not wearing masks or distancing, coupled with a desire to return to normalcy, creates expectations and pressures to relax preventive behaviors.\n\n【65】Testing is psychologically complex. For some people, it may provide false assurance that one is currently negative and justifies unprotected socializing. Regular testing is a reassurance for people who perceive it as keeping them and others safe. For others, negative status is assumed if they present no symptoms and avoiding testing means they do not risk an asymptomatic positive that will restrict their behaviors.\n\n【66】Numerous paradoxes were revealed in this case study that parallel other epidemics. The unintended consequences associated with sources of false security heightens the significance for learning about the lived experience of reinfection. This case study provides insights and lessons learned relevant for public health messaging and continued preventive behaviors.\n\n【67】First, symptoms were rated worse during reinfection relative to initial infection. This virus violates the assumption that immunity from an initial infection would result in a less severe second illness. Given this increase in severity, combined with the low likelihood of detecting reinfections in the USA, the possibility of reinfection should not be underplayed or deemphasized as a rare occurrence. This is particularly important as vaccines are distributed, as those who are vaccinated may hold similar beliefs about protection as those who have previously been infected. Mask-wearing and distancing should be underscored as important even for recovered individuals.\n\n【68】Second, rationalizations were made as a coping strategy to justify unprotected, close social interactions. These included feeling asymptomatic and testing negative or not testing at all, which provided a false comfort, as did ignoring symptoms or explaining them as allergies or a cold.\n\n【69】Third, the stigma associated with testing positive and social ramifications of not gathering or not succumbing to pressures to go without masks and distancing have deleterious effects on people. The long-lasting mental health consequences of testing positive or being isolated from others motivated creative coping and, at times, elevated risk-taking behaviors. Isolation pods and pods of trusted friends helped maintain social connections. However, trusting others to practice preventive behaviors to keep oneself and others safe was an ineffective strategy for wellness. Lack of trust of the virus should supersede discomfort of insisting friends and family wear masks and maintain their distance.\n\n【70】The loss of social interaction and other perceived losses potentially outweighs the loss of life as behavioral motivators. The unintended consequences of the synergistic effects of wanting normalcy, trusting others, and innate desire for social connection may be (a) additional waves of infection spikes; (b) massive reductions in preventive behaviors immediately upon vaccination because of a lack of understanding about reinfection; and (c) continual spikes or high levels of infection and reinfection during and after vaccine distribution. Although this is a case study of one participant, her insights warrant consideration and are based on interactions with grandparents, parents, and peers. More mixed methods research is needed to understand the prevalence of reinfection and differential motivations for preventive behaviors to begin to solve this wicked problem.\n\n【71】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【72】Unmasked social interactions contradicting public health recommendations were rationalized by social circle members with heavy reliance on feeling asymptomatic, lacking a positive test (testing negative or not testing), or attributing symptoms to allergies.

It commonly presents as a painless, nodular unilateral mass \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】Testicular cancers include germ cell tumors (GCTs) 90–95% and non-germ cells tumors (NGCTs)10–15%. GCTs are mainly categorized into unclassified type; seminoma (pure or classic, syncytiotrophoblastic and spermatocytic), and non-seminomatous-type tumors include embryonal carcinoma; yolk sac tumor; choriocarcinoma; other trophoblastic tumors; teratoma (mature, immature, or malignant); and mixed tumors \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【11】Seminoma is the most common testicular germ cell neoplasm and accounts for about 50% of all GCTs, which occur most commonly in patients aged 30–49 years \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【12】Less than 20% of patients with stage I seminoma will have retroperitoneal lymph node metastatic disease \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【13】In this case report, we describe a classic seminoma that was diagnosed in a 90-year-old patient, who is the second-oldest patient with this condition in the medical literature.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 90-year-old Syrian man with a 6-year history of an increase in size of his right scrotum, without pain presented to the urology clinic with enlargement of, and slight pain in, his right testis. He is a farmer with seven sons and has been smoking for 55 years. In his medical history, he had controlled hypertension and no history of testicular trauma or inflammation. A clinical examination showed the presence a painless, massive enlargement occupying his right scrotum, impermeable to light and with no inguinal lymph node palpable. His vital signs were within normal limits. A scrotal ultrasound scan showed a hypoechoic solid mass measuring approximately 10 cm in his right testis. Laboratory test results revealed tumor markers: alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of 3.1 KU/L (normal range 0.5–5.8 KU/L), the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) of 2.38 IU/L (normal range 0–2.5 IU/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 420 IU/L (normal range 200–400 IU/L).\n\n【16】Routine blood test results were within normal limits. The findings suggested testicular tumor and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed and showed no retroperitoneum metastases. His right testicle was removed radically by a right inguinal approach. The pathology test result showed a tumor that is very rare in elderly patients, a classical testicular seminoma. A histological study revealed a nodular solid mass measuring 95\\*80 mm, with a solid gray cut surface with focal necrosis friable in consistency. The tumor had invaded the hilar soft tissues and tunica albuginea, but without tunica vaginalis invasion. Consequently, the stage was pT2, which it is when the tumor is limited to the testis (including rete testis invasion) with lymphovascular invasion or when the tumor invades the hilar soft tissue or epididymis or penetrates the visceral mesothelial layer covering the external surface of tunica albuginea, with or without lymphovascular invasion. Histological sectioning showed sheets of large polygonal cells (Fig. 1 ), which stained positively for CD117 (Fig. 2 ) and negative for cytokeratin and vimentin, which is consistent with a diagnosis of classical seminoma. A follow-up oncology consultation suggested outpatient surveillance without adjuvant chemotherapy. Our patient was hospitalized for 24 hours and discharged without complications. Tumor markers, hematological tests, and a CT evaluation were repeated after 6 months and again after 12 months, and all were within normal limits without any evidence for retroperitoneal metastases.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Sheets of polyhedral seminoma cells with a distinct cell membrane and large nuclei containing prominent nucleoli\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】CD117(c-Kit) immunohistochemical stain that showing strong membranous positivity in seminoma cells\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Malignant tumors in the testis are rare. They include GCTs (seminoma and non-seminomatous-type tumors), which account for 90–95% of all primary testicular tumors, and sex cord-stromal tumors (Leydig cell, Sertoli cell, and gonadoblastoma) \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】Classic testicular seminoma and non-seminoma tumors are not common in patients older than 60 years, while spermatocytic seminoma, malignant Leydig cell tumors and lymphomas, in addition to paratesticular sarcomas are more common among elderly patients \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【28】The oldest case in the literature is a 92-year-old patient with classic seminoma \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【29】Consequently, our patient is considered the second-oldest age in the literature, demonstrating that there is no age limit for this type of malignancy.\n\n【30】The patient often presents with a painless, slow-growing enlargement. Acute pain in the testis is noticed in about 10% of all cases and may be due to intratesticular hemorrhage or infraction, and in most cases a testicular mass is noticed. The mass is hard and the skin should be easily separable from it and testicular tumor may be accompanied by or covered with a hydrocele \\[ 7 , 10 \\].\n\n【31】Transillumination of the scrotum should be performed to distinguish between them and palpation of the abdomen may reveal a bulky retroperitoneal mass. Examination of supraclavicular, inguinal, and scalene nodes should be done also to detect any enlargement \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【32】Serum AFP levels are not significantly elevated in patients with seminoma; one study reported very modest elevations in AFP levels in patients with histologically pure seminomas who had a typical clinical course. Serum hCG is often increased in the 10–20% of tumors with admixed syncytiotrophoblast cells. These levels are usually not in excess of 1000 mL U/mL, although one very large seminoma with abundant syncytiotrophoblasts had an associated hCG level of 4000 mL U/mL. Serum LDH is increased in about 80% of patients with advanced-stage disease \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【33】Scrotal ultrasonography should be performed rapidly to assess for testicular tumor and to distinguish it from epididymal pathology. This technique may help to check for testicular tumor in the presence of a hydrocele \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【34】CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis are used to assess for metastatic disease, especially in the lungs and retroperitoneum \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【35】Seminoma is very radiosensitive and most of stage II seminomas are cured with radical orchiectomy and radiotherapy for retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while patients with advanced seminoma should receive primary chemotherapy. Seminomas are sensitive to platinum-based courses and 90% of patients with advanced disease respond to chemotherapy. Most of the residual retroperitoneal masses following chemotherapy are often fibrosis \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【36】A positron emission tomography scan should be performed in a patient with a residual mass and, if positive, surgical resection is warranted \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【37】In general, testicular tumors should be regularly followed up every 6 months for the first 3 years. During the follow-up, a careful examination of the other testis, the abdomen, and lymph nodes should be done and laboratory investigations, including AFP, hCG, and LDH levels, carried out.\n\n【38】Chest X-ray and an abdominopelvic CT scan are used less frequently to detect the risk of relapse in the retroperitoneum \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【39】We describe in this case report the second-oldest patient (at 90 years old) diagnosed with classic seminoma in the medical literature. Therefore, classic seminoma could present at any age and should be considered as a differential diagnosis for any painless mass in the scrotum.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】The datasets used and/or analyzed in the current study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】AFP:\n\n【44】Alpha fetoprotein\n\n【45】βhCG:\n\n【46】Beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin\n\n【47】CT:\n\n【48】Computed tomography\n\n【49】GCT:\n\n【50】Germ cell tumor\n\n【51】LDH:\n\n【52】Lactate dehydrogenase\n\n【53】NGCT:\n\n【54】Non-germ cells tumor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Upon detection of the injured cell content, mast cells then tailor the release of preformed and newly produced chemical mediators to the detected challenge, via an array of pathogen receptors. In addition to immunoglobulin E receptor-triggered mast cell activation, commonly referred to as allergic or atopic disorders, non-immunoglobulin E receptor mediated mast cell activation follows engagement of toll-like receptors, immunoglobulin G receptors, and complement receptors. Upon containment of the extrinsic challenge, acute inflammation is downregulated, and repair of the injured tissue ensues. The mast cell compartments must return to a baseline steady state to remain tolerant towards self-antigens and harmless entities, including environmental conditions, to prevent unnecessary immune activation and chronic hypersensitivity disorders. Over the past 50 years, an increasing number of patients are experiencing episodes of aberrant mast cell activation, not associated with allergen-specific mast cell disease or systemic mastocytosis. This led to proposed diagnostic criteria of mast cell activation syndrome. Mast cell activation syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, defined by a combination of (1) recurrent symptoms typical of mast cell activation, (2) an increase of validated mast cell derived mediators, and (3) response to treatment with mast cell stabilizing or mast cell mediator-targeted therapies. Onset of mast cell activation syndrome ostensibly reflects the loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment to nonthreatening entities and nonhazardous environmental conditions. The etiology of chronic mast cell dysregulation and associated intolerance to self-antigens or harmless entities is not well understood, but a growing number of studies point to exposure of the epithelial borders, which leads to inappropriate or excessive mast cell activation or impaired resolution of acute inflammation following neutralization of the identified pathogen.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Here we present a case of adult onset mast cell activation syndrome following scombroid poisoning. Scombroid toxicity is usually a self-limited illness, but there are individuals who have been shown to have severe symptoms or persistent illness following histamine fish poisoning. We describe a 74-year-old Caucasian woman, with a history of drug-induced urticaria, who developed a constellation of hypersensitivity illnesses consistent with the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome after ingestion of tainted fish.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Mast cell activation disease causes problems of increased complexity in children and adults. The increased prevalence and severity of mast cell activation disease has been attributed to dramatic changes in our lifestyles and modern living environments. These changes likely impact the integrity of the epithelial barriers, leading to loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment. Here, we present a case of a nonatopic, 74-year-old female who developed mast cell activation disease after exposure to a potent environmental toxin. Mast cell activation disease commonly involves several organ systems, with patients often referred to a succession of different specialists. This results in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal care. Instead, early recognition of mast cell activation disease would lead to better outcomes. We review the literature, describing the diagnostic criteria for mast cell activation disorders that can improve recognition of this multiorgan system syndrome. Further research is needed into the interaction of epithelial barrier disruption and the dysregulation of the immune system.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Case report\n-----------\n\n【9】### Background\n\n【10】Mast cells are closely associated with epithelium, serving as sentinels responsible for the recognition of tissue injury and coordination of the initial inflammatory response. Upon detection of the injured cell content, mast cells then tailor the release of preformed and newly produced chemical mediators to the detected challenge, via an array of pathogen receptors. In addition to immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor-triggered mast cell activation (MCA), commonly referred to allergic or atopic disorders, non-IgE mediated mast cell activation follows engagement of toll-like receptors (TLRs), immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptors, and complement receptors. Upon containment of the extrinsic challenge, acute inflammation is downregulated, and repair of the injured tissue ensues. The mast cell compartments must return to a baseline steady state, to remain tolerant towards self-antigens and harmless entities, including environmental conditions, to prevent unnecessary immune activation and chronic hypersensitivity disorders.\n\n【11】Over the past 50 years, an increasing number of patients are experiencing episodes of aberrant mast cell activation, not associated with allergen specific mast cell disease or systemic mastocytosis. This led to proposed diagnostic criteria of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). MCAS is a heterogeneous disorder, defined by a combination of (1) recurrent symptoms typical of MCA, (2) an increase of validated mast cell-derived mediators, and (3) response to treatment with mast cell stabilizing or MC mediator-targeted therapies. Onset of MCAS ostensibly reflects the loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment to nonthreatening entities and nonhazardous environmental conditions. The etiology of chronic mast cell dysregulation and associated intolerance to self-antigens or harmless entities is not well understood, but a growing number of studies point to exposure of the epithelial borders, which leads to inappropriate or excessive mast cell activation or impaired resolution of acute inflammation following neutralization of the identified pathogen.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 74-year-old Caucasian woman, with a past medical history of arrhythmia, breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy, an acoustic neuroma, menopause, hypothyroidism, and chronic musculoskeletal complaints, presented to the emergency department (ED) with intense redness of her face and hands, burning sensation involving her face and neck, palpitations, a “pounding headache,” difficulty breathing, dysphagia, and a rapid heart rate. Her illness began shortly after eating a tuna burger from a local fish market. She denied previous incidents of food intolerance or anaphylaxis. In the past, the patient had only used prescription or over-the-counter antihistamines for drug induced urticaria, opiate pain relievers, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both pain relievers had been avoided for years.\n\n【14】Upon arrival in the ED, her vital signs were body temperature of 97.0 °F (36.1 °C), pulse of 120 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg, oxygen concentration of 99% on room air, and a respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute. She also reported chest pain, with a level of 5/10. On physical examination, she was found to have an erythematous facial rash and complained of diffuse itching. The patient was administered prednisone 60 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg, with relief of her headache, rash, chest pain, and pruritis. In addition, an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, at 107 bpm, and she was ultimately diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia. No other laboratory tests were ordered. Two samples of the tuna steak were obtained from the local fish market, which sickened four adults with scombrotoxinism. The samples contained histamine levels of 500 ppm and 4850 ppm, both greater than the threshold of less than 50 ppm deemed nontoxic by federal regulation. Since both the patient and her husband exhibited allergic-like reactions to the tuna burger, scombroid poisoning was suspected.\n\n【15】Unlike her husband, who was treated and recovered from this episode of scombrotoxinism, the patient experienced persistent urticaria and angioedema, with the diagnosis of new onset dermatographism, following completion of the 5-day course of oral prednisone and diphenhydramine from the initial ED visit. Despite the use topical corticosteroids and daily levocetirizine 5 mg, loratadine 40 mg, and fexofenadine 180 mg, the patient experienced daily symptoms, for the next 6 weeks. The patient returned to the local emergency department for persistent facial swelling and difficulty swallowing following ingestion of crab cakes for dinner, which had been tolerated in the past. The patient reported difficulty swallowing, sensation of food getting stuck, increased throat clearing, and nasal congestion, as well as numbness and tingling of the tongue, lips, and throat. In the local ED, the patient was found to have a body temperature of 98.2 °F (36.8 °C), a pulse of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 140/65 mmHg, oxygen concentration of 98% on room air, and a respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute. On physical examination, an erythematous facial rash was reported, and the patient was evaluated by an otolaryngologist in the ED, given new onset dysphagia. The otolaryngologist reported erythema of the laryngeal mucosa. The patient was discharged with a course of famotidine 20 mg, prednisone 40 mg, and diphenhydramine 25 mg.\n\n【16】Following this visit to the ED, the patient underwent an evaluation by a local allergy specialist. Recurrent urticaria was noted, and laboratory tests revealed the following: total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) of 16 IU/mL; total complement level within normal limits; undetectable serum IgE for insect venoms, tuna, and crab; undetectable autoantibodies to nuclear antigen (ANA); a negative recommended avoidance of all seafood.\n\n【17】The patient sought another opinion with our practice, regarding chronic urticaria and new onset shellfish allergy, 1 month after her last ED visit and 6 months after scombroid poisoning. She had continued her regimen of thrice daily histamine receptor-1 blockade and famotidine 20 mg twice daily. In addition to the recurrent flushing, rhinitis complaints, dyspepsia, and episodic dysphagia, the patient cited chest tightness at rest, in the evening, and on exertion. Spirometry revealed an obstructive pattern consistent with reversible airway disease, which exhibited a modest improvement following administration of levalbuterol 0.63 mg/3 mL. Another set of laboratory tests were ordered, with the following results: serum tryptase of 4.8 and a serum IgE 17 IU/mL, which were comparable to previous results, but a plasma histamine level of 13 nmol/L was detected (normal range 0–8 nmol/L) (Table 1 ).\n\n【18】**Table 1 Results of serial testing of tryptase and histamine between 2014 and 2015**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】The patient maintained a limited diet, given her history of new onset shellfish allergy, and carried an epinephrine autoinjector and a short-acting beta agonist inhaler for the anaphylaxis and asthma, respectively. The patient opted for treatment with omalizumab for chronic urticaria, and was prescribed 300 mg, administered every 4 weeks, since she was still symptomatic despite thrice daily antihistamines, twice daily leukotriene modifiers, and oral and inhaled cromolyn preparations.\n\n【21】Following her first dose of omalizumab, the patient complained of increased pruritis, flushing, and chest tightness, prompting another ED visit. The patient required epinephrine administration for a grade two, drug-induced anaphylactic event. Following another course of oral corticosteroids and diphenhydramine, the patient underwent a graded challenge to omalizumab. Over a 3-month period, omalizumab 150 mg, administered every 2 weeks, was successfully reintroduced \\[1\\] . As recently reported, the addition of omalizumab, is the standard care for patients with MCAS.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of MCAS in this patient, following scombroid poisoning, is supported by detection of increased mast cell derived mediators. Following anaphylaxis, to crab meat and then to the first administration of omalizumab, we tested for validated markers of mast cell activation within a few hours of each suspected MCA event (Table 1 ). An elevated serum histamine level was detected following ingestion of crab meat and her first omalizumab administration. After her third episode of anaphylaxis, serum histamine returned to baseline, but serum tryptase also reduced to 2.2 μg/mL from her previous recorded values, which ranged from 4.8 to 5.2 μg/mL. Along with the constellation of recurrent symptoms of mast cell activation, including chronic urticaria, asthma, and susceptibility to anaphylaxis, and a partial response to histamine and leukotriene blockade, the detection of an elevated plasma level following episodes of anaphylaxis, and a reduction of serum tryptase of greater than 2 μg/mL and > 20%, led to the diagnosis of nonclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) (Table 2 ).\n\n【23】**Table 2 Proposed criteria for mast cell activation syndrome (all three criteria must be present) (Akin, 2017)**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Upon reaching the maintenance dose of omalizumab 150 mg, every 2 weeks, the patient was able to expand her diet and reduce her daily medical regimen to control her asthmatic condition and chronic spontaneous urticaria. In addition to omalizumab, the patient is maintained on daily levocetirizine, chlorpheniramine, zafirlukast, and famotidine. Moreover, under ongoing treatment her quality of life was improved, including less disrupted sleep, resumption of outdoor exercise, reintroduction of food stuffs, except seafood, and less frequent urticarial outbreaks.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Over the past 50 years, there has been a rise in classic mast cell activation disorders, such as rhinitis, food hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, urticaria, and asthma, as well as less well known MCAD, such as neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal syndromes. A growing number of pediatric and adult patients are experiencing recurrent episodes of MCA, not associated with allergen-specific mast cell activation disease or systemic mastocytosis. This led to proposed diagnostic criteria of mast cell activation syndrome, which includes the following: (1) systemic mast cell activation involving two or more organ systems, in parallel; (2) an increase in validated mast cell markers during symptomatic episodes; and (3) having a major response to medications that block MCA or inhibit the action of MC-derived mediators (Table 2 ). The diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is appropriate, when all three criteria are met \\[2 , 3\\] .\n\n【28】Mechanisms contributing to rise of mast cell activation disorders, including MCAS, have not been established. Studies have implicated environmental exposures from modern living leading to excessive mast cell-initiated acute inflammation, or impaired resolution of inflammation following neutralization of the offending agent. This case report demonstrates the onset of MCAS in a 74-year-old woman following exposure to scombrotoxin.\n\n【29】Scombroid poisoning, or histamine fish poisoning, is a toxic event with symptoms and treatment that mimic anaphylaxis. Scombroid poisoning results from consumption of mishandled fish. Histamine and other decomposition products are generated in time-temperature abused raw fish by bacterial, enzymatic conversion of free histidine. The onset of scombroid poisoning is typically from 10 minutes to 1 hour following consumption of poisonous fish. The symptoms are variable and include peppery or metallic taste, oral numbness, headache, dizziness, palpitations, rapid and weak pulse (low blood pressure), difficulty in swallowing, and thirst. Scombroid poisoning often mimics allergen-specific IgE-triggered mast cell activation, with symptoms such as hives, rash, flushing, facial swelling, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Less specific symptoms such as anxiety are less frequently observed \\[4\\] .\n\n【30】Recovery is usually complete within 24 hours, but in rare cases can last for days. For example, serious cardiovascular compromise and respiratory complications have been observed, and in a few unusual cases, hospitalization, including treatment for anaphylaxis \\[5 , 6\\] . There are two reports of patients developing chronic mast cell activation disorders following scombroid poisoning: after ingesting decomposed tuna, a 21-year-old woman, with a history of intermittent asthma, developed poorly controlled asthma, requiring multiple ED visits and five daily medications to control new onset, severe persistent asthma. Another woman, without a history of MCADs, was diagnosed with adult-onset rhinitis and asthma following scombroid poisoning \\[7 , 8\\] .\n\n【31】Scombroid poisoning is associated with elevated histamine levels in the outbreak-associated samples. However, there is not a clear dose-response relationship between oral administration of histamine and the magnitude of toxicity associated with scombroid poisoning \\[5\\] . Interestingly, several studies point to the impact of “histamine releasing factors” on the epithelium and closely associated mast cells, by enteric, gram-negative bacteria found in the fish cutis and intestines. These include _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella_ species, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , and _Morganella morganii_ \\[4\\] . As reported in animal models of anaphylaxis and asthma, loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment can be induced by exposure to chemical adjuvants and microbial-derived substances, such as aluminum hydroxide and lipopolysaccharides, respectively 9 , 10 , 11\\] . Combined with signals of tissue injury, called alarmins or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the microbial-derived substances are potent stimulants of mast cell activation.\n\n【32】With this patient, the reportedly high levels of histamine detected in the two samples of tuna from this seafood market greatly exceeded the level of histamine deemed toxic by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more than 50 mg/100 g of tuna (50 ppm). Such high levels of histamine ostensibly reflect the burden of scombrotoxins, which in turn induced epithelial damage and delivered large quantities of histamine to the poisoned diners of the tainted fish. That is, the combination of histamine and histamine release factors, scombrotoxins, may have either severely disrupted the epithelium border and consequently caused a pronounced MCA event, or interfered with the processes that resolve inflammation after the acute insult has been neutralized. Three of the four adults with scombroid poisoning made a full recovery within 24 hours with conservative medical management. In contrast, our patient, with a distant history of drug-induced urticaria, required daily medication for adult-onset spontaneous inducible urticaria/angioedema, hypersensitivity gastroenteritis, and moderate persistent asthma, starting in the seventh decade of life. In addition to diet restriction, including avoidance of seafood, gluten, cow’s milk, soybean, and nuts, she must carry an epinephrine autoinjector and short-acting beta agonist inhaler given her history of anaphylaxis and intrinsic asthma exacerbations, following scombroid poisoning \\[12\\] .\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】In summary, we describe the clinical presentation of a presentation of MCAS following scombroid poisoning. The diagnosis is appropriate given her combination of (1) typical symptoms, (2) laboratory abnormalities, and (3) response to treatment. Following scombroid poisoning, adult-onset chronic urticaria/angioedema evolved into susceptibility of anaphylaxis, chronic hypersensitivity gastroenteritis, and moderate persistent asthma. Symptomatic episodes were associated with an elevation in validated mast cell markers, both serum tryptase and histamine, and her symptoms came under better control with the addition of omalizumab, the anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, to her daily regimen of cromolyn antihistamines and leukotriene blockade. Despite the rise of immediate hypersensitivity disorders, it is not uncommon for MCAS to be diagnosed late, as observed with our patient. This leads to delayed recommendations for more effective treatment prescriptions of medications, with adverse effects; both of which may contribute to progressive disease. As recently described, the greatest hurdle to diagnosis and management of MCAS is to correctly attribute appropriate symptoms to this disorder, and timely measurement of validated mast cell activation markers. The latter will differentiate MC activation disorders from other syndromes with overlapping symptomology \\[12 , 13\\] . This case also provides insight into potential etiologies and risk factors for development of MCAS.\n\n【35】Mast cell dysregulation can be due to a mutation affecting homeostasis of the mast cell compartment, clonal MCAS (mastocytosis, hyper alpha tryptasemia), or extrinsic factors driving aberrant MCA. Although the etiology of this newly recognized hypersensitivity syndrome is unknown, the course of events leading to adult-onset MCAS in this patient points to the disruption of the epithelial barrier by scombrotoxins. This, in turn, disrupted the tight regulation of this tissue-based, innate immune cell population, and increased susceptibility to mast cell activation events. Animal models and epidemiological studies support this theory of recurrent or severe injury to the epithelium in susceptible children and adults leading to development of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity syndromes: disruption of the epithelial barrier leads to loss of regulation of the mast cell compartment. This, in turn, leads to increased susceptibility of unnecessary inflammation, from impaired barrier function, and implicates the use of therapeutics targeting epithelial–mast cell interactions in preservation or restoration of immune homeostasis \\[10 , 14\\] .\n\n【36】Availability of data and material\n---------------------------------\n\n【37】The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】MC:\n\n【40】Mast cells\n\n【41】MCAS:\n\n【42】Mast cell activation syndrome\n\n【43】TLR:\n\n【44】Toll-like receptors\n\n【45】IgR:\n\n【46】Immunoglobulin receptors\n\n【47】CR:\n\n【48】Complement receptors\n\n【49】ARDS:\n\n【50】Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【51】PAMPs:\n\n【52】Pathogen associated molecular pattern\n\n【53】POTS:\n\n【54】Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome\n\n【55】hEDS:\n\n【56】Hypermobile type Ehlers–Danlos syndrome\n\n【57】PID:\n\n【58】Primary immunodeficiency\n\n【59】ACE2:\n\n【60】Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n\n【61】DAMPs:\n\n【62】Damage-associated molecular patterns", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Because the hypotony maculopathy in both patients did not resolve after conservative treatment, ciliary body suturing was performed. Briefly, a 25-gauge trocar intraocular irrigation needle for vitrectomy was inserted into the vitreous cavity of the injured eye. A lamellar scleral flap was then made, and an incision was created on the sclera while maintaining intraocular pressure. Next, the detached ciliary body was sutured to the sclera under direct vision. The intraocular fluid at the site of cyclodialysis was then rapidly drained from the scleral wound because of elevated intraocular pressure in the vitreous cavity, and the ciliary body was visually recognized through the scleral wound under direct vision, thus allowing a stable suture fixation of the ciliary body to the sclera. Postoperatively, the treated eye in both cases showed improvement of intraocular pressure and visual function.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The surgical method described in this report was found to be effective for draining intraocular fluid at the site of cyclodialysis and for performing a stable suture fixation of the ciliary body to the sclera through the scleral wound under direct vision, and it should be considered advantageous for avoiding intraoperative bleeding and suturing in a blinded manner.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The current surgical treatments for cyclodialysis include ciliary body suturing \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\], cyclocryotherapy \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\], laser photocoagulation \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\], encircling \\[ 11 , 12 \\], intraocular lens (IOL) suture fixation \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\], and vitreous surgery \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\]. Although there are numerous surgical procedures available, each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages. We report two cases of blunt force trauma–related cyclodialysis and resultant hypotony maculopathy that were successfully treated via suturing of the ciliary body to the sclera with a 25-gauge trocar for vitrectomy using intraocular irrigation under direct vision.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Patient 1\n\n【12】An 17-year-old Japanese boy presented with a periorbital hematoma and the development of an anterior chamber hemorrhage in his right eye that had developed after he was hit with a softball 2 months earlier. Thereafter, the anterior chamber hemorrhage resolved; yet, decreased vision and decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) persisted. His past medical history was unremarkable, and fundoscopic examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed hypotony maculopathy. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) of the anterior segment (AS) revealed cyclodialysis, which was surgically treated at 5 months after the patient’s injury. Prior to surgery, the visual acuity (VA) and IOP in the patient’s right eye was 0.04 (0.15 × S-4.50 C − 3.50 Ax 5 degrees) and 4 mmHg, respectively. AS-OCT examination revealed a shallow anterior chamber, a macular fold in the fundus, papilledema, and retinal vessel dilation, and UBM imaging revealed cyclodialysis from the upper to temporal regions and in the lower areas (Fig. 1 a–c). For treatment, a 25-gauge trocar intraocular irrigation needle was inserted into the lower nasal side of the right eye. Next, and after confirming that the tip of the needle was correctly inserted into the vitreous cavity, irrigation fluid was injected into the eye at the pressure of 20 mmHg. After preparing a lamellar scleral flap in the 6- and 12-o’clock directions, three incisions were made on the sclera under the scleral flap, and the intraocular fluid at the site of the cyclodialysis was easily drained due to the elevated pressure at the intraocular irrigation port, by which the ciliary body was visually recognized through the scleral wound under direct vision. Next, diathermy coagulation was performed under the scleral flap, and the ciliary body was securely fixed to the sclera using a 10-0 nylon suture under direct vision (Fig. 2 a–c). Intraoperatively, there was no bleeding from the suture site, and the lamellar scleral flap was then closed to complete the surgery. After surgery, the VA and IOP in his right eye improved to (1.0 × S -3.00 = C − 1.25 Ax 180 degrees) and 13 mmHg, respectively, with good visual function. Moreover, UBM examination revealed that the cyclodialysis had resolved and that the initial fundoscopy findings had improved (Fig. 3 a–c).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Preoperative fundoscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) images in patient 1. **a** Fundoscopic image showing macular fold, papilledema, and retinal vessel dilatation. **b** and **c** UBM images showing cyclodialysis from the upper region to the temporal region and in the lower areas\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Intraoperative findings in patient 1.

His past medical history was unremarkable, and upon initial examination, the VA and IOP in his right eye were 30 cm/vision (i.e., counting fingers; noncorrigent uncorrected) and 4 mmHg, respectively. AS-OCT examination revealed subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal stromal and epithelial edema with Descemet membrane folds, hemorrhage in the anterior chamber, traumatic mydriasis and cataract, phacodonesis, and a mild vitreous hemorrhage. Although ultrasound B-mode imaging showed no retinal detachment, UBM imaging revealed circumferential cyclodialysis (Fig. 4 a–e). Moreover, although the anterior chamber hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage gradually disappeared, there was a persistent decreased of IOP. At 1 month after injury, the patient underwent vitrectomy, lensectomy, IOL transscleral sulcus fixation, and ciliary body suturing in his left eye. Briefly, a 25-gauge trocar intraocular irrigation needle was inserted, and after confirmation that the tip of the needle was correctly inserted into the vitreous cavity, irrigation fluid was injected into the eye at the pressure of 20 mmHg. Next, pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy were performed, and fundoscopic examination showed hypotony maculopathy. Thus, transscleral sulcus fixation of the IOL was then performed. In addition, the pupil was adjusted by suture tightening using a 10-0 PROLENE suture (Ethicon/J&J Medical Devices, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) in the upper and lower parts for the treatment of traumatic mydriasis. A lamellar scleral flap was then made in the lower and upper regions, and an incision was made on the sclera. As in patient 1, the intraocular fluid at the site of cyclodialysis was drained from the incision site, and, when within range, the ciliary body was fixed to the sclera using 10-0 nylon suture under direct vision (Fig. 5 a–c). Intraoperatively, there was no bleeding from the suture site, and at 2 months after surgery, the VA and IOP in his left eye had improved to (0.6 × S + 2.75 = C-2.00 Ax 50 degrees) and 12 mmHg, respectively, with good visual function. Moreover, UBM imaging revealed that the cyclodialysis had nearly resolved and that the initial fundoscopic findings had improved (Fig. 6 a–e).\n\n【27】**Fig. 4**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Preoperative slit-lamp and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) images in patient 2. **a** Fundoscopic image showing anterior chamber hemorrhage, traumatic mydriasis, traumatic cataract, and phacodonesis. **b–e** UBM images showing circumferential cyclodialysis\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】Intraoperative findings in patient 2.

In such cases, the ciliary body is separated from the sclera, which reduces aqueous production and allows the flow of aqueous humor through the cleft into the suprachoroidal space, thus leading to a reduction of IOP. Cyclodialysis can cause hypotony maculopathy (including a macular fold), dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, and papilledema, and it can also lead to irreversible vision loss if allowed to persist over a long-term period \\[ 1 \\]. Although conservative treatment alone can sometimes result in improvement of the decreased IOP and the hypotony maculopathy can spontaneously resolve, surgical treatment is required for patients with long-lasting symptoms.\n\n【41】As described above, the current surgical treatments for cyclodialysis include ciliary body suturing \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\], cyclocryotherapy \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 22 \\], laser photocoagulation \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\], encircling \\[ 11 , 12 \\], IOL suture fixation \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\], and vitreous surgery \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\]. Cyclocryotherapy and laser photocoagulation are performed to close the cyclodialysis cleft via the creation of an adhesion between the ciliary body and the sclera. However, because the sclera is the tissue that contains less pigment, the adhesion created by the coagulation procedure may be unsatisfactory. Thus, suturing of the ciliary body is generally considered to be a more effective method of obtaining a secure adhesion, even though the procedure is invasive and can possibly result in bleeding from the ciliary body due to the suturing being performed in a blinded manner.\n\n【42】In the surgical method used for the two cases described in this report, a trocar tip for vitrectomy is inserted into the vitreous cavity in order to maintain the intraoperative IOP, and this procedure provided the following three advantages. First, the intraocular fluid at the site of the cyclodialysis was easily drained from the scleral wound due to the IOP being well maintained during the scleral incision. Second, because the separated ciliary body advancing toward the sclera could be visually observed under direct vision, it was possible to perform a stable 10-0 nylon suturing of the ciliary body to the advancing sclera. Third, because the IOP was well maintained intraoperatively, the risk of bleeding from the ciliary body during suturing was reduced.\n\n【43】However, it should be noted that the surgical procedure does have some disadvantages. Those include a slightly longer time being required to create the lamellar scleral flap, as well as the incarceration of the ciliary body into the scleral wound that occurs when the intraocular irrigation pressure is set at a higher level or when the scleral incisional wound is large. Moreover, the insertion of the 25-gauge trocar tip into the vitreous cavity may be difficult in cases of severe cyclodialysis. However, in such cases, tilting of the eyeball can resolve the problem because it helps to confirm the position of the transpupillary tip. For optimal results, we consider that the specific site of the trocar placement should be selected from the area in which the preoperative UBM findings indicate that the cyclodialysis is mild.\n\n【44】Previous studies have reported the effectiveness of other surgical methods for the treatment of cyclodialysis, such as compression of the detached ciliary body with a loop of the IOL or capsular tension ring, and IOL ciliary sulcus suture fixation, a method involving direct suturing of the ciliary body to the sclera \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\]. In patient 2, the combined use of IOL ciliary sulcus suture fixation allowed us to fix the detached ciliary body to the sclera in the nasal and temporal sides, thus allowing us to create a lamellar scleral flap only in the upper and lower parts. In the future, we theorize that a combination of these surgical procedures will improve the outcomes of ciliary body suturing.\n\n【45】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【46】The surgical method used in the present study was found to be effective for draining the intraocular fluid at the site of the cyclodialysis and for performing a stable suture fixation of the ciliary body to the sclera through the scleral wound under direct vision.\n\n【47】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【48】AS:\n\n【49】Anterior segment\n\n【50】IOL:\n\n【51】Intraocular lens\n\n【52】IOP:\n\n【53】Intraocular pressure\n\n【54】OCT:\n\n【55】Optical coherence tomography\n\n【56】UBM:\n\n【57】Ultrasound biomicroscopy\n\n【58】VA:\n\n【59】Visual acuity", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Human infestations are predominantly seen in developing countries where the disease is endemic, but, due to the increase in international travel rates, hepatic fascioliasis is also appearing in nonendemic areas including Europe and the USA. The clinical and laboratory findings are usually nonspecific. Cross-sectional imaging can be very helpful in the diagnosis of fascioliasis as well as to differentiate it from other liver diseases with a very similar clinical picture. The objectives of this case report are to discuss imaging findings of hepatic fascioliasis and to review the literature.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 35-year-old Iranian patient who presented with right upper quadrant pain, low-grade fever, fatigue, and anorexia. The patient had a history of recent travel to the Gilan Province of Iran, almost a month before the onset of symptoms, which is an endemic area of fascioliasis in the country. Laboratory examinations revealed eosinophilia, elevated hepatic enzymes, and slightly raised C-reactive protein. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the patient shows clusters of focal ill-defined hypodense lesions with mild peripheral enhancement in the right liver lobe and subcapsular regions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver revealed multiple ill-defined lesions of low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and high signal intensity on the T2-weighted image, extending from the liver capsule into deeper parenchyma toward periportal regions, which shows mild peripheral enhancement on post-contrast images. Imaging-based diagnosis of fascioliasis was made depending on the characteristic distribution of subcapsular tracts/lesions on the above-mentioned imaging, which was then confirmed by serologic tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The patient was treated with triclabendazole, showing great clinical improvement, and was eventually discharged in good health condition.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The imaging findings in this case report highlight the importance of cross-sectional imaging for further evaluation of suspected cases of fluke-induced liver disease. The hypothesis of hepatic fascioliasis should be always considered when consistent radiological findings are observed. Clusters of tortuous subcapsular lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement extending into deeper liver parenchyma are characteristic imaging findings that strongly suggest hepatic fascioliasis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Fascioliasis is a food-borne hepatobiliary zoonosis caused by _Fasciola hepatica_ and _Fasciola gigantica_ . Humans ingest infected watercress or contaminated water with encysted larvae (metacercariae), which excyst in the stomach/duodenum, migrate through the intestinal wall to the peritoneal cavity, and then penetrate the Glisson capsule to enter the liver and eventually the bile ducts \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The clinical course of fascioliasis consists of two phases: the hepatic parenchymal phase and the ductal phase. The hepatic parenchymal phase usually lasts for 2–4 months, in which immature larvae penetrate the Glisson capsule to invade the liver parenchyma, causing inflammation, abscess formation, hemorrhage, necrosis, granulation, and fibrosis. The ductal phase is characterized by the extension of larvae into the bile ducts where they mature (adult fluke) and start laying eggs that finally pass through the host’s feces. These flukes can survive in the biliary ducts for many years and may cause biliary inflammation and/or obstruction. Infestations in humans are predominantly seen in developing countries including Africa, South America, and North and South Asia (including China and Korea). Due to the increase in international travel rates, hepatic fascioliasis is also appearing in nonendemic areas including Europe and the USA. Misdiagnosis or late diagnosis is still frequently seen because the disease is rarely seen in nonendemic areas and its clinical picture is nonspecific. Clinicians may not be familiar with the presentation, contributing to delayed diagnosis and possible complications that eventually lead to unnecessary surgical interventions. The history of recent travel to the endemic area is very important and should always be considered when consistent radiological findings are observed. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary when appropriate clinical findings are present \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 \\]. The typical imaging findings in this reported case highlight the importance of cross-sectional imaging for further evaluation of suspected cases of fluke-induced liver disease.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 35-year-old Iranian patient presented to our hospital with a 4 weeks history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, low-grade fever, fatigue, and anorexia. At admission, her body temperature was 37.8 °C, and her vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure 122/78 mmHg, pulse rate 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute). On physical examination, mild RUQ tenderness and normal liver span were noticed. No abnormal findings were present on neurological examinations. The patient was a nonsmoker and did not consume alcohol. She was a literate and married woman but had no official duties and was a housewife. She had no history of previous surgery, chronic medical illness, or family/psychosocial history of any health-related conditions including congenital malformation. The patient was receiving no medication before admission to the hospital. The patient had a history of recent travel to the Gilan Province of Iran, almost a month before the onset of symptoms, which is an endemic area of fascioliasis in the country.\n\n【12】A complete blood count (CBC) was performed that revealed a total leukocyte count of 9300/mm <sup>3 </sup> with eosinophilia (eosinophils 15%, neutrophils 61%, lymphocytes 19%, monocytes 5%, and basophils 0%), red blood cell count of 4.2 million/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 279,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> . Laboratory examinations also revealed elevated hepatic enzymes (serum aspartate aminotransferase 76 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 295 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 223 IU/L), and slightly raised C-reactive protein 12 mg/L. Renal function tests and serum bilirubin were within normal limits. Abdomen/pelvis CT scan demonstrates clusters of focal ill-defined hypodense lesions in the right liver lobe and subcapsular regions. These clusters of hepatic lesions (abscess) show peripheral contrast enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), forming a tunnel-like tract from the entry site at the Glisson capsule deep to the liver parenchyma (tunnels and caves sign) (Fig. 1 a, b). No evidence of high-density foci within biliary duct lumen, ductal dilatation, or ductal wall thickening/hyperenhancement was present. Multiplanar dynamic liver MRI was also performed, which shows multiple ill-defined lesions of low signal intensity on T1-weighted image (T1WI) and high signal intensity on T2-weighted image (T2WI) in the right liver lobe, extending from the liver capsule to the deeper parenchyma toward periportal regions (Fig. 2 a–d). No bile duct dilatation or obvious low-signal filling defects within the biliary duct lumen were depicted. Contrast-enhanced T1WI shows multiple, round, clustered hypointense lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement in the liver (Fig. 3 a, b). These imaging findings were consistent with the hepatic parenchymal phase of the disease in which immature larvae penetrate the liver capsule and invade the liver parenchyma without obvious bile duct involvement. Imaging-based diagnosis of hepatic fascioliasis was made depending on the characteristic distribution of ill-defined subcapsular tracts/lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement extending toward deeper liver parenchyma and periportal regions. The diagnosis was confirmed by serologic tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For treatment, 500 mg (10 mg/kg) triclabendazole was orally administered in two doses given 12 hours apart. Bed rest, vitamin supplementation, and a protein-rich diet were also recommended. No surgical intervention was needed, and the patient was eventually discharged in good health condition. Sonographic follow-up was advised for the patient at 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals or until the lesions completely resolved.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**a** Axial contrast-enhanced CT-image demonstrating patchy areas of decreased attenuation migrating from the liver capsule into deeper parenchyma and periportal regions showing mild peripheral contrast enhancement (arrows). **b** Axial contrast-enhanced CT-image demonstrating clusters of hypodense lesions extending from the liver capsule into deeper parenchyma and periportal regions showing mild peripheral contrast enhancement (arrows)\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**a** Axial T1W MR image showing hypointense subcapsular lesions at the right lobe of the liver (arrows). **b** Coronal T1W MR image showing a hypointense lesion in the liver (arrow). **c** Axial T2W MR image showing hyperintense subcapsular/parenchymal lesions in the liver (arrows). **d** Coronal T2W MR image showing a hyperintense subcapsular lesion in the liver (arrow)\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**a** A contrast-enhanced axial T1W MR image showing multiple, round, clustered hypointense subcapsular/parenchymal lesions with mild peripheral contrast enhancement in the liver (arrows). **b** A contrast-enhanced coronal T1W MR image showing multiple, round, clustered hypointense subcapsular/parenchymal lesions with mild peripheral contrast enhancement in the liver (arrows)\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】In the present study, we report a confirmed case of hepatic fascioliasis in a young woman, presented with nonspecific clinical findings and a recent history of travel to an endemic area of fascioliasis. This case report highlights the importance of cross-sectional imaging in the diagnosis of hepatic fascioliasis as well as to differentiate it from other liver diseases with a very similar clinical and radiological picture. While travel history is most important, characteristic findings of tortuous subcapsular lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement, extending into deeper liver parenchyma on contrast-enhanced CT and MRI strongly suggest hepatic fascioliasis.\n\n【27】In the presence of an appropriate clinical setting, direct parasitological tests, indirect immunological tests, and cross-sectional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI are used for the diagnosis of hepatobiliary fascioliasis in humans \\[ 3 \\]. The diagnostic approach may be variable and depends on some factors, including the degree of suspicion, stage of the disease, and the resources and expertise available \\[ 9 \\]. In our case, we have both CT and MRI of the patient, which have a complementary role to each other, and their findings were highly suggestive of hepatic fascioliasis, confirmed by the ELISA test.\n\n【28】In a patient with fascioliasis, common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain, fever, weight loss, fatigue, pruritus, skin rashes, dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting. Fascioliasis may mimic several hepatobiliary disorders, especially metastatic liver disease. Misdiagnosis or late diagnosis is still frequent and may lead to unnecessary surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy and hepatic segmentectomy \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. Furthermore, delay in treatment may cause the patient to suffer long-standing biliary symptoms and face an increased risk of pigment gallstones. Appropriate imaging is important in differential diagnosis \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【29】The best diagnostic clue of hepatic fascioliasis on imaging is clusters of patchy ill-defined hypoenhancing lesions mostly in subcapsular regions that may progress toward deeper parenchyma and periportal areas. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary duct changes are best seen on sonography \\[ 8 \\]. Radiological findings of hepatobiliary involvement can be seen as parenchymal/ductal involvement in various imaging modalities as follows: during the parenchymal phase, CT may demonstrate hypodense nodular lesion(s) arising in the subcapsular area in the first weeks after ingestion of the metacercariae, progressing to tortuous clustered lesions by 6 weeks. These clusters of low-density hepatic lesions (abscess) show peripheral contrast enhancement on CECT, forming a tunnel-like tract from the entry site at the Glisson capsule deep to the liver parenchyma (tunnels and caves sign). During the ductal phase, high-density foci within the duct lumen represent trematodes, which are usually associated with ductal dilatation and periportal tracking, ductal wall thickening, and/or hyperenhancement. These ductal phase CT findings are usually seen 10 weeks postinfection. MRI of the liver may demonstrate low-signal T1WI and high-signal T2WI lesions with extension from the liver capsule into the deeper liver. T2WI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may demonstrate mild ductal dilatation with low-signal filling defects. MRI is better than CT because it can show the characteristic evolutionary pattern of disease that reflects its life cycle in the early parenchymal phase, even without the use of a contrast agent. Also, MRI may provide more details about the course of complications such as hemorrhagic lesions and abscess formation in fascioliasis. MRI can also detect more lesions relative to CT. Sonographic findings of hepatic fascioliasis are usually nonspecific. During the parenchymal phase, they include focal hypoechoic or anechoic liver lesions and diffuse involvement of the liver (heterogeneous echotexture). During the ductal phase, ultrasound typically shows ductal thickening, intrahepatic or common bile duct dilatation, and tortuousness due to the intraluminal parasites or the hemorrhage/inflammatory reaction they incite, and may even show mobile fluke within the dilated bile ducts or gallbladder \\[ 1 , 3 , 8 \\].\n\n【30】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be performed for both diagnosis and treatment of bile duct obstruction, which allows the detection and extraction of the motile fluke. ERCP findings include linear, elliptical, or rounded filling defects within a dilated biliary ducts or pancreatic duct \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【31】A summary of the literature regarding imaging findings of human hepatic fascioliasis is presented in Table 1 . The findings are almost identical to those in our case.\n\n【32】**Table 1 Review of the literature of imaging findings associated with hepatic fascioliasis**\n\n【33】Full size table\n\n【34】Differential diagnosis includes cholangitis and hepatitis, liver abscess, brucellosis, cholecystitis, biliary tract stones, and primary/secondary liver malignancies. Misdiagnosis of fascioliasis is frequent and may lead to unnecessary surgery. The hypothesis of hepatic fascioliasis should be always considered in an appropriate clinical setting when consistent radiological findings are found on cross-sectional imaging \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. A liver biopsy for tissue diagnosis is rarely performed, which typically reveals necrosis, acute and/or chronic inflammatory changes, debris, and occasionally small fragments of migrating larvae \\[ 9 \\]. The final diagnosis should be based on serological tests or visualization of eggs in endoscopically or percutaneously aspirated bile, liver tissue, or stool \\[ 7 \\]. Antihelminthic drugs are the primary treatment option. Patients who have a poor response to medications or those with evidence of bile duct obstruction and acute cholangitis may require endoscopic extraction of parasites or decompression/stenting of the biliary system. Gallbladder involvement generally requires cholecystectomy \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【35】The following ways can prevent getting infected with hepatic fascioliasis: (1) familiarity of the general public in the endemic areas or those who travel to these areas with this disease and its transmission methods; (2) avoiding consumption of raw wild aquatic plants, local vegetables, raw liver, freshwater fish, or shrimp from areas where _Clonorchis_ and _Opisthorchis_ infections occur, and give them enough heat before consumption; (3) washing vegetables, especially in endemic regions, with acid detergents and a solution of potassium permanganate \\[ 4 , 9 , 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】In general, the diagnosis of _Fasciola hepatica_ is particularly challenging in nonendemic areas, as clinical and laboratory findings are usually nonspecific. Cross-sectional imaging is usually performed to look for possible causes of these nonspecific findings. Clusters of tortuous subcapsular tracts/lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement extending into deeper parenchyma and periportal regions are characteristic findings on CT/MRI that strongly suggest hepatic fascioliasis. The hypothesis of hepatic fascioliasis should be always considered in an appropriate clinical setting when consistent radiological findings are observed.\n\n【38】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】Supporting data are available, and the corresponding author has the responsibility of access to the data.\n\n【40】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【41】CBC:\n\n【42】Complete blood count\n\n【43】CT:\n\n【44】Computed tomography\n\n【45】CECT:\n\n【46】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography\n\n【47】ELISA:\n\n【48】Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n\n【49】ERCP:\n\n【50】Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n\n【51】MRI:\n\n【52】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【53】MRCP:\n\n【54】Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography\n\n【55】RUQ:\n\n【56】Right upper quadrant\n\n【57】T1WI:\n\n【58】T1-weighted image\n\n【59】T2WI:\n\n【60】T2-weighted image", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Studies in these babies indicate that intravenous paracetamol is tolerated well, however studies on the efficacy of intravenous paracetamol are lacking. There are no pharmacokinetic data on the administration of multiple doses of paracetamol in preterm babies with a gestational age below 32 weeks.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a case series of nine Caucasian preterm babies, six boys and three girls, with a mean gestational age of 28.6 weeks (range 25.9 to 31.6 weeks). Case one, a girl with a gestational age of 25 weeks and six days, presented with necrotizing enterocolitis. In the second case, a female baby with a gestational age of 26 weeks and two days presented with hematoma. In case three, a female baby with a gestation of 26 weeks and one day developed intraventricular hemorrhage. In case four, a male baby with a gestational age of 31 weeks and four days presented with pain after vacuum delivery. Case five, a female baby born after a gestation of 29 weeks and six days presented with hematoma. In case six, a male baby with a gestation of 30 weeks and six days presented with hematoma. In case seven, a male baby, born with a gestational age of 30 weeks and six days, presented with caput succedaneum and hematoma. In case eight, a male baby, born after a gestation of 28 weeks and four days, developed abdominal distention. Case nine, a female baby, born with a gestational age of 27 weeks and three days presented with hematoma. These babies were treated with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg/kg every six hours. Serum concentrations and aspartate transaminase were determined after prolonged administration. Pain scores were assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Paracetamol serum concentrations ranged from 8 to 64 mg/L after eight to 12 doses of intravenous paracetamol. Adequate analgesia was obtained in seven babies. During paracetamol therapy the median serum level of aspartate transaminase was 20 U/L (range 12 to 186 U/L). This case series indicates that prolonged intravenous administration of paracetamol in preterm babies with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks is tolerated well in the first days after birth. However, in the absence of proper pharmacokinetic data in this age group we cannot advocate the use of paracetamol intravenously.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Pain management in newborns is limited by the availability of only a few analgesics. The use of opiates in newborns is limited because of potential clinical side effects. As an alternative to opiates, paracetamol is a well-known analgesic in children without significant side effects. There are only limited data on the use of paracetamol in the newborn. The first drafts of the evidence-based guideline regarding pain management in children of the Dutch Pediatric Society supported the intravenous administration of paracetamol (15 mg/kg every six hours) in babies. In advance of the guideline we introduced intravenous administration of paracetamol to preterm babies in our neonatal intensive care unit to reduce the use of opiates. As a safety precaution we determined serum levels of paracetamol and aspartate transaminase in babies with intravenous paracetamol.\n\n【10】After the release of the final version of the nationwide evidence-based guideline on pain assessment and management in children, it became clear that the guideline restricted intravenous administration of paracetamol to term babies after the first month \\[ 1 \\]. After the release of the final guideline we discontinued the local policy of intravenous administration of paracetamol in preterm babies. The Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee was informed afterwards and concluded that the presented data were obtained legally according the Dutch Law on Medical Research with Humans (WMO).\n\n【11】Though the case series of nine is achieved in an unusual manner, we consider the data on paracetamol levels in preterm babies below 32 weeks of gestation as relevant information for future clinical studies.\n\n【12】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【13】### Case one\n\n【14】A Caucasian female baby was admitted to our NICU after a gestation of 25 weeks and six days. Although delivery started in the hospital the one minute Apgar score is not available because no health care provider was present at the time of birth. Her five minute Apgar score was six and her birth weight was 890 grams (p50-75). During the third week of life she developed necrotizing enterocolitis grade one according to Bell's criteria. She received 15 mg/kg intravenous paracetamol every six hours, with a total of four doses. Co-medications were antibiotics and ranitidine. Pain score, as measured with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) decreased from 10 to eight (12 or more reflects moderate to severe pain). After 24 hours paracetamol was discontinued because of low PIPP scores. The paracetamol serum level determined four hours after the last dose was 24 mg/L.\n\n【15】### Case two\n\n【16】A Caucasian female baby, born with a gestational age of 26 weeks and two days, was admitted with respiratory failure to our NICU. She was intubated shortly after delivery. Apgar scores were one and five after one and five minutes respectively. Birth weight was 680 grams (p5-10). Because of hematoma she received 15 mg/kg intravenous paracetamol every six hours. Therapy was started four hours after birth. She received a total of six doses. Pain scores decreased from 10 to nine only. Co-medications were antibiotics and caffeine. The paracetamol serum level, which was determined three hours after the last dose, was 29 mg/L.\n\n【17】### Case three\n\n【18】A Caucasian female baby was admitted to our NICU after a gestation of 26 weeks and one day. Shortly after birth she developed respiratory failure and was intubated. Apgar scores were one and five after one and five minutes, respectively. Her birth weight was 800 grams (p25-50). She developed a grade three intra-ventricular hemorrhage for which morphine was started. Further co-medications were antibiotics. In an attempt to stop morphine, paracetamol was started, in a dose of 15 mg/kg every six hours. Pain scores were below six during morphine and remained so during paracetamol mono-therapy. She received six doses of paracetamol and the serum level was determined 20 hours after the last dose. The serum level was 12 mg/L.\n\n【19】### Case four\n\n【20】A Caucasian male baby, born with a gestational age of 31 weeks and four days, was admitted to our NICU after vacuum delivery. Apgar scores were eight and nine after one and five minutes, respectively. His birth weight was 1600 grams (p25-50). He received 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours for a total of eight doses. Pain scores decreased from 14 before start of therapy to nine during therapy. The paracetamol serum level was determined 10 hours after the last dose and was 25 mg/L.\n\n【21】### Case five\n\n【22】A Caucasian female baby, born after a gestation of 29 weeks and six days, was admitted with hematoma due to traumatic birth and breech delivery to our NICU. After birth she received cardiopulmonary resuscitation because of apnea and bradycardia. Apgar scores were one and six after one and five minutes, respectively. Her birth weight was 1300 grams (p25). She was diagnosed with hematoma and received 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours starting five hours after birth. She received a total of nine doses of paracetamol. One hour after the last dose her paracetamol serum level was 46 mg/L. Thirty hours later the serum level was determined again and was < 5 mg/L. Co-medications consisted of antibiotics and caffeine. Pain scores decreased from 16 before start of paracetamol to nine during therapy.\n\n【23】### Case six\n\n【24】A male Caucasian baby was admitted to our NICU after a gestation of 30 weeks and six days. Birth took place in a peripheral hospital and was complicated by breech presentation and forceps delivery. Apgar scores were two and seven after one and five minutes, respectively. Birth weight was 1480 grams (p25). In the first hours of life he developed respiratory failure and was intubated. The baby showed extensive hematoma for which 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours was started. He received a total of 10 doses. Three hours after the last dose his paracetamol serum level was 64 mg/L. Co-medications were antibiotics and caffeine. Pain scores decreased from 10 before therapy to six during therapy.\n\n【25】### Case seven\n\n【26】A Caucasian male baby, born with a gestational age of 30 weeks and six days, was admitted to our NICU after an uneventful preterm delivery. The Apgar scores were nine and 10 after one and five minutes, respectively. His birth weight was 1755 gram (p50-75). He was diagnosed with caput succedaneum and also had a small hematoma on one of the upper limbs. Due to high pain scores he received 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours starting two hours after birth. He received a total of 11 doses of paracetamol. His serum paracetamol level was 37 mg/L four hours after the last does. He received no co-medication. Pain scores decreased from 14 before start of paracetamol to seven during analgesic therapy.\n\n【27】### Case eight\n\n【28】A Caucasian male baby, born after a gestation of 28 weeks and four days, was admitted with respiratory failure due to respiratory distress syndrome to our NICU. Apgar scores were four and eight after one and five minutes, respectively. His birth weight was 860 grams (p25-50). He developed severe abdominal distention on the second day of life and received 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours for a total of 14 doses. There were no radiological signs of necrotizing enterocolitis and his condition improved over the next few days. Co-medications were antibiotics and caffeine. Five hours after the last dose his paracetamol serum level was 8 mg/L. Pain scores decreased from 14 before starting paracetamol to three during therapy.\n\n【29】### Case nine\n\n【30】A Caucasian female baby, born with a gestational age of 27 weeks and three days was admitted to our NICU after preterm rupture of membranes and an uncomplicated delivery. Apgar scores were six and nine after one and five minutes, respectively. Her birth weight was 990 gram (p50). Due to hematoma and subsequent high pain scores (14) she received 15 mg/kg of intravenous paracetamol every six hours. She received a total of 17 doses. Due to inadequate analgesic effect 10 μg/kg/hour morphine was started during paracetamol therapy. Her paracetamol serum level, determined seven hours after the last dose, was 61 mg/L.\n\n【31】Table 1 summarizes the clinical data of the nine babies.\n\n【32】**Table 1 Clinical data of the case series**\n\n【33】Full size table\n\n【34】Figure 1 shows the paracetamol serum concentrations of the nine babies, related to the number of doses. In seven babies the serum levels of paracetamol (the black dots) are < 50 mg/l (grey area), the upper margin value found by Palmer for babies > 32 weeks of gestation \\[ 2 \\]. The highest serum concentration (64 mg/l) was far below 150 mg/l (indicated by the dotted grey horizontal line), which has been reported as a toxic value in children \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【35】**Figure 1**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】**Paracetamol serum levels in relation to number of doses** . In seven babies the serum levels of paracetamol (the black dots) are < 50 mg/L (grey area), the upper margin value found by Palmer for babies > 32 weeks of gestation \\[ 2 \\]. The highest serum concentration (64 mg/L) was far below 150 mg/L (indicated by the dotted grey horizontal line), which has been reported as a toxic value in children \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】We administered intravenous paracetamol in a dose not supported by literature. The dose we used in preterm babies of less than 32 weeks gestation is being used in term babies, and is not a result of miscalculation due to the differences in formulations of propacetamol and paracetamol \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【41】Until now, most studies on intravenous paracetamol have been performed with propacetamol in preterm babies above 32 weeks of gestation. Propacetamol is a pro-drug of paracetamol and is hydrolyzed by plasma esterases after intravenous administration such that 1 g of propacetamol is hydrolyzed to 0.5 g of paracetamol \\[ 4 – 6 \\]. To our knowledge this is the first report of paracetamol concentration data in preterm babies below 32 weeks of gestation, in whom multiple dose intravenous paracetamol (Perfalgan <sup>® </sup> ) was administered for non-surgical analgesia in the first hours after birth.\n\n【42】This case series indicates that in preterm babies below 32 weeks intravenous paracetamol is tolerated well. In seven babies we found serum concentrations below 50 mg/l, the upper margin value reported by Palmer \\[ 2 \\]. In two subjects serum values were around 60 mg/l. During paracetamol therapy we found no indications for liver failure.\n\n【43】Although the therapeutic window for paracetamol in children is assumed to be 10-20 mg/l, there is no consensus on dosage regimens for intravenous administration of paracetamol in babies \\[ 7 \\]. Allegaert, using propacetamol, suggests a maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg every 12 hours for babies below 31 weeks gestational age after a loading dose of 30 mg/kg propacetamol \\[ 4 \\]. Using this dose, Allegaert was not able to show significant analgesic effect \\[ 5 \\]. However, with a maintenance dose of 12.5 mg/kg every six hours Allegaert showed analgesic effects \\[ 6 \\]. Autret suggests a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours after a loading dose of 15 mg/kg propacetamol in newborns for antipyretic effects \\[ 8 \\]. Autret did not study the analgesic effect. In term newborns, de la Pintière describes a maintenance dose of intravenous propacetamol of 120 mg/kg/day, equivalent to paracetamol 60 mg/kg/day \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【44】Limited data is available concerning the pharmacokinetics of propacetamol and paracetamol \\[ 2 , 5 , 6 , 10 \\]. Both Allegaert and Palmer found serum levels of paracetamol between < 6 and 50 mg/l, after a single dose of propacetamol and multiple doses of intravenous paracetamol, respectively. Note that Palmer included preterm babies above 32 weeks of gestation \\[ 2 \\]. In a letter to the editor, Bartocci _et al_ report their Stockholm experience of postoperative analgesia with intravenous morphine and paracetamol (maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg every eight hours) in newborns with a postconceptional age between 25 and 42 weeks \\[ 11 \\]. From the letter, however, it is unclear at what postnatal age paracetamol is given and no paracetamol concentration data are shown.\n\n【45】Several cases report accidentally given overdoses of propacetamol or paracetamol. Two doses of approximately 300 mg/kg propacetamol (equivalent to 150 mg/kg paracetamol) at a 6 hour interval given to a term baby, resulted in a serum level of 166 mg/l without signs or symptoms of liver failure \\[ 9 \\]. Two babies born prematurely after maternal overdose of paracetamol had serum concentrations of 76 and 260 mg/l respectively, without apparent adverse effects \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. A paracetamol overdose in a preterm baby resulted in a serum concentration of 121 mg/l \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【46】Recently, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd issued a letter with drug safety information concerning accidental overdose in 23 world wide cases. All were babies younger than one year, one of whom died. Scope of the letter was a raising concern on the possible confusion in prescribing ml/kg instead of mg/kg, leading to a tenfold overdose \\[ 15 \\]. The letter does not provide information on serum levels or liver functions in these cases.\n\n【47】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【48】This case series is not a formal pharmacokinetic study. Obviously, the small sample size and the single serum concentration limit a pharmacokinetic interpretation of paracetamol therapy in preterm babies. Still, this case series of nine very preterm babies indicates that paracetamol administration in a maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg/day every six hours results in paracetamol concentrations that are in the range of others \\[ 2 , 5 , 10 \\]. It suggests that intravenous paracetamol is tolerated well in the first hours after birth in very preterm babies. However, since proper pharmacokinetic data in this age group is still lacking, we cannot advocate the use of paracetamol intravenously based on our observations. It is obvious that future studies should target determination of dosing regimens to achieve maximum analgesic effect (efficacy) without adverse effects (tolerance) in newborns in the first four weeks after birth.\n\n【49】### Consent\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the patients for publication of this case report.

There was no known history of contact with a coronavirus disease 2019 patient, and all the family members were asymptomatic. Nasopharyngeal swabs done at admission did not detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, serology tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies were positive for immunoglobulin M and negative for immunoglobulin G. Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed hemoglobin A1, hemoglobin A2, hemoglobin F, and hemoglobin S of 46.2%, 2.5%, 19.9%, and 38.4%, respectively. Chest X-ray showed retrocardiac pneumonia in the left lung, and Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb showed a recent total femoropopliteal venous thrombosis. At day 10 of hospitalization, our patient had classical signs of cardiac tamponade with a voluminous pericardial effusion seen on echocardiographic examination and elevated C-reactive protein, compatible with a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of a case of plausible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection associated with venous thrombosis and acute pericarditis in Congo.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We hypothesized that this case of venous thrombosis and acute pericarditis in a Congolese child with heterozygous sickle cell disease was related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern. During the first wave of the epidemic, published data suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects adults while infants were variably but generally mildly affected \\[ 1 \\]. Moreover, it has been claimed that the high-risk populations for COVID-19 include elderly individuals and people with severe comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure \\[ 2 \\]. Nevertheless, some case series from China and Europe have reported critical illness in children who present for medical attention with severe or critical illness, requiring hospitalization and intensive care support \\[ 1 \\]. Since the beginning of the pandemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the end of March 2020, no severe COVID-19 pediatric infections have been described in its second largest city, Lubumbashi, DRC.\n\n【10】However, during the second wave of the epidemic, because of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and after the reopening of primary and secondary schools, more pediatric patients began to present for pediatric consultations for symptomatic COVID-19. Since then, limited data have been published on SARS-CoV-2 infection in young children in the DRC. Here, we report a pediatric case of COVID-19-related thrombotic complication observed at the end of March 2021 in a Congolese patient. We present herein the severity and atypical manifestations of COVID-19 among young children with sickle cell disease (SCD).\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A previously healthy 3-month-old male child of Congolese origin was admitted to the pediatric department with a seven-day history of fever, unilateral lower leg swelling and dyspnea. There was no known history of contact with a COVID-19 patient and all the family members were asymptomatic.\n\n【13】On physical examination, he was afebrile but dehydrated, prostrated, and with a painful tumefaction of the left lower limb. We noted tachypnea and hypoxemia, with saturation of 93.5%. The infant’s body temperature was 36.5 °C, and his heart rate was 140 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 52 breaths per minute. Laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 mg/dL, hematocrit 22.5%), 42,110 leukocytes/mm <sup>3 </sup> (82% polymorphonuclear), and 899,000 platelets. Inflammatory markers and d \\-dimer were high (CRP of 27.1 and 5200 ng/mL respectively). Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed hemoglobin (Hb)A1, HbBA2, HbF, and HbS of 46.2%, 2.5%, 19.9%, and 38.4%, respectively. Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb showed a recent total femoropopliteal venous thrombosis, the head of which was located at the level of the external iliac vein, as well as subcutaneous edema and dermal thickening related to venous obstruction.\n\n【14】Chest X-ray showed retrocardiac pneumonia in the left lung. The patient received oxygen therapy to maintain an oxygen saturation level above 92%, red cell concentrate, cefotaxime for 7 days concomitantly with lincomycin, vitamin C, zinc, and dexamethasone for 5 days, and heparin sodium from the second day of hospitalization.\n\n【15】On the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient remained irritable and his left lower limb painful. C-reactive protein (CRP) rose to 40.9 mg/L. Chest radiograph showed a slight increase in the cardiac area, suggestive of pericardial effusion. Chest tomography could not be done. Nasopharyngeal swabs at admission and on the eighth day of hospitalization, processed at the provincial reference laboratory, did not detect SARS-CoV-2. However, serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive for IgM and negative for IgG, indicative of COVID-19 seroconversion. White blood cells decreased to 20,730 leukocytes/mL, but CRP increased further to 138 mg/dL. Initial international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4 and anti-streptokinase antibodies of 91 UI/mL were found. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed a partially regressive crural deep vein thrombosis.\n\n【16】On day 10 of hospitalization, the patient was hemodynamically unstable and had classical signs of cardiac tamponade; urgent echocardiography showed a voluminous pericardial effusion, associated with signs of cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis yielded an outpouring of approximately 100 mL serofibrinous exudation fluid. The patient died on day 10 from heart failure. No autopsy was done.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】The first severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children reported from China started with gastrointestinal symptoms, exhibiting no obvious early respiratory manifestations, but progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since then, some pediatric case series from China and Europe have been reported with critical illness requiring hospitalization and intensive care support \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【19】Since the beginning of the pandemic in the DRC at the end of March 2020, no severe COVID-19 pediatric infections have been described in Lubumbashi, DRC, until the current case.\n\n【20】The clinical course of our patient was atypical, with a painful swelling of the left lower limb as initial symptom, followed by fever, unilateral lower leg swelling, and dyspnea. According to the clinical characteristics of existing pediatric cases, which have been divided into five clinical types, our patient had a severe COVID-19 infection.\n\n【21】The primary results of laboratory investigations suggested an underlying inflammatory phenomenon (CRP of 27.1) and possible predisposition to prothrombotic events ( d \\-dimers = 5200 ng/mL) as described in adult patients. Elevated levels of d \\-dimer observed at the primary biologic checkup in our patient have been associated with increased severity and mortality in previously reported patients \\[ 3 \\]. The prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with comorbidities is known to be poor. For example, although it has been reported that the clinical course seen for sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients with COVID-19 was no different to those without SCD following several case series studies \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\], although there are some reports that have suggested worse COVID-19 complications in SCD \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. In our patient, hemoglobin electrophoresis showed HBA1, HBA2, HBF, and HBS of 46.2%, 2.5%, 19.9%, and 38.4%, respectively. As a result of the predisposition to a prothrombotic state in patients with SCD and COVID-19, Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed a femoropopliteal venous thrombosis with complete occlusion of the lumen as well as a subcutaneous edema and dermal thickening related to venous obstruction. SCD patients are prone to a prothrombotic state affecting both the arterial and venous systems \\[ 11 \\]. The pronounced inflammation in COVID-19 patients also predisposes them to a hypercoagulable state (COVID-19-associated coagulopathy) with very high mortality rates. Hypercoagulability may affect both the venous (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism) and arterial systems (ischemic stroke, acute occlusion of the arteries of the limbs, and mesenteric ischemia). Thus, (even heterozygous) SCD patients with COVID-19 may be at high risk of developing thromboembolic events. As previously suggested, our patient was treated with therapeutic doses of enoxaparin (Lovenox) at 1 mg/kg 12 hourly, with a significant regression of the femoropopliteal venous thrombosis within 72 hours of anticoagulant therapy.\n\n【22】Moreover, the patient had lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, which have been identified as poor prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【23】The initial chest radiograph showed a slight increase in the cardiac area suggestive of pericardial effusion and about 10 days later, the patient had classical signs of cardiac tamponade confirmed by an urgent echocardiography showed voluminous pericardial effusion, associated with signs of cardiac tamponade. The American Medical Association, diagnostic Criteria for Acute Pericarditis has been defined as follow: At least 2 of the following clinical criteria are required: Chest pain (typically sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward), Pericardial friction rub, Suggestive changes on electrocardiography (widespread ST-segment elevation or PR depression) and new or worsening pericardial effusion Additional Supportive Criteria for Pericarditis has also been suggested: Elevation of markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein), Evidence of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【24】In our patient, ECG and cardiac RMI wasn’t available and therefore could not be done at the time of his hospitalization in our medical center. However, we have considered clinical biological (CRP) and Echocardiographic features as sufficient to make the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis in our technologically under-equipped medical centers \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【25】The affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the heart may be explained by the direct binding of its spike protein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is present in the human heart, thus allowing cellular infection. It has been shown in COVID-19 that direct pulmonary lesion pathophysiology, viral replication, and dissemination from the seventh day after symptoms onset may lead to a cytokine storm syndrome and direct myopericardial lesion by inflammatory cell infiltration. The fatal outcome and extreme celerity of respiratory and hemodynamic deterioration in this patient reinforce this hypothesis.\n\n【26】Regarding medical care procedures, pediatricians treating patients with COVID-19 are faced with a lack of solid evidence and guidelines regarding the management of COVID-19-related pericardial disease. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should not be introduced, considering the risk of respiratory worsening. Treatment is with steroids, and if severe, immunoglobulins have been suggested, following several clinical studies to manage cytokine storm syndrome. Our patient developed severe cytokine storm syndrome and pericarditis despite ongoing high-dose steroid treatment from the second day of hospitalization, suggesting that steroid administration itself could not prevent those critical complications in a patient with hematologic comorbidities. There is growing evidence from ongoing adult studies supporting the use of colchicine as a treatment option in COVID-19-related pericarditis.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】The current case is sufficient to alert pediatricians to the necessity for early identification of children with COVID‐19, especially those with SCD, specifically in countries with high prevalence of sickle-cell disease mutation. As the risks of thromboembolic events and cytokine storm syndrome are high, SCD–COVID19 comorbidity should benefit from early anticoagulation and aggressive antiinflammatory therapies.\n\n【29】Data availability\n-----------------\n\n【30】The data that support the findings of this case report are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There are many morphological variants that exist. It has been previously reported that some of these variants were found to be associated with subsequent or concurrent squamous cell carcinoma. However, there are limited cases that describe this underlying malignancy found in patients with bladder condyloma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 38-year-old African American female presented with condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder and underlying squamous cell carcinoma, which also invaded the neighboring uterus, urethra, and anterior vagina. Initial attempts at treatment began with cystoscopic resection of the condyloma; however, due to diffuse transformation, we pursued radical cystectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】As such a finding is rare in the urinary bladder, with few reports discussing its association with ensuing squamous cell carcinoma, we hope that this continues to generate awareness and consideration in the treatment of affected individuals.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Condyloma acuminatum is an epidermal manifestation that primarily affects the anal and genital regions. Only rarely has it been found outside of these normal parameters in mucocutaneous regions such as the urethra. In some populations, literature has described that condyloma acuminatum act as a risk factor for malignancy. Limited reports describe these lesions associated with squamous cell carcinoma found in the urinary bladder.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 38-year-old African American female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department as a referral for evaluation in May 2020 owing to a large bladder mass found incidentally on imaging at an outside hospital. At the time of presentation, her only symptoms were recurrent urinary tract infections, of which she reported 4–5 occurrences in the last year, intermittent spotting on toilet paper, and occasional stress urinary incontinence. We repeated a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis at our institution and identified the mass occupying much of the posterior bladder wall with suspicious but indeterminate invasion of the uterus and cervix. Additionally, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis was found with the left ureter more dilated than the right. Subsequently, the patient underwent cystoscopy with bilateral stent placement and a biopsy sample was taken of the bladder lesion as well as a lesion of the left labia. Pathology results returned for both showing findings consistent with condyloma acuminatum as well as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix. The patient then proceeded with a transurethral resection (TUR) of the mass. A second TUR with excision of the left labial mass was planned owing to the remaining tumor burden and concern that there may be an underlying malignancy. This attempt, however, was aborted owing to diffuse transformation now involving the urethra. After careful consideration and discussion, it was determined that bladder salvage was not feasible, and the best course of action would be bladder removal. She then underwent a radical cystectomy with the creation of a neobladder and self-catheterizable stoma and a hysterectomy in early September 2020, with biopsy samples taken intraoperatively. Final pathology results returned showing atypical condyloma proliferation of the urinary bladder wall and squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, urethra, and anterior vagina. Staging of the malignancy was determined to be IIIA (pT4a, pN0, cM0) and grade 1 owing to microscopic residual tumor margins of the urethra, as the condyloma was found to extend beyond the urethral meatus. Considering the staging reflected positive margins, adjuvant chemotherapy was carefully considered. She then began chemo and radiation in November 2020 and completed it in February 2021. Today, she is managed with close monitoring by surveillance imaging with urology and medical and radiation oncology with no recurrence of disease demonstrated on imaging.\n\n| Transverse CT abdomen-pelvis showing posterior bladder mass  |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Coronal CT abdomen-pelvis showing bladder mass and hydroureteronephrosis  |   |\n| Sagittal CT abdomen-pelvis showing posterior bladder mass  |   |\n| Bladder cystoscopy showing condyloma acuminatum  |   |\n\n【13】Discussion\n----------\n\n【14】Condyloma acuminatum occurs as epidermal verrucous growths that primarily affect the genital and anal regions. It is transmitted by sexual contact through human papillomavirus types 6 and 11. Histologically, it appears as hyperplastic papillary fronds with koilocytosis and viral atypia. Whereas it is chiefly found affecting external genitalia, it is less commonly found in mucocutaneous regions such as the urethra \\[ 1 \\]. In addition to HPV exposure, and prior anogenital warts, immunosuppressed populations have been found at greater risk of developing condyloma acuminatum, with a higher burden to include treatment resistance, higher rates of recurrence, and higher rates of malignant potential \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Rarely, these have been described as noninvasive lesions found in the urinary bladder with few reports recorded in the literature \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【15】As one of many morphologic variants found uncommonly in biopsies of the urinary bladder, condyloma acuminatum has been found associated with subsequent or concurrent carcinoma in situ (CIS) or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the bladder. In fact, a clinicopathological analysis of 29 cases involving noninvasive lesions reports their findings of malignant transformations. Of three patients with condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder, one patient had CIS at the time of cystectomy at a 3-month interval from biopsy, while another had invasive SCC at 20 months from the time of biopsy \\[ 5 \\]. Another study showed that 17 of 38 patients with invasive SCC or CIS were diagnosed concurrently or within 1 year of being found to have condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder. Therefore, though limited data exist owing to few reported incidences, documented discoveries suggest that condyloma acuminatum of the urinary tract increases the risk for bladder squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【16】Most bladder cancers are urothelial in nature, with less than 5% of bladder cancers being non-urothelial in nature \\[ 6 \\]. These non-urothelial bladder cancers represent up to 75% of bladder malignancy in areas where _Schistosoma hematobium_ infection is endemic \\[ 7 \\]. While several risk factors have been shown to be associated with bladder cancer, environmental exposures to things such as cigarette smoke remain chiefly responsible \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. It should be noted, however, that one study even found a 50% increase in the risk of overall cancer among patients hospitalized with condyloma acuminatum \\[ 10 \\]. This is especially concerning when considering shared risk factors of both condyloma acuminatum and bladder cancer such as smoking \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【17】Human papillomavirus continues to represent the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and predisposes affected individuals to condyloma acuminatum \\[ 3 \\]. As condyloma acuminatum has been found to be associated with developing concurrent or subsequent SCC of the bladder, clinicians should take special consideration when exploring squamous lesions of the bladder, as these lesions can represent underlying malignancy. This is especially true when considering the significant morphological overlap between various noninvasive squamous lesions of the bladder, as these can make diagnosing condyloma acuminatum difficult \\[ 4 \\]. With bladder cancer in the USA steadily increasing, special attention should be given to immunocompromised individuals, as they have been found to be associated with an increased risk of developing condyloma acuminatum and subsequently SCC of the bladder \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Condyloma acuminatum has been previously documented in post-transplant patients, diabetics, and those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【18】Treatment for condyloma acuminatum of the external genitalia has been widely accepted as either monotherapy or a combination of various medical therapies, although local recurrence is typical \\[ 15 \\]. Surgical options vary and range anywhere from cryoablation, laser ablation, electrocautery, or excision. The selection of treatment varies by circumstance and depends on the number, size, and location of lesions. Thus, it is determined on a case-by-case basis. As a rare finding in the urinary bladder, little evidence is available for the standard of care and guiding treatment approach. In general, trends in practices start with conservative measures but escalate to radical surgical treatment upon the findings of malignant transformation \\[ 16 \\], though, one study reports successful treatment with radiation and low-dose chemo without cystectomy in patients with condyloma alone \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【19】Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder is chiefly radical resection of the urinary bladder \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Evidence from retrospective and observational data shows that squamous cell carcinoma appears to be more aggressive than urothelial carcinoma \\[ 20 \\]. While there is no defined role for neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy, certain patients may benefit especially in the context of persistent local advanced disease despite cystectomy \\[ 21 \\]. In patients with advanced bladder cancer where surgery is not an option, palliative care is a reasonable approach. Still, with limited prospective data, treatment options should be pursued on an individual basis. As it stands, the prognosis is difficult to calculate. However, one multi-institutional study reports no difference in 5-year survival between urothelial and non-urothelial bladder cancers following radical cystectomy after controlling for sex, stage, and grade \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】We describe a rare case in which condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder was found, with final pathology results revealing underlying SCC of the bladder. Though it is rarely reported, condyloma acuminatum represents one of a few noninvasive squamous lesions of the urinary bladder. Immunocompromised patients appear to be at a greater risk of developing condyloma acuminatum, and in this population, higher reports of disease burden have been found. Owing to the rising prevalence of HPV worldwide and the increasing number of reports documenting condyloma of the bladder found in more subtypes of immunocompromised individuals, it is of growing urological concern. In general, limited data are available to guide treatment options for these skin lesions; however, it is common to pursue conservative measures and escalate to radical surgical options depending on the tumor burden. Condyloma acuminatum has been found to be associated with subsequent or concurrent CIS or SCC of the bladder upon initial biopsy determination. As such, patients found with condyloma of the bladder should be closely monitored for underlying malignancy. Treatment usually involves radical cystectomy, though preoperative or postoperative combinations of chemotherapy or radiation are considered in certain patient populations. As a rare finding, the prognosis remains to be determined.\n\n【22】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】Not applicable.\n\n【24】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【25】SCC:\n\n【26】Squamous cell carcinoma\n\n【27】TUR:\n\n【28】Transurethral resection\n\n【29】HPV:\n\n【30】Human Papillomavirus\n\n【31】CIS:\n\n【32】Carcinoma in situ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Treatment should be based on surgical excision. Due to the risk of recurrence, a close follow-up is mandatory.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Hydatidosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus \\[ 1 \\]. The lifecycle of this parasite includes two hosts: dogs are the definitive ones and humans are the intermediate ones \\[ 2 \\]. Humans become accidentally infected by many routes of transmission, including: eating vegetables or drinking water that can both be contaminated with the hydatid ova; and direct contact with the definitive hosts \\[ 2 \\]. It is endemic in Tunisia and represents a serious public health problem \\[ 3 \\], where the annual human incidence of surgical cases is approximately 15/100,000 \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Cysts are mainly found in the liver (63%), succeeded by the lungs (25%), muscles (5%) and bones (5%) \\[ 4 \\]. The involvement of the pelvic region is rare and represents an incidence which ranges between 0.2 and 2.25% \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【11】We present a case highlighting the importance of considering appendical hydatic cyst among the differential diagnosis when facing a case of intra-abdominal cystic lesion in endemic countries.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 45-year-old Tunisian woman, with no past medical history, was admitted for a pelvic mass. She had no associated history of vomiting, fever, jaundice or weight loss. On physical examination, the patient was anicteric and afebrile. The abdominal palpation found a bloating in the right iliac fossa. Her gynecological examination showed a right pelvic mass in the recto-uterine pouch. Her blood tests were normal. The abdominal ultrasound revealed a suspicious cystic mass of 9 cm in diameter, located at the right side of the uterus. The right ovary was not seen. The thoracic-abdominal pelvic scan showed a heterogeneous right lateral rectal mass of 9 cm.\n\n【14】Tumor markers, including CA 125, alpha fetoprotein, Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19–9 were tested and found within the normal range. With nonspecific signs and symptoms, wide radiological image findings, an anatomical contiguity, and the absence of a clinical history of a previous hepatic echinococcal cyst, a preoperative diagnosis of pelvic tumor was suggested.\n\n【15】Our patient was scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy. Three cystic masses were observed intra-operatively: the first one was 4.5 cm in diameter and was closely located to the appendix; the second one measured 2 cm in diameter and was attached to the uterovesical pouch; and the third cyst was of 6 cm in diameter, and was detected laterally to the right of the rectum. The rest of the abdominal cavity was normal.\n\n【16】An appendectomy and a complete resection of the cysts were conducted. The frozen section showed the presence of hydatic cysts, which were later confirmed by the histopathological examination. The operation ended with peritoneal cleansing with a hypertonic saline solution. Our patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the third postoperative day.\n\n【17】Our patient was then referred to a general surgery department to undergo an appropriate follow-up. We also took the opportunity to integrate her in the breast cancer screening program. Two years after treatment, our patient remained under follow-up and demonstrated no evidence of recurrent hydatidosis.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】The liver is the most common affected organ. Other intra-abdominal organs are less concerned and represent only 10–15% of the cases \\[ 5 \\]. The involvement of the appendix with this parasitosis is rare even in the endemic areas and it is due to an ectopic migration of the hydatic cyst localized in a different site \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【20】The clinical manifestation of the hydatic cyst varies widely and it is associated with nonspecific radiological images, which lead to difficulties in making the correct diagnosis \\[ 4 \\], as in the present case. However, our first suspicion was pelvic tumors such as gynecologic tumors, appendicle tumors or mucocele of the appendix.\n\n【21】A hydatic cyst develops increasingly inducing compression and irritation of the adjacent organs, which adds difficulties in diagnosing this pathology \\[ 6 \\]. When located in the pelvic region (0.2–2.25%), it may cause abdominal pain and swelling, urinary disorders, or menstruation disturbances \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【22】For the abdominal localization, the ultrasonography represents an important imaging examination as it may show the characteristic aspect of this cystic lesion, and may help in making the correct diagnosis \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【23】Surgical excision is the preferred treatment \\[ 2 \\]. An en bloc resection without rupture is the recommended procedure to avoid spreading of daughter cysts and so the onset of secondary disease \\[ 2 \\]. New therapeutic approaches have been described including percutaneous puncture of the cyst called the PAIR procedure (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration). Paksoy _et al._ conducted this procedure and showed successful results, considering it safe and simple, but antihelminthic drugs should be administrated postoperatively \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【24】The overall local recurrence rate of hepatic disease ranges between 10 and 12% \\[ 9 \\], thus a regular follow-up must be undertaken to detect recurrence.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【26】The involvement of the appendix, especially as a primary localization of the hydatid cyst, is a rare finding. This pathology is associated with nonspecific clinical manifestation and different radiological images. Surgical excision remains the preferred treatment. A close follow-up is highly recommended to detect further recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In particular, bone metastasis is significantly related to poor prognosis since radioactive iodine therapy is generally less effective. Therefore, surgical resection is considered one of the treatments for patients with bone metastases. We report chest wall resection and reconstruction using titanium micromesh covered with polypropylene mesh (Marlex mesh) for metastatic rib bones as a result of follicular thyroid carcinoma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 51-year-old man was referred to our institution with a painful chest wall tumor. He presented with a 15 × 10 cm bony swelling on the left chest wall and multiple small lung nodules from follicular thyroid carcinoma. Completion total thyroidectomy, chest wall resection and reconstruction using titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh were performed. There were no critical complications associated with surgical treatments and tumor pain disappeared during the postoperative period. Then, he received radioactive iodine therapy and the uptake of radioactive iodine was well observed in bilateral lung fields.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Reconstruction using titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh is possible for repairing the wide chest wall resection required for thyroid carcinoma metastasis. This technique would help to enhance treatment efficacy in the combination therapy of radioactive iodine and surgery in patients with large thyroid carcinoma metastasis in the chest wall.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) are usually curable, but the distant metastases are often untreatable. Lungs and bones are the major metastatic sites for DTC and radioactive iodine (RI) therapy is important in the treatment of such distant metastases. RI therapy is generally less effective in bone metastasis due to the low uptake of RI \\[ 1 \\] and the occurrence of bone metastases is significantly related to poor prognosis \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Therefore, if possible, surgical resection should be considered one of the treatments of choice for patients with bone metastases. Solitary sternal metastasis can be a good indicator for surgical resection and reconstruction and these treatments have been successfully performed in clinical practice \\[ 4 – 6 \\]. In addition, elimination of large bone metastases is considered to facilitate other distant metastases, mainly lung metastases, to uptake RI effectively. Such an enhancement effect is expected in RI treatment for DTC patients with multiple metastases. Thus, surgical resection of bone metastases contributes to the efficacy of RI therapy and is associated with favorable prognosis and improved quality-of-life (QOL) \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【9】To our knowledge, this is the first report of chest wall resection and reconstruction using titanium micromesh covered with polypropylene mesh (Marlex mesh) for metastatic rib bones as a result of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). There were no critical complications such as flail chest, dyspnea, or infection. Chest wall pain as the chief complaint disappeared after surgery and this procedure improved the patient's QOL.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 51-year-old man, who had a treatment history for thyroid tumor elsewhere, was referred to our institution in June 2006 due to a painful chest wall tumor. He had undergone right hemi-thyroidectomy as a 42-year-old but the detailed information was not available at presentation in our institution. On physical examination, the patient presented with a 15 × 10 cm bony swelling on the left chest wall. The thyroid tumor was not palpable in the residual left lobe of the thyroid gland. Ultrasound (US) examination subsequently revealed no thyroid tumor and no regional lymphadenopathy. Laboratory data showed an extremely elevated level of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) (12,000 ng/mL) with normal thyroid function. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 14 × 8 cm tumor in the left 3rd to 6th ribs and multiple small lung nodules (Figure 1 ). Core-needle biopsy was performed on the left chest wall tumor. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (Figure 2A ) revealed follicular growth in the tumor specimen obtained and immunohistochemical staining was positive for Tg (Figure 2B ) and thyroid transcription factor-1 (Figure 2C ). Thus, we diagnosed that the previously resected thyroid tumor was FTC and his painful chest wall tumor and multiple lung nodules were metachronous distant metastases from the previously resected FTC.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan before surgery.** Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan showed a 14 × 8 cm tumor of the left chest wall in the left ribs.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Core-needle biopsy of the left chest wall tumor.** Hematoxylin and eosin stain **(A)** revealed follicular growth, and immunohistochemical stain was positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 **(B)** and thyroglobulin **(C)** .\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Complete total thyroidectomy and chest wall resection and reconstruction using titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh were performed in August 2006. First, complete total thyroidectomy of the residual left thyroid gland was performed in the supine position before chest wall resection. There was no thyroid tumor in the resected lobe, as diagnosed pre-operatively. Then, the patient position was changed to the right lateral position. First, we observed the chest wall tumor from inside the thoracic cavity with a thoracoscope, endoscope technique, to determine the marginal line for resection. Next, a post-lateral incision was made. The anterior serratus muscles, 3rd to 6th ribs, and those intercostal muscles with 2 cm margins on both sides were resected (Figure 3A ). The thoracodorsal muscles were not resected because there was no invasion. After the resection, the defect was approximately 20 × 15 cm in size. Finally, we reconstructed the chest wall defect using titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh, with a sandwich method. Pieces of Marlex mesh and titanium micromesh were appropriately cut to be larger than the skeletal defect and the titanium micromesh was sandwiched between two Marlex meshes (Figure 3B ). Then, we sutured the mesh to the 2nd and 8th ribs and the dorsal edges of the 3rd to 6th ribs with titanium wires to provide rigidity (Figure 3C ). Two drainage tubes were inserted into the left thoracic cavity and the chest wall was suitably closed. The whole surgical procedure including total thyroidectomy and resection and reconstruction of the chest wall was accomplished in 10.7 hours of operation time and 1050 mL of blood loss was recorded during the operation The patient did not receive a blood transfusion.\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Reconstruction of the left chest wall defect.(A)** The left chest wall tumor was resected with the 3rd to 6th ribs. **(B)** Titanium micromesh and Marlex mesh were appropriately cut larger than the skeletal defect. **(C)** Titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh was sutured to the 2nd to 8th ribs with titanium wires to improve rigidity.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】There were no critical complications associated with the surgical treatments. Components of flail chest, dyspnea, and surgical site infection were not observed. Tumor pain disappeared during the postoperative period. Chest X-ray and CT scan showed that the left lung had completely expanded and reconstruction of the thoracic defect was successfully achieved (Figure 4 ). Respiratory function was approximately equivalent before and after surgery. Histopathological examination revealed that the resected specimens were metastatic lesions of poorly differentiated FTC. The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. The level of serum Tg decreased to 2800 ng/mL 2 months after the resection. He received RI ablation (50 mCi) and uptake was observed in the thyroid bed in November 2006, 3 months after surgery. Unfortunately, in December 2006, he developed spinal bone metastases and this caused spinal compression and paralysis at the level of the 7th thoracic vertebrae. Orthopedic surgery was immediately performed to fix the spinal aliments with rod instruments and paralysis was dramatically improved. Then, he received a therapeutic dose of RI (100 mCi) in May 2007, 9 months after our surgery. Uptake of RI was well observed in bilateral lung fields. Although the RI treatment was considered effective for lung metastases, spinal bone metastasis gradually progressed. Paraplegia and bladder bowel disturbance were present in August 2007, 12 months after our surgery, and his general condition deteriorated day by day. Eventually, he died of disease in March 2008 19 months after our surgery due to his reduced general condition. This patient never suffered painful chest wall tumor after the resection and lung metastasis was clinically controlled during the follow-up period.\n\n【26】**Figure 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan after surgery.** Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan showed that the left lung had completely expanded and reconstruction of the thoracic defect was successfully achieved.\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Distant metastases,mainly in the lung and bone, occur in 10% to 20% of patients with DTC. RI therapy is essential to treat such metastatic disease. Lung metastases usually respond to RI treatment, however bone metastases uncommonly respond to RI therapy and are associated with poor prognosis \\[ 1 – 3 , 8 \\]. Casara _et al._ \\[ 3 \\] reported that less than 5% of patients with bone metastases achieve complete remission despite the fact that RI uptake was observed in 60% of patients, whereas more than 35% of patients with lung metastases were considered to achieve complete remission after RI therapy. The 10-year survival rates for patients with bone and lung metastases were 15% and 53%, respectively. Because of the low remission rate in RI therapy and poor prognosis in patients with bone metastases, the surgical approach should be considered as one of the treatments of choice for bone metastasis, if possible. Curative resection of solitary bone metastasis is associated with improved survival, especially in younger patients \\[ 7 , 9 – 11 \\]. Moreover, patients' QOL is often improved by surgical removal of the metastases due to the rapid relief of symptoms. Thus, surgical resection of bone metastases is considered valuable. In addition, external beam radiotherapy or embolization has been reported to be effective as palliative therapy for unresectable or multiple bone metastases \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【32】Our patient had large bone metastases at the left chest wall and multiple small lung nodules. We considered that it was not enough to treat these advanced lesions with RI therapy alone because of the decreased effectiveness of RI therapy to large bone metastases and the decreased RI delivery to lung metastases. Therefore, we performed chest wall resection followed by reconstruction. Removal of large bone metastases was expected to facilitate other distant metastases to uptake RI efficiently. In fact, RI was well concentrated to lung metastases after surgery. Furthermore, this patient became free from left chest wall pain with limited analgesics after surgery. Thus, such surgical treatment is considered to contribute to both the efficacy of RI uptake and better patients' QOL, although just in restricted cases.\n\n【33】There are some reports on the surgical methods used for reconstruction after sternal resection \\[ 4 – 6 \\]. Marlex mesh is reported to be easy to handle, has a high affinity for tissues and is resistant to infections, but it may have a paradoxical chest wall motion because of the lack of rigidity when the defect is large. On the other hand, a metal plate can retain the rigidity and prevent a flail chest, but its affinity to tissue is insufficient and lung injury may occur. Briccoli _et al._ \\[ 13 \\] reported that sternal reconstruction with Marlex mesh and a titanium plate after sternotomy resulted in satisfactory surgical treatment without a flail chest. We used a titanium micromesh, which has many holes on a titanium plate, moderate malleability and sufficient rigidity, and covered with Marlex mesh for reconstruction of the wide defect after thoracic wall resection. This procedure showed good affinity to tissues, prevention of paradoxical respiration and an acceptable level of radiolucency. To our knowledge, this is the first report using titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh for reconstruction after the resection of chest wall metastases from thyroid carcinoma.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】Reconstruction using a titanium micromesh covered with Marlex mesh is possible for repairing the wide chest wall resection from thyroid carcinoma metastasis. This technique could help to enhance the treatment efficacy in the combination therapy of RI and surgery in patients with large thyroid carcinoma metastases in the chest wall.\n\n【36】Consent\n-------\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

She was transported to our hospital owing to disturbance of consciousness and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage by computed tomography. Computed tomography angiography revealed multiple, small intracranial aneurysms, and we suspected that one of them in the peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery was the source of hemorrhage based on the distribution of hematoma. The patient underwent emergency surgery. Because it was difficult to identify an aneurysm in the most peripheral part of the left middle cerebral artery in the initial surgery, only one aneurysm was clipped. Later, a peripheral aneurysm was clipped using the navigation system. Because both aneurysms were small intracranial aneurysms (< 2 mm), either of them could be the source of hemorrhage. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged in healthy condition. Because brain magnetic resonance imaging performed in the previous year did not find aneurysms at the same site, she was diagnosed with rupture of a _de novo_ aneurysm. Neurofibromatosis type 1 might have caused the rupture of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period in this patient.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be complicated by the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) causes various lesions in many organs, including the skin \\[ 1 \\]. The estimated number of patients with NF1 is about 40,000 in Japan, and the prevalence is about 1 in of every 3000 people. There is no racial difference in the morbidity \\[ 2 \\]. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disease, and more than half of the patients have sporadic NF1, which is caused by a mutation of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 17q11.2. that is responsible for production of neurofibromin \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Well-known complications in the central nervous system associated with this disease include neurofibroma and optic glioma. In addition, some studies have demonstrated cardiovascular anomalies in NF1, such as moyamoya disease, internal carotid artery occlusion or stenosis, cerebral arteriovenous fistula, dissection, or intracranial aneurysms \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. Here, we report a case of NF1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and _de novo_ aneurysms.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The patient was a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of NF1. There was no family history. She had brown spots on the skin and multiple dermatofibromas, and she was diagnosed with sporadic NF1 by biopsy in her teens. After small intracranial aneurysms (< 2 mm) were found in the right middle cerebral artery 2 years ago, she underwent annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up (Fig. 1 left). In addition, she was orally administered phenytoin for the treatment of genuine epilepsy. There were no aneurysms anywhere other than in the brain. She also had a history of untreated hypertension. She had no other complications, such as intracranial neurofibroma and brain tumors.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the previous year. Left: because a small intracranial aneurysm (arrow) was found in the right middle cerebral artery 2 years ago, she underwent annual MRI follow-up. Right: in the previous year, there had been no aneurysms in the left middle cerebral artery where the aneurysms were (arrow head)\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】She was transported to our hospital because of acute headache and disturbance of consciousness and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage by computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 2 A). Regarding the disturbance of consciousness, she had a score of 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, grade III in the Hunt and Kosnik grading system, and grade II in the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading. Blood pressure was over 200 mmHg. Computed tomography angiography revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms (Fig. 2 B, and C). Based on the distribution of hematoma, we suspected that one of the aneurysms in the peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery, rather than known intracranial aneurysms in the right middle cerebral artery, was the source of hemorrhage. These multiple small intracranial aneurysms in the left middle cerebral artery were considered _de novo_ aneurysms because they were not found on brain MRI in the previous year (Fig. 1 right). Accordingly, she underwent emergency surgery on the day of admission. After a left frontotemporal craniotomy, the Sylvian fissure was opened, exposing the superior and inferior trunk (M2) of the middle cerebral artery. We found small intracranial aneurysm (< 2 mm) in the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery. During surgery, only one small aneurysm was clipped (Fig. 3 A, and B) because it was difficult to identify another one, which was in the most peripheral part of the left middle cerebral artery. Three days later, the peripheral aneurysm, which was difficult to be identified in the initial surgery, was clipped and wrapped using the Navigation System (Stealth Station S7 Surgical Navigation System, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) (Fig. 3 C, and D). The small distal intracranial aneurysm, which was clipped during the second surgery, was considered the source of rupture because hematoma was around the aneurysm, and the wall was slightly red. However, because both aneurysms were small intracranial aneurysms (< 2 mm), either of them could be the source of hemorrhage. We confirmed that the aneurysms had disappeared by computed tomography angiography after the operations (Fig. 4 ). The postoperative course was good without any complications, such as rebleeding, cerebrovascular spasm, and hydrocephalus, and she was discharged in a healthy condition. The modified Rankin Scale score at discharge was 1. She continued to undergo follow-up MRIs of the known right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms.

While moyamoya vessels \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\], internal carotid artery occlusion, and stenosis \\[ 9 , 11 \\] are common cerebrovascular lesions, dural arteriovenous fistula \\[ 5 , 14 \\] and cerebral artery dissection \\[ 8 \\] have also been identified in NF1 patients. To date, not many case reports have investigated complications of intracranial aneurysms \\[ 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 \\]. Although the incidence of intracranial aneurysms is higher in NF1 patients (9–11%) than in age-matched individuals \\[ 17 , 18 \\], screening for intracranial aneurysms is considered unnecessary \\[ 18 \\]. Fukunaga _et al_ . found that, in NF1 patients, the internal carotid artery was the most common (32%) site of aneurysm formation, and the incidence of multiple aneurysms was 32%, which was slightly higher than that of typical intracranial aneurysms \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【31】There are many arguments about factors contributing to the formation of intracranial aneurysms in NF1 patients, and no consensus has been reached on this issue. Hemodynamic factors associated with the carotid artery occlusion, stenosis, and growth of moyamoya vessels may be responsible for the formation of intracranial aneurysms in NF1 patients \\[ 11 \\]. However, vascular anomalies, such as carotid artery occlusion and collateral blood flow, were not observed in the patient in this study, suggesting that hemodynamic factors are not involved in this case.\n\n【32】Salyer _et al_ . performed the histopathological examination and speculated the mechanism underlying renal artery lesions as follows: (1) Schwann cells proliferate in the vascular wall, and (2) the vascular wall then becomes fragile owing to fibrous intimal thickening, defects of the medial smooth muscle, and destruction of the elastic lamina \\[ 20 \\]. However, it has been pointed out that the mechanisms underlying the formation of aneurysms in the brain vessels cannot be same as those in renal vessels because nerves are unmyelinated, and Schwann cells never proliferate in the central blood vessels \\[ 21 \\]. Sobata _et al_ . found that degeneration and loss of smooth muscle cells triggered by the destruction of the internal elastic lamina led to the formation of aneurysms in intracranial vessels \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【33】NF is often complicated by hypertension. In this case, the patient also had a history of untreated hypertension \\[ 20 \\]. Gibbons _et al_ . have demonstrated an association between pheochromocytoma-associated hypertension and subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms \\[ 22 \\]. In addition, Hasegawa _et al_ . reported a case of multiple intracranial aneurysms complicated by hypertension and catecholamine-secreting malignant schwannoma, and their findings indicate that hypertension is involved in the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【34】As mentioned above, no consensus has been reached on the mechanism underlying the formation of intracranial aneurysms. The NF1 patient with vascular fragility in this study had hypertension, which might have been involved in the formation and rupture of _de novo_ aneurysms in a short period.\n\n【35】Some studies suggest that screening for intracranial aneurysms is unnecessary in patients with NF1 \\[ 18 \\], and other studies indicate no significant relationship between NF1 and the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage \\[ 24 \\]. However, the present patient was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of _de novo_ aneurysms, although she underwent annual brain MRI. Therefore, more frequent MRI monitoring of intracranial aneurysms is important in patients with NF1. In addition, further studies are needed to examine the mechanism underlying the formation of aneurysms using biopsies of aneurysms or the superficial temporal artery.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】Here, we report a case of NF1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and _de novo_ aneurysms. NF1 may be complicated by the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period.\n\n【38】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】We make our references in the manuscript available for testing by reviewers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

While usually asymptomatic, severe cases can result in pneumoperitoneum, which can be managed surgically or medically depending on circumstances. We present a case of a patient with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, which presented as pneumoperitoneum following trauma. To our knowledge, there are no other published cases in which a trauma patient with pneumoperitoneum was found to have radiologic evidence of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 37-year-old Hispanic male admitted to the hospital after being involved in a motorcycle accident. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast demonstrated trace pneumoperitoneum, possibly originating from the splenic flexure of the colon without evidence of extravasation of oral contrast. Laparoscopy with conversion to exploratory laparotomy revealed bowel abnormalities at the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure, which were identified as pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis by pathology. There was no evidence of bowel perforation. A panel of abdominal radiologists attended the computed tomography interpretation to note that incidental atraumatic or traumatic rupture of the cysts could have caused the pneumoperitoneum. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was transferred to another facility per insurance request.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】When presenting in the context of trauma, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis can lead to difficult management decisions. To our knowledge, there are no existing evidence-based guidelines for the scenario of concurrent pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, blunt abdominal trauma, and pneumoperitoneum in a patient with a benign abdominal exam. This patient’s pneumoperitoneum was likely caused by rupture of preexisting cysts rather than frank bowel perforation. Patients who are asymptomatic, lack signs of clinically worrisome disease, and have a low pretest probability will likely not benefit from surgery and can be medically managed. Thorough discussion between surgeons and radiologists can be helpful when evaluating the clinical significance of a patient’s pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis and aid in the decision to perform surgery.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The term pneumatosis intestinalis is used to describe the presence of gas in the wall of the small or large intestine. It has many causes ranging from benign to life threatening and may be either primary or secondary to another disease process. One of the forms of pneumatosis intestinalis is pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI), a rare and benign idiopathic condition in which multiple thin-walled cysts develop in the submucosa or subserosa of the bowel \\[ 1 \\]. It is usually asymptomatic and often only incidentally found on radiography or endoscopy \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. When symptomatic, patients can present with abdominal pain, obstruction, and bleeding. In some cases, the cysts can rupture leading to pneumoperitoneum \\[ 1 \\]. The resulting pneumoperitoneum can be life threatening and requires surgical correction in severe cases. In mild cases, medical management is appropriate \\[ 3 , 5 \\].\n\n【10】Given the various manifestations of this condition, the clinical significance can often be misinterpreted, resulting in inappropriate management \\[ 6 \\]. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) is used to establish the diagnosis and diagnose possible associated complications. We present the case of a patient who was found to have radiologic evidence of PCI with pneumoperitoneum in the setting of trauma. To our knowledge, there are no other published cases on this matter.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 37-year-old Hispanic male was hospitalized after being involved in a motorcycle crash. The patient suffered blunt chest and abdominal trauma as well as concussion without loss of consciousness. Upon arrival, the patient had a Glasgow Coma scale score of 15 and was hemodynamically stable. His abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender to palpation with no guarding. Labs were significant for hemoglobin count of 14.2 g/dL (normal 13.5–17.5 g/dL), white blood count of 11.8 1000/μL (normal 4.5–11 1000/μL), and lactate of 1.7 mmol/L (normal 0.7–2.1 mmol/L), which remained stable throughout his hospital course.\n\n【13】Initial intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis was performed 10 minutes after patient presentation. The CT scan was interpreted by a radiology resident 15 minutes later and final interpretation by a board-certified emergency radiologist was completed in an additional 1 hour and 25 minutes. The initial CT interpretation indicated nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum, and occult small bowel injury could not be excluded. Given these findings, a repeat CT of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast was ordered by the trauma service as per our institution’s standard protocol for evaluation of possible occult bowel injury in blunt abdominal trauma.\n\n【14】The follow up CT performed after midnight, 8 hours after the initial CT, demonstrated trace pneumoperitoneum, possibly originating from the splenic flexure of the colon without evidence of extravasation of oral contrast (Fig. 1 ). The time from repeat CT scan completion to initial interpretation by a radiology resident was 30 minutes. The resident made the surgery team aware of these findings immediately. A board-certified emergency radiologist reviewed and provided another preliminary interpretation for the study 10 minutes later, confirming the presence of pneumoperitoneum. Based on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma, the patient was taken to the operating room as per standard protocol at our institution. Six hours after the follow up CT was performed, an academic board-certified abdominal radiologist provided a final interpretation.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis sagittal view ( **a** ), coronal view ( **b** ), and axial view ( **c** ) demonstrating findings of numerous cysts within the wall of the splenic flexure of the colon (arrows) with trace pneumoperitoneum in the subphrenic spaces (arrowheads)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】On laparoscopy, cyst-like structures projecting from the wall of the distal transverse colon and splenic flexure were noted. Due to the patient’s body habitus, the surgery team did not feel that they could adequately explore the area and the decision was made to convert to exploratory laparotomy. No evidence of bowel perforation was found. A segmental section of the diseased portion of the colon was taken and sent to pathology. Pathology results showed multiple enlarged cystic nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in the bowel wall (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Colonic segment with attached pericolonic fat measuring 12 cm in length and 6 cm in diameter. The serosa is tan–pink and smooth. Upon opening, the mucosa is tan–pink, soft with normal bowel folds. Attached to the folds, multiple large nodules are identified ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm. The entire nodular area measures 8.4 × 3.5 × 2 cm. Upon sectioning, the nodules deflate and are consistent with air bubbles ( **a** , **b** ). Microscopically, the section of the colon showed multiple air-filled cystic structures located in the submucosa. The cysts were lined by macrophages and multinucleated giant cells with bland nuclei. No atypia, pleomorphism, or mitoses were identified. The overlying colonic mucosa exhibited mild reactive changes but did not show significant inflammation or adenomatous change ( **c** )\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Subsequently, the radiologic studies were reviewed by a panel of abdominal radiologists. The panel concluded that the proximity of the pneumoperitoneum to the pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis suggested that the pneumoperitoneum may have been caused by incidental atraumatic or traumatic rupture of the cysts. However, they could not rule out bowel perforation based on imaging alone.\n\n【25】The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was transferred to an acute care facility of equal acuity for further medical management as per the patient’s health insurance request.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】We present the case of a patient who was incidentally found to have pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in the setting of trauma. Despite relatively benign examination and laboratory, findings, the patient was treated surgically due to concern for bowel perforation.\n\n【28】Due to nonspecific physical examination and laboratory findings, the diagnosis of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is generally established through abdominal imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT scan, the test of choice, reveals microvesicular gas collections (10–100 mm cysts or bubbles) within the lamina propria of the bowel. This feature differentiates it from acquired pneumatosis intestinalis, in which linear or curvilinear gas collections can be seen parallel to the bowel wall \\[ 4 , 7 \\].\n\n【29】Given the various manifestations of this condition, the clinical significance can often be misinterpreted, resulting in inappropriate management \\[ 6 \\]. While most cases of PCI can be managed medically, bowel perforation frequently requires urgent surgical intervention \\[ 5 \\]. This case is uniquely challenging as the pneumoperitoneum was discovered in the setting of trauma. To our knowledge, there are no existing evidence-based guidelines for the scenario of concurrent PCI, blunt abdominal trauma, and pneumoperitoneum in a patient with a benign abdominal exam.\n\n【30】Although this patient did not display signs of peritonitis on abdominal examination, nor metabolic acidosis, lactate acidosis, or portal venous gas on CT, he was suspected to have a bowel perforation and taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Having a high clinical suspicion for bowel perforation in this clinical scenario was rational. However, the overall clinical picture should have been taken into consideration to avoid the error of diagnostic anchoring. In this case, the asymptomatic patient and minimal amount of pneumoperitoneum was most likely caused by rupture of some preexisting PCI cysts due to trauma. When PCI is complicated by pneumoperitoneum, clinicians face the difficult decision of discriminating patients with a relatively benign PCI from patients with life-threatening bowel perforation.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】As illustrated by this case, it is important for clinicians to recognize the entity of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis and be able to differentiate benign from clinically worrisome disease. Asymptomatic patients who lack signs of clinically worrisome disease and who have a low pretest probability will likely not benefit from surgery and can be medically managed. Surgeons and radiologists should have a thorough discussion to evaluate the clinical significance of a patient’s PCI and weigh the benefits and risks of surgery.\n\n【33】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【34】Not applicable.\n\n【35】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【36】PCI:\n\n【37】Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis\n\n【38】CT:\n\n【39】Computed tomography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Many cases remain unidentified, especially if asymptomatic. Thus, it is difficult to determine the actual incidence. Müllerian duct anomaly is associated with a wide range of gynecological and obstetric complications, namely infertility, endometriosis, urinary tract anomalies, and preterm delivery. Furthermore, congenital anomalies in pregnant mothers have a high risk of being genetically transmitted to their offspring.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a patient with unsuspected müllerian duct anomaly in a term pregnancy. A 33-year-old Malay woman with previously uninvestigated involuntary primary infertility for 4 years presented with acute right pyelonephritis in labor at 38 weeks of gestation. She has had multiple congenital anomalies since birth and had undergone numerous surgeries during childhood. Her range of congenital defects included hydrocephalus, for which she was put on a ventriculoperitoneal shunt; imperforated anus; and tracheoesophageal fistula with a history of multiples surgeries. In addition, she had a shorter right lower limb length with limping gait. Her physical examination revealed a transverse scar at the right hypochondrium and multiple scars at the posterior thoracic region, levels T10–T12. Abdominal palpation revealed a term size uterus that was deviated to the left, with a singleton fetus in a nonengaged cephalic presentation. The cervical os was closed, but stricture bands were present on the vagina from the upper third until the fornices posteriorly. She also had multiple rectal prolapses and strictures over the rectum due to previous anorectoplasty. An emergency cesarean delivery was performed in view of the history of anorectoplasty, vaginal stricture, and infertility. Intraoperative findings showed a left unicornuate uterus with a communicating right rudimentary horn.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Most cases of müllerian duct anomaly remain undiagnosed due to the lack of clinical suspicion and the absence of pathognomonic clinical and radiological characteristics. Because it is associated with a wide range of gynecological and obstetric complications, it is vital for healthcare providers to be aware of its existence and the role of antenatal radiological investigations in its diagnosis. The presence of multiple congenital abnormalities and a history of infertility in a pregnant woman should warrant the exclusion of müllerian duct anomalies from the beginning. Early detection of müllerian duct anomalies can facilitate an appropriate delivery plan and improve the general obstetric outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Müllerian duct abnormalities (MDAs) are a broad and complex spectrum of defects that are often associated with primary amenorrhea, infertility, endometriosis, and obstetric complications. Women with congenital uterine malformation usually experience a higher incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery. An obstetrician should have a high index of suspicion for an undiagnosed congenital defect such as MDA in the presence of infertility with a background of maternal congenital malformations. Early diagnosis and recognition of the condition may allow proper planning of treatment to ensure a favorable obstetric outcome.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】We report a case of MDA diagnosed during an emergency cesarean section of a pregnant woman with multiple congenital anomalies. A 33-year-old Malay woman with 4 years of previously uninvestigated involuntary primary infertility had spontaneously conceived. She presented with acute right pyelonephritis in labor at 38 weeks of gestation. Of note, she has had multiple underlying congenital anomalies since birth and had undergone various surgeries during childhood. The abnormalities included hydrocephalus, for which she was put on ventriculoperitoneal shunting; an imperforated anus; and tracheoesophageal fistula with a history of multiples surgeries. In addition, she had a shorter right lower limb length with limping gait. A detailed ultrasound scan at 20 weeks of gestation revealed a grossly normal fetus. Her medication history was not significant, and her social and family history revealed no remarkable findings.\n\n【12】Clinically, she was alert and not in sepsis. Her vital signs were stable. However, she had a low-grade fever of 37.5 °C. She had a transverse scar on her right hypochondrium and multiple scars at the posterior thoracic region at levels T10–T12. Her abdominal examination revealed a term size uterus that was deviated to the left, with a singleton, nonengaged fetus in cephalic presentation. The result of a right renal punch was positive. Her cervix was unfavorable, with fibrotic stricture bands at the upper one-third of the vagina up to the fornices. She also had multiple rectal prolapses and strictures from a previous anorectoplasty. Her kidneys were of normal shape and size on her ultrasound examination. Her blood parameters, including her renal profile, were within normal ranges. She was administered a broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic.\n\n【13】In view of the above-mentioned maternal conditions, an emergency cesarean section was performed. Intraoperatively, MDA of left unicornuate uterus with fused right communicating horn was diagnosed. Both of the patient’s fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal (Figs. 1 and 2 ). A healthy and normal baby boy weighing 2500 g was delivered. He was vigorous at birth. Postoperatively, the intravenous antibiotic was continued for 3 days. Her condition improved, and the results of all cultures were negative. She was discharged on day 4 postoperatively and remained well at her 6-month follow-up.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Intraoperative findings illustrating the left unicornuate uterus with a communicating right rudimentary horn (anterior view).

The patient’s fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】The müllerian ducts are embryologic structures that exist in pairs before undergoing a mechanism of fusion and resorption _in utero_ to form the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and upper two-thirds of the vagina. MDAs are rare conditions. The actual prevalence of MDAs is difficult to ascertain because many of the cases are asymptomatic and thus remain undiagnosed. The reported prevalence of MDAs varies widely across studies. In a systematic review, the prevalence of MDAs was 5.5% in an unselected population, 8% in infertile women, 12.3% in women with a history of miscarriage, and 24.5% in women with a history of miscarriage and infertility \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【24】The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (formerly the American Fertility Society) classification system for müllerian defects has been applied as the standard definition in the United States for decades \\[ 2 \\]. When MDAs are diagnosed, any associated anomalies of the vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and renal system should also be identified and documented, even though they are not listed as part of the classification system. In a literature review regarding infertile and fertile women with MDAs, the frequencies of specific anomalies were septated uterus (35%t), bicornuate uterus (26%), arcuate uterus (18%), unicornuate uterus (10%), didelphys (8%), and agenesis (3%) \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【25】MDAs are frequently associated with adverse gynecologic and obstetric complications, such as infertility, endometriosis, and miscarriage. They are also commonly associated with renal anomalies in as many as 30–50% of cases. The common renal anomalies are renal agenesis, ectopic kidney, hypoplasticity, fusion, duplication, and malrotation of the kidneys \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Thus, the identification of both kidneys during the investigation is essential. MDAs are also frequently seen in women born with complex anorectal malformations. Other congenital abnormalities commonly associated with MDAs include vertebral body anomalies (29%) (that is, fused or wedged vertebral bodies, spina bifida; 22–23%), heart abnormalities (14.5%), and syndromes such as the Klippel-Feil syndrome (7%) \\[ 6 \\]. Other conditions involving vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities (VACTERL association), such as renal or cardiac anomalies in patients with MDAs, could also affect their conception, fertility, modes of delivery, and obstetrical outcomes \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【26】The diagnosis of MDAs remains challenging in most cases. Although hysterosalpingogram is useful in diagnosing a unicornuate uterus, it does not help in detecting a noncommunicating horn. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice because it is widely available, noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and able to provide information about other relevant nonuterine structures such as ovaries, kidneys, and pelvic mass. It can also provide information on the subsequent imaging modality or modalities that should be chosen for definitive diagnosis. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images provide more detailed information and often prevent the need for additional imaging \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Historically, magnetic resonance imaging has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of reproductive tract anomalies \\[ 10 \\]. However, magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for cases only when 2D or 3D ultrasound findings are limited and a definitive diagnosis is required to make decisions regarding patient care. Additional investigations include an intravenous pyelogram or renal ultrasonography to detect any horseshoe kidney, ipsilateral renal agenesis, or pelvic kidney. Laparoscopy is rarely indicated in the investigation of MDAs.\n\n【27】Among the various types of MDAs, the unicornuate uterus is associated with the poorest fetal survival. Even if the pregnancy is healthy, the obstetric performance is universally poor in this group. Common obstetrical complications include malpresentation, intrauterine growth retardation, and preterm birth. These reproductive problems are attributed to abnormal uterine vasculature and diminished myometrial mass of the unicornuate uterus \\[ 11 \\]. As a result, cesarean delivery rates are high among this group of patients.\n\n【28】In view of these complications, it is crucial for female patients with multiple congenital anomalies to receive an early referral to exclude MDAs. A thorough assessment is compulsory during the initial pregnancy checkup to assess the severity of the condition. Early recognition and categorization of the condition allow appropriate management during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods to ensure a good outcome for mother–baby dyad care.\n\n【29】However, our patient, even though she underwent regular antenatal review at the local health center, was referred only much later to our tertiary-level center for further evaluation. Her old admission records regarding her childhood conditions were not available. On the basis of limited records, her clinical findings were suggestive of vertebral, anorectal, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb associations. Hence, the possibility of an underlying MDA should be highly suspected from the beginning. The MDA was proved intraoperatively with the presence of unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn and communicating uterine horn. This condition is frequently associated with ipsilateral renal and ureter agenesis \\[ 12 \\]. However, it was absent in our patient.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】The majority of MDAs remain undiagnosed due to a lack of clinical suspicion and the absence of pathognomonic clinical and radiological characteristics. Hence, knowledge of its existence and the role of antenatal radiological investigations is vital to prevent the wide range of gynecological and obstetrical complications. As illustrated in our patient’s case, the presence of multiple congenital abnormalities and a history of infertility in a pregnant woman should warrant the exclusion of MDAs from the beginning. Early detection of MDAs will facilitate the most appropriate delivery plan to ensure the best maternal and neonatal outcomes.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】The patient’s information and medical records used for the case report are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【34】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【35】MDA:\n\n【36】Müllerian duct anomaly", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Neurological complications are rare in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. However, if they do occur, the consequences are often significant enough to warrant major neurosurgical intervention. Neurological complications occur when the pathological process of ossification in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis extends to other vertebral ligaments, causing ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments and/or ossification of the ligamentum flavum.

Computed tomography revealed diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis at T4 to T10. He underwent partial laminectomy of T10 and posterior fusion of T9 to T12.

DISH rarely causes neurological complications, as evidenced by isolated case reports on the subject; however, if neurological complications do occur, they are often severe enough to warrant major neurosurgical intervention \\[ 1 – 4 \\]. Neurological complications occur in DISH when the pathological process of ossification extends to other vertebral ligaments, causing ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments (OPLL) and/or ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) \\[ 5 \\]. A retrospective analysis of 74 cases of DISH conducted by Sharma _et al_ . found that 11 patients had presented with progressive spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Of these, OPLL was responsible in nine cases and OLF in two \\[ 5 \\]. However, thoracic spondylolisthesis and spinal cord compression in DISH has not previously been reported in the literature. We report the first case of thoracic spondylolisthesis and spinal cord compression in DISH. Neurosurgical intervention relieved the patient’s neurological symptoms significantly.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 78-year-old Japanese man presented with a 6-month history of gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his lumbar spine revealed lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). He could not walk outdoors. A neurological examination of muscle weakness of his iliopsoas and quadriceps femoris suggested possible spinal cord compression. Cervical and thoracic spine MRI revealed anterior spondylolisthesis and severe cord compression at T3 to T4 and T10 to T11, and high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image at T10/11 (Fig. 1 ). An X-ray revealed intervertebral disc space narrowing and anterior spondylolisthesis at T3/4 and T10/11 (Fig. 2 ). A myelogram-computed tomography (CT) scan showed anterior spondylolisthesis and severe cord compression at the T10/11 level. OPLL and OLF were not seen at T10/11. DISH was noted above the T10 level (Fig. 3 ). We determined that the lesion responsible was located at the T10/11 level. He underwent partial laminectomy at T10 and posterior fusion at T9 to T12. He could walk outdoors with one T-cane postoperatively. Postoperative CT detected DISH between T4 and T10 and anatomical repositioning of the anterior spondylolisthesis previously noted at T10. Postoperative MRI revealed resolution of the spinal cord compression and an improvement in the high signal intensity on the T2-weighted image (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】MRI revealed anterior spondylolisthesis and severe cord compression at the T3 to T4 and T10 to T11 levels, as well as high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image at the T10/11 level ( _white outline arrows_ )\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】X-ray revealed T3/4 and T10/11 intervertebral disc space narrowing and anterior spondylolisthesis and no involvement of the sacroiliac joints ( _white outline arrows_ )\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Myelogram-CT revealed T10 to T11 anterior spondylolisthesis and severe cord compression at T10/11 level ( _white outline arrows_ ).

DISH was seen above the T10 level ( _white solid arrows_ )\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 4**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Postoperative CT revealed diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis between T4 and T10 ( _white solid arrows_ ).

DISH is also known as senile ankylosing hyperostosis \\[ 6 \\]. DISH involving the spine is identified radiologically by flowing ligamentous ossification and calcification of the anterolateral aspect of the vertebral body with relatively well-preserved disc space \\[ 7 \\]. The radiographic criteria, as defined by Utsinger _et al.,_ includes: (1) bridging osteophytes extending over four contiguous vertebral bodies; (2) relatively normal intervening disk space height in relation to height in relation to age; and (3) absence of apophyseal joints, bony ankyloses, and absence of erosion, sclerosis, or osseous fusion of the sacroiliac joints \\[ 8 \\]. Our patient met all these criteria.\n\n【30】Spinal involvement of DISH is characterized radiologically by flowing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, which is typically separated from the anterior aspect of the vertebral body by a thin radiolucent line \\[ 9 \\]. The spinal longitudinal ligaments and entheses slowly ossify and show decreased mobility in the affected region until complete ankylosis results. DISH frequently begins in the lower thoracic spinal segments, before extending into the upper thoracic segments and lumbar spine \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【31】DISH results in the fusion of several spinal segments, which amplify the biomechanical load on the unaffected segments. Hypermobility of the spinal segment causes disc degeneration or hypertrophy of the OLF, thus resulting in LSS.\n\n【32】The main point of interest in the present case was the slow progression of myelopathy due to T10 anterior spondylolisthesis in a patient with DISH. In this case, DISH between T4 and T10 caused disc degeneration and anterior spondylolisthesis in T3 to T4 and T10 to T11. Hypermobility of the spinal segment gradually led to spinal cord compression.\n\n【33】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of thoracic spondylolisthesis and spinal cord compression in a patient with DISH. Neurosurgical intervention provided significant relief of our patient’s symptoms. Patients with significant neurological deficits due to spinal cord compression often require surgical intervention. The type of surgery depends on the site and type of compression.\n\n【34】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【35】We report the first case of thoracic spondylolisthesis and spinal cord compression in DISH. Neurosurgical intervention resulted in significant improvement of our patient’s neurological symptoms.\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】CT:\n\n【38】Computed tomography\n\n【39】DISH:\n\n【40】Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis\n\n【41】LSS:\n\n【42】Lumbar spinal stenosis\n\n【43】MRI:\n\n【44】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【45】OLF:\n\n【46】Ossification of the ligamentum flavum\n\n【47】OPLL:\n\n【48】Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

On biomicroscopic examination, bilateral horizontal Descemet’s membrane folds were observed. Corneal tomography revealed irregular and asymmetric “against-the-rule” astigmatism in both eyes. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrated numerous central Descemet’s without edema or other corneal structure alterations.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This is the first report of Descemet’s membrane folds in ochronosis. These corneal findings suggest that the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the sclera leads to thickening and stiffness of this region. These alterations could remarkably decrease visual acuity owing to topographic corneal curvature alterations, especially in elderly patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder clinically characterized by a triad of dark urine on addition of alkali, ochronotic pigmentation, and degenerative arthritis \\[ 1 \\]. Ochronosis is the connective tissue manifestation of AKU caused by deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. This enzyme depletion leads to a complete block within the tyrosine metabolism cascade. Homogentisic acid accumulates and is polymerized into a melanin-like pigment that is ultimately deposited in connective tissue over the years, where it associates with collagen fibers, especially in eyes, skin, bones, tendons, articular cartilages, lungs, valves, and kidneys \\[ 2 \\]. Patients with AKU are usually asymptomatic until the fourth decade \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Ophthalmic ochronotic changes might be associated with pathologic conditions such as glaucoma, progressive astigmatism, and anterior uveitis \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. Thus, our primary objective is to report for the first time a case of bilateral Descemet’s membrane folds in a patient with ochronosis.\n\n【11】Case report\n-----------\n\n【12】An 85-year-old Italian Caucasian male patient presented to our hospital with a substantial bilateral decrease in visual acuity for the past 2 years. He had already been submitted to total replacement of both knees, hip, and cardiac valve in the course of the previous 10 years. Severe motion limitation of spine and shoulders was prevalent. Also, his ears, cartilage, and hands were characteristically pigmented. His family history was negative for alkaptonuric ochronosis. He was treated with analgesic therapy with paracetamol and gabapentin 300 mg × 3/day, vitamin C 1 g daily, dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine.\n\n【13】The patient presented a corneal topography performed in 2011 that showed relatively regular 5-diopter “against-the-rule” astigmatism in both eyes. Best-corrected visual acuity with spectacles was LogMAR 1.0 (+1.50–6.50×90) and 1.3 (+2.00–7.50×90) for the right and left eye, respectively. On biomicroscopic examination, the patient was pseudophakic (having undergone uneventful phacoemulsification 15 years previously) and presented slightly elevated nodular interpalpebral dark pigmentation in the conjunctiva, sclera, and limbal cornea in both eyes (Fig. 1 A, B). Corneal examination showed five horizontal Descemet’s membrane folds in the right eye and three in the left (Fig. 1 C, D) with a quiet anterior chamber without any stromal edema or epithelial alteration. Pupils were normal size, reacting to light. Applanation tonometry was 12 mmHg in both eyes, and gonioscopy revealed open angles. Fundus examination with 90D lens showed normal optic disc, macular area, and vessels in both eyes.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Clinical appearance on silt-lamp biomicroscopy. **A** Dark conjunctival and scleral pigmentation temporally in the right eye. **B** Dark conjunctival and scleral pigmentation temporally in the left eye. **C** Descemet’s membrane folds appearance on cross-section beam. **D** Descemet’s membrane folds appearance on diffuse cross-section beam\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】The anterior segment analysis mode of the Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) provided Descemet’s membrane folds details (Fig. 2 A, B). Corneal simulated topography in Pentacam HR Scheimpflug tomography (Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) revealed irregular and asymmetric astigmatism at 180°, coinciding with the axis of the pigmented lesions in both eyes (Fig. 3 A, C). This device showed keratometry (K) readings of 50.00 × 35.00 diopters (D) and 47.00 × 37.00 D in the right and left eye, respectively. Also, the corneal pachymetry map revealed normal central corneal thickness with inferior displacement of the distribution (a thinnest point reading of 578 and 565 μm in the right and left eye, respectively) corresponded to the topographic most flattened area (5 mm from the inferior limbus). The most thickened areas (temporal and nasal) correspond to limbal pigment deposition (Fig. 3 B, D).\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Descemet’s membrane folds on anterior segment optical coherence tomography. **A** Right eye showing five folds with no stromal edema **B** Left eye showing three folds with no stromal edema\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Scheimpflug tomography simulated corneal topography showing anterior sagittal curvature map. **A** Right eye demonstrating 15-diopter asymmetric irregular astigmatism coinciding with the axis of the pigmented lesions. **B** Right eye pachymetry map revealing normal central thickness with inferior displacement of the distribution. **C** Left eye demonstrating 10-diopter asymmetric irregular astigmatism coinciding with the axis of the pigmented lesions. **D** Left eye pachymetry map revealing normal central thickness with inferior displacement of the distribution\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】This case describes the oldest patient with ocular ochronotic findings to be reported in international scientific literature \\[ 4 \\]. Progressive, marked “against-the-rule” astigmatism has been reported twice in elderly patients \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Both patients were in their seventies when astigmatism began to develop, in both cases being oriented along the same axis as the pigment was found. However, the presence of Descemet’s membrane folds has never been described. Cheskes _et al._ believed that progressive astigmatism was due to corneoscleral thinning after scleral pigment accumulation \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【29】Ochronotic pigment in the aortic valve and bone synovium leads to dystrophic calcification, thickening, and stenosis over time \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. We believe that this is the same process that happens in the sclera. This author has already described a series of 42 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and thin sclera; however, no corneal folds or irregular astigmatism were observed \\[ 10 \\]. The presence of corneal folds suggests that ochronotic accretions, integrated from the sclera into the limbus nasally and temporally, are probably responsible for scleral stiffness in this region. In accordance with this, another study demonstrated no scleral thinning in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) in two patients with ocular ochronosis \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【30】In ocular ochronosis, the pigment is typically localized to the sclera, conjunctiva, and limbus. One author described a 25-year-old patient with annular corneal pigmentation in addition to arthropathic changes and skin pigmentation using _in vivo_ confocal microscopy \\[ 12 \\]. Interestingly, this was not observed in our case. Some authors believe that this intense scleral pigmentation is devoid of cells, suggesting a probable toxic effect of the pigment \\[ 13 \\]. The deposition of homogentisic acid polymers occurs around collagen fibrils, altering, thickening, and obscuring their structure, forming plaques and fiber-like structures, followed by necrosis of the fibrocytes. This entire process corroborates our ”scleral stiffening” theory, probably differing due to the duration of the clinical manifestations and severity of the disease.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】This is the first report of Descemet’s membrane folds in ochronosis. These corneal findings, along with other previous studies, suggest that the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the sclera leads to thickening and stiffness of this region. While ochronosis is not known to cause blindness, decreased visual acuity can impact patients’ quality of life in their last decades and hence should be closely observed.\n\n【33】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【34】Not applicable", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of cystic hygroma in a 19-month-old child successfully treated with robot-assisted excision through a small concealed retroauricular hairline approach. This is the first report in the medical literature of treating cystic hygroma with a minimally invasive robot-assisted excision via a small, concealed, hairline incision.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Cystic hygroma, also known as macrocystic lymphangioma, is a rare congenital malformation of the lymphatic system, the majority of which are diagnosed by the end of the second year of life \\[ 1 \\]. Cystic hygroma can affect the child’s appearance, swallowing, and even the airway patency. While surgery is the mainstay treatment modality for cystic hygroma \\[ 2 \\], it often leaves a visible scar on the neck. We report a case of cystic hygroma occurring in a child after trauma treated with robot-assisted excision through a retroauricular hairline approach.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 19-month-old Asian baby girl visited the otolaryngology department for the evaluation of a sudden swelling in the left side of her neck, which had been found by her parents after a fall in the bathtub on the day of the outpatient clinic visit. Other than having a prominent swelling in the left side of her neck, the girl was asymptomatic. A physical examination showed a 4 × 4 cm sized cystic mass in the posterior triangle of the left side of her neck with a bluish hue over the neck skin. Over the course of 2 months of follow-up at the outpatient clinic, the left neck swelling decreased slightly to 3 × 3 cm in size with subsequent resolution of the bluish skin coloration. Subsequent computed tomography imaging of her neck showed a well-encapsulated cystic mass in the left side of her neck posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Fig. 1 ). To avoid leaving a visible scar in her neck, robot-assisted excision was performed via a small retroauricular hairline approach. A self-retaining retractor, the Yang’s retractor \\[ 3 \\] was first applied through a 3-cm trans-hairline skin incision after the elevation of a 7-cm skin flap (Fig. 2 ). Robot-assisted excision was performed successfully via a 7-cm-long skin flap tunnel (Fig. 3 , Additional file 1 : Video 1). The mass showed the presence of a bloody-colored serous fluid. The final pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of cystic hygroma. The follow-up visit 3 months postoperatively showed no evidence of recurrence and the scar was well hidden in the hairline (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Neck computed tomography scan with contrast enhancement. **a** axial scan and **b** coronal scan; there is a 3 cm × 3 cm sized, well-encapsulated homogenous low-density mass in the left posterior triangle neck area ( _arrows_ )\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Intraoperative findings: retroauricular hairline approach with a 3-cm skin incision in the hairline and via 7-cm skin flap tunnel\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Robot-assisted excision via a small retroauricular incision was facilitated by the application of the Yang’s retractor\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 4**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Follow-up visit 3 months postoperatively showed the incision scar well hidden in the hairline\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Cystic hygromas represent 2.5–5 % of benign congenital cervical masses, generally appearing as a spontaneous growth of preexisting subclinical lesions \\[ 4 \\]. In our case, the child developed a large neck mass after a fall in the bathtub. Trauma as an etiology for the development of cystic hygroma has been previously suggested, especially when it occurred in an adult \\[ 5 \\]. We believe that the child probably had a preexisting lymphatic malformation and blunt trauma to the neck led to bleeding into the cystic cavity with the development of a noticeable cystic hygroma.\n\n【30】The treatment of cystic hygroma remains challenging for pediatric head and neck surgeons, especially when the parents are often concerned about the permanent cosmetic outcome. In addition, surgical excision carries the risk of damaging the surrounding nerves and blood vessels, scarring, and recurrence due to incomplete excision \\[ 6 \\]. Other alternative treatment modalities developed with the intent of improving cosmetic outcome, or for patients who are poor candidates for surgery, including watchful waiting, sclerotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, the transoral approach, and endoscope-assisted excision \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【31】The robot-assisted excision using the retroauricular approach has recently been reported for branchial cleft cysts, which usually occur in an older age group between the ages of 10 and 50 years \\[ 8 \\]. Compared to endoscopic surgery, robotic surgery has the advantages of a three-dimensional view, more flexibility with a wider range of motion, and tremor-free movements, which are very important in a limited working space in the neck area especially in the pediatric population.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】This present case reports a successful robot-assisted excision of cystic hygroma through a concealed and minimally invasive retroauricular hairline incision in a child less than 2 years of age. The innovative use of the Yang’s retractor helps to elevate the skin flap, maintain the working field, and provide space for introduction of surgical instruments of the robotic Da Vinci Si surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). With improvements in surgical techniques and instrumentation, the treatment of cystic hygroma is now feasible through a minimally invasive robot-assisted surgery, hence potentially improving not only the cosmetic outcome but also the life quality of these patients typically afflicted with the disease early in their lives.

Even rarer is a bilateral traumatic distal Achilles tendon sleeve rupture, with outcomes of such injury unknown. The following case report describes this rare injury, not reported to date elsewhere.\n\n【3】### Case\n\n【4】A 57-year-old Finnish man with no predisposing medical history had a traumatic bilateral distal Achilles tendon sleeve avulsion injury. Clinical and radiological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment included suture anchors in a modified suture bridge style with customized rehabilitation protocol postoperatively. Symptoms continued to be relieved at 1 year postoperatively.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】A modified suture bridge style and meticulous rehabilitation protocol including motivated patient contributed to very satisfying results in this very rare bilateral injury.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】With the increase in sports participation and the growing number of people maintaining an active lifestyle in recent times, an upward trend of tendon injuries, with Achilles tendon contributing to approximately 20% of all tendon injuries, has been observed \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the body, with the capacity to withstand up to 12 times the individual’s body weight \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. The incidence rate of Achilles tendon rupture is 7–40 per 100,000 person-years and suggested to be increasing; hence, it is the most common lower extremity tendon injury \\[ 10 \\]. The rupture is mostly found 2–6 cm from the insertion site, otherwise known as the avascular zone \\[ 2 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. This injury occurs most frequently in the 4th–5th decades, being twice as common in males, following a sporting activity \\[ 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Less commonly, the tendon can be ruptured distally at its calcaneal insertion, either as an avulsion fracture with a bony piece from the calcaneus or as a continuous sleeve avulsion rupture without any bony fragment \\[ 1 , 2 , 6 , 14 \\]. This complex injury poses a tricky clinical management issue since there is minimal tissue to assist in direct repair of the tendon onto the insertion site \\[ 6 \\]. Generally, patients who present with this injury have specific risk factors, for example, insertional Achilles tendinopathy, tendon degeneration, calcific spur formation, steroid therapy, or small transverse microtears, which over time may progress to complete tears \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【10】Even less common is the occurrence of simultaneous bilateral ruptures, with a reported incidence of < 1% overall \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. These are usually mid-tendon ruptures with predisposing risk factors. A few case reports have been published on traumatic bilateral Achilles tendon ruptures without risk factors \\[ 8 , 10 \\]. A case report in 2016 described such an incident and demonstrated the use of ultrasonography in diagnosis \\[ 8 \\]. However, bilateral sleeve avulsion of Achilles tendon is exceptionally rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of simultaneous bilateral sleeve avulsion and its treatment, follow-up, and recovery.\n\n【11】Case details\n------------\n\n【12】A 57-year-old Finnish male patient presented with a history of high blood pressure and obesity (116 kg, BMI 43) and two gastrointestinal surgeries (no malignancies); otherwise, no chronic illnesses. He had no previous injections of cortisone or administration of fluoroquinolone-type medication, but symptoms were present in the Achilles tendon area bilaterally, which were treated in a conservative manner. No previous imaging \\[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and so on\\]. The ankles were fit to perform sportive activities. The patient was playing badminton and charging the net when he suddenly heard and felt two consecutive snaps from the ankles. He was transferred to the Helsinki University Hospital Emergency Department, and after clinical and radiological evaluations (Fig. 1 ), both ankles were further examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The diagnosis was bilateral sleeve avulsion of the Achilles tendon (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】X-rays showing no bony traumas on either side\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Magnetic resonance imaging showing complete avulsion of the Achilles tendons from calcaneus insertions\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Both Achilles tendons were operated on in the same session 3 days after the injury using suture anchors \\[JuggerKnot (left ankle) and FASTak (right ankle)\\] with a modified suture bridge style. Four anchors were placed in the figure of a square, but the lower anchors used Krackow sutures to get larger purchase from the tendon. The proximal anchor sutures were pulled through the tendon and used as a more classical style of suture bridge with the tails of lower suture anchors (Fig. 3 a–c). The postoperative rehabilitation protocol is presented in Table 1 .\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**a** Left ankle after exposure. **b** Left ankle after fixation\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Table 1 Postoperative rehabilitation protocol**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】The patient filled in Foot and Ankle Outcome Survey (FAOS) questionnaires evaluating preinjury levels (naturally posthumously relying on his memory 2 days after the injury), preoperatively (2 days after the injury/1 day before the operation), and then during every follow-up visit at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, evaluating both ankles separately (Fig. 4 a and b). The right side had problems with wound healing and wound revision was performed bedside 3 weeks postoperatively by administering negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Both wounds were healed at 12 weeks postoperatively. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was quite satisfied and pain free. At the 1 year follow-up—the final control visit—the patient felt satisfied with the outcome and was symptom free, but was unable to return to running and jumping activities due to fear of re-injury. Otherwise, the rehabilitation was a success and formatted to everyday routine. At this follow-up, our skilled physical therapist/research assistant performed American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) measurement and additional testing. Both ankles were also evaluated with MRIs (Fig. 5 a and b).\n\n【29】**Fig. 4**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】**a** Foot and Ankle Outcome Survey results for right ankle. **b** Foot and Ankle Outcome Survey results for left ankle\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Fig. 5**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】**a** Magnetic resonance imaging from the right ankle 12 months postoperatively. **b** Magnetic resonance imaging from the left ankle 12 months postoperatively\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】AOFAS score was 100 on the right side and 97 on the left side (hindfoot motion slightly decreased). QoL (quality of life) was limited to 81 because of the changes that the patient chose to make to avoid possible re-injury. FAOS score was 98 in both ankles, and improvements were noted in every subcategory; all of them were better than before the injury (Fig. 4 a and b).\n\n【38】The patient could do repetitive toe raises up to 38 repetitions on the right and 44 repetitions on the left side. The circumferences of the calves were 45/45 cm, respectively, and 5 cm proximally from the ankle 23/24 cm, respectively. There was no need to change shoes or occupation because of the injury.\n\n【39】After the follow-up visit, the patient was encouraged to increase the workload to get back to the activities that were important for QoL preceding the injury.\n\n【40】The patient was contacted 5 years after the injury. He remained very satisfied with the result and reported no pain or symptoms. He has continued rehabilitation training and perceives his ankles to be in better shape than before the injury. He also lost 8 kg during the rehabilitation period. He is able to play golf and run, but, unfortunately, he has given up badminton.\n\n【41】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【42】A literature review yielded no similar cases. Articles that have been written on this topic concern unilateral incidents. Previously, the decision on how to manage this injury was divided into nonoperative versus operative cases, especially between the general population and athletes given their different demands, with no general consensus of a “standard” treatment technique \\[ 1 , 5 , 13 \\]. Later on, the results have shown that both groups benefit from operative treatment, with the advantages far outweighing the risks \\[ 15 \\]. Abundant research has been conducted over the years to optimize the repair of the distal Achilles tendon surgically, using titanium anchors, transosseus drilling, whip stitch technique, or V–Y plasty if necessary \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 16 \\]. Within the last 3 years, however, there has been a move toward less invasive techniques to overcome some of the risks of surgery, especially wound breakdown or infection \\[ 2 , 3 , 12 , 17 \\]. These techniques involve small incisions over the site of surgery averaging 3–5 cm longitudinally, with one study describing use of ipsilateral semitendinosus autografting to restore continuity of the tendon \\[ 3 \\]. When combined with ultrasonography guidance, improved visualization is achieved with minimal wound length \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【43】Most earlier studies have had a follow-up period of 2–5 years, with the general consensus showing improvement to preoperative scores \\[ 2 , 4 , 7 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 18 \\]. The AOFAS score was most commonly used, with all studies showing significant improvement postoperatively, except when linked to patients with higher BMI (body mass index); in that case, the scores were actually worse \\[ 4 \\]. The functionality outcomes of the suture anchor technique focused on postoperative tendon elongation and end-range flexion weakness, with no visually altered gait found in participants \\[ 1 \\]. Patients were generally able to return to full sporting activity by 9 months postoperatively with this minimally invasive technique; that is, they had a shorter and earlier rehabilitation period and improved ankle function recovery with a full return to sports \\[ 18 \\]. Heel pain also seems to continue to decrease over time to complete resolution \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【44】Our patient had a marked improvement in FAOS score, attaining a level that was even better than before the injury. The patient had a history of Achilles tendon symptoms, and thus, the postoperative comprehensive and meticulous rehabilitation may have had a huge impact on symptoms and performance. The major improvement, with clinical significance, occurred during the first 3 months (ADL and pain) \\[ 19 \\], but because of residual symptoms sportive activities as well as quality of life suffered, which nevertheless continued improving at least up to 6–12 months postoperatively. It might be that the injury had an impact on how the patient handles difficult situations, and he learned to cope with them better, leading to evaluating possible residual symptoms as less uncomfortable.\n\n【45】The patient and his surgeons are very satisfied with the result of treating this rare injury pattern with modified suture bridge style anchoring and meticulous rehabilitation.\n\n【46】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【47】The datasets used during the study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography revealed an anomalous course of his bilateral vertebral arteries, both of which showed a persistent first intersegmental artery that entered the spinal canal at the caudal portion of the C1 posterior arch. In this case, the arteries were nearly pinched between the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of the C2.

In this case, transient brain ischemia caused by the anomalous course of vertebral arteries that were pinched between the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of C2 in cervical motion was the suspected cause of the syncope.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Syncope can arise through several mechanisms; one well-known cause is the vasodepressor reflex. Syncope can also be related to compression of the extracranial arteries in the neck\\[ 1 \\]. Anomalies in the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) may be a cause of syncope, but appear to be extremely rare\\[ 2 \\]. Mechanisms of syncope relating to CVJ anomalies remain unclear. We present here a pediatric case involving recurrent syncope and anomaly of the CVJ. The suspected mechanisms of syncope in the present case are discussed.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 10-year-old Japanese boy with a 2-year history of sleep attacks or syncope was referred to our orthopedic department because his mother noted that he had been experiencing frequent falls. He had been followed up by a pediatric orthopedist for asymptomatic congenital kyphoscoliosis with vertebral malformations in the thoracolumbar spine. He was treated for narcolepsy by a psychiatrist, but no clear diagnostic evidence was apparent, such as abnormalities on electroencephalography. On first presentation to this department, he suddenly lost consciousness. The attack seemed more like syncope than a narcoleptic episode. The mother said he experienced such attacks three to five times a day, with each episode lasting from 30 seconds to a few minutes. After each attack, he usually fell asleep. He showed neither motor weakness nor sensory loss in his upper or lower extremities, and no bladder dysfunction was evident, but generalized hyperreflexia was identified. Electrocardiography showed normal results, and we did not observe any bradycardia at the time of syncope. Breathing likewise remained normal during syncope.\n\n【13】Plain lateral radiography of his CVJ showed abnormal alignment with a clivo-axial angle (the angle formed by lines drawn along the clivus and the posterior aspect of the odontoid process) of 112° (normal, 150 to 180°; Figure 1 A)\\[ 3 \\]. Lateral radiographies in flexion and extension positions showed significant instability between C1 and C2. Computed tomography (CT) and three-dimensional (3D)-CT of his CVJ showed an anteriorly tilted odontoid process of C2 and a hypoplastic C1 posterior arch with rachischisis (spina bifida) that was migrating into his foramen magnum (Figures 1 B and 1 C). His bilateral lateral atlantoaxial joints were dislocated anteriorly and his C1 anterior arch was hypertrophied. Magnetic resonance imaging showed basilar invagination and compression of his spinal cord at the C1 level (Figure 1 D). Subsequent 3D-CT angiography showed abnormal courses of bilateral vertebral arteries (VAs; Figure 1 E). Both VAs showed a “first persistent intersegmental artery” that entered his spinal canal at the caudal portion of the C1 posterior arch after emerging from the C2 transverse foramen, without passing through the C1 transverse foramen. These arteries appeared to be nearly pinched between the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of C2. The VAs at the subaxial spine were not hypoplastic. Based on these findings, we suspected that the cause of syncope was this arterial anomaly at his CVJ, and transient brain ischemia could be caused by these anomalous courses of the VAs being pinched between the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of C2 during cervical motions, especially in flexion. Posterior decompression and occiput-cervical fusion was therefore planned for decompression of the spinal cord and to prevent compression of the first persistent intersegmental arteries during motion.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**Preoperative imaging of the craniovertebral junction. (A)** Lateral radiography shows malalignment of the craniovertebral junction. **(B)** Midsagittal reconstruction from computed tomography shows an anteriorly tilted odontoid process of C2 and migration of a hypoplastic C1 posterior arch into the foramen magnum. **(C)** Posterolateral view of three-dimensional computed tomography shows migration of the C1 posterior arch into the foramen magnum and rachischisis (spina bifida) of the C1 posterior arch. **(D)** Midsagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging shows compression of the spinal cord by the basilar invagination and an anteriorly shifted C1 posterior arch. **(E)** Posteroinferior view of three-dimensional computed tomography angiography shows anomalous courses of bilateral vertebral arteries (persistent first intersegmental artery), which were located between the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of C2. Asterisks, odontoid process; arrowheads, C1 anterior arch.\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】C1 laminectomy and posterior occiput-cervical fusion (O-C2) were performed using an instrumentation system (VERTEX® MAX; Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN, USA). Intraoperatively, the migrated C1 posterior arch was repositioned after skull traction and we were able to reach the upper surface of C1. Decompression of his foramen magnum was therefore not required for C1 laminectomy. A portion of the C1 posterior arch rachischisis consisted of tendon-like tissue that adhered severely to the dura. During C1 laminectomy, the locations of VAs were detected using Doppler ultrasonography. C2 pedicle screws were inserted with the assistance of a navigation system (Stealth Station®; Medtronic Sofamor Danek). After C1 laminectomy and screwing, monocortical autologous bone was harvested from the right posterior iliac crest and grafted between the decorticated posterior surfaces of the occipital bone and C2.The postoperative course was uneventful. Occiput-cervical alignment appeared improved after surgery, with a clivo-axial angle of 130° (Figure 2 A). Since the surgery, he has not experienced any episodes of syncope. Cervical orthosis was applied for 6 weeks. Bone union was confirmed on CT at 4 months postoperatively (Figure 2 B). As of the latest follow-up at 3.5 years postoperatively, he still showed no syncope, and was able to walk and run without falls.\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】**Postoperative imaging of the craniovertebral junction. (A)** Lateral radiography shows improved alignment of the craniovertebral junction. **(B)** A midsagittal reconstruction of computed tomography obtained 4 months postoperatively shows complete bone union.\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Congenital anomalies in the CVJ can cause numerous symptoms\\[ 4 \\]. In an analysis of 576 surgically treated patients with anomalies in the CVJ, motor dysfunction including weakness and spasticity, sensory dysfunction, dysfunction of the vestibular cerebellum including ataxia and nystagmus, cranial nerve dysfunction including swallowing difficulty and choking on water, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms\\[ 4 \\]. All these symptoms were neurological symptoms. Syncope may also occur in patients with CVJ malformation (Table 1 ), but appears to be extremely rare compared with the aforementioned symptoms.\n\n【25】**Table 1 **Reported cases of craniovertebral junction malformation and syncope****\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Corbett _et al_ .\\[ 2 \\] reported a case of syncope precipitated by sneezing in a 29-year-old man in association with Arnold–Chiari type I malformation and basilar invagination. In that case, suboccipital craniectomy and C1-C2 laminectomies alleviated the symptoms and the authors speculated that an abnormally acute clivo-axial angle (120°), small foramen magnum, and type I Chiari malformation appeared to represent a combination of features intolerant of Valsalva-induced changes in cerebral volume, brainstem position, cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, or blood vessel relationships\\[ 2 \\]. Pratiparnawatr _et al_ .\\[ 5 \\] reported the case of a 31-year-old man with basilar invagination and syringomyelia who showed cough-induced syncope. However, that patient also exhibited downbeat nystagmus, atrophy and fasciculation of the right side of the tongue, atrophy of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, mild weakness of the extremities, and generalized hyperreflexia. The cause of syncope was unclear in that case\\[ 5 \\].\n\n【28】In the present case, although neurological factors might also have been involved, we speculated that brain ischemia caused by direct compression of bilateral anomalous VAs relating to the CVJ malformation was the major cause of syncope. Two types of anomalous course of VAs have been reported\\[ 6 – 9 \\]. One is a “fenestration”, showing VA duplication after emerging from the C2 transverse foramen; one branch enters the spinal canal between C1 and C2 and the other runs normally, passing through the C1 transverse foramen and entering the spinal canal on the cranial side of the posterior arch. The other is a “persistent first intersegmental artery (without persistence of the primary VA)”, showing the artery entering the spinal canal at the caudal portion of the C1 posterior arch after emerging from the C2 transverse foramen, without passing through the C1 transverse foramen. Incidences of these two VA anomalies have been reported as 0.24 to 1.0% and 0.6 to 4.7%, respectively, in 300 to 1436 patients who had no symptoms from cervical spine lesions\\[ 6 – 8 \\]. Usually, these VA anomalies occur unilaterally\\[ 6 , 9 , 10 \\], and bilateral cases appear to be rare. Hong _et al_ .\\[ 6 \\] reported that the incidence of bilateral persistent first intersegmental artery among 1013 subjects was 0.8% compared with 3.8% for unilateral cases.\n\n【29】Our patient showed bilateral persistent first intersegmental arteries. Bilateral persistent first intersegmental arteries usually exist on the surface of the soft dura at the C1 level, so spinal motion does not interfere with blood flow in the anomalous artery. However, in the present case, 3D-CT angiography clearly showed the arteries lying between the two hard structures of the C1 posterior arch and the pars interarticularis of C2. The persistent first intersegmental arteries in this patient must therefore have been pinched at this level by the C1 posterior arch and pars interarticularis of C2 during cervical motions, particularly in flexion. Subsequent changes to blood flow in the basilar artery would then have induced transient cerebral ischemia, resulting in syncope. In addition, the fact that this patient only experienced minor neurological symptoms (hyperreflexia and frequent falls, but no motor or sensory deficits) supports the hypothesis that transient brain ischemia caused by the anomalous courses of the VAs was the major cause of syncope in this case. Bow hunter’s syndrome, also referred to as rotational VA occlusion syndrome\\[ 11 \\], is a rare vascular phenomenon that can be a differential diagnosis for transient cerebral ischemia caused by VA compression. However, bow hunter’s syndrome usually occurs with cervical rotation in patients with an anatomically normal skeleton and VAs, whereas syncope in the present case was not induced by cervical rotation but rather suspected flexion in a patient with skeletal anomaly and bilateral anomalous VAs. We therefore excluded the possibility of bow hunter’s syndrome in the present case.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【31】We have presented an extremely rare case of congenital anomaly in the CVJ resulting in recurrent syncope. Posterior decompression and occiput-cervical fusion relieved all symptoms. Symmetrical anomaly of the VAs (bilateral persistent first intersegmental arteries) pinched by the osseous structures (C1 posterior arch and pars interarticularis of C2) during occipital-cervical motion was the suspected cause of syncope.\n\n【32】Consent\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardians for publication of this case report and the accompanying images.

The I-gel supralaryngeal seal has shown promising efficacy for both spontaneous and controlled ventilation under general anesthesia. The recommended, standard I-gel insertion technique is relatively challenging due to its shape and cuff size. Usually, the I-gel becomes entrapped at the oral cavity and requires excessive force to negotiate across the oropharynx, resulting in insertion resistance, tongue obstruction, insertion failure, and intraoral trauma.

The modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique could be considered as an alternative in adults when difficulty is encountered with the standard I-gel insertion technique.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The I-gel is a second-generation supraglottic airway device that is built with a noninflatable elliptical gel material cuff and has a wide semirigid stem. The design and placement of the I-gel are almost similar to those of the laryngeal mask airway \\[ 1 \\]. The I-gel supralaryngeal seal has shown promising efficacy for both spontaneous and controlled ventilation under general anesthesia \\[ 2 \\]. The manufacturer’s recommended standard I-gel insertion technique is relatively challenging due to its shape and material, usually causing insertion resistance, tongue obstruction, insertion failure, and intraoral trauma \\[ 3 \\]. Various authors have recommended alternative I-gel insertion techniques such as tongue stabilization \\[ 4 \\], rotational I-gel insertion \\[ 5 \\], and triple I-gel maneuvers \\[ 6 \\]. The author has also published a modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique \\[ 3 \\] as a letter to the editor. This case series of ten patients describes the modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique in patients requiring a supraglottic airway device for 15–120 minute duration of below-umbilical surgical procedures.\n\n【10】Case series\n-----------\n\n【11】In this case series, ten male and female Indo-Aryan group of Asian patients aged 18–60 years scheduled for elective short to intermediate surgical procedures were recruited for the modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique. Pregnant patients as well as those with Mallampati score III and IV, anticipated difficult airway, body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , and known history of acid peptic disease were excluded. I-gel insertion was performed by an experienced (more than 1000 placements) anesthesiologist at Aga Khan University Hospital. This case series is part of an ongoing randomized control trial. Patient consent was obtained, and baseline vital signs such as electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation readings were recorded. Following preoxygenation, propofol 2 mg/kg was administered for anesthesia induction and nalbuphine 0.1 mg/kg for analgesia. The I-gel preinsertion preparation was confirmed, and anesthetic depth was confirmed by jaw relaxation and unresponsiveness of eyelash reflexes. A size 3 I-gel was used for patients weighing less than 50 kg, and size 4 for patients with weight of 50–90 kg. Before applying the modified jaw thrust technique, patients were positioned in sniffing the morning air position with extension of the atlanto-occipital joint along with slight flexion of neck, and the chin was gently pressed down. The I-gel was firmly grasped by the operator at the level of the integral bite block mark, and insertion was initiated with the I-gel cuff outlet facing toward the patient’s chin. The soft tip was inserted into the mouth in a direction toward the hard palate and gently slid to park in the oral cavity. At this stage, both of the operator’s hands were repositioned to thrust the jaw by lifting the angle of the mandibles with the little fingers. Other fingers were used to stabilize the jaw, and force was applied with both thumbs to slide the parked I-gel into the hypopharynx into its final placement position \\[ 3 \\]. Successful I-gel insertion was confirmed by capnographic tracing, adequate filling of reservoir bag in spontaneously breathing patients, and appropriate chest expansion on gentle hand ventilation in apneic patients. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration of 1.2, and oxygen and nitrous oxide ratio of 40%/60%. The I-gel was removed in all patients in deep anesthesia at completion of the surgical procedure. Patients’ demographic variables, anesthesia and surgical durations, I-gel insertion attempts, I-gel insertion resistance, I-gel placement time duration, and insertion complications such as laryngospasm, hypoxemia, and airway trauma (blood-stained I-gel at removal) were assessed in all ten cases. The rescue technique was the standard I-gel insertion technique after three consecutive failure attempts with the modified jaw thrust technique.\n\n【12】Case discussion and conclusion\n------------------------------\n\n【13】Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) have an established role in anesthesia practice, as well as for rapid-response care givers. To improve patient safety, several modifications and refinements in their structure and insertion technique have been redefined. However, several features such as minimal gas flow resistance, adequate airway seal pressure for both spontaneous and positive pressure ventilation, compatibility with surgical procedures (laparoscopy, pregnancy, and in obese patients), negligible pulmonary aspiration risk, better first-attempt insertion rates for experienced, novice, and prehospital care staff, and manageable complication rates still require attention \\[ 1 \\]. The I-gel can deliver adequate oropharyngeal leak pressure and gastric access with comparable insertion speed and successful insertion attempts. However, the shape and cuff size of the I-gel mean that it usually becomes entrapped at the oral cavity and requires force to pass through the oropharynx, resulting in insertion trauma. The author proposed a modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique, which was found to enable smooth intraoral I-gel negotiation by providing adequate space in the oropharynx \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【14】This case series recruited five male and five female patients who underwent general anesthesia. Patients were similar in age, weight, ASA status, anesthesia, and surgical duration (Table 1 ). A 100% first-attempt insertion rate was observed, along with negligible insertion resistance and convinciing insertion time duration (Table 2 ). The I-gel insertion time duration was noted to be 11.1 ± 4.25 seconds, and a blood-stained I-gel was observed in one male patient (Table 2 ). Barman _et al._ \\[ 7 \\] tested a two-person jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique and found a first-attempt insertion rate of 92.5%, while another author reported a rate of 96% with reverse I-gel insertion versus 86% with the standard technique \\[ 5 \\]. The I-gel insertion time duration was superior (11.1 ± 4.25 seconds) in this case series compared with the two-person jaw thrust technique (14.025 ± 1.99 seconds), reverse I-gel insertion technique (17.5 ± 6.5 s), or standard technique (20.8 ± 5.9 seconds). The incidence of trauma (blood-stained I-gel) in our study was 10%, compared with 5% in the two-person jaw thrust technique. The modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion works by creating an adequate intraoral space for the I-gel to negotiate the hypopharynx smoothly along with stabilization of the device in the center of the oral cavity. It has the added advantage of one-person operator harmonization to thrust the jaw compared with requiring the assistance of a second person to facilitate the jaw thrust in the two-person jaw thrust insertion technique. A randomized control trial with a larger number of patients will confirm the reliability of this technique and help to establish its role in clinical practice. This case series found that the modified jaw thrust I-gel insertion technique is practical and facilitates intraoral negotiation with minimal resistance, an insignificant complication rate, and an excellent first-pass insertion rate. This technique could be considered in adults as an alternative when difficulty is encountered with the standard I-gel insertion technique.\n\n【15】**Table 1 Patients’ demographics and anesthesia and surgical durations**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】**Table 2 I-GEL: number of insertion attempts, insertion duration, insertion resistance, and insertion complications**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【20】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Mass-related symptoms in patients with autoimmune hypophysitis are treated with anti-inflammatory therapy, surgery, and/or radiotherapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a 25-year-old White man with visual field defects of the right eye, headache, and weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a sellar mass, and the patient underwent transcranial surgery. Histopathology revealed autoimmune hypophysitis with predominantly CD20 positive B-cell infiltration. Progression of visual field defects necessitated postoperatively anti-inflammatory treatment with prednisolone. Azathioprine was initiated under gradual tapering of prednisolone with stable conditions at first, but relapse followed after dose reduction. Therefore, rituximab treatment was initiated, which resulted in regression of the pituitary mass. Rituximab treatment was discontinued after 25 months. The patient has continuously been in remission for 4 years after rituximab treatment was stopped.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case illustrates that rituximab might be an effective alternative treatment in B-cell predominant autoimmune hypophysitis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Hypophysitis is a rare condition characterized by inflammatory infiltration of the pituitary gland. Hypophysitis can be divided into two main categories: primary hypophysitis (autoimmune, granulomatous, xanthomatous, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related, or necrotizing inflammation) and secondary hypophysitis. Primary hypophysitis has an incidence of ~ 1 in 9 million per year \\[ 1 \\]. The most common form of primary hypophysitis is autoimmune hypophysitis (AH). AH has a strong female preponderance with the majority of cases identified during late pregnancy or postpartum. AH is confirmed histologically and immunohistochemically by lymphocytic infiltration (mostly T and B lymphocytes), plasma cells, histiocytes, and fibrosis \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Secondary causes of hypophysitis include infectious and systemic diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), sellar/parasellar lesions, and drug-therapy-induced hypophysitis \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【10】Pituitary inflammation in hypophysitis usually results in enlargement of the pituitary gland with sellar compression and compression of the surrounding neurological structures including the optic chiasm. Therefore, patients often present with headache with or without nausea and visual disturbances \\[ 3 \\]. The infiltrative inflammation of the pituitary gland can affect different parts of the pituitary gland, resulting in a broad symptomatology including anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, hyperprolactinemia, and diabetes insipidus. AH is considered to have a predilection to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropin hormone, and growth hormone deficiencies. ACTH and TSH deficiencies are very frequent in the early stages of AH unlike pituitary adenomas, which results in increased risk of life-threatening adrenal insufficiency \\[ 4 , 7 \\].\n\n【11】Typically, in primary hypophysitis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella region shows an enlarged symmetric homogeneous pituitary gland, a thickened but not deviated stalk, and an intact sellar floor \\[ 7 \\]. MRI findings cannot distinguish hypophysitis from the more common differential diagnoses of pituitary mass, that is, pituitary adenomas, germinomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and metastases. Approximately 40% of cases of primary hypophysitis are misdiagnosed preoperatively \\[ 8 \\]. Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosing hypophysitis. However, biopsy of a pituitary mass is rarely performed due to the risks of the procedure \\[ 3 , 9 \\]. Unlike other autoimmune endocrine diseases, measurement of anti-pituitary antibodies is not suitable for diagnosing AH \\[ 4 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis of hypophysitis is often due to a combination of clinical findings, radiology, and biochemical results \\[ 3 , 4 , 6 \\].\n\n【12】Treatment of AH consists of managing pituitary enlargement and substituting acute and persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Reduction of the pituitary enlargement is required in some cases where mass effects are present. In asymptomatic cases, conservative treatment with close follow-up is an alternative. Pituitary enlargement can be reduced by anti-inflammatory therapy, surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, or a combination of these types of intervention. High-dose glucocorticoids are the basis of anti-inflammatory therapy. Steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine (an anti-metabolic agent with immunosuppressive activity) are considered in the case of relapse with mass-related symptoms or increased mass size on MRI, need of long-term anti-inflammatory treatment, or intolerable adverse effects to glucocorticoids. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively induces apoptosis in B-lymphocytes, is approved for various immune-mediated disorders and has been used to manage recurrent AH in a few previous cases \\[ 3 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A previously healthy 25-year-old White man presented with a 1-year history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of about 30 kg. On physical examination, he had a body mass index of 28 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> and visual field defects in the right eye. Initial MRI showed a lightly spotted heterogeneous 19 × 16 × 19 mm tumor located suprasellarly, close to the pituitary gland with no ingrowth or association with the pituitary gland (Fig. 1 A). Endocrine evaluation revealed secondary hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone but intact thyrotroph and lactotroph axes. An ACTH test was performed with a subnormal cortisol response (30-minute cortisol 248 nmol/L, reference > 420 nmol/L) and low plasma ACTH concentration, indicating secondary adrenal insufficiency, and the patient started treatment with hydrocortisone. The somatotroph axis was not evaluated. Visual field measured by perimetry revealed visual field defects in the right eye.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】MRI scan showing pituitary enlargement in the T1-weighted sagittal (upper) and coronal section (lower). **A** Initial MRI before surgery. **B** Post-surgery with remnant pituitary tissue located just below the optic chiasm. **C** Relapse under treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone. **D** Almost complete regression of pituitary mass after rituximab treatment\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The tumor was initially diagnosed based on MRI as a craniopharyngioma for which reason the patient was referred to craniotomy as standard treatment. At surgery, the tumor appeared gray and reddish, and was capsulated and fragile with easy bleeding, unlike craniopharyngiomas with sharp, irregular borders, which have a tendency to adhere to vital neurovascular structures and often consist of cystic and/or solid parts \\[ 16 \\]. The pituitary tumor was partially resected, and a small amount of capsule remnant underneath the optic chiasm could not be surgically removed. Perioperative frozen section histological examination described the tumor as a possible malignant lymphoma due to lymphocytic infiltration.\n\n【20】The patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology at Odense University Hospital for further diagnostic workup and management of pituitary hormone deficiencies. Postoperatively, the patient was still affected by headache and visual deficits on ophthalmologic assessment. MRI showed regression of the pituitary mass (9 × 6 × 8 mm), but remnant pituitary tissue was located just below the optic chiasm (Fig. 1 B). Pituitary hormone insufficiency of all anterior axes and diabetes insipidus was diagnosed, and treatment with hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, testosterone, growth hormone, and desmopressin was implemented.\n\n【21】Endocrine evaluation did not support a hormone-producing adenoma. Sellar lymphoma is a very rare disease often related to immunodeficiency, for example HIV-related, or seen in immunocompetent patients who are over 60 years old \\[ 17 \\]. Metastasis was not suspected; the patient did not suffer from cancer in another location. Workup for infectious and rheumatologic etiologies was not indicative of secondary hypophysitis, nor was drug-related infiltration of the pituitary gland a possible differential diagnosis. Final histological diagnosis showed lymphoid reaction with predominant CD20 positive B-cell infiltration and no sign of significant IgG4 involvement. The patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hypophysitis.\n\n【22】Ten months postoperatively, the patient reported impaired vision. MRI showed that the remnant tissue lifted and exerted pressure at the optic chiasm. Perimetry confirmed progression of visual field defects in the right eye and now involvement of the left eye. Because of progression of visual field defects, treatment with glucocorticoid pulse therapy was initiated: methylprednisolone 500 mg infusion for 3 days, followed by reduced prednisolone doses, that is, 37.5 mg per day. Follow-up MRI after 1 month of glucocorticoid treatment (11 months postoperatively) demonstrated significant reduction of the pituitary mass and decreased pressure at the optic chiasm. Perimetry was unchanged. Treatment with prednisolone continued for 3 months.\n\n【23】The patient had intolerable adverse effects to glucocorticoid treatment with excessive weight gain of about 50 kg and cushingoid features. The need for long-term treatment led to initiation of steroid-sparing treatment with 150 mg azathioprine per day under gradual tapering of prednisolone (13 months postoperatively). Visual field defects improved, and repeated MRI showed additional regression of the remnant pituitary mass. Perimetry revealed stable conditions. Due to stable condition over 26.5 months, treatment with azathioprine was reduced. Control MRI after one and a half month showed recurrence with increasing mass in sella turcica causing mass effect on the optic chiasm. Treatment was resumed: azathioprine 100 mg per day in combination with prednisolone 37.5 mg per day.\n\n【24】Despite additional 11 months treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone treatment (52 months postoperatively), control MRI showed further progression with increasing pituitary mass size (11 × 6 × 7 mm) reaching the optic chiasm (Fig. 1 C). Treatment with rituximab was initiated: 1000 mg infusions 14 days apart, repeated every 12 months. This resulted in almost complete regression of pituitary mass (3 × 2 × 7 mm) evaluated by MRI (Fig. 1 D). Rituximab treatment was discontinued after 25 months (77 months postoperatively) because of stable disease. To date, the patient has been followed up for ten and a half years postoperatively. According to control MRI 4 years after end of treatment with rituximab, he is in sustained remission with unchanged pituitary mass size and no affection of the optic chiasm.\n\n【25】Discussions and conclusion\n--------------------------\n\n【26】AH progresses through initial stages of inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, edema, and enlargement to fibrosis and subsequent atrophy \\[ 11 \\]. Treatment with glucocorticoid pulse therapy has shown good response. In this case, the initial response to glucocorticoid treatment was good; however, the patient had intolerable adverse effects that led to change in treatment. Gutenberg _et al_ . showed reduction in pituitary size in 75% of patients with AH during pre- or postsurgical glucocorticoid treatment \\[ 18 \\]. However, relapse of AH is common and treatment with glucocorticoids, especially long-term treatment, is associated with a high risk of side effects (weight gain, psychiatric symptoms, edema, avascular bone necrosis, and diabetes mellitus). Honegger _et al_ . showed a recurrence rate at 38% and found a high rate of significant adverse effects under glucocorticoid pulse therapy (63% of involved patients) \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【27】If steroid treatment is discontinued either due to mass-related symptoms or due to intolerable adverse effects, other immunosuppressive therapy is considered. In this case, azathioprine was initiated under gradual tapering of prednisolone with stable conditions at first, but relapse followed after dose reduction. Azathioprine has been the most commonly used immunosuppressive agent; however, immunosuppressive or biological treatment directed at the predominant cell type involved may increase treatment efficacy \\[ 13 , 14 , 19 \\]. The infiltration of the pituitary gland in AH is typically a mixture of T and B cells, often with one cell type being more predominant than the other. Most lympholytic drugs primarily target T cells, such as azathioprine, whereas rituximab specifically binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, inducing apoptosis \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. Additionally, rituximab may reduce the antigen presentation, leading to T-cell inactivation \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. The potential effect of histologically guided treatment of AH is illustrated in a case reported by Xu _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] The patient was initially treated with prednisolone and methotrexate without effect and afterwards treated with infliximab (a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes tumor necrosis factor alpha). Due to recurrence of pituitary enlargement, a transsphenoidal biopsy was performed, showing CD20 positive B lymphocytes as the dominant cell type. Subsequently, treatment with rituximab resulted in long-term remission \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【28】Steroid-sparing treatment seems promising as a useful addition to glucocorticoids. There is no indication for rituximab in AH yet; however, it should be considered as an alternative treatment. Table 1 provides a brief summary of the papers reporting use of steroid-sparing therapies in AH, adding to the previous summary by Joshi _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\]. The case reports indicate good response to azathioprine and rituximab in patients with progression or recurrence as well as adverse effects to glucocorticoids.\n\n【29】**Table 1 Brief summary of cases using azathioprine or rituximab in autoimmune hypophysitis**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】The current case illustrates that, in treatment of AH where surgery and traditional immunosuppressive therapy is insufficient or intolerable, monoclonal antibody-directed therapy such as rituximab can be a preferable alternative.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Not applicable.\n\n【34】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【35】AH:\n\n【36】Autoimmune hypophysitis\n\n【37】ACTH:\n\n【38】Adrenocorticotropic hormone\n\n【39】TSH:\n\n【40】Thyroid-stimulating hormone\n\n【41】MRI:\n\n【42】Magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In both cases, along with opacification of the native lung over several days, the patients presented acute respiratory failure that required the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Eventually, hypoxemic respiratory failure resolved, but with rapid progression of fibrosis of the native lung.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We conclude that acute worsening of fibrosis on the native lung secondary to a severe viral infection should be added to the list of potential complications developing on the native lung after single lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Single lung transplantation (SLT) and bilateral lung transplantation are validated therapeutic options for managing advanced forms of chronic respiratory failure. The choice of the technique depends on the age, general condition, and lung pathology of the recipient. Worldwide, bilateral lung transplantation is now the most frequently used lung transplantation technique \\[ 1 \\], but SLT, which is technically simpler, may be a reasonable option for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung fibrosis who are ≥ 60–65 years old and/or present frailty or comorbid conditions \\[ 2 \\]. However, one major drawback of SLT is that recipients are exposed to complications involving the native lung \\[ 3 , 4 \\], such as infection, hemoptysis, pneumothorax, and neoplasia. In patients receiving SLT for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), fibrosis of the native lung usually worsens over time \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\], with no significant effects on gas exchange \\[ 9 \\]. Here, we describe two recipients of SLT for IPF who exhibited acute worsening of lung fibrosis after an episode of serious viral infection: cytomegalovirus primo-infection in one case and COVID 19 in the other. Before transplantation, the patients gave their consent to the anonymous utilization of their pre- and postoperative data.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Case 1\n\n【12】A 65-year-old Caucasian man underwent right SLT in January 2020 for IPF. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatch (positive donor, negative recipient) required valganciclovir prophylaxis. Lung perfusion scan performed 2 months after transplantation showed residual perfusion toward the native lung, at 43% of the total perfusion.\n\n【13】On quantitative PCR, the CMV DNA viral load became detectable in the blood (DNAemia) in April 2020, and was treated with therapeutic doses of valganciclovir. Despite this management, the viral load increased in May 2020, and intravenous CMV immunoglobulin was added to the therapeutic regimen.\n\n【14】The patient was hospitalized in July 2020 (day 1) with persistent CMV viral load, with no clinical arguments for CMV disease. The persistent viral load (with peak load of 411,303 copies) despite the use of intravenous ganciclovir initiated on admission prompted the search for CMV resistance (CMV genotype test), which revealed resistance to gangiclovir (UL97 genotype). Treatment with intravenous foscarnet was initiated on day 13, along with hydration to prevent acute deterioration of the renal function. Results of thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan performed on day 7 are shown in Fig. 1 A.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】CT of the thorax in patient 1, a 65-year-old man, at various times after right single lung transplantation (SLT) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). **A** Day 7 after hospital admission (day 1) for management of CMV infection in a patient with CMV mismatch. **B** Day 14, 1 day before the patient developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 16. **C** Day 19, while in the ICU for ARF. **D** Day 27, 1 day before discharge from the ICU. **E** Day 63, well after the ARF episode.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】On day 15, the respiratory status of the patient worsened, with fever, cough, and acute respiratory failure, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 16. On chest CT, mild pleural effusion and interlobular septal thickening in the lower part of the pulmonary field of the right grafted lung were the only imaging manifestations on day 14 (Fig. 1 B). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results were negative for bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens, except for CMV with a positive PCR result. Chest CT on day 19 (Fig. 1 C) showed a densification of the native lung as compared with the CT performed 5 days earlier with ground glass opacities of the left apex. The underlying mechanism of the acute respiratory failure was suspected to be pulmonary edema secondary to fluid overload associated with foscarnet infusion.\n\n【20】Despite large-spectrum antibiotic therapy and volume depletion, oxygen requirement increased (6 L/min on admission to the ICU, introduction of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy on day 17, up to 40 L/min, FiO <sub>2 </sub> 80% on day 20). Results of BAL, repeated on day 27, were negative for bacterial or fungal pathogens, and the CMV viral load on PCR was decreased. A chest CT performed on day 27 confirmed the marked densification of the native lung, along with the disappearance of the CT abnormalities on the right lung (Fig. 1 D). From day 26, the respiratory condition improved progressively, which allowed for discharge from the ICU to the general ward on day 28, with persistent requirement for oxygen therapy at rest (4 L/min). Meanwhile, CMV DNAemia decreased under foscarnet infusion.\n\n【21】From day 28 to final discharge from the hospital 45 days later, the patient showed slow respiratory improvement. Oxygen saturation at rest was 97% at the time of discharge from the hospital. When PCR revealed no CMV viral load, foscarnet was replaced with letermovir.\n\n【22】A chest CT performed well after the acute respiratory failure (day 63) showed a persistent densification of the native lung predominating on the lower field (Fig. 1 E). At no time during the course of the treatment was native lung biopsy considered because of the risks of morbidity/mortality of the procedure and the absence of an expected benefit for the patient.\n\n【23】### Case 2\n\n【24】In December 2019, a 62-year-old Caucasian man underwent right SLT for IPF. The early postoperative course was uneventful except for two episodes of acute cellular rejection on postoperative days (PODs) 40 and 90 that were treated with a bolus of methylprednisolone, which returned the FEV1 to the prerejection value. On lung perfusion scan performed on POD 60, 35% of the total lung perfusion was directed toward the left native lung. Chest CT results on POD 90 are shown in Fig. 2 A.\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】CT of the thorax in patient 2, a 62-year-old man, at different times after right SLT for IPF. **A** Postoperative day (POD) 90, before SARS-CoV-2 infection. **B** POD 104, when SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. **C** POD 110, at the time of transfer to the ICU for ARF. **D** POD 135, after discharge from the ICU. **E** POD 170 after discharge from the hospital.\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】In April 2020, the patient presented cough and decreased FEV1. Chest CT on POD 104 showed bilateral ground glass opacities with native lung predominance (Fig. 2 B). PCR nasopharyngeal swab results positive for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【30】The respiratory condition worsened over the following week and required oxygen therapy. Despite the introduction of lopinavir/ritonavir followed by remdesivir, breathlessness and oxygen requirement increased, so the patient was transferred to the ICU, where high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was initiated. Thoracic CT angiography performed on POD 110 showed worsening of the ground glass opacities (still with native lung predominance) (Fig. 2 C). BAL results were negative for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens (except for SARS-CoV-2).\n\n【31】After several days under high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (up to 40 L/min, 50% FiO <sub>2 </sub> ), the respiratory condition of the patient improved, which allowed for discharge from the ICU to the general ward on day 115 under 5 L/min nasal oxygen therapy. The improvement was slow over the following weeks, with a progressive decrease in oxygen requirement. On POD 135, thoracic CT revealed a regression of the ground glass opacities on the grafted side and a marked progression of pulmonary fibrosis on the native lung (Fig. 2 D). Lung perfusion scan performed on day 126 showed perfusion in the left lung representing 11% of the total perfusion. On the day of discharge from hospital (POD 155), the patient was weaned from oxygen at rest but needed oxygen upon exercise. PaO <sub>2 </sub> and PaCO <sub>2 </sub> values on that day, with room air at rest, were 63 and 38 mmHg, respectively. Thoracic CT performed on POD 170 revealed a normal appearance of lung parenchyma on the grafted side and marked fibrotic lesions on the native lung (Fig. 2 E).\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】After SLT, the native lung may be the target of possible complications, which may be a source of morbidity or mortality \\[ 3 , 10 , 11 \\]. If the underlying pathology is pulmonary fibrosis, the native lung is exposed to infection, including mycobacterial and fungal infection, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, neoplasia in the form of bronchopulmonary cancer, or lymphoproliferative disease. In general, lung fibrosis affecting the remaining lung is not by itself directly responsible for significant morbidity. The usual profile is that of a progressive worsening of lung fibrosis over time. In 21 patients who underwent SLT for IPF and were followed for an average of 35 months after transplant, sequential high-resolution chest CT revealed a progressive loss of lung volume and extension of the fibrotic lesions over time in the native lung \\[ 12 \\]. Similarly, in smaller studies retrospectively analyzing 5–13 SLT patients by use of a chest CT scoring system, other investigators described progressive worsening of fibrosis (and decrease in lung volume) in the native lung \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\]. In contrast with the usual profile of progressive worsening of lung fibrosis, acute worsening of pulmonary fibrosis in the native lung seems to be much less frequent. The Vancouver group reported a single observation: 4 years after SLT for IPF, the patient presented acute respiratory symptoms, the chest CT revealing ground glass opacities throughout the native lung, which were not present 3 months earlier, without recent abnormalities in the grafted lung \\[ 13 \\]. The diagnostic workup was negative, including microbiology analysis. Within 10 days, the native lung showed progressive opacification, which led to considering the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of IPF and to administer prednisone 1 mg/kg along with _N_ \\-acetylcysteine, with subsequent improvement of the native lung on high-resolution chest CT. Despite the absence of pathology confirmation, this observation is consistent with the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of IPF on the remaining lung. Recently, Marron _et al_ . described three IPF patients who experienced acute worsening of pulmonary fibrosis in the native lung after SLT \\[ 14 \\]. All three patients were seronegative for CMV and received a graft from a seropositive donor. More than 12 months after SLT, in a context of CMV primo-infection with positive results of CMV DNA quantitative PCR in the serum, the patients presented acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. There were no radiographic or chest CT signs of CMV pneumonia affecting the graft, but within several days, opacification of the native lung was observed. The patients received CMV curative therapy, and eventually hypoxemic respiratory failure resolved, but with rapid progression of fibrosis of the native lung.\n\n【34】Our two patients share several similarities with those described by Marron _et al_ . First, in both reports, patients showed rapid opacification (within several days) of the native lung. Whether the patients experienced acute exacerbation of IPF or simply rapid progression of pulmonary fibrosis is not clear from the reports by Marron _et al_ . Chest CT in both of our patients revealed a pattern of ground glass opacities superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of IPF despite the absence of histological data.\n\n【35】A second point common to both reports is that patients presented hypoxemic respiratory failure, along with the opacification of the native lung. In our case of CMV primo-infection, as in the three previously published cases, CMV DNA replication was detected in serum, but signs suggesting CMV pneumonia, known to mainly involve the lung allograft in case of SLT \\[ 4 \\], were missing on chest radiographs or chest CT. This observation raises the question of the mechanism of the hypoxemic respiratory failure presented by the patients. The severity of the parenchymal involvement of the native lung may have led to major ventilation/perfusion mismatch, with the progressive improvement of the respiratory condition mainly related to the subsequent decrease of the perfusion toward the native lung over time, rather than to antiviral treatment. Finally, both reports have in common a rapid progression of pulmonary fibrosis in a context of severe viral infection, which in our report was CMV primo-infection in one patient and COVID-19 in the other. The mechanism leading to the rapid progression of fibrosis may not be specific to CMV, but rather due to the direct viral aggression of an already injured parenchyma.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】In conclusion, acute worsening of fibrosis on the native lung secondary to a severe viral infection should be added to the list of potential complications developing on the native lung after SLT for pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【38】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】The data we present are available in our lung department in the form of electronic files (clinical, biological and imaging data).\n\n【40】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【41】SLT:\n\n【42】Single lung transplantation\n\n【43】IPF:\n\n【44】Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\n【45】CMV:\n\n【46】Cytomegalovirus\n\n【47】DNAemia:\n\n【48】CMV DNA viral load in the blood\n\n【49】ICU:\n\n【50】Intensive care unit\n\n【51】BAL:\n\n【52】Bronchoalveolar lavage\n\n【53】POD:\n\n【54】Postoperative day", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Bacteremia occurs mainly in the elderly or in immunodeficient individuals, with high mortality. _F. nucleatum_ is not the first cause of tonsillar infection in emergency departments, which are more often the consequence of a viral or streptococcal infection, but it is a risk factor for severe bacterial infection, especially in a viral pandemic context.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 25-year-old European woman with no history presented to the emergency department with fever (38.9 °C), pharyngeal symptoms, intermittent headaches, and alteration of general condition. On examination, she presented odynophagia associated with moderate tonsillar hypertrophy, her neck was painful but flexible. A rapid diagnostic test for beta-hemolytic group streptococcus was negative. First biological analyses revealed an inflammatory syndrome with C-reactive protein of 76 mg/L. Procalcitonin was measured secondarily, and was 2.16 µg/L. Faced with discordant clinical and biological findings, a lumbar puncture was performed, which came back negative. At hour eight, hypotension was observed but corrected after filling with physiological serum. The patient was hospitalized for monitoring, based on a hypothesis of severe viral presentation. At hour 24, pyrexia confirmed this hypothesis. A spontaneous but transient improvement and no new hemodynamic event led to early discharge. At day three, she was rehospitalized for increased and continuous headaches, without hemodynamic severity. A broad-spectrum probabilistic antibiotic therapy of ceftriaxone and metronidazole was started due to first blood cultures positive for anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, while waiting for identification of the pathogen. Three days later, _F. nucleatum_ was identified. According to the microbiological results, antibiotic therapy was adapted with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, and no further complications were observed during clinical or complementary examinations. The final diagnosis was a _F. nucleatum_ oropharyngeal infection complicated by bacteremia, without metastatic spread.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The etiologies of tonsillar infection are not limited to benign viruses or bacteria. These should not be overlooked in emergency medicine, especially when the clinical presentation is discrepant. A combination of early bacterial investigations as blood culture and close clinical monitoring is the only safe way to detect bacteremia, especially in immunocompetent patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Currently, treatment strategies for oropharyngeal infections and outcomes in primary care \\[ 1 \\] are based on recommendations linked to a high prevalence of streptococcus and viral agents. These are based on old epidemiological data \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】_Fusobacterium nucleatum_ is a commensal anaerobic bacterium present in the microbiota of the mouth and the digestive tract. The pathogenesis of _F. nucleatum_ is linked to acute and chronic periodontal lesions, and may lead to intraabdominal, head, and neck infections and abscesses \\[ 3 \\]. Moreover, at a systemic level, in cases of bacteremia, _F. nucleatum_ is associated with invasive pulmonary and abdominal infections \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【11】Here we present a low-symptomatic pharyngeal form of infection linked to _F. nucleatum_ complicated with bacteremia, managed in the emergency department (ED), in a patient with no predisposing risk factors. Immunosuppressive treatment, sepsis, and radiation therapy can be differential diagnoses of unusual bacteremia \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【12】In the literature, no data or clinical cases are available on nonspecific fusobacterium oropharyngeal presentations and their prognosis, especially in emergency medicine. This clinical case is a reminder that a diagnosis of bacterial infection should not be overlooked, even in a pandemic context such as Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19).\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 25-year-old European woman with no history presented to the ED with a 24-hour fever associated with vomiting, diffuse aches and pain, and intermittent headaches. The patient had no recent travel. On examination, her temperature was 38.9 °C, blood pressure was 109/72 mmHg, and heart rate was 104 beats/minute. At ear nose and throat (ENT) examination, the patient presented odynophagia associated with moderate tonsillar hypertrophy without cervical adenopathy; her dental status was good with no gingivitis; her neck was painful but flexible. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. A rapid diagnostic test for beta-hemolytic group streptococcus was negative. First biological analyses revealed an inflammatory syndrome with C-reactive Protein (CRP) 76 mg/L, hyperleukocytosis (16.6 g/L), and neutrophils 14.7 g/L. Protidemia was 77 g/L and metabolic acidosis was suspected with a bicarbonate level of 15 mmol/L and an anion gap of 20 mmol/L, indicating extracellular dehydration. Urine test strip was negative. Chest X-ray was normal. Blood cultures were grown. Procalcitonin (PCT) was measured secondarily, and was 2.16 µg/L. Faced with discordant clinical and biological findings (a low-symptomatic form of ENT infection with high PCT), a lumbar puncture was performed, which came back negative (Table 1 ).\n\n【15】**Table 1 Microbiological analyses during hospitalization**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】At hour eight, hypotension was observed (88/53 mmHg) but corrected after filling with 500 mL of physiological serum. The patient was hospitalized for monitoring, based on the hypothesis of a severe viral presentation, associated with metabolic acidosis and elevated biomarkers (Table 2 ). At hour 24, spontaneous pyrexia occurred, confirming this hypothesis. CRP was stable and no new hemodynamic event was observed (Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ). The patient was discharged home.\n\n【18】**Table 2 Biological analyses during hospitalization**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】**Fig. 1**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Evolution of blood pressure\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Evolution of heart rate\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 3**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Evolution of temperature\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】**Fig. 4**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】Evolution of pulsed oxygen saturation\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】**Fig. 5**\n\n【37】Evolution of pain score using a numeric scale (NS)\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】The patient returned to the ED on day three, with increased and continuous headaches, chills and aches, but no hemodynamic severity. Two hours after arriving in ED, first blood cultures came back positive for anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, while waiting for complete identification of the pathogen. Therefore, a probabilistic antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g/24 hours) and oral metronidazole (500 mg/8 hours) was started and the patient was hospitalized for 4 days. Three days later, additional blood cultures identified _F. nucleatum_ and the first antibiotic therapy was switched to an oral combination of amoxicillin (2 g/day) and clavulanic acid (125 mg/day) on day four for 10 days. Jugular venous thrombosis was searched by Doppler examination and found negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and syphilis serologies were negative, eliminating alternative diagnoses and immunodepression factors. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) serology showed an old immunization profile. The final diagnosis was an _F. nucleatum_ oropharyngeal infection complicated by bacteremia without metastatic spread.\n\n【40】Discussion\n----------\n\n【41】Anaerobic oropharyngeal infections are rare, and the most frequent pathogen involved is _Fusobacterium necrophorum_ , leading to Vincent’s angina or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis \\[ 6 \\] and, to a lesser extent, _F. nucleatum_ and other Fusobacteria. In young patients, Vincent’s angina is responsible for Lemierre’s syndrome, a known locoregional complication of upper airway infections caused by thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein. In addition, _Fusobacterium_ sp. are responsible for 1% of bacteremia of all origins, while 44% of bacteremia are related to anaerobic bacteria \\[ 7 \\]. The most common species are _F. nucleatum_ (60–70% of cases) and _F. necrophorum_ (25–30%). _F. nucleatum_ is less common in anaerobic oropharyngeal infections, but it must not be overlooked in the ED because it is frequently complicated by bacteremia \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【42】Low-symptomatic pharyngeal forms of _F. nucleatum_ infections, contrary to typical ENT clinical presentations of Vincent’s angina much better known by ED practitioners \\[ 6 \\], can complicate and delay the diagnostic process. This particular presentation can lead to delayed diagnosis and increased risk of systemic complications and extraoral metastatic infections (brain, liver, joints, heart). The mortality rate associated with _Fusobacterium_ sp. bacteremia varies from 5% to 47% \\[ 8 \\]. In the majority of cases, bacteremia occurs in older individuals, and immunodeficiency is one of the risk factors that must be investigated \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【43】The literature on the management in the ED of these ENT infections with a risk of bacteremia is rare. Numerous studies have focused on the high prevalence of _F. nucleatum_ in colorectal cancer and its potential severity in digestive disease \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【44】The present clinical case highlights the following: first, the need to be aware of major complications in cases of ENT infection without identified tonsillar infection, and second, the need to consider the possibility that these are not linked to classical aerobic bacteria as viral agents. Consequently, we should question our use of diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal infection and our antibiotic prescription decision in the ED: oropharyngeal infection associated with _F. nucleatum_ requires a different antibiotic treatment \\[ 4 \\] to that associated with group A streptococcus, the most frequent bacterial etiology (20%) \\[ 2 \\] targeted by current management algorithms \\[ 1 \\]. Fusobacterium species are naturally resistant to macrolides, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim molecules. Moreover, for _F. nucleatum_ , resistance to penicillin through the production of penicillinases is increasing (30% in Europe) \\[ 10 \\]. According to the prevalence of microbiological profiles in the general population, the common error is probably to consider a common oropharyngeal infection with a negative rapid diagnostic test for beta-hemolytic group streptococcus as a viral infection. The diagnostic process must follow an approach such as in urinary tract infections, considering negative rapid strip test. This is even more relevant in the current context, in which infection with COVID-19 is mainly sought when faced with an acute undifferentiated fever. Even though ENT manifestations in COVID-19 are less common than fever and cough, they can reach 44% in some studies \\[ 11 \\]. The clinical reasoning must systematically integrate the search for a bacterial infection and, in particular, carry out a blood culture when considered necessary.\n\n【45】This clinical case shows that low-symptomatic forms of ENT infection with alteration of general condition should be considered by analogy with febrile illness entity \\[ 12 \\], an important issue in emergency medicine: the final diagnosis of bacterial infection may not be complete, while systemic repercussions are kinetically at the forefront with a delayed initial diagnosis.\n\n【46】In this clinical case, a first step was facilitated by elevated serum biomarkers of inflammation, regularly implicated in severe bacterial infection \\[ 13 \\], and initial 36-hour hospital monitoring was decided. Clinical presentation could have led to the conclusion of a severe form of “common seasonal virosis” with transient poor hemodynamic tolerance, indicating hypovolemia by dehydration. However, biological elements associating hyperleukocytosis, elevated CRP, and PCT levels, alerted us to the possibility of a systemic bacterial infection. The use of biomarkers remains an aid in the initial phase of management (Figure 6 ), but does not always allow conclusions of bacterial origin.\n\n【47】**Fig. 6**\n\n【48】 \n\n【49】Complete management from presentation to discharge: treatments, outcomes\n\n【50】Full size image\n\n【51】In a second step, decreased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, associated with pyrexia, led to hospital discharge without indication for probabilistic antibiotic coverage \\[ 14 \\]. Few studies on CRP kinetics are available to guide intrahospital management of bacterial \\[ 15 \\] or viral infections, especially in the ED. An elevated CRP level despite antibiotic therapy is known to be useful to suspect a fluid collection, but its decrease has been poorly studied \\[ 14 \\]. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the relevance of the initial phase of management without antibiotic coverage.\n\n【52】Finally, it was the complete bacteriological diagnosis of _F. nucleatum_ bacteremia in a third and last step that allowed a targeted etiological treatment, after a delay of 3 days, linked to a long incubation period of the Fusobacterium genus (72–96 hours of anaerobic culture).\n\n【53】Fortunately, a first-reasoned probabilistic treatment was administered as soon as a Gram-negative anaerobic pathogen was identified on blood culture, 24 hours before the final diagnosis, and 48 hours after the ED presentation. Moreover, carrying out blood culture is an approach with a low impact on organizational constraints and a positive medicoeconomic balance, regarding the objective of preventing septic shock.\n\n【54】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【55】A diagnosis of nonstreptococcal bacterial oropharyngeal infection should not be overlooked in emergency medicine, especially when the clinical presentation is discrepant: nonspecific pharyngeal manifestations associated with septic presentation suggested by biological results. The early use of inflammatory biomarkers remains useful for initial management but can be confusing in case of a long diagnostic process, leading to a delay in introducing antibiotic therapy. A combination of early bacterial investigations as blood culture and close clinical monitoring is the most relevant strategy to detect bacteremia and to avoid erroneous hypotheses of virosis faced with pharyngeal symptomatology and alteration of general condition, particularly in a viral pandemic context. An intrahospital management of infections with systemic effects, even transient, can be safe while waiting for final microbiological analyses.\n\n【56】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【57】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It occurs in a localized and a systemic form and may present with a variety of symptoms. Involvement of the upper respiratory tract is very common, while neurologic, endocrinological, and nephrological dysfunction may occur.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We describe the case of a 29-year-old Central European male patient presenting with severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, otorrhea, and one-sided facial nerve paralysis. The patient was unsuccessfully treated with i.v. antibiotics at another hospital in Berlin, and tympanic tubes were inserted. After presentation to our emergency room, he was hospitalized and further diagnostics started. Increased fluid intake and 12 kg weight gain over the last months were reported. The patient was diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and diabetes insipidus. The patient’s condition improved after treatment with rituximab.\n\n【5】### Discussion\n\n【6】A comprehensive PubMed search of all articles with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and diabetes insipidus was conducted to assess which combination of symptoms occurs simultaneously and whether other parts of the pituitary are commonly involved. The 39 selected articles, describing 61 patients, showed that ear–nose–throat involvement occurred most commonly, in 71% of cases. Of patients, 59% had involvement of the anterior pituitary gland, while true panhypopituitarism occurred in 13% of cases. Only one case report featured the same set of symptoms as described herein.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a highly variable disease, commonly involving the upper airways, but that may present with symptoms solely related to the pituitary gland. Clinicians should have a low threshold to investigate for granulomatosis with polyangiitis in patients with therapy-resistant otorrhea. Patients may present with a complex set of symptoms, and integrating different specialists when additional symptoms occur may lead to faster diagnosis.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a disorder formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis. Its hallmark is necrotizing vasculitis with granulomatous inflammation. It involves primarily small and medium-sized vessels with a predilection for the upper and lower airways. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is common \\[ 1 \\]. The current definition was formed in 2012 by the Chapel Hill Conference for Consensus Criteria \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【12】GPA belongs to a group of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive diseases called ANCA-associated vasculitis, although ANCA testing may be negative in 10–20% of cases \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【13】Research led to the identification of different subsets of ANCA-positive diseases. Anti-proteinase 3 activity (PR3-ANCA) is most common in GPA, while patients with microscopic polyangiitis and Churg–Strauss syndrome are most often anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【14】GPA occurs in a systemic and a localized form. ENT involvement occurs in up to 90% of individuals. The sinonasal area is most commonly affected \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Otologic involvement is the second most common presentation \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Localized forms of GPA with involvement of the ear and/or the upper respiratory tract have been described, especially in younger patients \\[ 10 \\]. Dysfunction of the central nervous system is common at some point of the disease; the result can be dysfunction of cranial nerves II, VI, and VII, but also endocrine involvement of the pituitary gland \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. Severe headache is the most common nonendocrine symptom of hypophysitis. Chiasmal syndrome and ocular paresis may occur due to the increased sellar mass. Isolated DI centralis may occur as an endocrine symptom and is characterized by deficient secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP), leading to clinical symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. More frequently, combined hormonal insufficiency of the anterior and posterior pituitary occurs. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, secondary hypothyroidism, and potentially life-threatening secondary adrenal insufficiency are the most frequent endocrine disorders of the anterior pituitary, at least in patients with primary hypophysitis, in contrast to the finding of vulnerable gonadal and growth hormone axis and more robust adrenal and thyroid axes in patients with pituitary adenoma \\[ 15 \\]. However, data on hypophyseal function of patients with secondary hypophysitis due to GPA are scarce.\n\n【15】We present the case of a patient with localized, severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis with otitis media, facial nerve palsy, and pituitary dysfunction resulting in DI.\n\n【16】This case is presented according to the CARE guidelines \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【17】Additionally, a comprehensive systematic review of existing literature was performed to examine how often and to what extent hypophyseal dysfunction and ENT involvement occur in patients with GPA.\n\n【18】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【19】The patient is a white German male of 29 years of age who presented with otalgia and serous otorrhea (Figs. 1 , 2 ) to the otolaryngology resident on call in the ER of the Charité University Hospital in Berlin in November 2018. The patient reported having had these symptoms for 1 month. He had visited an otolaryngology clinic in October 2018 with facial nerve palsy with House–Brackmann score (HB) < III. At the clinic, treatment was started with i.v. antibiotics and prednisolone as well as tympanocentesis with insertion of T-tubes. Audiometric analysis revealed combined sensorineural and conductive hearing loss on the right side and conductive hearing loss on the left side (Fig. 3 ). A computed tomography (CT) scan report on his temporal bone described fluid retention on the mastoid on both sides, possibly with osteolysis. Routine laboratory analysis including human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis showed slightly elevated C-reactive protein (34.9 mg/l) but no further anomalies. On microbiologic testing, the middle ear fluid revealed biological flora without detection of pathogens.\n\n【20】**Fig. 1**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Left ear of the patient 1 day after presentation to our clinic with visible serous otorrhea after insertion of Titan tubes\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Right ear of the patient 1 day after presentation to our clinic with visible serous otorrhea after insertion of Titan tubes\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 3**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Audiometric analysis on 26/11/2018, showing mixed hearing loss on the right side with Fletcher index of 80 dB and conductive hearing loss on the left side with Fletcher index of 40 dB\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Facial nerve function normalized and otorrhea decreased after receiving treatment. The patient was discharged after 7 days with middle ear tubes in situ.\n\n【33】Upon presentation to the ER, facial nerve function was still abnormal with HB score of II, and extensive serous otorrhea persisted. The middle ear ventilation tubes were in situ. The patient also reported increased fluid intake of 9 L per day and weight gain of 12 kg in 7 weeks.\n\n【34】Laboratory analysis showed positive c-ANCA at 87.0 U/ml with increased anti-PR3 activity in combination testing. Anti-MPO activity was negative.\n\n【35】On the basis of this testing, a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis was established.\n\n【36】A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed slight widening of the pituitaries infundibulum and unclear inhomogeneity between the anterior and posterior pituitary (Figs. 4 , 5 ).\n\n【37】**Fig. 4**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】Coronal imaging of the hypophysis on a 3-T T1-weighted MRI image\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】**Fig. 5**\n\n【42】 \n\n【43】Saggital imaging of the hypophysis on a 3-T T1-weighted MRI image\n\n【44】Full size image\n\n【45】Clinical and laboratory evaluation of the anterior pituitary function did not indicate insufficiency of the somatotropic, gonadotropic, thyrotropic, or corticotropic axis. In addition, serum prolactin was within the reference range.\n\n【46】Plasma sodium concentration was 144 mmol/l with plasma osmolality of 300 mosm/kg. In a water deprivation test, urine osmolality increased insufficiently from 131 to 418 mosm/kg. Measurement of hypertonic saline-stimulated plasma copeptin (2.63 pmol/l) confirmed the diagnosis of DI.\n\n【47】Treatment for GPA was successfully started with 1 g rituximab i.v., and ANCA values decreased to 22.2 U/ml at 4 months after discharge and finally to 13.4 U/ml in October 2019 (Additional file 1 ).\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】GPA is a variable disease that may present with a complex set of symptoms \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. The patient in our case presented with otalgia, otorhea, facial nerve dysfunction, hearing loss, and polydipsia. Upon presentation to our department, the posterior pituitary gland function was already affected. While the resulting increase in fluid intake was not seen as a burden by the patient, medical history showed that symptoms of DI had existed before otologic involvement. Referral to specialists in endocrinology and rheumatology was sought after the diagnosis of GPA.\n\n【50】A comprehensive systematic PubMed search was performed using the search term ‘Wegener granulomatosis AND pituitary dysfunction OR granulomatosis with polyangiitis AND pituitary dysfunction OR Wegener granulomatosis AND diabetes insipidus OR granulomatosis with polyangiitis AND diabetes insipidus’. The article references were scanned for additional literature, resulting in a total of 65 articles. All case reports with confirmed diagnosis of GPA in addition to diabetes insipidus were included. Articles published in foreign language (other than English or German) and for which no full text was available were excluded. In total, 39 articles were selected for analysis after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n【51】The 39 selected articles described 61 different cases for analysis (Table 1 ). ENT involvement in patients with GPA was very common, with 43 patients reported to have any ENT area affected (72%). Sinonasal disease was very common, with 21 patients affected (35%). Otologic complaints were less common, being reported in nine patients (15%). Two of the selected case series, representing a total of 17 patients, did not specify the involved subarea. This may result in underestimation of the total percentage of patients affected per subarea.\n\n【52】**Table 1 Published articles with patients matching our inclusion criteria, with publication date and site of ENT involvement**\n\n【53】Full size table\n\n【54】Of the 61 cases, 36 (59%) experienced at least one symptom of anterior pituitary dysfunction. Hyperprolactemia was the most common hormonal dysbalance ( _n_ \\= 20, 33%), while hypothyroidism ( _n_ \\= 15, 25%) and hypogonadism ( _n_ \\= 14, 23%) ranked second and third. Panhypopituitarism was relatively uncommon and occurred in eight (13%) patients.\n\n【55】Most of the patients examined in this study had an established diagnosis of GPA before developing symptoms suggestive of DI ( _n_ \\= 33, 54%). The majority of patients ( _n_ \\= 35, 57%) developed ENT symptoms suggestive of GPA earlier than symptoms suggestive of DI. In 11 cases of this subgroup (31%), the ENT symptoms occurred days to months before DI symptoms. In 18 cases (51%), ENT symptoms developed years prior to diagnosis. Six cases (17%) did not include a timeframe for the occurrence of the symptoms.\n\n【56】DI was diagnosed before the diagnosis of GPA in 17 cases (28%). In this subgroup, the symptoms of DI developed days to month before diagnosis of GPA in three (18%) cases and years before diagnosis of GPA in another three (18%) cases. The other cases did not offer a timeframe (Table 2 ).\n\n【57】**Table 2 Evaluation of pituitary function tests and latency of occurrence of symptoms per case**\n\n【58】Full size table\n\n【59】Among the reviewed articles, only one report matched our patient’s complaints of therapy-resistant otitis media, facial nerve paralysis, sensorineural hearing loss, and DI \\[ 42 \\]. Although GPA can occur as a very limited localized disease, e.g., as antibiotic-resistant otitis media with or without mastoiditis \\[ 51 , 52 , 53 \\], we want to highlight that GPA can also occur with a combination of involved localized areas, as described herein. The current case, as well as the cases reviewed, highlight the complexity of this disease.\n\n【60】This review supports previous research and suggests that more than 70% of patients with GPA and DI have symptoms in the field of otolaryngology \\[ 6 \\]. We found that ENT-related symptoms might occur more often before symptoms of DI. These results might explain why early involvement of ENT specialists was found to result in substantially increased survival \\[ 54 \\].\n\n【61】In line with our findings, in many of the cases reviewed, patients experienced ENT symptoms at least 1 year before symptoms of DI occurred. Sinonasal disease is the most common manifestation in the head and neck area, but other symptoms occur frequently. The otolaryngologist has to manage acute and chronic symptoms, so knowledge about the different forms of the disease is fundamental.\n\n【62】The specific enlargement of the pituitary infundibulum on MRI is the result of involvement of the stalk and the hypothalamus in patients with DI \\[ 55 , 56 \\]. These images allow for distinction from other pathologies affecting the gland. While panhypopituitarism occurred in only a few patients, our study suggests that anterior pituitary dysfunction is slightly more common than anticipated before \\[ 27 , 29 \\]. Even with these numbers, it may be possible that gland dysfunction is underdiagnosed due to the blunted response when treated with corticosteroids, which most patients with GPA receive during the course of their disease. Hyperprolactemia, hypothyroidism, and hypogonadism are the most common abnormalities in our study. Care by the attending physician in regard to possible dysfunction of pituitary gland function is important, especially because several patients developed DI years after diagnosis of GPA. If polydipsia and polyuria are present, tests for anterior pituitary gland function must be performed.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【64】This case demonstrates a relatively rare occurrence of DI in a patient with GPA and demonstrates the difficulty of diagnosing the disease. All healthcare professionals involved in the diagnostic process of the disease must have knowledge about its possible variable course. This is especially important since delayed diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity and possibly mortality, while appropriate treatment options exist \\[ 57 \\].\n\n【65】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【66】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its additional information files.\n\n【67】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【68】GPA:\n\n【69】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n\n【70】ANCA:\n\n【71】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\n\n【72】ENT:\n\n【73】Ear–nose–throat\n\n【74】PR3-ANCA:\n\n【75】Anti-proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\n\n【76】MPO-ANCA:\n\n【77】Anti-myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\n\n【78】AVP:\n\n【79】Arginine vasopressin\n\n【80】ER:\n\n【81】Emergency room\n\n【82】HB:\n\n【83】House–Brackmann score\n\n【84】CT:\n\n【85】Computed tomography\n\n【86】IGF:\n\n【87】Insulin-like growth factor\n\n【88】LH:\n\n【89】Luteinizing hormone\n\n【90】FSH:\n\n【91】Follicle-stimulating hormone\n\n【92】T3:\n\n【93】Triiodothyronine\n\n【94】T4:\n\n【95】Thyroxine\n\n【96】ACTH:\n\n【97】Adrenocorticotropin\n\n【98】DI:\n\n【99】Diabetes insipidus", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is therefore being increasingly used in higher doses. The major concern of many physicians is a possible risk of lactic acidosis. The reported frequency of metformin related lactic acidosis is 0.05 per 1000 patient-years; some authors advocate that this rate is equal in those patients not taking metformin.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present two case reports of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. The first case is a 77 year old female with a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus who had recently been prescribed metformin (3 g/day), perindopril and acetylsalicylic acid. She was admitted to the emergency department two weeks later with abdominal pain and psychomotor agitation. Physical examination revealed only signs of poor perfusion. Laboratory evaluation revealed hyperkalemia, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and mild leukocytosis. Arterial blood gases showed severe lactic acidemia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. Vasopressor and ventilatory support was initiated and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was instituted. Twenty-four hours later, full clinical recovery was observed, with return to a normal serum lactate level. The patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on the sixth day. The second patient is a 69 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease who was on metformin (4 g/day), glycazide, acetylsalicylic acid and isosorbide dinitrate. He was admitted to the emergency department in shock with extreme bradycardia. Initial evaluation revealed severe lactic acidosis and elevated creatinine and urea. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and commenced on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration in addition to other supportive measures. A progressive recovery was observed and he was discharged from the intensive care unit on the seventh day.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We present two case reports of severe lactic acidosis most probably associated with high doses of metformin in patients with no known contraindications for metformin prescription. In both patients no other condition was identified to cause such severe lactic acidosis. Although controversial, lactic acidosis should be considered in patients taking metformin.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Metformin, a dimethylbiguanide, is an oral antihyperglycemic drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only recently – in 1995.\n\n【10】The results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have provided good evidence of the benefits of metformin on the long-term incidence of diabetic complications in overweight patients \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【11】Biguanides decrease gluconeogenesis from alanine, pyruvate, and lactate. The accumulation of lactic acid may increase under several circumstances\\[ 2 \\]. The occurrence of metformin induced lactic acidosis is exceptional when the drug is used with caution.\n\n【12】Lactic acidosis is rare, but serious, with a mortality up to 50% \\[ 3 \\]. It is a type of high anion gap metabolic acidosis and is associated with various pathological processes. It has also been used as a prognostic index of mortality \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【13】Metformin can be associated with lactic acidosis in patients with other clinical conditions that can themselves cause hyperlactacidemia, namely heart failure, hypoxia and sepsis. The overall incidence of this complication is 0.05 cases per 1,000 patient-years. Almost all of the reported cases occurred in patients who had risk factors for lactic acidosis \\[ 5 \\]. But it is impossible to determine to what extent, if any, metformin may have contribute to the development of lactic acidosis in any individual case \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【14】Salpeter et al \\[ 7 \\] in a meta-analysis of 194 studies found no difference in the incidence of lactic acidosis between diabetics taking and not taking metformin.\n\n【15】We report the cases of two older adults admitted to our institution with severe lactic acidosis in the setting of type 2 diabetes treatment with metformin.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Patient 1\n\n【18】A 77-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the emergency department after two weeks of increasing abdominal pain associated with vomiting. Two days before admission, she developed psychomotor agitation. She had a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and cerebrovascular disease. She had had a stroke one month before with full recovery; at that time her creatinine was normal and she had been discharged from hospital with the following medications: metformin 3 g daily, perindopril 8 mg daily, and simvastatin 20 mg daily.\n\n【19】On admission examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12/15 (E <sub>4 </sub> V <sub>3 </sub> M <sub>5 </sub> ), blood pressure 136/87 mmHg, pulse 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute and core body temperature 36.6°C. Despite being eupnoeic with oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 97% on room air, she presented with signs of poor perfusion.\n\n【20】Initial investigations revealed a creatinine of 6 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 103 mEq/L, glucose 216 mg/dL and C-reactive protein 3.14 mg/dl. Complete blood count (CBC) count showed 22.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L white blood cells, with haemoglobin of 13.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 365 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Arterial blood gas showed severe lactic acidosis (pH 6.87, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 8.2 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 146 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>- </sup> 1.4 mEq/L, blood lactate 16 mmol/L). Chest X-rays and ECG were normal at the time of her admission. Serum toxicological results, namely benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates and barbiturates, were negative.\n\n【21】The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of metformin related lactic acidosis. Continuous venovenous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was initiated, with 2 L/h of dyalisate flow and 35 ml/kg/h of hemofiltration using the solutions from Fresenius HF BIC, with 2 and 4 mEq/L of potassium as needed, using a high-flux dyalizer membrane (ultraflux AV 600s). Elective endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation was performed.\n\n【22】Four hours after the initiation of CVVHD significant improvement of acid-base status was observed and blood lactate level had halved (table 1 ). On the third day the patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator. On the 5th day a primary methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection was diagnosed and the patient was started on vancomycin. The patient was discharged to the nephrology department ward on the seventh day.\n\n【23】**Table 1 Patient 1 – Arterial blood gas results at admission, 4 h and 12 h after initiation of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Full recovery of renal function was observed after 30 days and the patient was discharged from hospital on the 60th day medicated with insulin and glycazide.\n\n【26】### Patient 2\n\n【27】A 69 year old male was admitted to the emergency department with confusion due to altered mental status. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes, stable angina and hypertension. There was no previous history of hospitalisations. His usual medications included metformin (4 g/day), isosorbide dinitrate (60 mg/day), glycazide (60 mg/day) and acetylsalicylic acid (150 mg/day).\n\n【28】On admission, the patient had extreme bradycardia with pulse rate 30 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, core body temperature 36.0°C and the blood pressure was immeasurable using the cuff method. There were no other significant findings on the physical examination. ECG showed complete atrio-ventricular block and the patient was immediately connected to an external pacemaker with significant haemodynamic improvement, blood pressure rising to 127/76 mmHg.\n\n【29】Initial investigations showed creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 3.4 mEq/L and glucose 436 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas showed severe lactic acidosis (pH 6.7, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 32.4 mmHg, PaO <sub>2 </sub> 68.2 mmHg, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>- </sup> 5.0 mEq/L, and lactates 18 mmol/L). Hemogram showed a normocytic, normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 8 g/dL) and mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 130 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Microscopic examination of the urine sediment showed the presence of glycosuria. Chest X-rays were normal. Serum toxicological results, namely for benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates and barbiturates, were negative.\n\n【30】The patient started treatment with fluids, bicarbonate and insulin infusion since the admission diagnosis was ketoacidosis. During the procedure to implant a temporary pacemaker the patient suffered a respiratory-cardiac arrest followed by shock. He was then transferred to the ICU where he received vasopressor support with the diagnosis of metformin related lactic acidosis. Accordingly, CVVHD was initiated with 2 L/h of dyalisate flow and 35 ml/kg/h of hemofiltration using the solutions from Fresenius HF BIC, with 2 and 4 mEq/L of potassium as needed, using a high-flux dyalizer membrane (ultraflux AV 600s).\n\n【31】The patient stabilized after 4 hours of CVVHD with an improvement of acid-base status and a decreased lactate level (table 2 ). At the 12 <sup>th </sup> hour of ICU stay the patient no longer needed vasopressor support and he recovered stable sinus rhythm and, as a result, the pacemaker was removed. On the third day CVVHD was stopped with full recovery of renal function. On the same day, an early-onset ventilator associated pneumonia was diagnosed and the patient was put on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic with piperacilin/tazobactam. Blood cultures, bronchial secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative. The patient improved and was successfully weaned from the ventilator on the fifth day and was discharged from hospital on the seventh day.\n\n【32】**Table 2 Patient 2 – Arterial blood gas results at admission, 4 h and 12 h after initiation of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration**\n\n【33】Full size table\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】There is controversy regarding the association between metformin use and lactic acidosis \\[ 6 \\]. The independent effect of metformin on the development of lactic acidosis is unknown. However, metformin-associated lactic acidosis is recognized as a potential lethal condition that can occur in patients with contraindications to the drug, such as renal failure, sepsis, hypoxaemia, and alcoholism \\[ 5 , 8 \\].\n\n【36】In our two case reports, no other aetiology for such severe lactic acidosis was found apart from metformin, despite metformin plasma concentration not having been measured since its determination was not available in Portugal at the time. Both patients were type 2 diabetics without risk factors for developing lactic acidosis such as renal failure. We were also unable to find any known precipitating factor that could contribute to such severe lactic acidosis, namely signs of dehydratation or the presence of toxic drugs or infection. The only common factor in both patients were high doses of metformin, in particular in the second patient since the prescribed metformin daily dose was superior to the FDA recommendations, and advanced age, both patients being older than 70 years. Another unexpected and not described finding was the appearance of acute renal failure in patients without previous renal dysfunction. We question whether high doses of metformin in older patients could be responsible for acute renal failure with subsequent lactic acidosis due to drug accumulation, since metformin is excreted by the kidneys without being metabolized. Some studies have shown a positive correlation between serum creatinine and plasma metformin as well as between plasma metformin and arterial lactate \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【37】Clinical presentations of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are non-specific. Severe hypotension with reduced systemic vascular resistance and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation has also been reported \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【38】An aggressive treatment strategy for metformin-associated lactic acidosis is recommended. Treatment for metformin-associated lactic acidosis includes adequate supportive care, management of concurrent disease, correction of acidemia, acceleration of lactate metabolism, and elimination of the offending drug by renal excretion or dialysis \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【39】In our patients the early and aggressive treatment with haemodialfiltration could have improved the outcome even in the presence of very severe acidosis. Metformin is a small, non-plasma protein-bound molecule that was dialyzed out of the body and subsequent full correction of acid-base status and lactacidemia after 12 hours of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was observed in both patients.\n\n【40】Dialysis techniques are the adequate treatment of lactic acidosis in diabetic patients treated with metformin since it rapidly corrects the acid-base disorders and partially removes the metformin \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【41】Since metformin-associated lactic acidosis is associated with a mortality rate as high as 50%, attention should be focused on prevention through awareness of the risk factors \\[ 13 \\]. Identification and recognition of cautions and contraindications are the keys to reducing morbidity and mortality.\n\n【42】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【43】Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare, preventable, but life-threatening adverse event and should be strongly suspected in patients presenting with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis and high blood lactate concentration \\[ 11 , 14 \\]. The daily metformin dosage should be no more than 2.5 g and the dosage o fmetformin should be reassessed as the patient ages \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【44】Consent\n-------\n\n【45】Written informed patient consent was obtained for publication", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, there are no case reports about loxoprofen-induced pneumonia. We have encountered a rare case of loxoprofen-induced pneumonia.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 71-year-old Japanese woman who was initially treated with loxoprofen for fever. She was admitted to our hospital because of worsening of her symptoms, including fever and dyspnea. Her symptoms improved after treatment with ceftriaxone. Seven days after admission, she again developed high fever. She was again treated with loxoprofen and levofloxacin. However, acute respiratory failure developed after initiation of loxoprofen treatment. Chest computed tomography showed peribronchovascular consolidation. She was diagnosed with loxoprofen-induced pneumonia for which she was administered steroids. After treatment, her dyspnea and radiological findings improved.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The findings in this case report reveal an association between treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and pneumonia. This rare case was diagnosed after accidental retreatment with loxoprofen. This is the first report of loxoprofen-induced pneumonia.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Loxoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that alleviates inflammation and pain by nonselective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Many clinicians worldwide routinely administer loxoprofen to patients with cold symptoms and acute upper respiratory inflammation. The major side effects of loxoprofen include gastric inflammation, ulcers, and renal dysfunction. However, development of interstitial pneumonia is a very rare side effect of loxoprofen. Here we report the first case of interstitial pneumonia induced by loxoprofen.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 71-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital with high fever and severe cough, and was admitted for bacterial pneumonia. Before her admission, she had developed fever and cough, and had received treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug loxoprofen. However, her symptoms deteriorated. Her initial vital signs on admission were as follows: temperature, 37.8 °C; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/minute; and oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) on room air, 94 %. A physical examination revealed fine crackles in both her lower lung fields. Her laboratory test values were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, 6000/μL; neutrophil count, 3780/μL; serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, 230 IU/L (normal, 119 to 229 IU/L); and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, 6.3 mg/dL (normal, <0.3 mg/dL). A chest radiograph (Fig. 1a ) showed reticular shadows in both her lower lung fields. Chest computed tomography (CT; Fig. 2a ) showed consolidation. A sputum Gram stain revealed only normal bacterial flora. _Mycoplasma_ antigen was absent. Urinary antigen tests for _Legionella_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ also yielded negative results.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Chest X-ray images. **a** Chest X-ray on admission. **b** Chest X-ray at the time of worsening of respiratory failure. **c** Chest X-ray after steroid treatment\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Chest computed tomography images. **a** Chest computed tomography on admission. **b** Chest computed tomography at the time of worsening of respiratory failure\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】She was treated with ceftriaxone (2.0 g/day) for 7 days. She was retreated with loxoprofen a few times when she had high fever and pain. After these treatments, although her symptoms resolved almost completely, she still had a slight fever. Chest radiograph findings showed improvement of reticular shadows in almost all her lung fields. However, 7 days after initiation of ceftriaxone treatment, she again developed high fever. She was treated with loxoprofen to alleviate her fever, and the antibiotic was changed from ceftriaxone to levofloxacin. After 3 days, she had intermittent high fever, severe cough, and dyspnea, which gradually worsened. Her initial vital signs at this time were as follows: temperature, 39.0 °C; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/minute; and SpO <sub>2 </sub> on room air, 88 %. A physical examination revealed fine crackles in both her lower lung fields. Her laboratory test values were as follows: WBC count, 10,600/μL with a left shift; neutrophil count, 9110/μL; serum LDH level, 255 IU/L; serum CRP level, 14.8 mg/dL; Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) level, 320 IU/L (normal, <500 IU/L); surfactant protein-D (SP-D) level, 140 ng/mL (normal, <110 ng/mL); and plasma (1→3) beta-D-glucan level, 13 pg/dL (normal, <20 pg/mL). Arterial blood gas values obtained on 3 L/minute oxygen delivered via nasal cannula were as follows: pH, 7.45; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ), 58 Torr; partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ), 36 Torr; and bicarbonate level, 27 mg/dL. A chest radiograph (Fig. 1b ) showed areas of bilateral ground-glass opacity in almost all her lung fields. A chest CT scan (Fig. 2b ) revealed bilateral, peripheral, subpleural peribronchovascular consolidation in almost all her lung lobes. Sputum, urine, and blood cultures yielded negative results. Four days after she was treated with loxoprofen for recurrent high fever, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the left B <sup>4 </sup> . The total cell count and lymphocytes in her BAL fluid were elevated to 5.0×10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL and 38 %, respectively. The result of a drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) in peripheral blood was strongly positive (stimulation index, 330 %) for loxoprofen and negative for ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. The patient was diagnosed with loxoprofen-induced pneumonia. Her respiratory status rapidly worsened after BAL; therefore, she was treated immediately with high-dose methylprednisolone therapy (1 g/day for 3 days) for acute respiratory failure. Her respiratory status and chest radiography findings improved dramatically after initiation of steroid therapy (Fig. 1c ). The patient had a Naranjo adverse drug reaction (ADR) probability score of 6 (Table 1 ), so her symptoms were classified as a probable ADR \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【21】**Table 1 Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale calculated for our case**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first English-language case report of loxoprofen-induced pneumonia. There have been a few case reports of NSAID-induced pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia in Japan. These reports include cases of loxoprofen-induced hypersensitivity pneumonia \\[ 2 \\] and loxoprofen-induced eosinophilic pneumonia \\[ 3 \\]. However, there is no report on the incidence of NSAID-induced pneumonia. In general, the incidence of drug-induced lung disease (DILD) is higher in Japanese than in white patients. For example, in the case of gefitinib, which is the major epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer, the incidence of DILD is approximately 2.0 % in Japan, which is higher than that in the USA (0.3 %) \\[ 4 \\]. Meanwhile, in the field of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), it has been revealed that some genetic backgrounds, such as telomere length, telomerase mutation, and _MUC5B_ promoter polymorphism, are associated with the development of fibrosis in the white population \\[ 5 \\]. However, it has been reported that the _MUC5B_ promoter polymorphism frequency in Japanese patients with IPF is significantly lower than that in German patients with IPF \\[ 6 \\]. These results suggest that other genetic backgrounds may be present in the Japanese population. More recently, research focus on _MUC4_ promoter polymorphism indicated an association with the development of DILD in Japanese patients, and that the _MUC4_ promoter polymorphism may be associated with ethnic differences in the incidence of DILD. These ethnic differences in promoter polymorphism may account for the difference in incidence of DILD, including that for loxoprofen.\n\n【25】In Japan, most pulmonologists diagnose patients with DILD by the criteria developed by the Japanese Respiratory Society. These criteria suggest that the diagnosis of DILD should be based on the history of treatment with the suspected drug, absence of another disease (for example, infection or pulmonary edema), improvement after withdrawal of the suspected drug, and deterioration after retreatment with the suspected drug \\[ 7 \\]. In addition, in Japan, a positive DLST is considered significant evidence of DILD. We diagnosed this patient with loxoprofen-induced pneumonia because of the development of pneumonia after accidental retreatment with loxoprofen, a treatment history of loxoprofen, and exclusion of infection and pulmonary edema. Furthermore, our patient’s peripheral blood DLST for loxoprofen was strongly positive \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【26】Her chest CT findings included peripheral, subpleural peribronchovascular consolidation in both lungs in accordance with an organized pneumonia pattern \\[ 7 , 9 \\]. Although we were able to obtain BAL fluid for analysis, we could not perform transbronchial lung biopsy because of severe coughing during bronchoscopy. However, we confirmed increased cell numbers and lymphocytes in her BAL fluid. Subsequently, steroid pulse therapy was administered because progression of respiratory failure precluded further examination procedures.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】Here we report the first case of loxoprofen-induced pneumonia in the general population. Despite an unknown incidence rate, clinicians should be aware of the potential development of DILD after treatment with loxoprofen.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】ADR:\n\n【31】adverse drug reaction\n\n【32】BAL:\n\n【33】bronchoalveolar lavage\n\n【34】CRP:\n\n【35】C-reactive protein\n\n【36】CT:\n\n【37】computed tomography\n\n【38】DILD:\n\n【39】drug-induced lung disease\n\n【40】DLST:\n\n【41】drug lymphocyte stimulation test\n\n【42】IPF:\n\n【43】idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\n【44】KL-6:\n\n【45】Krebs von den Lungen-6\n\n【46】LDH:\n\n【47】lactate dehydrogenase\n\n【48】NSAIDs:\n\n【49】nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n\n【50】PaCO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【51】partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood\n\n【52】PaO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【53】partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood\n\n【54】SP-D:\n\n【55】surfactant protein-D\n\n【56】SpO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【57】oxygen saturation\n\n【58】WBCs:\n\n【59】white blood cells", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Therapeutic decisions are based heavily on receptor tissue characterization. Even though the vast majority of metastatic sites do not have receptor conversions, they can occur at the time of metastasis and/or during the course of treatment. However, multiple receptor conversions are uncommon.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present an unusual case of a Caucasian patient originally diagnosed with an estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative primary breast cancer who had a recurrence after 15 years of therapy. Her metastatic tumor had a different receptor status than the original tumor. During the course of therapy, at the time of progression, a new biopsy showed that her tumor had changed once more.\n\n【5】### Conclusion/Discussion\n\n【6】Tracking receptor conversions is important in metastatic breast cancer treatment. Single receptor conversions have been documented to occur, but not much is known of multiple receptor conversions. This case sheds light on the possibility of patients having multiple receptor conversions and the importance of performing multiple biopsies during the course of metastatic treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer affecting women in the USA, and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women after lung cancer \\[ 1 \\]. The American Cancer Society estimates that 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in 2022 among American women \\[ 1 \\]. Estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative is the most common type of BC, accounting for 65% of cases in women less than 50 years old and 75% of cases for older women \\[ 2 \\]. The use of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for 5–10 years is highly effective in reducing recurrence rate and death, yet endocrine resistance and late relapse may still occur \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Pan _et al_ . conducted a meta-analysis that showed that BC recurrences steadily occurred 20 years after the original diagnosis in patients that completed 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy \\[ 6 \\]. Furthermore, metastatic BC (MBC) was strongly linked to the original tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), with recurrence risks ranging from 10% to 41% depending on tumor grade and TN status \\[ 6 \\]. Although strides have been made in treating BC in recent years, MBC is still considered to be essentially incurable. It is of interest, however, that in the CLEOPATRA trial, a small subset of HER2 MBC patients that remain progression free for 8 years are believed by some observers to effectively be cured by the use of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【10】The status of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 are vital in guiding clinicians in their therapeutic decisions. In the past, these decisions were largely based on tissue characterization of the primary site and not always the metastatic sites. However, it has been shown that changes in ER, PR, and HER2 status from the primary breast tumor to distant metastatic sites do occur, affecting the choice of systemic therapy. These receptor conversions are hypothesized to be the result of tumor heterogeneity and clonal selection as a result of treatment \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. To our knowledge, there is limited information on multiple receptor conversions in one single patient.\n\n【11】Herein we present a case of a patient who had changes in her receptor status twice during the course of her disease, and how repeating a biopsy at the time of disease progression was key to determining her therapy.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 49-year-old Caucasian woman was originally diagnosed with an ER-positive (3+), PR-positive (1–2+), HER2 (2+), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative cancer in 2003. It was a grade 3, T2N2M0, left-breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma. _BRCA1_ and _2_ analyses were negative. She was treated with four cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and subsequently had a left mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Repeat biomarkers showed that it was ER positive (3+), PR negative, and HER2 (2+), negative by FISH. The patient completed adjuvant radiation therapy. She then received adjuvant tamoxifen for 2 years followed by aromatase inhibitors continuing for 13 years until recurrence.\n\n【14】In 2018, at the age of 64 years, while still on anastrozole, she presented with acute left back pain. Images showed recurrent disease with a new left subpectoral mass and left scapular lesion. A biopsy of the mass showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with ductal carcinoma of mammary origin expressing AE1-3, GATA3, and mammaglobin. However, this time the tumor was ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative (FISH copy number 2.1 and ratio 1.4) (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2 ). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) showed several mutations: _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F of 9.3%, _TP53_ Q104 of 0.1%, _TP53_ H178fs of 3.7% (Fig. 1 B).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Timeline and treatment history after metastasis with circulating tumor DNA in a tumor response map (the map and table below illustrates the variant allele fraction detected of the observed somatic variants during each sample submission of liquid biopsy)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Left subpectoral mass. **A** Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) ×40 image of the fine needle aspiration of the left subpectoral mass involving poorly differentiated metastatic ductal carcinoma. **B** Negative estrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **C** Negative progesterone receptor (PR) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **D** Negative Her2Neu immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】A biopsy of the left scapular lesion showed metastatic carcinoma consistent with breast primary. The bone biopsy was ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 2+, with FISH inconclusive due to technical failure (Fig. 1 C). Androgen receptor positive (5–10% weak), GATA3 positive, PD-L1 positive.\n\n【24】She started zoledronic acid and atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel because of a positive PD-L1 assay and had a partial response by June 2019 (Fig. 1 D and E). By September 2019, she showed a mixed response in her follow-up images, with improvement in her left subpectoral lymph node and the lesion in the left coracoid process, but a new lesion at T1 (Fig. 1 F). The ctDNA at that time showed _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F 3.8%, _TP53_ H178fs 1.9%, and _CDH1_ R87fs 0.1% (Fig. 1 G).\n\n【25】A repeat positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) scan showed improvement of the subpectoral lesion and stable bone metastasis by November 2019 (Fig. 1 H). She additionally received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the left coracoid process and the T1 vertebral body to consolidate the therapeutic response (Fig. 1 I). The ctDNA done in May 2020 showed _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F 0.5% and _TP53_ H178fs 0.4% (Fig. 1 J).\n\n【26】By August 2020, she had two small liver lesions. A fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy of the liver showed an ER negative, PR negative, HER2 2+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and positive by FISH group 3 by ASCO CAP 2018 (copy number 7.9 and ratio 1.61) tumor (Fig. 1 K and Fig. 3 ) \\[ 10 \\]. This tumor was also AR positive 1%, PD-L1 SP142 positive 2%, PTEN positive 90%, CK7 positive, GATA3 positive, and mammaglobin positive. She had localized treatment by irreversible electroporation (IRE) of the two small separate hepatic lesions to control her disease (Fig. 1 L).\n\n【27】**Fig. 3**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Liver mass. **A** Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) ×40 image of the needle core biopsy of the liver mass involved by cytologically similar, poorly differentiated metastatic ductal carcinoma. **B** Negative estrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **C** Negative progesterone receptor (PR) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **D** Equivocal (2+) Her2Neu immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】The PET–CT done in October 2020 showed that she had overall disease progression in the liver and bone (Fig. 1 M). Therefore, her therapy was switched to trastuzumab, capecitabine, and tucatinib (Fig. 1 N). A follow-up PET–CT showed a complete response of measurable disease with non-PET fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid residual lesions viscerally and in bone by January 2021, with sclerotic bone lesions still seen on scan (Fig. 1 O). The ctDNA did not detect any somatic alterations in her blood that correlated to the response seen on the PET-CT (Fig. 1 P). Her PET–CT done in November 2021 still showed no evidence of active disease (Fig. 1 Q).\n\n【32】Conclusion/Discussion\n---------------------\n\n【33】Receptor conversions are known to occur during the treatment of MBC, but multiple conversions are not well documented. A meta-analysis by Schrijver _et al_ . found that receptor conversions of ER, PR, and HER2 from positive to negative were 22.5%, 49.4%, and 21.3%, respectively, while receptor conversions from negative to positive were 21.5%, 15.9%, and 9.5% \\[ 8 \\]. This shows that HER2 conversions, especially from negative to positive, are relatively rare when compared with the hormone receptor (HR) status. Meng _et al_ . performed a retrospective review looking at the ER and PR receptor status of primary tumors and metastatic sites \\[ 11 \\]. They found that a conversion occurred in 26.3% of patients \\[ 11 \\]. Some patients had additional biopsies and they were able to reassess for re-conversions. They reported that ER and PR had a re-conversion in 26.8% and 35.4% of cases, respectively, but there was no mention of HER2 re-conversions \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【34】A study by Hoefnagel _et al_ . showed that discordance of diverse metastatic sites within the same patient for ER was 7.3% or 10.9% (using, respectively, a 10% or 1% threshold for positivity), for PR it was 29.1% or 30.9%, and for HER2 it was 3.6% on IHC but 0% for gene amplification \\[ 12 \\]. Thus in 10.9–14.5% of the patients, this discordance might have clinical relevance indicating a potential need to change treatment \\[ 12 \\]. Additionally, this study demonstrated that there was minimal discrepancy within metastatic lesions (for example, heterogeneity) for HER2, making this case that much more uniquely valuable. Since receptor conversions can occur in the course of disease progression from the primary tumor to subsequent metastatic sites, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend a biopsy of the metastatic site at presentation \\[ 13 \\]. During the course of our patient’s treatment, we biopsied at presentation and at multiple progressions to reassess receptor status and the presence or absence of actionable mutations to optimize treatment.\n\n【35】Receptor conversions can change the patient’s prognosis. While HER2 conversions from positive to negative are associated with a poor prognosis, HER2 conversions from negative to positive are associated with better outcomes \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be helpful in certain circumstances, but it will not detect a change in HR status and is not as sensitive as a tissue biopsy in detecting HER2 amplification \\[ 14 \\]. Tissue biopsies are still the gold standard for molecular analysis and have better sensitivity for assessment of amplification \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【36】The receptor status of the patient is important in providing the clinician with the most accurate information for choosing appropriate treatment. If the receptor status changes, then the patient may be receiving ineffective treatment and additional toxicity without therapeutic benefit. The question then becomes how often or when should one be biopsying the patient’s lesions to potentially change therapeutic treatment? In this case, we decided to track her ctDNA along with obtaining multiple metastatic biopsies at the time of progression. We tracked her metastatic response to treatment through imaging examinations, and when it was evident that she had disease progression, we biopsied her lesions and found, once again, she had a receptor conversion.\n\n【37】Circulating tumor DNA offers fast and accurate genotyping in patients with MBC, which helps in the selection of therapies in patients with actionable mutations \\[ 16 \\]. The use of ctDNA was interesting in that she had an _ERBB2_ mutation that later disappeared. Nevertheless, it missed the HER2 amplification. This shows that even though ctDNA can sometimes be useful to track how well a patient is responding to treatment, it can still miss some changes in the tumor. A tissue biopsy of the metastatic lesion, when appropriate, is the best test to assess changes. Given the invasive nature of a tissue biopsy, it should be considered when clinically there is some suggestion of a differing disease process, as in our case. As previously shown, our patient’s ctDNA was going down while she developed a new liver lesion.\n\n【38】A study by Nayar _et al_ . found that HER2 mutations and ER mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting a separate mechanism of acquired resistance for each one \\[ 17 \\]. Moreover, HER2 mutations are relatively rare, accounting for 1.6% of primary BC’s \\[ 17 \\]. For women with HER2 mutations, the SUMMIT basket trial demonstrated encouraging clinical results for the use of neratinib alone or in combination with fulvestrant \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【39】Metastatic BC shows high mutational burden and clonal diversity when compared with early BC \\[ 19 \\]. This could be due to selective spread across metastatic sites of positive and negative clones from the primary lesion, clonal selection during disease progression possibly due to therapeutic treatment, genomic evolution during the course of metastasis, biological drift, or small undetectable subclones in primary tumors that only become evident once metastasis has occurred \\[ 12 , 20 \\]. It is possible that this is what happened to our patient. She could have had heterogeneity within the initial MBC tumor that was not originally detectable. Her original BC diagnosis was HR+ HER2− then her initial soft-tissue MBC lesion biopsy was HR− and HER2− by FISH. At the time of progression, her liver was biopsied and the tumor was HER2+ by FISH.\n\n【40】Molecular imaging could help target which lesions to biopsy. In a meta-analysis by Kurland _et al_ . they recommend the integration of PET with 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (F-FES) as an image biomarker tracer to identify areas of ER metastatic lesions \\[ 21 \\]. Hopefully in the future, additional tracers are integrated to determine areas of marker diversities to minimize random metastatic biopsy selection.\n\n【41】This report describes a case where multiple conversions occurred. It is therefore extremely important to not only perform a biopsy at the time of metastatic diagnosis, but also during the course of metastatic treatment.\n\n【42】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】Not applicable.\n\n【44】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【45】BC:\n\n【46】Breast cancer\n\n【47】ER:\n\n【48】Estrogen receptor\n\n【49】HER2:\n\n【50】Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n\n【51】MBC:\n\n【52】Metastatic breast cancer\n\n【53】PR:\n\n【54】Progesterone receptor\n\n【55】FISH:\n\n【56】Fluorescence in situ hybridization\n\n【57】TAC:\n\n【58】Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide\n\n【59】ctDNA:\n\n【60】Circulating tumor DNA\n\n【61】PET–CT:\n\n【62】Positron emission tomography–computed tomography\n\n【63】SBRT:\n\n【64】Stereotactic body radiation therapy\n\n【65】IHC:\n\n【66】Immunohistochemistry\n\n【67】IRE:\n\n【68】Irreversible electroporation\n\n【69】FDG:\n\n【70】Fluorodeoxyglucose\n\n【71】HR:\n\n【72】Hormone receptor\n\n【73】NCCN:\n\n【74】National comprehensive cancer network\n\n【75】F-FES:\n\n【76】F-fluoroestradiol", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We aim to share our experience to keep childhood Takayasu arteritis in mind as a differential diagnosis in any child presenting with hypertension, absent or reduced peripheral arterial pulse, or blood pressure differences between extremities.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a systemic granulomatous inflammation affecting the large- and medium-sized vessels such as aorta, its main branches, and pulmonary and renal arteries. The inflammation and infiltration of plasma cells, giant cells, and lymphocytes lead to stenosis, occlusion, dilatation, and aneurysms of the vessels \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】It occurs in female patients more than in males and is most prevalent in Japan, South East Asia, India, and Mexico \\[ 2 \\]. Although age of onset ranges from 10 to 40 years \\[ 1 \\], the highest incidence occurs during the third decade of life \\[ 3 \\]. However, childhood TA (c-TA), which is a subtype of TA, affects the age group ranging from young infants to late adolescents \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【11】Furthermore, the incidence of TA worldwide has been estimated to be 2/1,000,000 per year. However, the prevalence and incidence of TA in children is unknown \\[ 5 \\]. We could not find any other registered cases of c-TA in Children’s University Hospital in Damascus, which is the biggest center for treating children in Syria, from 2000 till now; thus, we report the first known case from Syria.\n\n【12】Clinical manifestations involve two phases: an early phase, “pre-pulseless phase,” with nonspecific systemic inflammatory symptoms such as weight loss, fever, night sweats, asthenia, headache, arthralgia, and muscle pain; the disease is not often recognized in this phase, and if the disease is untreated, a “pulseless phase” with multiple arterial occlusions and stenosis will occur, causing acute ischemic symptoms like seizures, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【13】Diagnosis of childhood TA is difficult and challenging because of its nonspecific symptoms that delay the diagnosis and the treatment \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【14】Treatment of childhood TA is glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants \\[ 6 \\]. Stents, bypass grafts, and angioplasty may be used in irreversible arterial stenosis cases \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【15】We report the first case in a child from Syria who presented with nonspecific and ischemic symptoms in her left arm. Conventional angiography showed narrowing in the inlet of the left subclavian artery extending to the branching point of the left vertebral artery. Later, she relapsed twice with different additional symptoms each time.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】A 12-year-old Syrian girl was admitted to Children's University Hospital of Damascus due to 3 months complaints of a variety of unexplained symptoms. She had generalized myalgia and arthralgia without inflammatory signs. The pain was most severe in her left shoulder and elbow, with numbness and tingling in her left arm. She also had exertional dyspnea, pallor, dizziness, and constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever with night sweats, anorexia, and loss of approximately 7% of her weight), along with intermittent epigastric abdominal pain that exacerbated with meals and was occasionally associated with vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, she developed headache and episodes of epistaxis during her admission.\n\n【18】Her past medical history was significant for two episodes of tonsillitis during the last year, and she was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in an outpatient clinic. She was treated with penicillin G benzathine (dose: 1.2 million units intramuscular injection every 2 weeks), and iron was replaced without any improvement.\n\n【19】Clinical examination revealed lymphadenopathy in the cervical (1 × 1 cm) and inguinal (1 × 2 cm) regions. Her pulse was absent in the left brachial and radial arteries, and blood pressure was unobtainable in her left arm. Her blood pressure (BP) was 130/70 and 140/90 mmHg in her right arm and lower limbs respectively. Vascular bruits were heard over the left supra- and subclavian areas on auscultation.\n\n【20】Laboratory tests showed microcytic anemia with elevation in white blood cells (WBCs) count, platelet count, and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (values are presented in Table 1 ). Tests also revealed mild elevation in anti-streptolysin O (576 U/ml, normal range 50–250 U/ml), iron deficiency (3 μmol/l, normal range 9–31.3 μmol/l), elevated Von Willebrand factor (189%, normal range 60–150%). Liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time were all normal. The following tests were all within normal limits: Widal test, Wright test, tuberculin skin test, direct and indirect Coombs, cold agglutinins, rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA, antinuclear antibody, perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, complement factors C3 and C4, cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus antibodies, and anti-hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies.\n\n【21】**Table 1 Patient’s course of the disease**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed no significant abnormalities. Chest X-ray and pharyngeal swap were also normal.\n\n【24】Conventional angiography was performed regarding the difference in pulse and blood pressure values between the two upper limbs. It showed narrowing in the inlet of the left subclavian artery extending to the branching point of the left vertebral artery, and this was followed by widening of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 1 ). Other arteries were normal. The results were supported with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA, Fig. 2 ), and according to these results the diagnosis of childhood Takayasu arteritis was established.\n\n【25】**Fig. 1**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Conventional angiography showing narrowing of the left subclavian artery (yellow arrow) extended to the branching point of the left vertebral artery (green arrow) and followed by widening of the left subclavian artery\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 2**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Magnetic resonance angiogram showing injury of the left subclavian artery\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】She was given 30 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for 3 days as an initial management, then she was treated conservatively with close follow-up. Her treatment included prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and methotrexate 10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> /week for 3 months along with aspirin 1–2 mg/kg, omeprazole, folic acid, calcium, and vitamin D. The clinical features of ischemia (that is, pulselessness), BP, complete blood count, ESR, and CRP were used for clinical follow-up.\n\n【34】After that, the patient relapsed twice when prednisolone was tapered off to a maintenance dosage, and she had additional symptoms during her relapses (details are presented in Table 1 ).\n\n【35】Her first relapse was after 4 months, and the main complaint was chest pain that radiated to her left arm. On admission, a cardiac catheter was performed and no injury in coronary arteries was found. Electrocardiography, creatine kinase, troponin, arterial blood gases, and echocardiography were all normal. The pain was relieved by nitroglycerin patches. Conventional angiography showed that her disease was progressing radiologically (in addition to the narrowing of the left subclavian artery, the right subclavian artery was affected; Fig. 3 ). Prednisolone was returned to initial dose with methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> /month was added. She also had hypertension that was managed with amlodipine 5 mg/day. Despite adding cyclophosphamide, she had a second relapse 4 months later when prednisolone dose was reduced. Her chief complaint was severe occipital headache. The disease was still progressing radiologically (Fig. 4 A, B). Therefore, methotrexate was replaced with azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day with continuation of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide.\n\n【36】**Fig. 3**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Conventional angiography showing narrowing of the right subclavian artery (yellow arrow)\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】**Fig. 4**\n\n【41】 \n\n【42】**A** , **B** Conventional angiography. **A** shows complete occlusion of the left subclavian artery, and collateral arteries are visible (green arrow). **B** shows increased narrowing of the right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) compared with Fig. 3\n\n【43】Full size image\n\n【44】The patient was followed-up closely, and after approximately 14 months since the onset of the disease; her clinical and laboratorial condition was stable (details are presented in Table 1 ), although radiological findings did not regress (Fig. 5 A, B). The treatment was adjusted to azathioprine 1 mg/kg/day and prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. The patient is still following up in our outpatient clinic for continuous evaluation and dosage adjustment.\n\n【45】**Fig. 5**\n\n【46】 \n\n【47】**A** , **B** Conventional angiography. **A** shows only mild improvement in the left subclavian artery, and **B** shows no regression in the injury of the right subclavian artery despite clinical improvement\n\n【48】Full size image\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of large- and medium-sized arteries of unknown etiology, affecting mainly aorta and its large branches and causing vessel stenosis, occlusion or dilation, and aneurysmal formation \\[ 1 \\]. It can also involve the pulmonary, abdominal, and coronary arteries \\[ 3 , 5 \\].\n\n【51】TA rarely occurs in children \\[ 3 \\]. The exact incidence of childhood Takayasu arteritis (c-TA) is not determined yet \\[ 5 \\]. Despite the high incidence of TA in East Asian countries, it is not limited to one race \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. There is a low prevalence of TA in Arabs \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【52】The pattern of involvement of arteries varies among the races \\[ 8 \\]. The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and its branches are mostly affected in Japanese patients, while thoracic and abdominal aorta are commonly affected in Indian and North American patients \\[ 1 , 8 \\]. Of note, there is no similar study on c-TA in Arabs. However, a systematic review of TA in Arabs including 197 patients, with a mean age of 28 years, from seven Arab countries, not including Syria, shows a predominant involvement of the aortic arch branches \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【53】We described the first case of childhood Takayasu arteritis (c-TA) reported from Syria. In our case, a 12-year-old girl with TA affecting the aortic branches presented with a group of nonspecific symptoms and signs of this rare disease. TA diagnosis in children is frequently delayed as compared with adults \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Generally, delay in diagnosis ranges from 1 month to 5 years \\[ 11 \\]. In our case, the girl was diagnosed after 3 months from the beginning of symptoms. TA manifestation differs in children from adults; c-TA probably presents with less specific signs and symptoms \\[ 5 \\]. Clinical manifestations in children have a broad spectrum and can be divided into constitutional symptoms, which appear in 50% of patients in early stage of disease, and organ-specific symptoms, which occur later \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. Our patient presented with both types of symptoms. However, nonspecific manifestations of c-TA make its diagnosis challenging for clinicians \\[ 5 \\]. As a result, arterial inflammation progresses to a stage of chronic stenosis and gradual arterial narrowing that causes ischemia of the tissues \\[ 3 \\]. Patients often seek medical help in the sequelae stage \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【54】Arterial hypertension is the predominant manifestation in both adult and child patients \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. Other common clinical features in children are headache, fever, dyspnea, weight loss, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgia, and arthralgia \\[ 12 \\]. Our patient had all of these symptoms when diagnosed, and then she relapsed twice, with different manifestation in each one. Our patient also has lymphadenopathy in cervical and inguinal regions, which is an uncommon finding in c-TA \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【55】There is yet an unclear association between TA and TB (tuberculosis), as 20% of TA patients were diagnosed with active TB \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Nevertheless, our patient did not have TB.\n\n【56】The diagnosis of TA in this case was based on the criteria developed by the Ankara conference in 2008, which showed 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【57】The criteria include the following standards: one mandatory criterion that angiographic abnormality should be proved by imaging studies, plus one of the following: absent/weak or unequal peripheral arterial pulses, discrepancy of four limb systolic blood pressure measurements of more than 10 mmHg difference in any limb, bruits over large arteries, hypertension, and raised acute phase reactant (ESR < 20 or elevated CRP) \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【58】Our patient met every criterion mentioned above when she was first diagnosed except for hypertension, which developed later within the first relapse.\n\n【59】In terms of classification and depending on Numano’s classification, our patient is considered type I, as she showed MRA involvement of the left subclavian artery without any involvement of the ascending aorta or the aortic arch \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【60】Our patient presented with clinical features highly suggestive of vascular morbidity; thus, conventional arteriography was performed, followed by MRA, which is considered a sensitive and an accurate tool for establishing the diagnosis and continuing the follow-up of Takayasu arteritis \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【61】Treatment of TA depends on glucocorticoids as a first line agent; however, high relapse rate (occurring in 46–84% of patients) is increasingly suggesting the use of second-line immunosuppressants to maintain remission \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【62】Our patient was started on both (glucocorticoids and methotrexate); however, she still relapsed upon reduction of steroid dose, and this highlights the challenge of finding a way to assess disease activity and guide successful therapy \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【63】Until now, there is no strong evidence showing the superiority of using one non-biological immunosuppressive agent over the other \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【64】In this case, the patient showed good clinical improvement upon administration of steroids and methotrexate; nevertheless, there was no laboratorial or radiological improvement. After reduction of steroids, the patient relapsed showing new symptoms, and cyclophosphamide was added to the first regimen. Upon adding cyclophosphamide, the patient showed no clinical or laboratorial improvement during the course of 8 months. Glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide were continued, and methotrexate was replaced with azathioprine. Finally, this led to the remission of both clinical symptoms and acute phase reactants without radiological improvement, and the patient was continued on steroids and azathioprine.\n\n【65】Supportive therapy includes the use of antiplatelets and antihypertensive agents in patients suffering from hypertension \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【66】As for surgery, which plays an important role as an essential treatment in some cases, especially in medically unresponsive progressive TA \\[ 9 \\], our patient did not match any indication for surgical treatment.\n\n【67】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【68】Childhood Takayasu arteritis is a life-threatening disease that can have varied presentation. There is a scarcity of reviews and studies on c-TA in Arabs. As mentioned earlier, there is a low prevalence of c-TA in the Arab population. However, lack of awareness toward the disease among primary care physicians may be a reason for its low prevalence. The main purpose of our report is to share our experience and to keep TA in mind as a differential diagnosis in any child presenting with hypertension, absent or reduced peripheral arterial pulse, or blood pressure difference between arms.\n\n【69】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【70】Any additional data or material is available on request.\n\n【71】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【72】WBCs:\n\n【73】White blood cells\n\n【74】CRP:\n\n【75】C-reactive protein\n\n【76】ESR:\n\n【77】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【78】TA:\n\n【79】Takayasu arteritis\n\n【80】c-TA:\n\n【81】Childhood Takayasu arteritis\n\n【82】BP:\n\n【83】Blood pressure\n\n【84】MRA:\n\n【85】Magnetic resonance angiography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that meningioma can mimic cavernous malformations.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 42-year-old German man who presented to our institution with seizure. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed characters of an intra-axial subcortical lesion with a ‘popcorn’ appearance and hemosiderin deposits in the right parietal lobe. The initial diagnosis was cavernous malformation. Intraoperatively, the lesion presented as a subcortical mass that had no connection to the dura or the ventricle. The histological diagnosis showed a WHO Grade 1 ‘raddled’ psammomatous meningioma with extensive metaplastic ossification. A literature review of 29 cases of intraparenchymal meningiomas regarding their clinical presentations, location and management was performed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Meningiomas can be found in any region of the brain with and without dural attachment. Intraparenchymal meningiomas can have multiple entities mimicking their presentation. Caution must be used regarding the preoperative differential diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Meningiomas account for approximately 15% of all intracranial neoplasms \\[ 1 \\]. Meningiomas are usually attached to the dura and thought to arise from the arachnoid cap or meningothelial cells. Occasionally meningiomas develop without dural attachment, mainly in the intraventricular region, within the sylvian fissure, pineal region, or infratentorial compartment, and in pediatric and young patients \\[ 2 – 6 \\]. The majority of meningiomas exhibit highly stereotypic imaging characteristics, which often facilitate their diagnosis without the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. In cases of absence of dural attachment, it is often difficult in the preoperative diagnosis to distinguish meningioma from high-grade glioma, cavernous angioma, or metastatic brain tumors and sarcomatous lesions \\[ 7 – 10 \\]. Primary intraparenchymal meningiomas are rare and they are challenging to diagnose, especially when presenting with a typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan appearance.\n\n【10】We present a rare case of primary intraparenchymal meningioma that, preoperatively, was not typical for meningioma and showed characteristics of cavernous malformation. We reviewed all cases of intraparenchymal meningiomas in the literature to gather information regarding their sites, clinical presentations, pathological features, management, and outcome.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A right-handed 42-year-old German man presented to our institution with convulsive seizures. There were no other neurological symptoms or signs and no neurological deficits. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan of his brain revealed a hyperdense lesion with calcification in the right parietal area. His cranial MRI scan (Figures 1 , 2 and 3 ) demonstrated a popcorn-shaped mass in the subcortical white matter of his right parietal lobe. The lesion had smooth lobulated margins and no dural attachment was apparent. The lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted images and mixed hypo- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There were local mass effect, peritumoral edema and heterogeneously contrast enhancement. On his T2\\* gradient echo images the lesion showed focal spots of (dark signal) hypointense areas centrally compatible with calcifications, demonstrated on his CT scans, and a surrounding hypointense rim interpreted as hemosiderin deposition typical of cerebral cavernoma.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Axial T2-weighted image demonstrating a popcorn-shaped predominantly hypointense lesion in the parietal lobe with perifocal edema.**\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted image revealing a heterogeneous contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcortical white matter of the right parietal lobe and no apparent dural attachment.**\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**T2\\* gradient echo image showing a mass lesion with dots of calcification and surrounding hypointense rim typical of cerebral cavernoma.**\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】A right parietal craniotomy was performed under MRI-guided navigational assistance. Grossly, no mass or any other pathologic tissue was observed below the dura or on the cortex. Using a sulcal approach, the mass reached about 2cm into the cortex, showing a good cleavage. The mass was completely calcified (like a stone) and measured about 1.5×1.5cm in diameter. A gross total resection could be achieved. Postoperatively, he had no neurological deficits.A histological examination of the specimen showed (at low magnification (5× objectives)) a tightly packed and parallel laminated mass of fibrous tissue (Figure 4 ). There were a few irregularly shaped small foci within the lesion, which were partly filled with flimsy tissue. At higher magnification (10× and 20× objective), many faded whorl structures and psammoma bodies were identified (Figure 5 ).Furthermore, the lesion contained areas of transition into mature lamellar bone and was partly bordered by brain tissue with piloid gliosis. There was no periodic acid-Schiff-positive inclusions, nor hemosiderin deposits. An immunohistochemistry analysis revealed focal positivity for epithelial membrane antigen and Vimentin (Figure 6 ). Staining the sample with reticulin did not reveal a hemangiopericytomas-like pattern. No other histological sign of atypia or malignancy was observed. The pathological examination was performed by two independent and board-certified pathologists. The final diagnosis was a ‘raddled’ psammomatous meningioma with extensive metaplastic ossification. The postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged and returned to everyday life, showing no deficits.\n\n【26】**Figure 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Routine hematoxylin and eosin histology revealed a tightly packed and parallel laminated mass of fibrous tissue (4× objectives).**\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Figure 5**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Routine hematoxylin and eosin histology revealed many faded whorl structures and psammoma bodies (10× and 20× objective).**\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】**Figure 6**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed focal positivity for endothelial membrane antigen (20× objective) and psammoma bodies (20× objective).**\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】In the literature review, we identified 36 cases of intraparenchymal meningiomas, including our case report. Case reports with insufficient information and meningiomas secondary to underlying meningioangiomatosis were excluded; 29 cases were included in total. There were 18 male (62.1%) and 11 female (37.9%) subjects, with the age ranging between 0.4 and 60 years (mean: 21.2 years). Of the 29 intraparenchymal meningioma cases, 26 were located in the supratentorial region (89.7%) and three were located in the infratentorial region of the brain (10.3%). The frontal location was dominant, being reported in 12 cases (41.4%). The most frequently reported clinical presentation was seizure, being reported in 20 cases (69.0%). In almost all of the cases, the radiological appearance was a solid mass showing contrast enhancement.\n\n【39】Preoperatively, three cases mimicked a glioma, one case mimicked metastasis und one case mimicked a cavernoma. Total surgical resection was the standard treatment approach and was achieved in all the cases, except in three cases involving the brainstem, in which only a subtotal resection was performed. Radiotherapy following the surgery was done in four cases und one subject additionally underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Regarding the histopathology, the fibrous type proved to be dominant, being reported in 11 cases (37.9%). The majority of the patients had no postoperative deficits. The location, clinical presentation, radiological finding, and outcomes are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【40】**Table 1 **All intraparenchymal meningiomas until January 2014****\n\n【41】Full size table\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】Intraparenchymal meningiomas are meningiomas that arise within the brain tissue without dural attachment and have also been used to characterize meningiomas that are not dural based \\[ 10 \\]. The etiology of intraparenchymal meningiomas is unclear. Some authors presume that intraparenchymal meningiomas arise from arachnoid cells of the pia mater, which enter the surface of brain or sulcus with perforating blood vessels. Others suggest that the arachnoid cell rests during the migration progress \\[ 10 \\]. The pineal region, the intraventricular region, and within the sylvian fissure are typical locations where a meningioma may develop without dural attachment \\[ 5 , 38 – 40 \\]. Meningiomas show characteristic imaging features such as: broad-based dural attachment, signal changes in the skull due to tumor infiltration, sharp demarcation between the tumor and the brain, mass effect on adjacent brain tissue, and homogeneous enhancement of a contrast agent \\[ 41 , 42 \\]. The site of origin provides a clear diagnosis in most cases. However, meningiomas can be mimicked by other intracranial tumors and pseudo-tumors such as glioma, ependymoma, metastasis, and cavernous malformation \\[ 7 , 43 \\].\n\n【44】Our case report shows several factors which pointed to the diagnosis of cavernous malformation: the subcortical location, clinical presentation, radiological findings like the characteristic popcorn appearance on the MRI scan, and hemosiderin deposition. Other findings, such as peritumoral edema, calcifications, hypointense appearance to gray matter on T1-weighted MRI scans, and mixed signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI scans, are also reported in cavernous malformations in different stages after hemorrhage. It has been reported that cavernoma malformations may mimic meningioma \\[ 25 , 44 – 46 \\]. Cavernous malformations may be misdiagnosed as the more commonly seen meningiomas, particularly when they do not display the same MRI characteristics as a typical cavernoma \\[ 45 , 17 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that meningiomas can mimic cavernous malformations.\n\n【45】Our case report highlights the fact that preoperative diagnosis of atypical meningioma is challenging and classical MRI features may not be sufficient to distinguish the different pathologic entities, moreover, they can be misleading. Therefore, caution must be used in the preoperative differential diagnosis. In our case report, an angiography could have helped to distinguish the meningioma from a cavernous malformation, but this is not guaranteed due to the possibility of showing the same radiological features \\[ 41 \\].\n\n【46】The literature review shows that intraparenchymal meningiomas occur in all regions of the brain, including supratentorial and infratentorial areas. Intraparenchymal meningiomas were, in most cases, not considered and misdiagnosed as other lesions. The clinical presentation was site dependent; seizures were the most common symptom. Unlike the usual meningioma, where the meningothelial variant of meningioma is the most common, the fibrous variant of meningioma is dominant in intraparenchymal meningiomas \\[ 47 \\]. It seems that the fibrous variant of meningioma is generally dominant in meningiomas without dural attachment, such as intraventricular meningiomas. The large number of published cases of meningiomas without dural-base attachment establishes the fact that not all meningiomas are dural based.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【48】The meningioma in our patient had two unusual features: the subcortical location and the radiological appearance mimicking cavernous malformation. This case report highlights the fact that the typical radiological appearance of one lesion may sometimes be misleading. Intraparenchymal meningiomas can have multiple entities mimicking their presentation. Caution must be used in the preoperative differential diagnosis.\n\n【49】Consent\n-------\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

However, in rare cases, it may also be caused by the herpes simplex virus. As herpetic whitlow is not seen often, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger. Delayed recognition and/or treatment puts patients at risk of complications ranging from superinfection to herpetic encephalitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 23-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was referred by his primary care physician because of erythema and swelling of the little finger of his left hand. The primary care physician had already treated him with the oral antibiotic Augmentin® (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) and incision of the finger, but this had not resolved his complaints. He had multiple vesicles on the finger, which led to the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which we confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. All cutaneous abnormalities disappeared after treatment.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Whitlow is rarely caused by the herpes simplex virus, but this disease requires a swift recognition and treatment to prevent complications. This case serves to emphasise that not all whitlow is caused by a bacterial infection, and that it is important to differentiate between herpetic and bacterial whitlow, as these diseases require a different treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Herpetic whitlow is an infrequently seen cause of infection of a finger. It is estimated to affect 2.5 per 100,000 people each year. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (60%) or type 2 (40%). When it is seen, it is generally in patients with occupational hazards such as medical workers, dental workers, hairdressers or thumb-sucking children. As herpetic whitlow is rare, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger. Delayed recognition and/or treatment puts patients at risk of complications ranging from superinfection to herpetic encephalitis \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In patients with specific occupational hazards or those with an atypical whitlow, physicians should be aware of herpetic whitlow.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 23-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was referred to our emergency department by his primary care physician because of swelling and erythema of the little finger of his left hand for ten days prior to presentation. He had been prescribed the antibiotic Augmentin® (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid), and the primary care physician had already incised the finger releasing clear liquid (no pus). Despite this therapy, his complaints persisted. He had no fever or itching, and had never had these complaints before (Figures 1 and 2 ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Patient's finger, dorsal view. Dorsal and radial side of the patient's little finger, showing yellowish vesicles and erythema.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Patient's finger, dorsal view (Figure 1 ) zoomed in.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】We confirmed the erythema and swelling of the distal phalanx of his left little finger, with vesicles with a yellow translucent colour. From these vesicles, a clear fluid spontaneously discharged. There was no pus, bony tenderness or pain over his flexor tendons. The motion of his finger was unlimited, and he had no fever (Figures 3 and 4 ).\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Patient's finger, radial view.

Palmar side of the patient's little finger, showing two yellowish vesicles.\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】On the basis of the clinical appearance we considered herpetic whitlow with superinfection. When asked, he confirmed he had also observed vesicles on his genitals. He denied ever having sexual intercourse or contact with infected individuals. A polymerase chain reaction on herpes simplex virus type 1 was positive on both the material from his genital vesicles and on material from his finger. We referred him to a dermatologist for further treatment. Because of spontaneous subsidence of his complaints, Fucidine® (fusidic acid) cream was chosen as primary treatment. In other cases, in which subsidence does not occur spontaneously, antiviral agents such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may also be used.\n\n【30】The herpes simplex virus causes two types of infections: primary and recurrent. Usually, a break in the skin barrier (for example a wound) allows the virus to enter the tissue and establish an infection. Appearing several days after a person's first exposure, the sores of a primary infection last approximately 1 to 3 weeks. They heal completely, rarely leaving scars. Nevertheless, after the primary infection, the virus remains in the body, hibernating in nerve cells. Certain triggers can cause the hibernating (latent) virus to become active and travel back to the skin. Recurrent infections tend to be milder than primary infections, and generally occur in the same location as the primary infection \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【31】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【32】Whitlow is rarely caused by the herpes simplex virus, but this disease requires swift recognition and treatment to prevent complications. As this treatment differs from that of a traditional whitlow, physicians should be aware of herpetic whitlow.\n\n【33】Consent\n-------\n\n【34】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

This diagnosis is always associated with active systemic diseases in young adults and needs thrombophilia workup. Nevertheless, we present the case of a pregnant woman suffering from idiopathic combined central retinal vein and cilioretinal artery occlusion.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 36-year-old pregnant Iranian woman at the 36th week of her second pregnancy complained of subacute unilateral painless decreased vision of her left eye. She had experienced a transient vision loss that lasted several minutes, but attacks gradually became more frequent and finally persistent over a several-day period. Finally combined central retinal vein and cilioretinal artery occlusion was established. Her visual acuity improved to 4/10 in a month without any ocular intervention except for a short duration of prophylactic dose enoxaparin, and the acuity reached 8/10 without any complications in the third month follow-up visit. At 1 year follow-up, the visual acuity had not changed and no macular edema was seen.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Ocular vascular occlusion is extremely rare among young adults, and even rarer among pregnant women. According to this, any suspected retinal vascular event in this population should raise suspicion for underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, migraine, preeclampsia syndrome, and thrombophilia. However, as seen in this presented case, idiopathic ocular vascular occlusion events can occur also.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Pregnancy by itself is an etiological cause for multiple physiologic and nonphysiologic changes in the women’s body. Among these significant alterations are changes in the hemostatic system, which can predispose women to thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PTE), and much less commonly thrombosis in ocular circulation \\[ 1 \\]. However, ocular vascular occlusion (OVO) is extremely rare even in the nonpregnant population, and usually associated with active systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, thrombophilia, autoimmune diseases, migraine, etc. \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【10】Although there is an increased risk of thromboembolism during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester and postpartum period, many such affected women are carriers of hereditary or acquired thrombophilia \\[ 4 \\]. So, an extensive hematological investigation regarding these predisposing conditions is essential.\n\n【11】As mentioned above, thrombosis risk increases 2–4 folds during pregnancy \\[ 5 \\]. Besides this, some other physiological changes occur in the eyes during pregnancy, such as increased lens curvature, decreased conjunctival capillaries, eye dryness, decreased corneal sensitivity, and intraocular pressure. Some changes will also occur in a pregnant woman’s visual field (bitemporal concentric visual field defects) \\[ 6 \\]. It is worth saying that, surprisingly and despite these effects, generally, an uncomplicated pregnancy is rarely associated with any significant induced changes in the retina, and less so in retinal vessels. Most pregnancy-related retinal changes are associated with the preeclampsia–eclampsia spectrum \\[ 7 \\]. In fact, retinal vessel changes are found more frequently on funduscopic examination of this population \\[ 8 \\], but only approximately one-third will experience clinically significant ocular sequelae \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【12】There are just a handful of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with OVO in literature.\n\n【13】Ozdamar _et al._ reported a case of right eye cilioretinal artery occlusion (CLRAO) and incomplete central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in a patient just a week after elective cesarean section for twin gestation. Fortunately, her ocular and laboratory abnormalities rapidly disappeared 1 month after delivery under conservative treatment \\[ 10 \\]. Humayun _et al._ also reported a 32-year-old woman at 37 weeks of gestation with both papillophlebitis and branch retinal artery occlusion diagnosis simultaneously \\[ 11 \\]. Papillophlebitis is supposed to be a type of central retinal vein occlusion among young people, while its exact etiology is yet to be well established \\[ 12 \\]. There are several reports of CLRAO and CRVO in nonpregnant patients \\[ 13 , 14 \\], although such reports in pregnancy are extremely scarce.\n\n【14】According to the rarity of the disease in young adults, especially in the pregnant subpopulation, early diagnosis and appropriate subsequent interventions are very important during pregnancy. Considering the few anecdotal case reports \\[ 15 , 16 , 17 \\] and short case series \\[ 18 \\], knowledge is limited in this era. We present herein the case of a pregnant woman at the 36th week of gestation with diagnosis of combined CRVO and CLRAO. We describe what happened to her during this event and also share our acquired experience with other interested physicians to add more evidence on this topic to the literature.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】A 36-year-old gravid2 live1 pregnant Iranian woman at the 36th week of her gestation came to Imam Khomeini (Tehran, Iran) Obstetric Emergency Department in March 2021 complaining of subacute visual disturbance. She had well-controlled gestational diabetes (on diet) in her current pregnancy and history of hypothyroidism since 10 years ago, soon after her first delivery, which was well controlled before and during pregnancy by taking 150 microgram oral levothyroxine daily. She also denied any cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption, and she did not take any other medication except for daily levothyroxine, multi-prenatal, and ferrous sulfate tablets (each one tablet per day). She was a housewife living in a small county in Tehran Province with middle socioeconomical status. Regarding her family history, no thromboembolic event or similar visual or neurological disorders had been evident in her first- or second-degree relatives. She had been suffering from decreased vision that she described as central scotoma since 5 days ago. Her first visual attack had lasted for nearly 15 minutes, but thereafter, similar attacks had reoccurred frequently, finally leading to persistent decreased vision since 2 days before her arrival. She had been hospitalized in another center for 2 days. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurologic consult were done there, and the first impression was papillophelebitis at that center, but the patient had discharged home at her own request and referred to our hospital for further assessment. Upon her admission, she was completely conscious, her vital signs were all within normal ranges (blood pressure: 115/75 mmHg, pulse rate: 88 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 14/minute, oral temperature: 36.9 °C), and she had no complaints of poor signs (headache, nausea, vomiting, and/or epigastric pain) other than visual disturbance. Her body mass index was 24.9 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , and obstetrical examination was unremarkable (no evidence of uterine contraction or hypertonicity, rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, or any abnormalities in fetal heart rate tracing). Moreover, reviewing different body systems, sensorimotor neurological examination, gate assessment, lung and heart auscultation, musculoskeletal and dermatological examination, and also liver and spleen palpation (as far as doable due to presence of a large gravid uterus), no pathological findings were revealed. On ophthalmological examination, uncorrected visual acuity was counting fingers at 3-meter distance and 10/10 in her right and left eye, respectively. Direct fundoscopy of the right eye revealed evidence of retinal ischemia and scattered hemorrhages as well as optic disc swelling. Previous brain MRI was reviewed by another radiologist, and no pathologic findings were documented. Furthermore, no abnormalities were found on carotid sonographic examination or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Subsequently, we consulted with an ophthalmologist in Farabi Eye Hospital. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 13 mmHg in both eyes, and there was no abnormal lesion in anterior segment, as well as no vitritis in both eyes. Posterior segment assessment in her right eye revealed evidence of retinal ischemia, cotton-wool spots, and scattered flame-shaped hemorrhages, as well as optic disc swelling, in favor of CRVO and CLRAO (Fig 1 A). The next day, spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT) confirmed our clinically suspected diagnosis (Fig 2 A, B). According to the ophthalmologist's opinion, as no macular edema was evident, no further interventions or early delivery was necessitated. The ophthalmologist highly recommended us to check thrombophilia disorders or other relevant systemic diseases as potential predisposing factors and also to rule out preeclampsia syndrome. Additionally, they emphasized continuing prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 40 mg subcutaneously daily, which had been initiated on her admission, and they arranged an outpatient follow-up a week later. As our investigations ruled out potential comorbidities and preeclampsia syndrome (all blood pressure measurements were normal, and there was no abnormality in laboratory tests except for D-dimer and CRP) (Table 1 ), she was discharged home and no drugs except for LMWH were prescribed for an additional 7 days. There were no changes in her symptoms, and visual acuity remained stable at 3-meter counting fingers at 1-week follow-up. Six days later, she experienced labor pain and thus was admitted again at Imam Khomeyni Hospital; due to establishment of active labor, she subsequently underwent an uncomplicated emergency cesarean section through a Pfannesteil skin incision under regional anesthesia, and a 3300-g female newborn with Apgar score of 9 and 10 at the first and fifth minute was delivered. The baby’s height and head circumference were also 51 and 35.5 cm, respectively. Finally, both mother and baby were discharged home 48 hours later without any complications. We strongly recommended her to organize an ophthalmologist’s appointment as soon as possible. Finally, she visited her ophthalmologist 2 weeks after delivery; the follow-up examination and imaging results are shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 C, D. She had improvement in visual acuity to 4/10 and somewhat decrease in retinal findings. At 8-week postpartum follow-up, her visual acuity was 8/10 in the right eye (Fig. 1 C) and ocular coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was performed, revealing no edema as well as a decrease in vascular density in cilioretinal artery supply in superior of the macula (Fig. 2 E). She had no complications such as IOP rise or neovascularization. One-year follow-up examination was done by the same ophthalmologist, showing that all hemorrhage and exudate had resolved and cilioretinal artery occlusion was barely visible at the superior macula, while on imaging, no macular edema was seen (Figs. 1 D, 2 F). Moreover, thyroid stimulating hormone, complete blood cell count, and 75-g glucose tolerance test were all within normal limits.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Fundus photo of the patient. **A** Fundus photo of the right eye revealed optic nerve edema and diffuse peripapillary flame-shape hemorrhage and cotton-wool spots in the peripapillary region as well as tortuous and dilated veins, and whitening in superior of the macula in favor of cilioretinal artery occlusion. **B** 2-Week postpartum follow-up and **C** 8-week postpartum follow-up revealed a decrease in hemorrhage and cotton-wool spots and discrete exudate in the macula. **D** At 1-year follow-up, all hemorrhage and exudate had resolved and cilioretinal artery occlusion was barely visible visible at the superior macula\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**A** Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the right eye in fovea showed hyperreflectivity in the middle retinal layer and no apparent edema, and **B** in superior macula revealed thickening and hyperreflectivity of the inner retina and shadowing in cilioretinal artery occlusion area. **C** and **D** At 2-week postpartum follow-up. **E** OCT angiography (OCTA) of the right eye at 8-week postpartum follow-up showed a decrease in vascular density in superficial and deep capillary plexus and no macular edema. **F** OCTA follow-up at 1-year revealed a stable nonperfused area and no macular edema\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Table 1 Patient’s laboratory tests**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】We describe a rare case of combined CRVO and CLRAO during late third trimester of an uneventful singleton pregnancy. Finally, no underling systemic disorders, specifically thrombophilia, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsia syndrome, were confirmed, which is extremely rare and unreported in literature. Her ophthalmic workup revealed no macular edema, and her vision improved significantly in postpartum period without any systemic or local ocular medications such as corticosteroids. Also, a 1-year follow-up was arranged, revealing no neovascularization or macular edema. Such long-term follow-up seems to be lacking from previous reports.\n\n【29】In fact, normal pregnancy may displace the hemostatic balance toward hypercoagulability. In other words, pregnancy and the subsequent puerperium represent the classical Virchow’s triad components: hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and vascular damage. The hypercoagulable states within pregnancy could be caused by increased thrombin levels and procoagulant factors and decreased endogenous anticoagulant protein S. On the other hand, venous stasis is caused by progesterone effects on blood vessel walls, even in normal pregnancy \\[ 19 , 20 \\]. Many studies have reported an increased risk of thrombotic disorders during pregnancy \\[ 1 \\]. Thromboembolic events rarely occur in the eyes of a pregnant woman unless the pregnancy is complicated, most frequently by pregnancy hypertension \\[ 21 \\]. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a sight-threatening thrombotic condition, might also be among these thrombotic conditions. Despite the few case reports of RVO in pregnancy, some authors consider pregnancy as a risk factor for RVO \\[ 22 , 23 , 24 \\]. Nevertheless, an interesting population-based study on Korean people showed that preeclampsia/eclampsia is a risk factor for RVO during pregnancy, and the authors suggested that pregnancy itself may not be a predisposing condition for RVO \\[ 25 \\]. However, ocular vascular occlusive (OVO) events, including retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) or combined RVO and RAO, are strongly associated with thrombophilia in young patients \\[ 26 , 27 , 28 \\], leading to severe visual problems as seen in our patient, but fortunately, our patient regained much of her vision within 3 months, and her extensive hematologic workup was unremarkable again.\n\n【30】Kurtz _et al._ described three cases of OVO during pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period in which inherited thrombophilia was finally confirmed, in two pregnant women by diagnosis of BRAO at the 8th and 13th week of gestation and in another with history of uninvestigated visual disturbance 4 days after her last delivery with subsequent CRVO event 15 years later. In two patients, protein S deficiency was finally confirmed \\[ 29 \\]. It is known that free protein S decreases rapidly in the second trimester of pregnancy, but its level is comparable to nonpregnant females in the first trimester, which is why protein S was in lower normal limit in our case.\n\n【31】However, in contrast to the above-mentioned studies, we could not find any inherited thrombophilia, and there was no evidence (for example, hypertension, proteinuria, and disturbed hepatic or renal function tests) in favor of preeclampsia in the presented case.\n\n【32】Our patient showed combined vascular occlusion (CRVO + CLRAO), and she was younger than the mean age that Reval _et al._ reported in a series of CVOs, although they reported that 10 out of 17 patients developed neovascular glaucoma at 3-month follow-up. Fortunately, there was no neovascular glaucoma evident in her follow-up visits around 3 months and 1 year after her visual problem onset. She also subjectively confessed that her visual disturbance and scotoma had decreased to some extent. At her 3-month follow-up visit, her visual acuity increased to 8/10 Snellen acuity, and she underwent OCT and OCT-A, which revealed no signs of macular edema. On fundoscopic examination, no neovascularization was evident, previous retinal hemorrhage had resolved completely, and retinal and optic nerve head edema had regressed significantly, too. Furthermore, no neovascularization was found 9 months later on her last examination.\n\n【33】Humayun _et al._ also reported a 32-year-old woman at 37th week of gestation who suddenly suffered blurred vision and paracentral scotoma in her left eye. They reported she had papillophlebitis combined with branch retinal artery occlusion. The patient underwent elective cesarean section 3 days after, then received a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone for 6 months. Her visual field further improved with only a few residual central and paracentral defects. Subsequently, administration of oral prednisone was tapered slowly and finally discontinued 2 months later \\[ 11 \\]. In contrast to Humayun’s patient, our patient was just on conservative treatment, except for a short course of prophylactic LMWH (40 mg daily) during admission and a week later. There was some recovery in her first postpartum examination, and macular edema had disappeared too. In fact, in case of CRVO, many treatment options have been introduced, and high-quality studies have shown clinically significant improvement in its sequelae, especially macular edema. In the case of macular edema secondary to RVO, the first therapeutic choice is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) administration \\[ 30 , 31 \\]. Nevertheless, there is concern about potential risks of this drug during pregnancy. Although no specific guidelines for treating macular edema in pregnant women exist, corticosteroids might be used \\[ 32 \\]. However, as the main indication for treatment in such cases of combined CRVO and CLRO is macular edema \\[ 30 , 33 \\] and our patient did not show any significant macular edema and was also in late pregnancy, no anti-VEGF or corticosteroids were prescribed.\n\n【34】It is worth noting the interesting similar report of the case of a 25-year-old gravid female diagnosed with right eye CLRAO and incomplete CRVO a week after elective cesarean for twin gestation, in whom symptoms disappeared completely 1 month later without any treatment \\[ 10 \\]. However, in contrast to our case, that patient had minimal vein occlusion signs, for example, dilated and tortuous veins and few retinal hemorrhages, and despite this, she had 20/20 VA. Interestingly both their and our case had elevated D-dimer serum levels. In fact, D-dimer is the most specific marker of fibrinolysis, which is elevated in presence of thrombosis. On the other hand, an increase in maternal plasma D-dimer level may be seen in normal or complicated pregnancies as well as in the postpartum period. Hence, an elevated D-dimer level in pregnancy does not necessarily indicate a complication \\[ 1 , 2 , and 34 \\].\n\n【35】The last interesting point to consider regarding this case is that our patient experienced an initial sudden attack of central visual disturbance for approximately 15 minutes, subsequently followed by more frequent but shorter-lasting attacks, and finally persistent decreased vision. One hypothesis could be suggested concerning the pathogenesis of decreased perfusion of CLRA, which originates from the choroidal artery, which leads to lower pressure in contrast to retinal arterial supply, and even though CLARO occurred due to more occlusion of the central retinal vein in our case.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】We report the case of a young pregnant woman in her late third trimester who developed combined CRVO and CLRAO. To the best of our knowledge, this report is an extremely rare case of OVO in pregnancy in which we could not find any underlying etiology except for the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. As well, a 1-year follow-up was performed, revealing no macular edema. Finally, we should state that, although OVO events are very rare during pregnancy, any clinicians involved in pregnant women’s health should take specific consideration regarding this diagnosis in any patient complaining of visual-related signs and symptoms.\n\n【38】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article (and its additional information files).\n\n【40】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【41】OVO:\n\n【42】Ocular vascular occlusion\n\n【43】CRVO:\n\n【44】Central retinal vein occlusion\n\n【45】CLRAO:\n\n【46】Cilioretinal artery occlusion\n\n【47】DVT:\n\n【48】Deep vein thrombosis\n\n【49】PTE:\n\n【50】Pulmonary thromboembolism\n\n【51】MRI:\n\n【52】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【53】TTE:\n\n【54】Transthoracic echocardiography\n\n【55】IOP:\n\n【56】Intraocular pressure\n\n【57】SD-OCT:\n\n【58】Spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography\n\n【59】LMWH:\n\n【60】Low-molecular-weight heparin\n\n【61】OCT-A:\n\n【62】Ocular coherence tomography angiography\n\n【63】RVO:\n\n【64】Retinal vein occlusion\n\n【65】RAO:\n\n【66】Retinal artery occlusion\n\n【67】Anti-VEGF:\n\n【68】Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In the future, the accumulation and analysis of rare cases that obtain a better survival time will contribute to clarifying neuroendocrine carcinoma biology, and help to improve the prognosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】According to the classification of neuroendocrine tumors by the World Health Organization (WHO), small-cell colon carcinoma is categorized as a neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), which has high malignancy \\[ 1 \\]. A NEC can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract but it is rarely found in the colon: NEC has an incidence rate of only 0.6% of total colon malignancies \\[ 2 \\]. Due to aggressive tumor behavior, distant metastases in internal organs or regional lymph nodes are often found at the same time as detection of a tumor. In addition to these facts, high recurrence rates contribute to poor survival, with a median survival of 10.5 months \\[ 2 \\]. In patients with a metastatic lesion at the time of the surgery, the median survival time is only four months \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Here we report the long-term survival of a patient with advanced small-cell colon cancer who received continuous chemotherapy.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 67-year-old Japanese man underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) in our institution for follow up after gastrectomy; the CT revealed abnormal thickness of his sigmoid colon wall and further studies were planned. Two years previously, he had undergone a distal gastrectomy due to gastric cancer (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma), and received S-1 (tegafur-gimeracil, 100mg) orally for 14 days followed by a seven-day rest period as adjuvant therapy for two years. He also had inactive hepatitis C. There were no abnormalities on physical examination except for an upper abdominal midline scar due to previous surgery, and his performance status was grade 0. There were no abnormalities found on laboratory tests.\n\n【13】A double contrast radiological examination with barium enema showed a protruding lesion with a smooth surface at the distal end of the sigmoid colon, and the lumen was narrowed for approximately 2cm. An endoscopy demonstrated a 20mm Bormann 2 lesion with central ulceration located 20cm from the anal verge (Figure 1 ). No metastatic sites in other internal organs were confirmed by CT.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**Endoscopic findings.** An endoscopy demonstrated a 20mm Bormann 2 lesion with a central ulceration located 20cm from the anal verge.\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Multiple biopsies from the main site showed group V malignant cells that were positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56, and proved to be a NEC.\n\n【19】Under a diagnosis of NEC, a sigmoidectomy was performed. During the operation, three small hard white nodes were found at the mesenteric and pelvic cavity. The main tumor was located at 20cm on the oral side of the peritoneal reflection, and dissected by three enlarged paracolic lymph nodes.\n\n【20】Macroscopically, a 15×20mm sub-mucosal tumor with the appearance of a small central ulceration was observed in the sigmoid colon (Figure 2 ).\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Macroscopic findings.** A 15×20mm sub-mucosal tumor with the appearance of a small central ulceration was observed in the sigmoid colon.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Microscopically, the tumor deeply invaded the tissue and extended beyond the serosa. On hematoxylin and eosin staining, the tumor had high cellularity with appearance of hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular sheets, rosette arrangements, and alveolar structures (Figure 3 ). Immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 were also positive, which indicates an endocrine function (Figures 4 and 5 ). Several ductal structures were occupied by mucinous fluid and positivity for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), PAS-diastase (d-PAS), and Alcian blue was observed on the mucosal surface, suggesting the adenocarcinoma was included within the tumor. The nodules in the mesenteric and paracolic lymph nodes were also pathologically diagnosed as metastases. Finally, the tumor was diagnosed as a NEC (small-cell carcinoma).\n\n【26】**Figure 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Pathological appearance of small-cell colon carcinoma on hematoxylin and eosin staining (original magnification ×100).**\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Figure 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Synaptophysin was positive on immunohistochemical staining (original magnification ×100).**\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】**Figure 5**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**Chromogranin A was positive on immunohistochemical staining (original magnification ×100).**\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】Adjuvant chemotherapy was planned based on a regimen for small-cell lung carcinoma. Cisplatin plus irinotecan (cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy, cisplatin 60mg/m <sup>2 </sup> day 1 and irinotecan 60mg/m <sup>2 </sup> days 1, 8, and 15) were administered. Only a grade 2 side effect of transaminitis was observed during chemotherapy, and the patient recovered conservatively from this side effect. After finishing five cycles of chemotherapy, an evaluation CT showed no findings of recurrence. After cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy was finished, tegafur-uracil (UFT; 400mg) and leucovorin (UZEL, 75mg) were administered orally for 28 days followed by a seven-day rest period. Nine months after surgery, follow-up CT showed an enlarged lymph node behind the inferior vena cava and a 15×8mm nodule located at the ventral side of the cecum, which raised a suspicion of mesenteric dissemination. Under consideration of progressive disease, cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy was performed again using the same regimen. After nine cycles of cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy, a follow-up gastric endoscopy demonstrated external tumor invasion to the anterior duodenum wall due to growing peritoneal dissemination. It seemed that the tumor had acquired a resistance to cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy, and therefore carboplatin plus etoposide therapy, carboplatin plus etoposide therapy carboplatin 390mg day 1 + etoposide 96mg, 80% dose, days 1, 2, 3 were selected as a third-line regimen. After six cycles of carboplatin plus etoposide therapy, the peritoneal dissemination sites had not expanded on CT findings, and the tumor invasion on the anterior duodenum wall had partially receded on endoscopic findings. At the present moment, the survival time has reached approximately 30 months after the initial surgery.\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】According to the 2010 WHO classification of neuroendocrine neoplasia (NET), NET was categorized into grade 1 and grade 2 based on the malignant potential of metastasis, and tumors with high malignancy were divided into NEC or mixed adenoendocrine carcinoma, which includes an element of adenocarcinoma of more than 30% \\[ 1 \\]. The present case was pathologically diagnosed as a small-cell carcinoma mixed with poor to moderate adenocarcinoma elements of less than 30%, and was categorized as NEC based on WHO classifications. When applying the present WHO classification, special attention should be paid because previously well or poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas are redefined separately as NET grade 2 and NEC.\n\n【41】A definitive diagnosis was made histopathologically, and immunohistochemical staining greatly helps in diagnosis \\[ 4 \\]. Saclarides _et al_ . reported that more than a few cases initially diagnosed as carcinoid were changed to NEC after histopathological analysis \\[ 3 \\]. In the present case, diagnosis was made preoperatively based on the immunohistochemical staining of chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56. An endoscopic biopsy diagnosis is occasionally changed from well to moderately differentiated colon adenocarcinoma to NEC by pathological evaluations after surgery \\[ 3 \\]. When any specific structures of NEC are histologically found, routine immunohistochemical staining contributes to appropriate diagnosis and continuous early treatment.\n\n【42】Chemotherapy for NEC is often performed based on the regimen for small-cell lung carcinoma. The latest guidelines for small-cell lung carcinoma from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend etoposide plus platinum agents such as cisplatin or carboplatin for limited stage, and adding irinotecan instead of etoposide for extensive stage \\[ 5 \\]. The present case initially received cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy, and secondly carboplatin plus etoposide therapy was selected because the tumor acquired resistance to cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy. In the present case, which was considered to have a high recurrence risk, UFT and UZEL were selected for maintenance and carboplatin plus etoposide therapy after the first cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy was administered based on a colon cancer regimen. Although the disease-free interval from the first cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy to recurrence was approximately four months, cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy was selected again. In the NCCN guidelines for small-cell lung cancer, when a recurrence is observed less than six months after finishing chemotherapy, a different treatment regimen is recommended \\[ 5 \\]. It might have been better to change from cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy to carboplatin plus etoposide therapy at the time of recurrence because the tumor had already shown resistance to cisplatin plus irinotecan therapy.\n\n【43】It is very rare for patients with small-cell colon carcinoma to survive for approximately 30 months after being diagnosed with stage IV disease and peritoneal disseminations. Some reports have shown long-term survival despite an advanced stage by combination of operation and effective chemotherapy \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Unfortunately, patient characteristics associated with positive results from chemotherapy and favorable outcomes are still unknown because so few cases achieve long-term survival. A recent clinical trial showed the efficacy of amrubicin, an anthracycline agent with potent topoisomerase II inhibition activity, in improving survival time as second-line treatment for patients with small-cell lung cancer \\[ 8 \\]. Although the number of cases was limited, Asayama _et al_ . also reported the efficacy of amrubicin as first-line treatment for five cases of gastrointestinal endocrine carcinoma \\[ 9 \\]. Earlier reports suggested that a certain percentage of patients with small-cell colon carcinoma had sensitivity for chemotherapy and achieved a better prognosis \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【44】In general, small-cell colon carcinoma has a high risk for recurrence and the follow-up method is important. Because recurrence sites are found in various organs, such as lymph nodes, liver, lung, and brain, less invasive whole body screening is needed. A recent study showed the effectiveness of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy on diagnosis and follow up by using an <sup>111 </sup> indium pentetreotide that specifically associated with the somatostatin receptor in NEC \\[ 10 \\]. However, the superiority of CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is still controversial, and regular whole body screening and reassessment of chemotherapeutic effect is essential.\n\n【45】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【46】In this patient, long-term survival was achieved with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, even though the cancer was at an advanced stage. The ideal strategy for advanced small-cell colon carcinoma has not yet been established. However, if it is determined before the operation that the tumor is advanced, then tumor resection should be performed, and selecting a chemotherapy regimen based on established guidelines will contribute to a better prognosis.\n\n【47】In the future, the accumulation and analysis of rare cases that obtain a better survival time will contribute to clarify NEC biology, and help to improve the prognosis.\n\n【48】Consent\n-------\n\n【49】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

His medical history showed that laboratory culture and serological tests had revealed recurrent herpetic keratitis in that eye. At his initial visit, the best corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were 12/200 OD and 20/20 OS.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**Left, preoperative appearance showing lipid deposition covering pupil** . Right, postoperative appearance 2 weeks after DLKP. There is blood in the interface between graft and host.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】DLKP with single running 10-0 nylon sutures was performed (Figure 1 , right). Complete graph epithelization was achieved within 5 days. In addition to 0.1% topical dexamethasone qid (Sanbethasone <sup>® </sup> , Santen) and levofuroxacine eyedrops qid (Cravit <sup>® </sup> , Santen) for 5 months, the patient was prescribed 1000 mg/day oral acyclovir (Zovirax <sup>® </sup> , Glaxo Smith Kline), to be commenced the day prior to the operation and continued for 10 days to prevent herpetic recurrence.\n\n【20】The corneal graft remained in good condition with recovery of BCVA to 20/100 until the fifth postoperative month, at which time the patient was readmitted with decreased vision and right ocular pain. Examination revealed stromal herpetic keratitis, stromal melting and wound dehiscence with descemetocele at between 2 and 4 o'clock to the donor-recipient apposition site. (Figure 2 , left) The anterior chamber was shallow, and incarceration of the iris was observed. The patient was prescribed 1000 mg peroral acyclovir and ointment five times a day. Due to the development of corneal perforation and unavailability of donor corneal tissue, running sutures were replaced with interrupted sutures, and frozen AM trimmed to fit the site was transplanted with a \"roll-in filling technique\", i.e., roll-in AM was used to provide wound apposition without sutures, while a second AM patch was used to cover the melting area with interrupted sutures. (Figure2, right, AMT indicated by arrow). Preservative-free hyaluronate and topical antibiotic eye drops were prescribed qid. Acyclovir ointment was prescribed five times a day for 3 months. Following AM transplantation, stromal inflammation subsided and complete epithelization was achieved within 10 days of surgery. At 8 months postoperatively, biomicroscopy revealed stable wound apposition and stromal gain.\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Left, postoperative appearance 5 months after DLKP showing ulceration, stromal melting, wound dehiscence and iris incarceration** . Right, postoperative appearance 2 weeks after AMT.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Postkeratoplasty oral acyclovir prophylaxis has been reported to prevent recurrences. In our opinion, the wound perforation seen here was a result of insufficient prophylaxis with recurrence. AM transplantation has been widely reported to be an efficient procedure for central and peripheral corneal erosion, ulceration and perforations. The beneficial effectsof this approach result from the presence of a rich extracellular matrix and collagen which provide a stromal substrate as in our case and anti-inflammatory properties arising from entrapment of inflammatory cells, the presence of various growth factors, inhibition of proteinase activity, and decrease of lipid peroxidation.\\[ 3 \\] AM patch has also been reported to be effective in acute ulcerative and necrotizing herpetic stromal keratitis\\[ 4 \\] due toreduction of gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 and increased expression of TIMP-1.\\[ 5 \\] These properties may have been responsible for the effective suppression of herpetic inflammation seen in this particular case.\n\n【27】AM has been commomly used to repair areas of corneal stromal loss by mutilayered AM, but which technique is difficult to apply for wound dehiscence because of shape of stromal loss. Our modified \"AM roll-in filling technique\" can provide compact and dense spacer for such stromal loss site. We have reported the successful application of AM in wound dehiscence and herpetic stromal melting after DLKP. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of the \"AM roll-in filling technique\" for such patients. Due to availability of corneal donor, this technique could be used as a first choice in such situation.\n\n【28】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【29】AM:\n\n【30】amniotic membrane\n\n【31】AMT:\n\n【32】amniotic membrane transplantation\n\n【33】BCVA:\n\n【34】the best corrected visual acuities\n\n【35】DLKP:\n\n【36】deep lamellar keratoplasty\n\n【37】MMP:\n\n【38】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【39】TIMP:\n\n【40】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

However, this pattern may be difficult to diagnose in some variant cases. We aimed to describe dermoscopic patterns of dermatofibroma according to its histopathological subtypes, with special emphasis on new and rare dermoscopic features.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This prospective study, which was conducted between September 2015 and May 2016 in the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Hassan II, Fez, Morocco, included 100 cases of dermatofibroma confirmed on clinical and histological grounds. Each lesion was scored for classic, previously reported, or new dermoscopic features.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】All our Moroccan patients had a dark skin phototype (Fitzpatrick scale types IV and V). A total of 14 morphological dermoscopic structures were distinguished, and 17 dermoscopic patterns were observed, with the most common pattern being the central white patch and peripheral pigment network (21%). New patterns observed in our study were a white ring around an ulceration (6%), a pigment network with a pigmented ring around follicular openings (2%), and a discreet peripheral network and starlike white patch (3%). A patchy network with white patches was significantly noted in atrophic dermatofibroma ( _p_ \\= 0.01); vascularization was described in both aneurysmal and hemosiderotic dermatofibromas ( _p_ \\= 0.002); and a white ring around an ulceration was noted in aneurysmal dermatofibroma ( _p_ < 0.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】We provide a description of dermoscopic patterns of dermatofibroma according to its histological subtypes in a dark skin phototype, along with a new report of a white ring around an ulceration as a significant pattern in aneurysmal dermatofibroma.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】Dermatofibroma (DF) or benign fibrous histiocytoma represents one of the most common skin tumors \\[ 1 \\]; it accounts for approximately 3% of the skin biopsy specimens received at dermatology laboratories \\[ 2 \\]. It is a neoplasm of the soft tissue and bone composed of fibroblastic and histiocytic components without any nuclear pleomorphism or histological anaplasia \\[ 3 \\]. In addition to common fibrous histiocytoma, other variants have been described to date, including aneurysmal, hemosiderotic, cellular, epithelioid, atypical, lipidized, clear cell, palisading, atrophic, keloidal, granular cell, myxoid, lichenoid, balloon cell, and signet ring cell variants, with the possibility of coexistence of histological features of several variants in the same lesion \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In its classical form as a small, raised, cutaneous nodule with a red-brown surface located on the limbs, DF is easy to diagnose clinically, but the diagnosis becomes difficult in variants and atypical cases. For this reason, it is important to improve other noninvasive diagnostic tools, especially dermoscopy.\n\n【12】A pigment network and a central white patch have been described as the typical appearance of common fibrous dermatofibromas (CFDFs) visualized by dermoscopy. When present, the pigment network and central white patch allow the examiner to confirm the diagnosis and set a conservative therapeutic approach \\[ 6 \\], but in variants and atypical DFs, these features are not usually present. Our objective was to investigate the dermoscopic patterns of DF in our Moroccan population and to describe significant patterns related to different histopathological variants of DF.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】We conducted a descriptive and analytical study of digital dermoscopic images of DF prospectively collected in the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Hassan II of Fez in Morocco during a period of 10 months from September 2015 to May 2016.\n\n【15】### Subjects\n\n【16】Ninety-five Moroccan patients with 100 DFs were enrolled in the study. DF was confirmed either by clinical findings in CFDF with the classic dermoscopic pattern of pigment network and central white patch or on histological grounds in difficult and atypical cases of DF. The excision was also performed if the patient requested a histological confirmation.\n\n【17】### Data analysis\n\n【18】Clinical data were obtained for each patient, including age and sex as well as the phototype, location, and size of the lesions. Dermoscopic images were documented with a digital camera (DermLite, 3Gen Inc., San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA; or Fotofinder, Bad Birnbach, Germany) with or without polarized light and with or without immersion. To avoid collapse of the vessels in the lesions, no pressure was used.\n\n【19】Clinical and dermoscopic data were analyzed and evaluated by two independent dermoscopists experienced in dermoscopy in our department. Clinical and dermoscopic images of atypical variants of DF confirmed on the basis of histology were retrospectively analyzed after excision. Dermoscopic features were divided into three categories: (1) classic with pigment network and central white patch, (2) previously reported patterns, and (3) new dermoscopic patterns.\n\n【20】Data extraction was performed using Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). These data were then analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA), and descriptive statistics were expressed as means and percentages. In the univariate analysis, the chi-square test was used to compare these percentages. A _p_ value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All subjects were informed of the conditions related to the study and gave their informed consent.\n\n【21】Results\n-------\n\n【22】One hundred lesions in 95 Moroccan patients were evaluated. The average age of the patients was 40.3±8.7 years old (range 17–56 years old), and there was a female predominance in our sample (63%). All patients had dark skin based on Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (94% phototype IV, 6% phototype V).\n\n【23】The lesions were located on the limbs in 75% of cases and on the back in 20% of cases. The lesions ranged in size from 0.5 cm to 10 cm in a case of a giant DF. The color varied from pink to light and dark brown. Twenty-nine percent of the lesions were nodular, and 50% were popular. Sixteen percent of the lesions were atrophic plaques, and 5% were tumors. Four histological subtypes were distinguished: CFDF (72% of cases), atrophic DF (17%), aneurysmal DF (7%), and hemosiderotic DF (4%). Fourteen dermoscopic structures were described in our study: pigment network (79% of cases), white patches (70%), homogeneous pigmentation (36%), white streaks (18%), globule-like structures (18%), peripheral ring (13%), ulceration (6%), brown streaks (6%), ringlike structures and heterogeneous pigmentation (3%), comedo _\\-_ like openings (3%), inverted network (3%), milia-like cysts (2%), and vascular structures (30%) (Table 1 ).\n\n【24】**Table 1 Dermoscopic structures of 100 dermatofibromas**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】Structures such as an inverted network, a discreet pigment network, globule-like structures, and brown streaks were visualized using immersion (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【27】**Fig. 1**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】**a** , **b** , **c** , **d** Before immersion. **e** , **f** , **g** , **h** After immersion: better visualization of pigmented structures as peripheral network globules ( **e** , **f** ), pigmented streaks ( **g** ), and an inverted network ( **h** )\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Seventeen dermoscopic patterns were then distinguished, and they were divided into three categories: classic pattern with pigment network and central white patch (21% of cases), previously reported patterns with multicomponent pattern (20%), patchy network and multiple white patches (16%), lentigo-like pattern (12%), pink bluish pigmentation with vascularization (7%), central homogeneous pigmentation and peripheral pigment network (9%), total homogeneous pigmentation (3%), ringlike structures and a central scarlike white patch (3%), peripheral homogeneous pigmentation and central white scarlike patch (2%), seborrheic keratosis-like pattern (2%), total white scarlike patch (1%), peripheral homogeneous pigmentation and central inverted network (1%), and heterogeneous pigmentation and multiple white patches (1%). New dermoscopic patterns were a white ring around an ulceration (6% of cases), pigment network with a ring around the follicular openings (2%), and a discreet peripheral network and starlike white patch (3%) (Table 2 and Figs. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ).\n\n【32】**Table 2 Dermoscopic patterns of 100 dermatofibromas**\n\n【33】Full size table\n\n【34】**Fig. 2**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**a** \\- **d** Classic dermoscopic patterns of common fibrous dermatofibroma: pigment network and central scarlike white patch with central globule-like structures\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Fig. 3**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】Previously reported dermoscopic patterns of common fibrous dermatofibroma. **a** , **b** Lentigo-like pattern. **a** Dark phototype. **b** Clear phototype. **c** , **d** Peripheral ringlike structures with central white scarlike appearance. **e** , **f** Seborrheic keratosis-like pattern. **g** , **h** Multicomponent pattern. **i** Peripheral pigment network and central inverted network. **j** Total scarlike patch.

Atrophic DF was significantly localized in the lower limbs ( _p_ \\= 0.002). The pink coloration was related to the hemosiderotic DF ( _p_ \\= 0.004).\n\n【55】The four patterns significantly related to the classic type of DF were central white patch and peripheral pigment network, homogeneous pigmentation with peripheral pigment network, lentigo-like pattern, and total homogeneous pigmentation ( _p_ ≤ 0.02), whereas the pattern of patchy pigment network and multiple white patches was significantly described in atrophic DF ( _p_ \\= 0.01). Vascularization was described in both the aneurysmal and hemosiderotic DFs ( _p_ ≤ 0.04), and the aneurysmal DF was characterized by the white ring around an ulceration ( _p_ < 0.001) (Table 3 ).\n\n【56】**Table 3 Univariate analysis showing clinical and dermoscopic characteristics significantly related to different variants of dermatofibroma**\n\n【57】Full size table\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】DFs may display different morphological faces with different histological variants. In our study, these variants were atrophic DF, aneurysmal DF, and hemosiderotic DF. Although this benign tumor may mimic melanocytic lesions, especially melanoma in its atypical forms \\[ 7 \\], the establishment of its significant dermoscopic patterns has developed at a far slower pace than melanocytic lesions because there are fewer than ten analytical studies on DF reported in the literature \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\], compared with the large number of studies on melanocytic lesions.\n\n【60】The misdiagnosis of DFs as melanocytic lesions is probably more important in our population, owing to the fact that the patterns significantly related to this benign tumor were characterized by pigmented features such as a pigment network, homogeneous pigmentation with peripheral pigment network, a lentigo-like pattern, or total homogeneous pigmentation. This may be explained by the dark skin phototype of our patients, which increased the need for better characterization of DF in the dark phototype.\n\n【61】The pattern of a pigmented peripheral network and a central white scarlike patch was the most stereotypical and common finding of CFDF. It corresponds to pronounced fibrosis within the papillary dermis with hyperpigmented rete ridges at the edge of DF \\[ 9 \\]. This pattern represented 62% of cases in the study of Agero _et al._ \\[ 14 \\] and 34% in the study of Zaballos _et al._ \\[ 15 \\], whereas it was noted in only 21% of cases in our study. This may be explained by the particularity of the skin of our population, as stated above. Wide variation of patterns has been described in the literature and in our work on CFDF, although some of these patterns are very rare, such as the total white scarlike patch and the seborrheic keratosis-like pattern \\[ 9 , 15 , 16 \\]. These must be known as possible presentations of this tumor in order to increase diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【62】Pink bluish pigmentation with vascularization was noted in hemosiderotic DFs in our study and in a case report by Zaballos _et al._ \\[ 17 \\], whereas Blum _et al._ \\[ 9 , 18 \\] reported a pattern of an asymmetric blue grayish area with globules, a pigment network, and streaks without pink bluish coloration. The blue color was reported to correspond to the dermal pigmented siderophages, and the pink color in our study may correspond to the numerous small vessels, extravasated erythrocytes, and hemosiderin deposits \\[ 17 \\]. The presence of vascular structures was also noted in aneurysmal DFs, which was similarly reported in one other study \\[ 15 \\]. The patchy network and multiple white patches were noted in the atrophic variant of DF. This variant was rarely noted in other studies \\[ 14 , 15 \\], whereas it represented 16% of cases in our study (Table 4 ).\n\n【63】**Table 4 Review of the literature concerning dermoscopic patterns of dermatofibromas**\n\n【64】Full size table\n\n【65】Furthermore, we defined new dermoscopic patterns such as a pigmented ring around the follicular openings in dark-skinned patients. This pigmented ring is different from the small ringlike structures or globule with a darker peripheral rim forming a kind of network, which corresponds to flattened and broad rete ridges, as previously reported by Zaballos _et al._ \\[ 15 \\] and Agero _et al._ \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【66】The white ring around an ulceration was highly related to aneurysmal DF in this study. It may be a very useful sign to differentiate between aneurysmal DF and achromic melanoma, especially because this variant of DF is also characterized by polymorphous vessels and linear irregular vessels, which may be confusing and misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. So, in addition to the reported nonspecific signs of a central bluish or reddish homogeneous area with white structures and a peripheral delicate pigment network with vascular structures of variable degrees \\[ 9 , 19 \\], this ring pattern could be of great help in diagnosing difficult cases of aneurysmal DF.\n\n【67】The white color may be explained by the spindle cells’ disposition and dermal fibrosis around the large blood-filled spaces without endothelial lining \\[ 20 \\]. If they are large and superficial, these hemorrhagic spaces may cause epidermal removal and ulceration surrounded by fibrosis, which appears as a white ring around the ulceration.\n\n【68】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【69】This study provides a description of dermoscopic patterns of DF according to histological subtypes in a dark skin phototype, with a new report of patterns such as the white ring around an ulceration as a significant one in aneurysmal DF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In these diseases, the elevated troponin level is relatively low; the higher the troponin, the greater the possibility of AMI \\[ 1 \\]. Moreover, in AMI, the elevated troponin level persists for 7–10 days owing to necrotic release from cardiomyocytes, but in other diseases, the troponin level declines relatively rapidly \\[ 1 \\]. A report showed that patients with sepsis who had higher troponin levels tended to have a higher mortality rate \\[ 2 \\]. Herein, we report a case of septic shock in which the troponin level was extremely high and persisted even after recovery from sepsis, despite the absence of myocardial necrosis.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 61-year-old Japanese man with impaired consciousness was transported to our hospital. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, old myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). On initial evaluation, he had shock with cool peripheries, blood pressure of 79/68 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3/15, and axillary temperature of 31 °C. Additionally, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed diffuse left ventricular wall dyskinesia, with a visual ejection fraction (EF) of 20–30% (originally 47% with posterolateral wall hypokinesia/akinesia). Electrocardiography revealed widespread ST depression with ST elevation in the aVR lead (Fig. 1 A). Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), metabolic acidosis, anemia, hypoglycemia, and elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) level (Table 1 ). Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral consolidation (Fig. 1 B). We consulted a cardiologist because of the extremely high hs-cTnI level (54,138 ng/L), but the cardiologist considered AMI unlikely. The patient was diagnosed as having pneumonia (sputum culture grew _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ ) and septic shock, and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 54 and 12, respectively. In the emergency department, orotracheal intubation was performed, and antimicrobial administration, fluid resuscitation, vasopressor agent administration, and blood transfusion were started. After admission to the intensive care unit, continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) was also started for AKI. On the first day of admission, he had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) twice, but the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved at both times with a 1 g adrenaline dose. CHDF was terminated on the second day, and vasopressors/inotropic agent administration was terminated on the third day. The patient was weaned off from the ventilator on the seventh day and transferred to the hospital for rehabilitation on the 23rd day. After the transfer, he had no problems and was discharged.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】**A** Electrocardiogram on admission showing ST depression in leads I, II, III, aVL, aVF, and V3–V6, with ST elevation in the aVR lead. **B** Chest computed tomography image on admission showing consolidations in the right lower, left upper, and lower lobes\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】**Table 1 Blood test results at admission**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】Nevertheless, his hs-cTnI level continued to be extremely high during admission. It was > 500,000, 193,309, 29,357, and 4747 ng/L on the second, third, 13th, and 20th days, respectively. On the 17th day, TTE was performed, no new asynergy was found, and the EF improved to 38%. On the 21st day, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was performed under the care of a cardiologist, and no new myocardial necrosis was observed (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy image showing no evidence of new infarction. **A** Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy images on the 21st day of hospitalization and **B** before admission\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】We found that sepsis can cause an extremely high troponin level, as in very large myocardial infarctions. No previous studies have reported that troponin levels in sepsis can be as high as in this case. A study that used the same troponin assay that we used (ARCHITECT STAT hs-TnI, Abbott) showed that the median hs-cTnI levels (ng/L) in sepsis on the first through the third day were 109 \\[interquartile range (IQR) 39–394\\], 103 (IQR 38–449), and 79 (IQR 31–281), respectively \\[ 3 \\]. In the present case, the patient’s hs-cTnI level was higher than the measurable range (> 500,000 ng/L), and we suspected that the measurement might be inaccurate. However, the hs-cTnI level on the next day was also extremely high (193,309 ng/L); thus, we thought that the measurement of the troponin levels was accurate. As for the complication of AMI, we consulted a cardiologist and even performed myocardial scintigraphy; consequently, no new ischemic changes occurred. In addition, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism are also causes of very high troponin levels \\[ 1 \\], but no findings were suggestive of these diseases. Therefore, we concluded that the extremely high hs-cTnI levels were due to sepsis-induced myocardial injury.\n\n【24】In this case, the high troponin level persisted for at least 20 days. In general, troponin levels decline relatively quickly in diseases other than AMI \\[ 1 \\]. However, a previous report also showed that, in some cases of sepsis, troponin levels remained elevated even on the seventh day \\[ 4 \\]. Hence, high troponin levels are likely to persist in sepsis.\n\n【25】The present case had a good outcome even though the troponin level continued to be extremely high. A recent study showed that, in sepsis, the higher the hs-cTnI level, the higher the mortality rate, but the relationship disappeared when the level was > 100–500 ng/L \\[ 3 \\]. Therefore, the extremely high troponin level in sepsis may not indicate a poor prognosis in proportion to the value. In addition, we consider that septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) may have contributed to the troponin elevation and favorable outcome in our case. No clear diagnostic criteria have been established for SCM, but the characteristic echocardiographic findings are left ventricular dilatation and decreased EF, both of which are reversible \\[ 5 \\]. These findings were also observed in our case, which indicated that the patient had SCM. A report showed that, in sepsis with SCM, troponin levels were around four times higher than in sepsis without SCM \\[ 6 \\]. The prognosis in SCM with hypokinetic conditions (EF < 40%, no tachycardia, large left ventricle, and so on) is considered good \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【26】SCM alone cannot explain why the troponin level was extremely elevated in our case. The patient had a history of coronary artery disease and CKD. These are factors that cause elevation of troponin level in sepsis \\[ 3 \\]. Moreover, he had complications of anemia and hypoglycemia, and PEA on the first day. These etiologies can also cause elevation of troponin level \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. The elevation of troponin level, in this case, is thought to be caused by a combination of SCM and these conditions.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】Herein, we report a case of extremely high hs-cTnI levels induced by septic shock. In spite of the high levels, the patient’s clinical outcome was good, and no evidence of new myocardial ischemic findings was found.\n\n【29】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【30】The data for this case report are located at Tokushima Red Cross Hospital.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

He started treatment with axitinib at 10 mg/day, and the dose was gradually tapered down to 4 mg/day because of intolerable adverse events. His metastatic lesions shrank; however, he could not continue due to the adverse events. He started fourth-line therapy with nivolumab; however, the metastatic lesions increased. Rechallenge with axitinib 4 mg/day was started, and the dose was reduced to 2 mg/day because of adverse events. Subsequently, the adverse events became controllable, and the metastatic lesions were maintained at reduced size.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Therapeutic drug monitoring of axitinib could play an important role in the development of safe and effective therapeutic treatment and individualization of these medications.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Currently, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs including cytokines and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. Among these, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and I-O drugs have been reported to have high therapeutic efficacy \\[ 1 \\]. Furthermore, I-O drugs are recommended for early use for patients classed as intermediate or poor risk in the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk groups \\[ 1 \\]. However, there is no established treatment after treatment failure of such agents \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. We describe the case of a patient with mRCC refractory to interferon α, sunitinib, axitinib, and nivolumab therapies, who was treated with low-dose axitinib re-administration. A low-dose axitinib rechallenge down to 2 mg/day after nivolumab therapy resulted in positive outcomes with the metastases maintained at reduced size.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 66-year-old Japanese man who had no past medical or medication history complained of gross hematuria and visited a nearby hospital in October 2013. He had no habit of drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco. He was diagnosed as having a right renal tumor and underwent right nephrectomy laparoscopically. The pathological diagnosis was right renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell carcinoma, pT1bN0M0, v1 (Fig. 1 ). One and half years later, lymph node swelling was detected at hepatic portal region and he underwent lymphadenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was a metastasis from RCC. Two years after diagnosis, he was suspected of lung metastases and started treatment with interferon α. Three years later, the multiple lung metastases grew larger and were determined as progression despite interferon α therapy. At this point, he was referred to our hospital in October 2016. There were no abnormalities on physical examination and his vital signs were normal. He started treatment with sunitinib 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment and 2 weeks off; however, adverse events including grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 49,000/μL), gum swelling, and hoarseness became intolerable 2 weeks after starting sunitinib. Four weeks after cessation of sunitinib 50 mg/day, he was started on a dose of sunitinib 25 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. Computed tomography (CT) findings in January 2017 revealed that his lung metastases had shrunk; however, he continued to experience the same adverse events. Therefore, the dose of sunitinib was further reduced to 12.5 mg/day on a schedule of 2 weeks on and 1 week off. CT findings in May 2017 revealed new metastases in the pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter (Fig. 2 a, b). As a result, the treatment was changed from sunitinib to axitinib and he started treatment with axitinib at 10 mg/day; however, adverse events including gum swelling, dysphonia, hypertension, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia became intolerable (Fig. 3 ). Two weeks after cessation of the drug, the dose of axitinib was gradually reduced from 6 mg/day to 4 mg/day. CT findings in September 2017 revealed the metastases had diminished in size and lung metastases were maintained at a diminished size (Fig. 2 c, d); however, the adverse events could not be controlled and he discontinued axitinib treatment. His adverse events improved after discontinuation of axitinib; however, CT findings in December 2017 revealed the size of metastases had increased again (Fig. 2 e, f). Consequently, he was started on fourth-line therapy with nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and did not experience any adverse events. However, after he had received eight cycles of nivolumab, his metastatic lesions had grown, peritoneal dissemination appeared in his pelvic region, and pleural effusion appeared (Fig. 2 g, h), so nivolumab was discontinued. After giving a detailed explanation of treatment options to our patient, he decided to rechallenge with axitinib 4 mg/day. However, adverse events including gum swelling and dysphonia became intolerable. After that, the dose of axitinib was reduced to 2 mg/day, and he experienced relief of adverse symptoms except for hoarseness. CT findings in August 2018 revealed metastases in lungs, pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter had diminished in size (Fig. 2 i, j). He has been continuously receiving a low dose of axitinib at 2 mg/day for 10 months with metastases maintained at reduced size.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Pathological findings of original right renal tumor.

The adverse events of axitinib experienced by our patient were not controllable and it was discontinued even after gradual tapering to a dose of 4 mg/day.\n\n【26】RCC can be treated with curative intent surgery when diagnosed at a local stage; however, mRCC will progress in most cases and require systemic therapy. Early oncologic immunotherapies such as interleukin-2 and interferon-α were reported in the 1990s. They are non-specific cytokine therapies for RCC, and exert their effects by generating activation of T cell responses. The median survival time of Japanese patients with mRCC was approximately twice as long as that of patient in studies from North America or Europe \\[ 5 \\]. Treatment of mRCC has evolved significantly over the past 20 years. Since 2005, the approved first-line treatment consists of TKIs such as sunitinib that target the VEGFRs. Second-line therapies include treatments targeting the VEGF pathway, and more recently immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab have been developed. Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3, approved for second-line therapy for advanced RCC. Recently, axitinib has been replaced by cabozantinib and nivolumab in the second-line setting in international guidelines, and the place of axitinib in therapy is therefore challenging. Axitinib is well tolerated, with the expected adverse events of VEGFR-TKIs. In most cases, these adverse events are manageable and reversible with dose adaptation or interruption and supportive care; however, the present case discontinued axitinib, even though the dose was gradually reduced to 4 mg/day because of adverse events such as gum swelling, dysphonia, and diarrhea. After rechallenge with axitinib at a dose reduced to 2 mg/day, there was relief of adverse symptoms except for hoarseness, and metastases of lungs, pleura, diaphragm, and the right paracolic gutter diminished in size. Japanese ethnicity is reported to be associated with decreased systemic clearance of axitinib, resulting in a higher exposure \\[ 6 \\]. If our patient had been treated with a reduced dose of axitinib at 2 mg/day before the nivolumab therapy, the metastases could have been maintained at a diminished size. Recently, novel patterns of response and progression to immunotherapy such as durable response, pseudoprogression, hyperprogression, and dissociated response have been reported \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, there may also have been a possibility of a durable response to nivolumab after pseudoprogression; however, we discontinued nivolumab because of disease progression. Standardized definitions and clear mechanisms of these responses have not been established and further clarification is needed \\[ 7 \\]. Recently, axitinib in combination with an I-O drug was reported to have a striking effect on patients with mRCC \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. There may also have been the interactive effects of nivolumab and axitinib in our case.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】We described the case of a patient with mRCC treated with low-dose axitinib re-administration with positive outcomes after treatment failure of interferon α, sunitinib, axitinib, and nivolumab. Therapeutic drug monitoring of axitinib could play an important role in the development of safe and effective therapeutic treatment and individualization of these medications.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】CT:\n\n【31】Computed tomography\n\n【32】IMDC:\n\n【33】International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium\n\n【34】I-O:\n\n【35】Immuno-oncology\n\n【36】mRCC:\n\n【37】Metastatic renal cell carcinoma\n\n【38】mTOR:\n\n【39】Mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【40】RCC :\n\n【41】Renal cell carcinoma\n\n【42】TKIs:\n\n【43】Tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n\n【44】VEGF:\n\n【45】Vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【46】VEGFR:\n\n【47】Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

There is concern about intrabiliary tumor growth which may affect the surgical margin, resulting in local recurrence after hepatectomy for colorectal cancer liver metastasis; however, there has been no report of the dissemination in the bile duct after hepatectomy. Here, we report an unusual case of biliary dissemination of colorectal cancer that caused recurrent intrabiliary growth after hepatectomy, and discuss the management of intrabiliary metastasis of colorectal cancer.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 69-year-old Japanese man underwent treatment for liver dysfunctions 3 years after aortic valve replacement. Computed tomography revealed an enhanced tumor within the hilar bile duct and dilatation of the left hepatic duct, typical of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed tumor shadow in his bile duct, and the cytology confirmed malignant cells in the bile. We performed extended left hepatectomy with bile duct resection; his postoperative course remained good without acute complications. After 3 months postoperatively, he was readmitted for subacute cholangitis and obstructive jaundice. Immediately, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage was performed, followed by cholangiography that exhibited intrabiliary tumor growth in the remnant liver. On immunohistochemical examination, tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2 but negative for cytokeratin 7. Then, computed tomography revealed an enhanced tumor-like lesion at the descending colon. After 3 months, left hemicolectomy was performed. Meanwhile, the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage fluid turned bloody, which was considered to be bleeding from a residual bile duct tumor. Accordingly, radiotherapy was initiated to prevent tumor bleeding around the hilar bile duct, but, unfortunately, the effects were short-lived, and cholangitis rebooted after 1 month leading to our patient’s death due to septic liver failure. Autopsy revealed a remnant tumor in the bile duct, but no noticeable nodular metastasis was observed, except for a single small metastasis in the lower lobe of the left lung.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The intrabiliary growth of metastatic colorectal cancer mimics cholangiocarcinoma occasionally. To date, as the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy remains uncertain, the complete resection of a bile duct tumor is the only method which could result in a better prognosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Most colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases form nodules within the hepatic parenchyma, and hepatectomy is the only radical treatment for synchronous metastases \\[ 1 \\]. Thus, a suitable cutting line is crucial during surgical resection to confirm the tumor clearance. When detected around the nodule, either macroscopically or microscopically \\[ 2 , 3 \\], intrabiliary tumor growth can affect the surgical margin, resulting in local recurrence after hepatectomy \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. However, to date, only a few cases have been reported primarily comprising development in the bile duct \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 \\]; of these, many are case reports, and some are a limited number of case series. Moreover, there has been no report of recurrence in the bile duct inoculation after hepatectomy; the actual mechanism of biliary dissemination of CRC is still unknown.\n\n【10】Here we report a rare case of biliary dissemination of CRC which caused recurrent intrabiliary growth after hepatectomy and discuss the management of intrabiliary metastasis of CRC.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 69-year-old Japanese man underwent treatment for liver dysfunction 3 years after aortic valve replacement. Later, rapid elevation in his serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was recorded and he was readmitted to determine the etiology. His body temperature was 36 °C, blood pressure 164/65 mmHg, and pulse rate was 66/minute. Laboratory data revealed mild anemia and liver-renal injury: white blood cells (WBC) 4600/uL, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelet 18.9 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> /dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.29 mg/dL, ALP 1138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 40 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 37 U/L, and γ glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) 298 U/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 22.4 mg/dL, creatinine 1.14 mg/dL, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 45.6 seconds, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 2.67. He also had a past history of duodenal ulcer perforation and was currently being treated with warfarin, angiotensin receptor blocker, and proton pump inhibitor. In addition, he was taking orally administered ursodeoxycholic acid for unknown liver function disorder. He had no alcohol consumption or tobacco smoking history and no relevant family history.\n\n【13】A plain radiograph showed no significant findings, but computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhanced tumor within the hilar bile duct and dilatation of the left hepatic duct (Fig. 1 ), which are typical findings for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed tumor shadow in his bile duct, and the cytology confirmed malignant cells in the bile (Fig. 2 ). As no lymph node and distant metastases were detected, we inserted endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) to reduce jaundice as preparation for surgery. We performed extended left hepatectomy with resection of his bile duct; his postoperative course was good without severe complications. After 3 months postoperatively, he was readmitted for subacute cholangitis and obstructive jaundice. Immediately, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage (PTCD) was performed, followed by cholangiography that exhibited the intrabiliary tumor growth in the remnant liver.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Preoperative enhanced computed tomography.

Malignant cells were observed in the bile duct cytology\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Simultaneously, histological examination of resected specimens revealed tumor growth in the hilar duct across the left hepatic duct (Fig. 3a, b ). Microscopic findings at the same site revealed a dilated bile duct filled with well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3c, d ). On immunohistochemical examination, tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 (Fig. 4a ) but negative for CK7 (Fig. 4b ). Furthermore, CK18 (Fig. 4c ) as control and CDX2 (Fig. 4d ) were stained. Although these findings were not typical of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, hepatic metastasis from another primary lesion was strongly suspected \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Furthermore, CT revealed an enhanced tumor-like lesion at the descending colon, followed by diagnosis of type 2 cancer in total colonography. Then, left hemicolectomy was performed; the immunohistochemical-identified feature matched with an intrabiliary tumor. Meanwhile, the PTCD fluid turned bloody, which was considered to indicate bleeding from a residual bile duct tumor (Fig. 5 ). Accordingly, we planned chemotherapy with orally administered capecitabine but our patient experienced a spike fever because of refractory cholangitis. Thus, we abandoned chemotherapy and initiated radiotherapy to stop the tumor bleeding around the hilar bile duct. After completing radiotherapy (total 50 Gy) for approximately 1 month, we observed an improvement in his liver function because of tumor shrinkage. Unfortunately, the effects were short-lived, intrabiliary growth and cholangitis rebooted after 1 month leading to his death due to septic liver failure (Fig. 6 ). Autopsy revealed a remnant tumor in the bile duct (Fig. 7 ), but no noticeable nodular metastasis was observed, except for a single small metastasis in the lower lobe of his left lung.\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Tumor growing in the hilar duct across the left hepatic duct.

Unfortunately, 3 months postoperatively, he was readmitted for subacute cholangitis and obstructive jaundice due to intrabiliary tumor growth in the remnant liver. Eventually he died of septic liver failure caused by cholangitis. An autopsy revealed a remnant tumor in the bile duct, but no noticeable nodular metastasis was observed. Intrabiliary metastasis of CRC is not typically reported in both Eastern and Western countries \\[ 9 \\]. Owing to the rarity of the disease, a majority of published literature comprises either case reports or studies of small case series \\[ 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 \\]. Reportedly, the prevalence of intrabiliary metastasis by CRC ranges from 3.6–10.6% \\[ 9 \\]; however, the prognosis of this disease remains unclear. In Japan, it might be less aggressive compared with usual nodular liver metastasis, and active resection is considered to improve patients’ survival \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]. We decided to perform extended left hepatectomy in this case of biliary dissemination of CRC. In contrast, five cases with poor prognosis have been reported in Korea \\[ 11 \\]; these patients did not undergo surgery but palliative procedures, such as PTCD or endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD), with a risk of repeated cholangitis. In our case, refractory cholangitis due to intrabiliary tumor growth in the remnant liver caused liver failure similarly. Interestingly, despite the remnant tumor in the bile duct, no life-threatening distant metastasis occurred until our patient’s death. We anticipate that bile duct metastasis is, basically, a sign of less aggressiveness of the tumor; thus, more caution is required to avoid bile duct dissemination at the time of surgery. As this metastatic disease also mimics cholangiocarcinoma, we were unable to differentiate it before resection. Perhaps, the definitive diagnosis of metastatic colonic carcinoma could be attributed to immunohistochemistry, which revealed CDX2 <sup>+ </sup> , CK20 <sup>+ </sup> , and CK7 <sup>− </sup> \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. Fortunately, we could resect the primary lesion in a two-stage operation; however, the management of synchronous liver metastases from CRC remained complex and multidisciplinary \\[ 1 \\]. A reliable report from the USA reported the highest number of cases and demonstrated that all prevalence estimates for intrabiliary growth were considerably affected by different clinical management styles for metastatic CRC within each institution \\[ 9 \\]. However, the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains unknown. As mentioned in this case, radiotherapy could have resulted in the tumor shrinkage effect, but it could have been temporary. Perhaps, the complete resection of the intrabiliary growth would have improved the prognosis of our patient.\n\n【45】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【46】Occasionally, the intrabiliary growth of metastatic CRC mimics cholangiocarcinoma and might cause refractory cholangitis. To date, as the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy remains uncertain, the complete resection of bile duct tumors is the only method to prevent postoperative cholangitis and could result in a better prognosis.\n\n【47】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【48】ALP:\n\n【49】Alkaline phosphatase\n\n【50】CK:\n\n【51】Cytokeratin\n\n【52】CRC:\n\n【53】Colorectal cancer\n\n【54】CT:\n\n【55】Computed tomography\n\n【56】PTCD:\n\n【57】Percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

One of the most common causes of chronic cough is cough-variant asthma, which accounts for approximately one-third of cases. This phenotype of asthma is characterized by extreme sensitivity of the neuronal pathways mediating cough to environmental irritants, which results in an urge to cough. This case is an example of cough-variant asthma presenting with allergic shiners due to her severe cough.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 38-year-old Iranian woman, who was well before the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, presented with a nonproductive hacking cough that had begun after excessive use of antiseptic solutions. The only positive finding on physical examination was a reddish-purple rash on and around the eyelids mimicking a heliotrope rash, which had probably evolved due to the severity of the cough. The results of the pulmonary function test were within normal limits. Methacholine challenge test and chest x-ray were both normal. Chest high-resolution computed tomography revealed hyperinflation and tree-in-bud opacities. All other laboratory tests were normal. Because of the reversibility in her pulmonary function test, despite normal baseline parameters, asthma treatment was initiated, resulting in disappearance of the cough and the eye discoloration, being indicative of the correct diagnosis and proper treatment.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Patients with cough-variant asthma may often have no other classic symptoms of asthma other than cough.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Chronic cough by definition is a disabling complaint affecting 5–10% of the general population \\[ 1 \\]. It is considered chronic when the duration is longer than 8 weeks in adults and adolescents older than 14 years old \\[ 2 \\], and interferes with normal activity and daily life \\[ 3 \\]. One of the most common causes of chronic cough is cough-variant asthma, a specific and atypical asthma phenotype, which accounts for approximately one-third of cases \\[ 4 \\]. This phenotype of asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic inflammation, and bronchodilator responsiveness without clinical manifestations such as wheezing and dyspnea \\[ 5 \\]. Patients often show extreme sensitivity of the neuronal pathways mediating cough to environmental irritants such as perfumes, air pollutants, bleaches, and cold air, which results in throat irritation and the urge to cough \\[ 1 \\]. Diagnostic tests such as spirometry (before and after bronchodilator) and methacholine challenge tests help to assess bronchial hyperreactivity and lung mechanics, although these methods do have imperfections and should be interpreted only in the context of the patient’s clinical presentation \\[ 6 \\]. Early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids may prevent progression of cough-variant asthma to classic asthma \\[ 7 \\]. In intractable cases, treatment of the existing gastroesophageal reflux may prove to be helpful \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【10】This case is an example of cough-variant asthma with atypical clinical manifestation, presenting with chronic severe dry cough leading to red–purple discoloration of both eyelids, which disappeared after an optimal asthma management plan was put in place.\n\n【11】Case report\n-----------\n\n【12】A 38-year-old Iranian woman, who was well before the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic, presented with a nonproductive hacking cough that had begun after excessive use of antiseptic solutions in order to prevent coronavirus infection. The intermittent severe cough had lasted several days and was aggravated by exposure to perfumes, strong odors, and spices. The symptoms had persisted for approximately 3 months before the patient sought professional medical assistance. She had used different antitussive medications without an optimal response. Her medical history was unremarkable except for allergic rhinitis. There was no history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic sinusitis, tuberculosis, any use of medications, or cardiopulmonary diseases. She was a nonsmoker and a housewife. She did not have any toxic occupational exposure; however, she had overused antiseptic solutions to prevent coronavirus infection for the past 2 years. Physical examination was normal with no extraordinary audible sounds including wheezing or rhonchi. The only positive finding on physical examination was a reddish-purple rash on and around the eyelids mimicking a heliotrope rash, which had probably evolved due to the severity of the cough (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】The patient with severe cough and red–purple discoloration of eye contours before treatment\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The results of the pulmonary function test were within normal limits at the first step, but after using a bronchodilator, a substantial increase from baseline was noted in FEV1 (Table 1 ).\n\n【18】**Table 1 Patient’s pulmonary function test (pre and post bronchodilator)**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】Methacholine challenge test and chest x-ray were both normal. Chest HRCT revealed hyperinflation and tree-in-bud opacities. The patient was admitted and underwent complete diagnostic work-up. Sputum was evaluated for bacteriology and sensitivity, with negative results for specific pathogens including _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ . CBC revealed mild hypochromic microcytic anemia. cANCA and pANCA were both negative, and vitamin D3 was mildly insufficient (25 ng/ml). PT, PTT, and INR were within normal limits (Table 2 ).\n\n【21】**Table 2 Patient’s laboratory data**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】SARS-CoV2 PCR was negative. After excluding the other aforementioned probable causes of chronic dry cough, cough-variant asthma was considered the most likely diagnosis, so an empirical asthma trial therapy was initiated for the patient. The results were surprising. After a 2-week period of treatment, significant improvement of cough was associated with the resolution of the heliotrope-like lesion over the eyes (Fig. 2 ). The patient has been constantly under close follow-up since the initiation of the therapy without showing recurrence of the signs and symptoms during the treatment.\n\n【24】**Fig.  2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】The same patient after treatment\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Asthma is a clinical diagnosis because of its heterogeneous phenotypes without a single diagnostic test to confirm or exclude it \\[ 1 \\]. Cough-variant asthma describes an asthmatic phenotype with cough as its sole presentation. The first-line strategy for diagnosis of asthma is spirometry evaluation with 12% and 200 ml improvement in FEV1 from baseline after bronchodilator challenge \\[ 8 \\]. However, there is no consensus regarding the challenge of methacholine bronchial provocation test. While some centers perform this test as a main part of the work-up, others do not validate it as a major diagnostic test to assess the condition of the patient \\[ 1 \\]. Since airway obstruction in asthma has a variable nature, objective findings in confirming the diagnosis may not be found easily \\[ 9 \\]. Even if spirometry and bronchial provocation tests are available, a normal result does not exclude asthma. Therefore, there is no gold-standard test for asthma and its phenotypes \\[ 10 \\], and all tests need to be interpreted individually in each patient. The imaging findings of toxic inhalation in HRCT includes bronchial wall thickening, areas of consolidation, bronchiectasis, and the tree-in-bud pattern.\n\n【30】Considering all these facts, our patient revealed increments from baseline in FEV1 after bronchodilator therapy, although the pre-bronchodilator baseline parameters were totally normal. However, methacholine challenge test was negative. The only findings on HRCT imaging were hyperinflation and tree-in-bud opacities, both of which denote toxic inhalation. In addition, the patient’s response to treatment was dramatic. After admission and initiation of optimal asthma treatment, the eye discoloration disappeared as a result of the effective remedy (Figs. 1 , 2 ). According to literature and current guidelines, treating asthma prior to testing reversibility to spirometry is only recommended in clinical emergencies. Our patient showed reversibility in her pulmonary function test even though normal baseline parameters were noted, and her clinical picture was considered urgent. We first took the patient’s detailed history regarding any potential exposure to harmful airborne substances at the time of admission, and she did not mention any exposure except antiseptic solution overuse, so we considered antiseptic solution to be the triggering agent of the patient’s airway hyperreactivity. The fact that she strictly applied social distancing and avoided outdoor as well as crowded areas was indicative of an indoor allergen exposure. Accordingly, we considered the antiseptic solutions the inciting agent and advocated strict avoidance of antiseptic solutions along with medical asthma therapy, resulting in successful control of the disease and alleviation of the signs and symptoms.\n\n【31】This led to the initiation of the treatment. Disappearance of the cough and the eye discoloration were indicative of the correct diagnosis and proper treatment.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】Asthma misdiagnosis is common due to the wide differential diagnosis for cough and also the varying phenotypes of asthma. Since asthma is a clinical diagnosis, a perfect history, physical examination, objective pulmonary tests, and possibly treatment trials are all essential for identifying patients.\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】All data and the patient’s consent are available from Dr. Mahsa Rekabi, the first author.\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】COVID-19:\n\n【38】Coronavirus disease 2019\n\n【39】HRCT:\n\n【40】High-resolution computed tomography\n\n【41】FEV1:\n\n【42】Forced expiratory volume in the first second\n\n【43】FVC:\n\n【44】Forced vital capacity\n\n【45】Pred:\n\n【46】Predicted\n\n【47】PEF:\n\n【48】Peak expiratory flow\n\n【49】FEF:\n\n【50】Forced expiratory flow\n\n【51】CBC:\n\n【52】Complete blood count\n\n【53】cANCA:\n\n【54】Cytoplasmic anti neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody\n\n【55】pANCA:\n\n【56】Perinuclear anti neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody\n\n【57】PT:\n\n【58】Prothrombin time\n\n【59】PTT:\n\n【60】Partial thromboplastin time\n\n【61】INR:\n\n【62】International normalized ratio\n\n【63】WBC:\n\n【64】White blood cell\n\n【65】RBC:\n\n【66】Red blood cell\n\n【67】Hg:\n\n【68】Hemoglobin\n\n【69】Hct:\n\n【70】Hematocrit\n\n【71】Plt:\n\n【72】Platelet\n\n【73】Neut:\n\n【74】Neutrophil\n\n【75】Lymph:\n\n【76】Lymphocyte\n\n【77】Mono:\n\n【78】Monocyte\n\n【79】SARS-CoV2:\n\n【80】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\n【81】PCR:\n\n【82】Polymerase chain reaction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Enhanced computed tomography after close follow-up for 6 years revealed a new nodule with poor enhancement on the pancreatic body. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed squamous cell carcinoma and differentiation from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma. Gene mutation analysis revealed _KRAS_ <sup>G12D </sup> and _KRAS_ <sup>G12R </sup> mutations in adenosquamous carcinoma components and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm lesions, respectively, with none showing the mutation of _GNAS_ codon 201.

To investigate the underlying transdifferentiation pathway of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms into this rare subtype of pancreatic cancer, we explored gene mutation differences as a clinicopathological parameter.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Pancreatic cancer is a severe disease, and its incidence and mortality rates are on the rise \\[ 1 \\]. Despite improvements in multidisciplinary treatment to improve the prognosis of this advanced disease, there remain suboptimal treatment outcomes due to the rapid local tumor spread or metastatic dissemination. There are several histological subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Among them, adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is a rare variant that accounts for only 1–4% of all pancreatic neoplasms \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Pancreatic ASC has a worse prognosis than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA); moreover, it has some unique clinical and histopathological characteristics \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【10】Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are classified into subtypes based on their histological and imaging characteristics \\[ 5 \\]. Most cases of main duct IPMNs are of the intestinal type; additionally, the large and complex form of intestinal-type IPMNs can have invasive carcinoma, typically of the mucinous type, with relatively lazy behavior \\[ 6 \\]. On the other hand, gastric-type IPMNs are typically low grade, with only a small proportion developing into carcinoma. However, gastric-type IPMNs behave like conventional PDA upon development into carcinomas, typically of the tubular type \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Although it has been reported that IPMN develops into mucinous carcinoma and tubular adenocarcinoma, transdifferentiation of IPMN into ASC remains unclear.\n\n【11】This article describes a rare case of an ASC with coexisting IPMNs of the pancreas. Further, we examined mutations in driver genes for progression in ASC and IPMNs to investigate the possibility of malignant transdifferentiation in pancreatic neoplasm.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】An 80-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with multiple cystic lesions throughout the pancreas identified on abdominal ultrasonography. She had no complaints associated with pancreatic cystic lesions. The lesions were up to 13 mm in size. After close follow-up for 6 years, a new nodule was found on the pancreatic body that had a diameter of 18 mm and poor enhancement on enhanced computed tomography (CT); moreover, the largest cyst grew to a diameter of 18 mm (Fig. 1 a–c). The serum carbohydrate 19-9 antigen (CA19-9) level remained within the normal range (< 37 U/mL) during the 6-year follow-up period. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) newly showed a partially high-intensity occupying lesion with a diameter of 15 mm on the pancreatic body (Fig. 1 d). T2-weighted MRI revealed multiple high-intensity cystic lesions throughout the pancreas (Fig. 1 e). There was no dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, or connection of cystic lesions to the pancreatic ductal system. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypoechoic well-defined tumor with a diameter of 15 mm on the pancreatic body. Through EUS‐guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, a tumor sample was obtained and histopathologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body. Further, diagnostic imaging led to a diagnosis of the multiple cystic lesions throughout the pancreas as IPMNs. The cysts had diameters of up to 18 mm; moreover, there were no findings suggestive of malignancy, including enhancing mural nodules, and thickened/enhancing cyst walls. On the basis of these results, we performed distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with lymph node resection. Macroscopically, we observed an invasive tumor with a diameter of 15 mm and cystic lesions around the tumor (Fig. 2 a, b). Microscopically, the main tumor was proliferating with irregular medium and small glandular cavities, accompanied by interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 2 c, d). We partially observed invasive micropapillary pattern and differentiation into squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 2 e). Since the columnar epithelium of these cysts was papillary, the many dilated cysts observed around the main tumor were diagnosed as IPMNs (Fig. 2 f). IPMNs lacked continuity with the adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma components. The margins of the resected pancreas and the six resected lymph nodes were negative for ASC. Based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification, the ASC was stage IA (T1a, N0, M0) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images. Enhanced computed tomography revealed a poorly enhanced nodule (white arrow) on the pancreatic body ( **a** ) and a cystic lesion (white arrowhead) adjacent to the tumor ( **b** ). Additionally, several cystic lesions (white arrowheads) were detected throughout the pancreas ( **c** ). Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor with a partially high-intensity area (white arrow) on the pancreatic body ( **d** ). Further, several cystic lesions (white arrowheads) were detected throughout the pancreas on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( **e** )\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Macroscopic and microscopic pathology (hematoxylin and eosin stain) of the surgical specimen.

There was an invasive tumor with a diameter of 15 mm and cystic lesions around the tumor ( **c** ; loupe magnification, ×4). The solid tumor was proliferating with irregular small and medium-sized glandular cavities with interstitial fibrosis ( **d** ; original magnification, ×40). There were partially invasive micropapillary patterns, and differentiation into squamous cell carcinoma was noted ( **e** ; original magnification, ×200). The columnar epithelium of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm cysts observed around the solid tumor had a papillary appearance ( **f** ; original magnification, ×20)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Table 1 presents the findings of immunohistochemical analysis. MUC1 was expressed by both ASC and IPMN cells (Fig. 3 a, b). ASC also showed strong expression of p53 and Ki-67, but the IPMNs did not (Fig. 3 c, d). Only the squamous cell carcinoma component of ASC showed p40 expression (Fig. 3 e). CK5/6 was expressed in ASC cells; moreover, it was more strongly expressed in the squamous cell carcinoma component than in the adenocarcinoma component (Fig. 3 f). Assessment of gene mutations revealed _KRAS_ <sup>G12D </sup> and _KRAS_ <sup>G12R </sup> mutations in ASC and IPMNs, respectively (Table 2 ). The mutation of _GNAS_ codon 201 was not detected in either ASC or IPMNs. Based on these results, the final histopathologic diagnosis was pancreatic ASC and IPMN.\n\n【23】**Table 1 Immunohistochemical findings**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】**Fig. 3**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Immunohistochemical analysis of the surgical specimen (original magnification, ×40). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed MUC1 expression in both adenosquamous carcinoma ( **a** ) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( **b** ). Expression of p53 ( **c** ) and Ki67 ( **d** ) was observed only in adenosquamous carcinoma and, specifically, on both the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components. p40 expression was detected only in the squamous cell carcinoma components of adenosquamous carcinoma ( **e** ). There was stronger CK5/6 expression in the squamous cell carcinoma component than in the adenocarcinoma component ( **f** )\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Table 2 Gene mutations**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】Given the patient’s age, oral administration of S-1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug) was initiated twice daily at a dose of 50 mg/day for 14 consecutive days as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy; she was also advised to rest for 7 days. No recurrence was noted after 9 months of follow-up.\n\n【32】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【33】ASC of the pancreas is defined as a mixed tumor with ductal adenocarcinoma component, and ≥ 30% malignant squamous cell carcinoma component \\[ 10 \\]. The prognosis of pancreatic ASC is worse than that of PDA; furthermore, the median survival following ASC is only 5.6–13.0 months \\[ 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. The mechanisms underlying ASC development remain unclear; however, several theories have been proposed regarding histopathogenesis. The first theory suggests the existence of pancreatic cancer stem cells \\[ 15 \\]. The second theory, which is also known as collision theory, suggests that two histologically distinct tumors develop and integrate independently \\[ 3 , 16 \\]. Recent studies have suggested the existence of ASC progenitor cells in some cancers, given the genetic and immunohistochemical similarities coexisting in tubular and squamous ASC components \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. Based on these theories and reports, the monoclonal pathway could be a logical hypothesis for ASC development. The existence of this monoclonal pathway must include a gene that promotes squamous differentiation of the adenocarcinoma from the progenitor cells \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【34】There has been increasing incidence of pancreatic IPMN, given the recent advances in diagnostic imaging. Patients with IPMN have a favorable postoperative prognosis; recent studies have reported a 5-year postoperative survival rate for patients with IPMN of 89–97.5% \\[ 22 , 23 , 24 \\]. It was demonstrated that IPMNs differentiated into adenocarcinoma in 47% and 17% of patients with the main pancreatic duct type and branch type as precancerous lesions, respectively; it was also demonstrated that it usually takes > 10 years to develop into a malignant invasive tumor \\[ 25 \\]. Omori _et al_ . identified three different pathways (sequential, branch-off, and _de novo_ subtypes) through which IPMNs progress to PDAs by performing detailed histologic and genetic analysis of PDAs and concurrent IPMNs \\[ 26 \\]. Additionally, they reported differences in the genes that were mutated, especially _KRAS_ and _GNAS_ , between PDA arising from IPMNs and _de novo_ PDA.\n\n【35】Close follow-up of our patient was undertaken on the basis of the International Consensus Guidelines 2012 for the Management of IPMN and MCN of the Pancreas \\[ 5 \\]. In our patient, the poorly enhanced nodule, ASC, could not be confirmed on CT at the first visit of the patient, which was 6 years ago, nor could it be confirmed on the CT taken a year prior to the surgery. On the other hand, the cystic lesion with a diameter of 13 mm that was identified on CT 6 years ago had grown in size to 18 mm at the time of surgery. This clinical course of this patient indicates that the pancreas, which can be the origin of IPMNs, may develop _de novo_ malignant tumors regardless of whether IPMNs differentiate into cancer or not. Therefore, there is a need for regular and close follow-up by diagnostic imaging for patients with IPMNs.\n\n【36】Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved disease-free survival, compared with surgery alone, in patients undergoing gross curative resection of pancreatic cancer \\[ 27 , 28 \\]. As previously mentioned, the prognosis of pancreatic ASC is worse than that of PDA. Although this case was stage IA according to AJCC classification, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed for the purpose of improving the postoperative prognosis and according to the patient’s strong desire.\n\n【37】_KRAS_ gene is localized to chromosome 12q12.1 and is a proto-oncogene that belongs to the RAS family. It encodes KRAS, which is stimulated by upstream pathways, including growth factors, to promote the action of other genes and acts in the signaling transduction pathway of EGFR. KRAS regulates proteins involved in cell survival, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. A point mutation in _RAS_ ( _KRAS_ / _NRAS_ ) could be associated with various cancers, especially pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Recent studies have confirmed that over 90% of patients with early-stage pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), which is the most common precursor lesions, express mutant _KRAS_ \\[ 29 , 30 \\].\n\n【38】_GNAS_ gene is present at chromosome 20q13.32 and is also known as the _GNAS_ complex locus, which is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns. _GNAS_ encodes the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) α subunit (Gαs), and the product of the _GNAS_ gene acts as the mediator of the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway \\[ 31 \\]. _GNAS_ was identified as a driver gene for IPMN in 2011 \\[ 32 , 33 \\]. _KRAS_ and _GNAS_ mutations are often and rarely, respectively, detected in PDA. Contrastingly, _GNAS_ mutation is considered an IPMN-specific gene abnormality; therefore, PDA with _GNAS_ mutation is considered as having differentiated from IPMN lesions \\[ 26 , 32 , 33 , 34 \\].\n\n【39】Differentiation from IPMN to ASC is extremely rare, with three reports of ASC arising from IPMN present in the literature thus far \\[ 35 , 36 , 37 \\]. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there has been no report that demonstrates IPMN lacking continuity with the ASC components. In our case, immunostaining results for CK5/6, which is a marker of squamous cell carcinoma, suggested the probability of differentiation from adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, there were different _KRAS_ mutations in ASC and IPMN components. In contrast with _KRAS_ mutation, _GNAS_ mutation was not detected in either ASC or IPMN components. Certainly, ASC could be a carcinoma developed in a multifocal IPMN with an ASC phenotype. Alternatively, our results of gene mutation analysis also suggest that ASC in this case may have been derived from PanIN.\n\n【40】In summary, we present a rare case of coexisting ASC and IPMN of the pancreas. Our findings suggest that differences in gene mutations may facilitate the exploration of the IPMN malignant transformations and the origins of pancreatic cancer. The biological characteristics of ASC remain unclear; therefore, there is a need for further research to determine the factors for differentiation to ASC.\n\n【41】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】The data supporting the findings of this case report are available within the article.\n\n【43】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【44】ASC:\n\n【45】Adenosquamous carcinoma\n\n【46】IPMN:\n\n【47】Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm\n\n【48】PDA:\n\n【49】Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n\n【50】CT:\n\n【51】Computed tomography\n\n【52】CA19-9:\n\n【53】Carbohydrate 19-9 antigen\n\n【54】MRI:\n\n【55】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【56】EUS:\n\n【57】Endoscopic ultrasonography\n\n【58】FNA:\n\n【59】Fine needle aspiration\n\n【60】AJCC:\n\n【61】American Joint Committee on Cancer\n\n【62】PanIN:\n\n【63】Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Conventional treatment includes restricting dietary sodium and using diuretics, usually loop diuretics, accompanied by specific treatments for each clinical disorder \\[ 1 \\]. Meanwhile, remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) is a rare syndrome whose pathophysiology is not clearly understood. High inflammatory markers, negative rheumatoid factor (RF), and prompt response to low-dose steroids are hallmarks of the disease. This article presents a case of refractory edema diagnosed as RS3PE followed by a brief review of literature.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 82-year-old Asian male was admitted to the Department of General Internal Medicine with 2-month history of symmetrical swelling in both hands. The swelling was localized to the dorsum of hands and did not extend to the face and lower extremities. He had no dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. He had good appetite, and there was no significant history of weight loss. He denied any history of jaundice in the past. Despite treatment with loop diuretics furosemide 40 mg daily, his condition did not respond to the medication and his quality of life deteriorated. Therefore, he visited our hospital and requested an alternative treatment. On physical examination, his vitals were stable with blood pressure of 147/85 mmHg and heart rate of 98 beats per minute. He had swelling restricted to the dorsum of both hands with pitting edema (Fig. 1 A). Examination of the joints showed tenderness suggestive of synovitis with restricted movements in bilateral proximal interphalangeal joint. Other clinical examinations including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**A** Symmetrical pitting edema of dorsum of both hands. **B** Swelling on dorsum of hands drastically resolved\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Laboratory findings revealed hyperglycemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 118 mm/hour, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 6.58 mg/dL, and slight anemia with hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL (Table 1 ). Plain radiographs of both hands showed soft tissue swelling with neither narrowing of the joint spaces nor bone erosion. At this point, the diagnosis of bilateral RS3PE was made. Treatment with prednisolone 15 mg daily was instituted. At follow-up after hospitalization, dramatic improvement of all his symptoms was noted. The swelling on the dorsum of his hands had drastically resolved (Fig. 1 B). At 1 week follow-up after hospitalization, ESR and CRP had returned to normal. He was discharged on hospital day 12 and continues to be followed up on an outpatient basis. He remained symptom free at 2-week review on prednisolone 15 mg daily, which was then reduced to 10 mg daily. Thereafter, the prednisolone dose was reduced by 1 mg every 4 weeks, and he has progressed without any flare-up of inflammation.\n\n【17】**Table 1 Laboratory data on admission**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【20】In daily medical practice, physicians are often faced with patients with edema of unknown etiology. Edema can be localized or generalized. RS3PE is a rare autoimmune condition. The first description was in 1985 in a series of ten patients by McCarty _et al._ \\[ 2 \\]. The patient presented herein satisfied all four of McCarty’s RS3PE diagnostic criteria of localized edema particularly in the dorsum of hands and/or legs, acute onset of polyarthritis, age greater than 50 years, and seronegativity for RF.\n\n【21】Mixed connective tissue disease and systemic sclerosis are the differentials for swelling of the hands with arthritis. However, there was no skin sclerosis or erythema in this case. Because of the short follow-up period, we could not exclude the association with malignancy. We could not exclude joint erosion as early changes because we did not perform ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the wrist joint.\n\n【22】Corticosteroids are the mainstream of treatment for RS3PE. Typically, the starting dose is the steroid equivalent of prednisolone 15–20 mg daily. According to previously published cases, corticosteroids were sustained at this initial dose for 2–3 weeks then tapered over 12–18 months \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【23】In general, edema of hands evidently reduces patient quality of life, as in this case.\n\n【24】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】Not applicable.\n\n【26】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【27】RS3PE:\n\n【28】Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema\n\n【29】RF:\n\n【30】Rheumatoid factor\n\n【31】ESR:\n\n【32】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【33】CRP:\n\n【34】C-reactive protein", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Recognizing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is crucial for subsequent treatment and prognosis. In clinical practice, corticosteroids and rituximab can be used to treat both immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; plasma exchange therapy is the first-line treatment in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, while corticosteroids are strongly recommended as first-line treatment in immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The differential diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is essential in clinical practice. However, case reports have suggested that immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur concurrently.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 32-year-old Asian female without previous disease who presented with pancytopenia, concurrent with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The morphology of the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow indicated immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. The patient received glucocorticoid treatment, and her platelet count increased; however, schistocytes remained high during the course of the therapy. Further investigations revealed ADAMTS13 activity deficiency and positive ADAMTS13 antibodies. The high titer of antinuclear antibody and positive anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein/Smith antibody indicated a potential autoimmune disease. However, the patient did not fulfill the current criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease. The patient responded well to plasma exchange therapy, and her platelet count remained normal on further follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Concurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is rare, but clinicians should be aware of this entity to ensure prompt medical intervention. Most of the reported cases involve young women. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, pregnancy, and autoimmune disease are the most common underlying conditions.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are distinct diseases that cause thrombocytopenia. ITP is defined as a platelet count below 100,000 platelets per cubic millimeter, excluding known causes of thrombocytopenia; in addition, platelet-associated immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgG is commonly identified \\[ 1 \\]. Primary ITP accounts for 80% of cases; the additional 20% are secondary to some other disease, such as infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, or primary immune deficiency \\[ 2 \\]. TTP is caused by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (vWF)-cleaving metalloproteinase, ADAMTS13, which leads to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the vasculature \\[ 3 \\]. TTP is a rare and life-threatening disease with an average annual prevalence of 10 cases/1 million people and a mortality rate of 10–20% \\[ 4 \\]. Recognizing TTP is crucial for timely treatment and prognosis. In clinical practice, although corticosteroids and rituximab can be used to treat both ITP and TTP, plasma exchange therapy (PEX) is the first-line treatment for TTP; in contrast, corticosteroids are strongly recommended as first-line treatment in ITP \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Therefore, differential diagnosis of ITP and TTP is essential in clinical practice. Concurrence is rare; however, previous case reports have shown that ITP and TTP can occur concurrently in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), pregnancy, and Sjögren’s syndrome \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. We report herein a case of concurrent ITP and TTP in a patient without knowledge of any underlying diseases.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Case report\n\n【12】In this case report, we analyze the patient’s clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatment, and outcome.\n\n【13】### Literature review and data extraction\n\n【14】The MEDLINE database was used to search for all published literature on ITP complicating TTP. The Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms we used were (((idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura \\[Mesh Terms\\]) OR (immune thrombocytopenia \\[Mesh Terms\\])) AND (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura \\[Mesh Terms\\])) OR (immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura \\[Mesh Terms\\]). There were no restrictions on article type or publication date, and 497 results were obtained. After removal of duplicated articles and articles without access to full-text reports, 16 case reports in any language, on patients of any age or race diagnosed with ITP and TTP were included. The following data retrieved from each report are presented in Table 1 : (1) first author's name and year of publication, (2) age and sex of the patient, (3) underlying conditions, (4) significant laboratory characteristics, (5) ADAMTS13 activity and antibodies, if reported, (6) main clinical presentations, (7) therapy, and (8) patient outcomes. The search was conducted on 6 June 2022.\n\n【15】**Table 1 Summary of cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura complicated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】Results\n-------\n\n【18】### Case report\n\n【19】A 32-year-old Asian female presented to the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital on 6 November 2021, complaining of a headache for 6 months and purpura for 3 weeks. The patient had been experiencing intermittent headaches with tinnitus for 6 months, prior to admission. Complete blood cell count (CBC) revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.07 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin (HGB) of 10 <sup>6 </sup> g/L, and platelet (PLT) count of 210 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal findings.\n\n【20】Three weeks prior to admission, the patient noticed purpura on her extremities, and she also complained of increased menstrual flow. She had received two doses of the inactivated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in May 2021 and in June 2021. She had no history of significant medical illness, except for one stillbirth. She denied alcohol, tobacco, or drug abuse. She had never received a transfusion. She took no medications on admission, and there was no significant family medical history.\n\n【21】Physical examination revealed an afebrile, normotensive female. There were no hemorrhage lesions on her palate; however, multiple ecchymoses and petechiae were observed over the body. There was mild tenderness in the upper limb muscles. There was no splenomegaly, lymph node hypertrophy, or liver hypertrophy. Her physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass nodules in the left upper lung and solid nodules in the left lower lung, which were considered benign lymph nodes by radiologists. Brain MRI revealed a choroid plexus cyst. There were no significant findings from abdominal ultrasound and echocardiogram.\n\n【22】The urine pregnancy test was negative. CBC revealed a WBC count of 3.41 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, HGB of 77 g/L, PLT count of 28 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 96.6 fL, and vitamin B12 level of 319 pg/mL (reference: 180–914 pg/mL). Blood smear showed normal leukocyte morphology, the reticulocyte percentage was 6%, and the absolute reticulocyte count was 0.094 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 330 U/L. The percentage of CD55 <sup>− </sup> erythrocytes and CD59 <sup>− </sup> erythrocytes of the total erythrocytes was less than 0.5% each. The level of glucose-6-phosphate was 23 U/L, which was normal. Thyroid function was normal, with a slightly elevated thyroglobulin antibody titer (110.3 U/mL \\[reference: 0–60 U/mL\\]). d \\-dimer was 1.52 µg/mL, and haptoglobin was < 25 mg/dL. Immune function test revealed IgG of 17.13 g/L complement protein 3 (C3) of 0.63 g/L. The anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test was positive at a titer > 1:1000, with a speckled pattern. The extractable nuclear antibody profile showed strong positivity (3+) for anti-ribonucleoprotein/Smith (U1RNP/Sm) antibody. The direct Coombs’ test, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-red blood cell antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, antiplatelet antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies were negative. Coagulation, liver function (including bilirubin), kidney function, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and iron studies were all within normal limits. Tumor markers were all negative. The urinalysis was unremarkable.\n\n【23】The peripheral blood smear revealed many fragmented red blood cells with increased polychromasia and decreased platelets (Fig. 1 A). Bone marrow biopsy revealed relative erythroid hyperplasia and a normal megakaryocyte count (Fig. 1 B). The investigations for pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, respiratory viruses, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and _Helicobacter pylori_ , were negative. The clinical scenario revealed Coombs’-negative hemolytic anemia, complicated with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that was possibly caused by an autoimmune disease.\n\n【24】**Fig. 1**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】**A** The peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes (red arrows) and reticulocytes (blue arrows) (×400). **B** Bone marrow megakaryocyte with increased size and platelet production deficiency (×1000)\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The patient was initially treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg for 1 day, but the schistocytes in the peripheral blood increased to over 6%. The methylprednisolone dose was then increased to 240 mg for 5 days. The patient’s platelet count increased to 216 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, but the schistocytes remained at 5%. The PLASMIC score was high. The PLASMIC score is a seven-component clinical prediction tool that was developed to reliably assess the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency \\[ _C_ statistic 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–0.98\\] \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. TTP was suspected. The ADAMTS13 activity was 1.65%, and the ADAMTS13 inhibitor assay was positive; therefore, a diagnosis of TTP was considered. The patient then received six cycles of PEX. Cyclosporine was added, and the dosage was titrated to 150 mg per day. Following treatment, the PLT count remained normal, schistocytes were reduced to 1–2%, ADAMTS13 activity increased to 63.99%, and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody was negative. During hospitalization, the patient did not present any signs of thrombosis, and all blood vessel ultrasounds were normal. She was discharged and managed in an outpatient clinic with tapered oral methylprednisolone. At the last visit, on 2 June 2022, oral methylprednisolone and cyclosporine were discontinued, and the patient only took hydroxychloroquine 0.2 g once daily. The patient’s CBC remained normal.\n\n【29】### Systemic literature review\n\n【30】Sixteen publications \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 \\] were evaluated in detail, and a total of 24 patients (including our patient) were included in this qualitative analysis. The patients’ ages ranged from 9 to 72 years old, and the mean age was 36 years. There were 14 females and 10 males; 7 patients were HIV positive, 3 patients were postpartum women, 3 had autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren’s syndrome), 1 case was drug related, 1 patient had a history of a tumor, 1 had a positive Coombs’ test, and the remaining 8 patients had no known underlying medical conditions. The common laboratory characteristics were thrombocytopenia, elevated schistocytes, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Only 6 patients’ ADAMTS13 activity was detected (ranging from 0% to normal). The most common symptoms were mucocutaneous bleeding ( _n_ \\= 16), neurological symptoms ( _n_ \\= 16), and fever ( _n_ \\= 14). All patients received PEX and/or steroids. Intravenous immunoglobulin, splenectomy, vincristine, and rituximab were the most common assistant therapies. Following treatment, 20 patients were in remission, and 4 patients (16.7%) died. The results are presented in Table 1 .\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】We present a case of thrombocytopenia in a previously healthy woman. The morphology of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow indicated immune-mediated thrombocytopenia; furthermore, the platelet count responded well to glucocorticoids. The patient also presented with anemia, with slightly increased MCV, increased reticulocyte level, decreased haptoglobin, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, indicating hemolysis. The patient presented with a high level of ANA and positive anti-U1-RNP, which indicated potential autoimmune hemolysis; however, the negative Coombs’ test and negative anti-red blood cell antibodies made autoimmune hemolysis less likely. Furthermore, the patient did not exhibit other clinical signs to fulfill the current criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or mixed connective tissue disease. The schistocytes remained high during glucocorticoid therapy, which indicated intravascular hemolysis, and further investigations revealed ADAMTS13 activity deficiency and positive ADAMTS13 antibody, which confirmed the diagnosis of TTP.\n\n【33】During the COVID-19 pandemic, new vaccines were developed without full clinical trials. Some vaccines have been reported to be associated with _de novo_ ITP, ITP exacerbation, and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), especially the adenoviral vector-based vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Ad26.COV2.S) \\[ 24 \\]. VITT is caused by antibodies that recognize platelet factor 4 (PF4) bound to platelets \\[ 25 \\]. The pathomechanism of VITT is under investigation; current studies suggest a two-hit process in which the vaccine stimulates neoantigen formation (first hit), in addition to a systemic inflammatory response (second hit), which together lead to the production of anti-PF4 antibodies \\[ 26 \\]. Anti-PF4 antibodies lead to the inhibition of ADAMTS13 activity, which is unable to regulate the multimeric size of vWF \\[ 27 \\]. Ultra-sized vWF multimers can accumulate in the plasma, leading to the formation of platelet-rich microthrombi \\[ 28 \\]. VITT likely develops in a narrow window, 5–10 days post-vaccination, leading to the identification of cases typically between 5 and 30 days post vaccination \\[ 29 \\]. A case of possible VITT related to the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine was published. In this case, the symptoms occurred 2 weeks after vaccination \\[ 30 \\]. Our patient received the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine 5 months prior to the onset of symptoms, which made a diagnosis of VITT less likely.\n\n【34】Furthermore, our patient presented with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, making Evans syndrome a possible differential diagnosis; however, the negative direct Coombs’ test, and the high percentage of schistocytes, made this diagnosis less likely. Therefore, the case was diagnosed as concurrence of ITP and TTP.\n\n【35】TTP is a rare form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), severe thrombocytopenia, and ischemic end-organ damage resulting from the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature \\[ 31 \\]. PEX is the primary treatment for TTP, whereas glucocorticoids have been routinely added as an assisted therapy alongside PEX \\[ 32 \\]. Glucocorticoids are thought to hasten recovery by reducing the production of ADAMTS13 inhibitors, and reducing cytokine production and autoantibody-mediated clearance of ADAMTS13. According to the 2020 guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), glucocorticoids are recommended, in addition to PEX, for initial treatment of TTP, despite the lack of randomized trials on this combination therapy \\[ 32 \\]. However, the efficacy of monotherapy with glucocorticoids in TTP has been demonstrated in observational studies. In research on 54 patients with TTP treated with corticosteroids alone, 24 patients (44.4%) did not respond to the treatment \\[ 33 \\]. In contrast, another study comparing prednisone versus cyclosporin found that prednisone was superior to cyclosporin for increasing ADAMTS13 activity, and suppressing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies \\[ 34 \\]. The efficacy of glucocorticoid monotherapy in TTP is varied; however, glucocorticoid therapy is fundamental to ITP treatment, and patients with ITP usually respond well to glucocorticoid therapy \\[ 35 \\]. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell lineage-specific CD20 antigen, can be added to corticosteroid and PEX therapy to increase the response rate in refractory TTP \\[ 36 \\]. The newest TTP therapy is caplacizumab, a humanized, single-variable-domain, anti-vWF immunoglobulin that targets the A1 domain of vWF \\[ 37 \\], preventing interaction with the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V receptor. Caplacizumab showed value when added to the standard treatment for acquired TTP; it shortens the time to normalize platelets and decreases the recurrence rate \\[ 38 \\].\n\n【36】Sequential or concurrent ITP and TTP have been reported in the literature. We reviewed 23 sequential, or concurrent, ITP and TTP cases (Table 1 ). Based on these case reports, patients with concurrent or sequential ITP and TTP usually present with microangiopathy; however, our case lacked the features of microangiopathy . This could be attributed to the low platelet count in the early stage of ITP, which led to the formation of fewer platelet-rich thrombi. Further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\n【37】This is a rare case of concurrent ITP and TTP in a previously healthy woman. This case highlights the importance of considering all possible causes of thrombocytopenia, especially when specific treatments (i.e., PEX, glucocorticoids) should be given in the first line.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】Concurrence of ITP and TTP is rare; however, clinicians should be aware of this entity to ensure prompt medical intervention. Most of the reported cases involve young women, while HIV infection, pregnancy, and autoimmune diseases are the most common underlying conditions. Whether this condition can be triggered by the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is unclear.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】The datasets obtained and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In most cases, detection of prune belly syndrome occurs during neonatal or infancy period. In this case report, we describe a 12-year-old boy from Ethiopia with the triad of findings of prune belly syndrome along with skeletal malformations. We are unaware of any previous report of prune belly syndrome in Ethiopia.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 12-year-old Amhara boy from the Northwest Gondar Amhara regional state presented to our referral hospital with a complaint of swelling over his left flank for the past 3 months. Maternal pregnancy course and medical history were noncontributory, and he had an attended birth at a health center. He has seven siblings, none of whom had similar symptoms. On examination he had a distended abdomen, asymmetric with bulging left flank, visible horizontal line, upward umbilical slit, and absent rectus abdominis muscles. His abdomen was soft with a tender cystic, bimanually palpable mass on the left flank measuring 13 × 11 cm. Both testes were undescended and he also has developmental dysplasia of the hips. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a large cystic mass in his left kidney area with echo debris and a hip X-ray showed bilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip.\n\n【5】Intraoperative findings were cystic left kidney, both testes were intraperitoneal, tortuous left renal vein, enlarged bladder reaching above umbilicus, and left megaureter.\n\n【6】Interventions: bilateral orchidectomy and left nephrectomy were done. He was given intravenously administered antibiotics for treatment of pyelonephritis and discharged home with an appointment for follow up and possible abdominoplasty.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】In the current report delayed presentation contributed to testicular atrophy and decision for orchidectomy. Furthermore, he will be at potential risk for sex hormone abnormality. Therefore, diagnosis of prune belly syndrome in resource-limited settings requires a high index of suspicion. We recommend further research to determine the optimal management and early diagnosis of prune belly syndrome in resource-limited settings.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare multisystem disease characterized by a deficiency of abdominal wall musculature, bilateral intra-abdominal testes, and urinary tract abnormalities, including megacystis, hydroureteronephrosis, and renal dysplasia. PBS predominantly affects boys, with a contemporary incidence of 3.6 to 3.8 per 100,000 live births in the United States of America \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. There is wide variability in disease severity as PBS is not infrequently accompanied by cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal anomalies \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. There is no proven etiology for the development of PBS but a defect in mesodermal differentiation of the anterior abdominal wall and urinary tract between the 6th and 10th weeks of gestation has been suggested \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 12-year-old Amhara boy from the Northwest Gondar Amhara regional state complained of left flank swelling for the last 3 months. Three days before admission he started to experience pain in his left flank, which was associated with high grade fever, chills, rigor, and vomiting. At the time he had no urinary or respiratory symptoms. Maternal pregnancy course and medical history were noncontributory, and he had an attended birth at a health center; his past medical history was unremarkable. He has seven siblings, none of whom had similar symptoms. His mother had no history of radiation exposure, use of traditional medicine, or chemotherapy during pregnancy.\n\n【14】### Physical examination\n\n【15】No dysmorphisms were noted in his general appearance. His vital signs were: pulse rate (PR) 142 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 33 breaths/min, temperature (T) 38.5 °C, and blood pressure (BP) 105/65 mmHg. Anthropometric measurements showed severe stunting. An abdominal examination revealed distended abdomen, asymmetric with bulging left flank, visible horizontal line, upward umbilical slit, and absent rectus abdominis muscles. His abdomen was soft with a tender cystic, bimanually palpable mass on the left flank measuring 13 × 11 cm. Both testes were undescended (Fig. 1 ). He also had scoliosis and developmental dysplasia of the hips with waddling gate.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】A 12-year-old boy with prune belly syndrome with empty scrotum and absent abdominal wall musculature\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】### Investigations\n\n【21】Urinary analysis demonstrated many red blood cells (RBCs) and positive leukocyte esterase. He had a normal renal function test with creatinine of 0.72 mg/dl and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 44 mg/dl, normal hemoglobin of 12.7 gm/dl, and normal electrolyte. Ultrasound showed a large cystic mass in his left kidney area with echo debris. His right kidney had normal echo texture and size. An X-ray of his hips showed bilateral developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH; Fig. 2 ). Our facility does not have the capacity to perform a genetic study to support the diagnosis of PBS.\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Pelvic X-ray of a 12-year-old boy with bilateral hip dysplasia\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】### Intraoperative findings\n\n【27】His left kidney is cystic and enlarged; there is no parenchyma tissue, both testes are intraperitoneal just below the kidneys, tortuous left renal vein, enlarged bladder reaching above umbilicus, and left megaureter (Fig. 3 ). A bilateral orchidectomy and left nephrectomy were done.\n\n【28】**Fig. 3**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Intraoperative findings of a 12-year-old boy. _K_ kidney, _S_ small intestine, _U_ ureter\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】### Course of our patient in our hospital\n\n【33】After surgical removal of cystic mass and testes, he was given intravenously administered antibiotics for treatment of pyelonephritis for 14 days. Subsequently he showed significant improvement and was discharged home with an appointment for follow up to consider hormonal replacement therapy and possible abdominoplasty. His parents were also counseled about the PBS and the care they can give him at home.\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】PBS is a rare congenital disorder composed of anomalies of various organ systems. This case report describes a 12-year-old boy with the triad findings of PBS reported in previous publications \\[ 7 , 8 \\] and congenital bilateral hip dysplasia with scoliosis. In the majority of case reports the diagnosis of PBS is made during infancy. Although this child was born at a health center his congenital malformation was not detected at birth. This may indicate a low level of awareness among health professionals about PBS; however, there are very few case reports of PBS diagnosed outside the neonatal age group \\[ 9 \\]. The embryologic characteristics of congenital musculoskeletal problems correlate well with the embryologic theory of PBS \\[ 10 \\]. Similar to other case reports, scoliosis and hip dysplasia were noted in the current case. Orthopedic abnormalities occur in 45 to 63% of patients with PBS \\[ 11 \\]. The most common orthopedic anomalies are hip dislocation and talipes equinovarus \\[ 12 \\], while scoliosis is the most common spinal abnormality noted \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. Currently, children with PBS reach adulthood; however, morbidity related to the musculoskeletal system can potentially affect their quality of life. The abdominal wall defect may not have life-threatening consequences but the inefficient contraction of the abdominal wall muscles is believed to affect bladder, bowel, and pulmonary function, increasing the risk of recurrent urinary and respiratory tract infections \\[ 15 \\]. Improvement in bladder emptying is a potential benefit of offering abdominoplasty in full-blown PBS \\[ 16 \\]. The incidence of renal failure over time was 20 to 30%, although some case series have rates of renal insufficiency as low as 7% \\[ 17 \\]. In the current case, despite a non-functioning left kidney, the renal function test was within normal limits for our patient’s age, which could be explained by the compensatory action of his right kidney.\n\n【36】Treatment of the case involved both surgical and medical teams. Removal of our patient’s left kidney and orchidectomy were performed, and he was treated for a urinary tract infection. There have been documented cases of testicular tumors developing in these patients, but overall the risk does not appear to be greater than other patients with undescended testes \\[ 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. Orchidopexy or removal of the testes is one of the treatment modalities available to children with PBS. Removal of the testes is done to counteract the high risk of cancer associated with intraperitoneal testes which was a potential outcome in this case.\n\n【37】He was discharged from our hospital with the expectation of long-term follow up, and an appointment for abdominoplasty was scheduled. After communicating with an endocrinologist, hormonal replacement therapy was considered to be started on follow up.\n\n【38】Our strength to the approach of this case was giving the most treatment and care that were available in our setting. In contrast, the unavailability of genetic study was our limitation.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【40】Diagnosis of PBS in resource-limited settings requires a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis of PBS will help health professionals to carry out the appropriate steps of management and follow up. As the disease involves multiple organ systems, a multidisciplinary management approach is required to improve the quality of life for patients with PBS. We recommend further research to determine the optimal management and early diagnosis of PBS in resource-limited settings.\n\n【41】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【42】BP:\n\n【43】Blood pressure\n\n【44】BUN:\n\n【45】Blood urea nitrogen\n\n【46】DDH:\n\n【47】Developmental dysplasia of the hip\n\n【48】PBS:\n\n【49】Prune belly syndrome\n\n【50】PR:\n\n【51】Pulse rate\n\n【52】RBC:\n\n【53】Red blood cell\n\n【54】RR:\n\n【55】Respiratory rate\n\n【56】T:\n\n【57】Temperature", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis of patients suffering from both pathologies is necessary to enable dedicated monitoring of any complications at the ophthalmic and skin level. However, few cases are described in the literature.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 14-month-old Congolese male child affected by oculocutaneous albinism, presented with pallor and jaundice. Blood indices revealed severe hemolytic anemia, which led to the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. The patient received a blood transfusion and close follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The co-inheritance of sickle cell disease and oculocutaneous albinism is a reality in the Democratic Republic of Congo, although it is rarely described. Given the current state of our knowledge, specific surveillance, specifically regarding cutaneous and ophthalmological complications, should be offered in this particular population. To enable this dedicated follow-up, sensitization to screening for sickle cell anemia in albino individuals should be carried out.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Sickle cell disease (SCD) and oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are both autosomal recessive monogenic conditions with a high prevalence in populations of sub-Saharan Africa \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disease affecting hemoglobin, and is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality \\[ 4 \\]. Its origin is linked to a point mutation in the globin gene located on chromosome 11 (11p 11-5) giving rise to abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S (HbS) \\[ 5 \\]. The disease affects 20–25 million people worldwide, among which 50–80% of those born in sub-Saharan Africa die before the age of five if they do not benefit from optimal medical monitoring, including prevention of infectious disease \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), as highlighted by recent epidemiological data, 2% of newborns are homozygous for hemoglobin S \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Although this figure is epidemiologically significant, the disease remains unknown, with a high mortality rate in a country with limited resources \\[ 10 \\]. However, while management begins with a diagnosis of the condition, screening at birth is not at all or rarely performed \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【10】Sickle cell disease is a multisystem disease with polymorphic involvement including skin ulcer and ocular complications. The latter are related to ischemic retinopathy and neovascularization \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\]. OCA is a group of autosomal recessive disorders of melanin biosynthesis, characterized by a generalized reduction in the pigmentation of the eyes (oculo-), skin (-cutaneous), and hair \\[ 2 , 16 \\].\n\n【11】There are OCA subtypes in which the mutations are in different genes on chromosome 11 \\[ 17 \\]. Four subtypes are described, including TYR on chromosome 11q14 for OCA 1, OCA 2 (P) for OCA 2, TYRP1 for OCA 3, and SLC45A2 (MATP) for OCA 4. Syndromic forms include Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, linked to the HPS-1 gene, and Chediak–Higashi syndrome, linked to the CHS-1 gene \\[ 17 \\]. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that at least 1 in 4000 people have OCA \\[ 18 \\]. In the DRC, the most important prevalence is in Kasai \\[ 18 \\]. Although this is difficult to prove, this is probably due to a major consanguinity among the tribes living in this region \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【12】The two diseases, SCD and OCA, share common signs that can sometimes be confusing in diagnosing complications, such as depigmentation of the skin, pallor in the case of anemia, and ophthalmic or skin lesions. A leg ulcer, a sickle cell complication, can progress to skin cancer in people with albinism. There is, therefore, an important place for the education of these patients. It is understood that not being exposed to the sun makes it possible to avoid deleterious dehydration for a sickle cell patient and to prevent cancerous skin lesions in an albino patient.\n\n【13】The comorbidity of SCD and OCA was recently described in DRC in a study conducted in Kisangani, a city in northeastern DRC. The authors conclude that it is important to raise awareness about sickle cell disease, and the significance of prenuptial screening in this population as the sickle cell trait was found \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【14】This case report aims to draw physicians’ attention to the comorbidity of sickle cell disease and OCA, and the need to screen all albinos patients for sickle cell disease in view of proposing a dedicated health education and follow-up.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】A 14-month-old Congolese male child with oculocutaneous albinism visited the Mbujimayi pediatric clinic with fever and fatigue. He was originally from Kasai Oriental, a region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was the youngest in a family of five children, three of whom had oculocutaneous albinism. He himself has sickle cell disease and the rest of the siblings have a sickle cell trait (Fig. 1 ). He was born at term with a birth weight of 3000 g, and presented with spontaneously resolutive neonatal jaundice. The other significant history was episodes of fever with a monthly frequency of two episodes. No vaso-occlusive crisis was clearly diagnosed, in particular no dactylitis episode was reported. The vaccination schedule according to the expanded program of immunization in the DRC was respected with Bacille Calmette et Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine; oral polio vaccine (OPV) against polio; hepatitis B and haemophilus influenzae vaccine (HepB-HiB1); rotavirus vaccine (Rotasiil1); pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar); measles vaccine (VAR); and yellow fever vaccine (AAV). The patient has never been hospitalized and has always been treated on an outpatient basis in health centers during febrile episodes such as malaria or typhoid fever. The siblings reported no particular clinical history.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Genealogical tree\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】His parents are not albinos and have no specific medical history; they never benefited from a prenuptial test. They reported their fear of the judgment of others because they have albino children when they are not affected.\n\n【22】The patient was wide awake with good contact and interaction. Generalized pallor was noted with subicteric conjunctivae, and the irises were bluish gray and translucent, thus appearing red with nystagmus (Fig. 2 ). The patient’s skin was pinkish white, depigmented, without any particular lesions or bruises.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Physical examination that showed very light skin with blond hair and eyebrows, dark brown eyelashes and irises\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】On physical examination, weight and height were at the third and tenth percentile for age, respectively. There was no fever (temperature 36.5 °C), the respiratory rate was high (53 cycles/minute), as well as the heart rate (176 beats/minute), but the latter was regular with the presence of a 1/6 systolic murmur at the mitral focus. The oxygen saturation was 94%. The oral examination was normal. The lymph nodes were free, without lymphadenopathy. The lung examination was normal. The abdomen was supple and painless. There was stage III splenomegaly according to the Hackett classification. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 48 g/L and white blood cells at 13,200/μl (complete blood count performed with the Sysmex poch-100i; Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany).\n\n【28】The diagnosis of SCD has been suggested on the basis of pallor, jaundice, and severe anemia. It was confirmed first by a positive rapid test (BioMedomics, Inc, Morrisville, USA) and then by hemoglobin electrophoresis.\n\n【29】The diagnosis of albinism was proven by molecular genetics on a blood sample and identification of the mutation involved, that is homozygosity for the 2.7 kb deletion of OCA2 (laboratory “Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia CNB-CSIC Campus de Cantoblanco, Darwin 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain). A family investigation was then performed (see Fig. 1 ).\n\n【30】Given the very low hemoglobin level, the patient’s age, and SCD, a blood transfusion was indicated. Antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone and amikacin) was started in the hospital. The evolution was favorable. On discharge from hospital, routine prophylaxis with folic acid and oral penicillin was initiated, and advice on  crisis prevention and medical monitoring was given to the parents.\n\n【31】A dedicated patient monitoring program has been set up for sickle cell anemia and albinism with hygiene advice and sun protection measures. The patient received a hat, sunglasses, and sun protection cream. Ophthalmologic follow-up has also been set up. The evolution remains dermatologically stable, no skin lesion was observed. For SCD, the patient received treatment with hydroxyurea since early 2020. It is still too early to objectify the benefit of this therapy but he had only one infectious episode, one vaso-occlusive crisis, and did not require blood transfusion for over a year.\n\n【32】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【33】The purpose of this case report was to draw the attention of physicians to the possibility of comorbidity of SCD and OCA, and the need to screen for SCD in people with albinism. Clinical and biological data have shown that it was indeed a SCD and OCA comorbidity in a 14-month-old child from the province of Kasai Oriental in the DRC. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and the genealogical record demonstrated homozygosity for hemoglobin S, and although the diagnosis of OCA is generally clinical \\[ 21 \\], genetic testing has confirmed homozygosity for the deletion 2.7 kb of OCA2. Comorbidity of the sickle cell trait and OCA was recently described in the DRC in 221 individuals. This study demonstrated that the frequency of the sickle cell trait was equivalent in the two groups (82 albinos including 18.3% carriers of HbS and 139 non-albinos including 18% carriers of HbS) \\[ 20 \\]. This study did not report any case of SCD in this population but the authors concluded that it is important to sensitize this category of people to be screened for hemoglobin S \\[ 20 \\]. SCD patients present with numerous acute and chronic complications that contribute to early mortality and, consequently, national medical costs \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【34】The co-occurrence of SCD and OCA poses a problem to clinical follow-up mainly in terms of ophthalmic and cutaneous complications \\[ 12 , 23 , 24 \\]. Albinism can lead to reduced vision, photosensitivity, nystagmus, strabismus, refractive errors, iris transillumination, macular hypoplasia, and abnormal decussation of optic nerve fibers are the most common aspects. OCA debilitates \\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\]. In SCD, it is sickle cell retinopathy that can lead to irreversible loss of vision if it is not correctly diagnosed and treated early \\[ 12 , 23 , 27 \\]. The co-occurrence of SCD and OCA could deteriorate the patient’s vision more rapidly and requires special monitoring; annual ophthalmologic follow-up for sickle cell disease \\[ 12 \\] should include assessment, in particular, of maculopathy \\[ 17 \\]. Certain measures can be taken to improve the patient’s visual function and educate them on the importance of sun protection \\[ 28 \\].\n\n【35】In sickle cell patients, skin ulcers are often debilitating, refractory to treatment, and recurrent \\[ 12 \\]. These ulcers are precipitated by microvasculitis \\[ 29 \\]. Furthermore, reduced skin pigmentation leads to photosensitivity and an increased risk of skin cancer in OCA \\[ 30 , 31 \\]. One study on albinism in the DRC described that squamous cell carcinoma was the most common lesion \\[ 18 \\]. When skin ulcers are present, there is an increased risk of skin cancer \\[ 17 , 32 \\]. Skin examinations are therefore performed at 6–12 month intervals starting in adolescence.\n\n【36】Anemia is one of the consequences of SCD. In low-resource settings, it is the clinical assessment of pallor or any sign of its intolerance that leads to the diagnosis of severe anemia or its exacerbation \\[ 33 \\]. However, in the presence of OCA, anemia can be difficult to detect due to the very pale color of the skin \\[ 32 \\]. Despite the cost to the patient, in this situation a measurement of the hemoglobin level is indicated.\n\n【37】Genetically, SCD and OCA are rare autosomal recessive diseases caused by mutations on chromosome 11 \\[ 12 , 17 \\]. We report here the first case of a patient presenting simultaneously with SCD and OCA, suggesting the possibility of a presumed genetic link between these two rare diseases. An African family with four albinos associated with sickle cell anemia for one member and a sickle cell trait for three others was reported in 1956 \\[ 34 \\]. This study demonstrated that if the hypothesis of simple recessive Mendelian inheritance of OCA is correct, the absolute link between the genes for albinism and the beta-globin gene does not occur, but a looser linkage might be a possibility \\[ 35 \\].\n\n【38】Empirical observations are in favor of fewer vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell patients with lighter skin compared with those with darker skin. Nevertheless, as described by Bakare _et al._ , comparing a group of patients with OCA and SCD with an SCD group without OCA could provide a feasible way to challenge this hypothesis. In the future, genetic and pharmacological interventions aimed at regulating melanin production may play a role in alleviating the severity of phenotypic expression of sickle cell patients \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【39】The co-inheritance of SCD and OCA has rarely been described. In the absence of neonatal screening for SCD, its diagnosis is probably not made and specific follow-up, in particular for skin and ophthalmological complications, is not offered. This case also highlights a lack of clinical knowledge of this type of combination. Awareness-raising programs for screening for sickle cell anemia in this category of the population are necessary. In the present state of our knowledge, ophthalmologic and cutaneous complications should be the subject of an appropriate follow-up and anemia should not be underestimated.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】All data generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】DRC:\n\n【44】The Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n【45】HbS:\n\n【46】Hemoglobin S\n\n【47】OCA:\n\n【48】Oculocutaneous albinism\n\n【49】NO:\n\n【50】Nitric oxide\n\n【51】SCD:\n\n【52】Sickle cell disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Herein, we report the case of a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and sepsis caused by _V. vulnificus_ infection sustained through shrimp shelling.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An 82-year-old Japanese Asian woman with no medical history or underlying disease developed redness, swelling, and pain, which extended from the right fingers to the upper arm. A diagnosis of sepsis due to cellulitis was made. Blood culture detected _V. vulnificus_ ; thus, minocycline was administered in addition to meropenem. The disease course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 28 of hospitalization. Symptoms in the right upper arm developed 1 day after the patient shelled a large number of shrimp; therefore, the infection route was assumed to be through wounds sustained during shrimp shelling. We suspected liver disease and measured serum anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody levels, leading to the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】As in this case, small wounds caused by handling fish and shrimp are a potential source of infection. Patients with severe _V. vulnificus_ infection should be thoroughly assessed for the presence of liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infection were first reported in 1979 by Blake _et al_ . _V. vulnificus_ is a slightly halophilic Gram-negative bacillus with an optimal salt concentration of 2–3% that lives in seawater and brackish water \\[ 1 \\]. _V. vulnificus_ infections mainly occur in western Japan during the summer, and it is considered one of the most dangerous waterborne pathogens, with a reported fatality rate of 50% \\[ 2 \\]. Human infection occurs by eating raw or insufficiently heated food contaminated with _V. vulnificus_ , exposure to seawater, or wounds inflicted by marine animals. _V. vulnificus_ infection can result in fatal sepsis in patients with underlying diseases, such as preexisting liver disease, hemochromatosis, or immunodeficiency. To the best of our knowledge, there are no case reports of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) associated with _V. vulnificus_ infection. Herein, we report the case of a patient with PBC and sepsis caused by _V. vulnificus_ infection sustained through shrimp shelling.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The patient was an 82-year-old Japanese Asian woman with no comorbidities, relevant family medical history, alcohol consumption, or known allergies. No previous liver disease or abnormal liver function tests were noted. However, she had been a smoker of 20 cigarettes per day until 3 years prior. After mountain climbing on 23 and 24 July 2012, she experienced numbness and pain in the right arm. On 25 July, she developed general malaise. Since her symptoms did not improve by the morning of 26 July, she visited a private hospital with facial pallor, poor dietary intake, redness, mild swelling, and pain in the right arm. She was in circulatory shock with a blood pressure of 60/48 mmHg, and was later transported by an ambulance to Fukuoka University Hospital.\n\n【12】Her physical findings on admission were as follows: body height, 158 cm; body weight, 51.0 kg; body mass index, 20.43 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; conscious and coherent; blood pressure, 66/33 mmHg; pulse rate, 91 beats per minute (bpm; regular); respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; SpO <sub>2 </sub> , 97% (room air); body temperature, 37.7 °C; and redness and swelling extending from the medial part of the right upper arm to the right elbow and forearm (Fig. 1 ). Blood tests showed high levels of inflammation (Table 1 ), and computed tomography of the upper arm revealed adipose tissue turbidity (Fig. 2 ). We suspected septic shock, with the infection originating in the upper arm.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Skin rash in the right upper arm. Redness and swelling are observed above the right elbow on day 1. The area is warm to touch\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Table 1 Blood examination results on day 1**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Computed tomographic examination of the right upper arm. A soft tissue opacity is seen in the right arm\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】First, to stabilize blood pressure, we rapidly administered 1000 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, an initial dose of meropenem 1.0 g after blood culture specimens were collected, and noradrenaline at 0.2 µg/kg/minute. Then, under local anesthesia, a 5-cm incision was made distally from the medial right upper arm and proximally from the medial right cubital fossa. The color tones of the subcutaneous fat and fascia were normal, and we suspected cellulitis rather than necrotizing fasciitis. For the septic shock, we continued to administer meropenem (3.0 g/day) for 12 days, with linezolid (1.2 g/day) for 5 days and immunoglobulin (5 g/day) for 3 days via intravenous injection. On day 2 of hospitalization, a blood culture detected Gram-negative bacilli (Fig. 3 a), and linezolid was discontinued. On day 5 of hospitalization, _V. vulnificus_ was identified by blood culture, and we added minocycline (100 mg) twice daily for 8 days, to which _V. vulnificus_ was susceptible (Fig. 3 b). Subsequently, the inflammatory findings rapidly improved; the patient’s C-reactive protein levels dropped from 9.3 to 1.1 mg/dL in 9 days. Although there was no history of seafood intake or contact with seawater, we learned that the swelling developed in the right hand 1 day after she had shelled a large number of raw shrimp for cooking, and the swelling spread to the trunk. Therefore, we believed that the route of _V. vulnificus_ infection was through minor skin wounds inflicted by shrimp shells.\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Bacteriological findings. **a** Blood culture Gram stain; **b** antibiogram of _V. vulnificus_ . _ABPC_ ampicillin, _CEZ_ cefazolin, _CMZ_ cefmetazole, _CTX_ cefotaxime, _MEPM_ meropenem, _MINO_ minocycline, _LVFX_ levofloxacin\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】On day 11 of hospitalization, the treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily), as the redness and swelling in the upper arm had improved. After 7 days, drug-induced thrombocytopenia was observed, and levofloxacin was discontinued. No recurrence was observed, and the patient was discharged on day 28 of hospitalization (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【29】**Fig. 4**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Disease course after admission. _Nad_ noradrenaline, _IVIG_ intravenous immunoglobulin, _LZD_ linezolid\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】During the course of hospitalization, persistent elevation of serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels suggested liver disease. Blood tests performed on day 5 of hospitalization showed positivity for anti-mitochondrial M2 antibodies (Table 2 ), and abdominal echography showed a pattern of chronic liver disease, leading to the diagnosis of PBC. Since the liver damage was mild, we started to administer ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day). On follow-up with the practitioner, we received no reports of exacerbations.\n\n【34】**Table 2 Blood examination results on day 5**\n\n【35】Full size table\n\n【36】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【37】In the present case, the cause of sepsis was initially unclear because the patient had no relevant medical history or underlying disease. However, blood culture revealed a causative organism, _V. vulnificus_ , and the history of shrimp shelling was identified. We thought the fungus entered through a small wound and became the source of infection. Moreover, _V. vulnificus_ infection tends to accompany liver disease, and persistent elevation of serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels suggested liver disease, diagnosed as PBC in our patient. This is an interesting case study because we could not find any similar case reports.\n\n【38】_V. vulnificus_ is a Gram-negative bacillus that causes wound infections and sepsis in some patients. The outcomes of _V. vulnificus_ infection tend to be serious in men, and in middle-aged and older patients (> 40 years of age), particularly those with underlying diseases, such as liver disease, diabetes, immune disorders, elevated serum iron concentration, and cirrhosis (mainly alcohol induced) \\[ 2 \\]. _V. vulnificus_ infection is characterized by a short incubation period, typically within 24 hours of exposure. Moreover, since this bacterium can cause severe infections, such as bacteremia and wound infections, prompt initiation of antibacterial therapy is essential. Therefore, if an infection is suspected, particularly in high-risk patients, it is crucial to identify this bacterium accurately and rapidly in clinical practice \\[ 2 \\]. In one report, regarding the rates of sepsis and wound infection, _V. vulnificus_ caused wound infections and bacteremia in 62 patients over the course of 1 year in Israel. Among them, 57 patients developed cellulitis, four developed necrotizing fasciitis, and one developed osteomyelitis. The fatality rate of _V. vulnificus_ infection has been reported to be 20–50%, and no deaths were observed in this particular report \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【39】The proliferation of _V. vulnificus_ is influenced by water temperature. _V. vulnificus_ accounted for approximately 8% of the aerobic bacteria in samples collected from the Chesapeake Bay between April 1991 and December 1992. It was not detected in February or March (water temperature < 8 °C) but was detected in 80% of the samples in May, July, September, and December (water temperature > 8 °C) \\[ 3 \\]. Regarding the salt concentration of the water, when the influx of freshwater from the Mississippi River reduced the salt concentration at the Mississippi shoreline, _V. vulnificus_ became temporarily undetectable in this area. Therefore, salt concentration greatly influences the growth of _V. vulnificus_ \\[ 4 \\]. In the present case, although the location at which the shrimp were caught was unknown, the disease onset in July did not contradict the biology of _V. vulnificus_ .\n\n【40】PBC, which is an autoimmune disease associated with environmental and genetic factors, was first reported by Addison _et al._ in 1857; however, its exact cause remains unknown \\[ 5 \\]. A study of 1032 patients with PBC revealed that it is more common in women and is sometimes accompanied by other autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome and Raynaud syndrome \\[ 6 \\]. A family history of PBC, smoking, and history of urinary tract infections are also commonly reported. Furthermore, it has been suggested that in urinary tract infections, _Escherichia coli_ can disrupt immune tolerance, leading to the development of PBC \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. In the present case, PBC was revealed by blood test on the fifth day of onset. It is possible that _V. vulnificus_ infection occurred after the patient originally had PBC, or that PBC developed after _V. vulnificus_ infection. It is also possible that the two diseases coincidentally overlap. However, there are no precedents for either of these possibilities, and we cannot discuss these possibilities at this time.\n\n【41】In conclusion, the lessons learned from this case suggest that it is useful to evaluate patients with _V. vulnificus_ infection for the presence of undiagnosed liver disease, such as asymptomatic PBC. In addition, a detailed history regarding _V. vulnificus_ infection should be obtained because shelling of crustaceans is a potential source of infection.\n\n【42】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】Not applicable.\n\n【44】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【45】PBC:\n\n【46】Primary biliary cholangitis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Here we report another patient with a transient global amnesia and concomitant Takotsubo syndrome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Our patient is a 64-year-old white man with a previous history of myocarditis from borreliosis who developed sudden-onset confusional state with perseverations and repetition of the same questions during a funeral for his brother-in-law. Upon neurological work-up and after spontaneous resolution of most of the neurological deficits, transient global amnesia was diagnosed. Blood tests revealed moderate renal insufficiency, elevated troponin-T, and elevated N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide. Electrocardiography showed left anterior hemiblock and negative T-waves in V2–V6. Upon transthoracic echocardiography the apical type of a Takotsubo syndrome was suspected. Since coronary angiography was normal and electrocardiography and echocardiographic abnormalities resolved under candesartan, bisoprolol, acetyl-salicylic acid, and atorvastatin within a few days after onset, Takotsubo syndrome was diagnosed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Since Takotsubo syndrome may be associated with transient global amnesia a causal relation may exist. A possible trigger for both conditions could be severe emotional stress from the loss of a close relative. A possible common pathomechanism could be overstimulation of adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, the cerebrum, or the coronary or cerebral arteries. Whether pre-existing myocardial compromise promotes the development of Takotsubo syndrome requires further investigations.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Simultaneous occurrence of transient global amnesia (TGA) and Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been only rarely reported (Table 1 ) \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. Whether TGA triggers TTS in such a case or vice versa, or whether there is a common trigger for both conditions is so far unsolved. Here we report a tenth patient, the first male, with the simultaneous occurrence of a TGA and TTS.\n\n【10】**Table 1 Patients with simultaneous transient global amnesia and Takotsubo syndrome so far reported**\n\n【11】Full size table\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our patient is a 64-year-old white man, height 176 cm, weight 90 kg, who developed a sudden-onset confusional state with perseverations and repetition of the same questions during a funeral for his brother-in-law to whom he had a close emotional relation. He had a previous history of arterial hypertension, myocarditis due to borreliosis with systolic dysfunction that was diagnosed 13 years prior to the current admission, and an allergy to penicillin. He was regularly taking candesartan and bisoprolol. A clinical neurologic examination on admission revealed disorientation in all qualities, retrograde amnesia, and reduced tendon reflexes but was otherwise normal. Blood pressure on admission was 140/77 mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left anterior hemiblock and negative T-waves in V2–V6. Blood tests revealed moderate renal insufficiency, high-sensitive troponin-T of 243 ng/L (normal, < 14 ng/L), and an N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 588 ng/L (normal, < 241 ng/L). MRI of his cerebrum was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed dyskinesia of the left ventricular posterior, posterolateral, and apical parts of the left ventricular myocardium and apical ballooning (Fig. 1 ). Clinical cardiologic examination was normal. On hospital day (hd) 2 his troponin-T fell to 77 ng/L. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Coronary angiography on hd4 was normal but ventriculography still showed mild apical ballooning. The neurological manifestations of the stress syndrome resolved except for mild memory disturbances for some words within a few hours after onset. Echocardiography and ECG normalized under medication with candesartan, bisoprolol, acetyl-salicylic acid, and atorvastatin within a few days after onset. Cardiologic and neurologic follow-up investigations 6 weeks after onset of the clinical manifestations were normal.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Transthoracic echocardiography. Endsystolic apical five-chamber view on hospital day 1 showing dyskinesia of the left ventricular posterior, posterolateral and apical parts. _AO_ aorta, _LA_ left atrium, _LV_ left ventricle\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】TGA is characterized by a sudden episode of memory loss that cannot be attributed to a more common neurological condition, such as epilepsy or stroke \\[ 6 \\]. During a TGA, recall of recent events vanishes: the patient cannot remember where he is or how he got there. In addition, the patient may not remember anything about what is happening in the here and now \\[ 6 \\]. Consequently, the patient keeps repeating the same questions because he does not remember the answers he has just been given. He may also draw a blank when asked to remember things that happened a day, a month, or even a year ago \\[ 6 \\]. The cause of TGA is unknown but some studies indicate that ischemia in the hippocampus and the thalamus \\[ 7 \\], migraine-related mechanisms, venous flow abnormalities (abnormal venous drainage from the temporal lobes), epileptic phenomena, or psychological disturbances \\[ 8 \\] could be causative. Risk factors for developing a TGA may be a migraine history, cardiovascular risk factors, and emotional stress. Since TGA may be associated with TTS in single cases (Table 1 ) \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\], it has been recently proposed that TGA could also be due to a catecholamine storm and could represent the cerebral form of a TTS \\[ 2 \\]. However, none of these speculations has been proven to consistently explain the common occurrence of TGA and TTS \\[ 9 \\]. Occasionally, TGA may be associated with troponine elevation \\[ 10 \\]. Cortisol secretion can be increased during a TGA \\[ 11 \\]. Cerebral MRI patterns may indicate that seizures trigger the development of a TGA \\[ 12 \\]. Recently, cytotoxic edema of the hippocampus has been related to the pathogenesis of a TGA \\[ 13 \\]. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies revealed that a TGA is associated with decreased metabolism in the posterior medial network \\[ 14 \\]. Compensatorily, metabolism within the anterior temporal network is increased \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【20】TTS is a peculiar, acute-onset type of regional systolic dysfunction together with regional dyskinesia, akinesia, or hypokinesia of the left ventricular wall \\[ 15 \\] often resembling an acute coronary syndrome clinically, electrocardiographically, and laboratory-chemically, affecting predominantly postmenopausal women after a stressful trigger \\[ 16 \\]. In general, four types of TTS can be delineated: the classical apical-midventricular type, the midventricular type, the basal type, and the global type. Although coronary angiography needs to be normal per definition, occasionally TTS is associated with coronary heart disease. The cause and pathogenesis of TTS remain controversial but is has been speculated that adrenergic overstimulation of the myocardium may result in a decrease of contractility. Hormonal influences and innate susceptibility may play modifying roles in the pathogenesis of TTS \\[ 17 \\]. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system may contribute to the development of TTS \\[ 18 \\]. Patients with TTS either receive treatment or do not. Treatment includes heart failure therapy and eventually antiarrhythmic medication or a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. The ECG resolves within 10 weeks after onset and the echocardiographic abnormalities within 6 weeks after onset. The outcome is fair in the majority of cases but some patients die from intractable heart failure, particularly those who experience the global type or complications.\n\n【21】Concerning the current case, the trigger of TTS seems to be emotional stress during the funeral of a close relative. Whether TTS occurred before the TGA, after the TGA, or simultaneously with the TGA remains speculative, because no cardiologic examination was carried out immediately at onset of the TGA. Possibly, systolic dysfunction from the TTS resulted in cerebral ischemia or a venous drainage problem and thus caused the memory problem. However, it cannot be excluded that overstimulation of cerebral adrenergic receptors in neurons or vascular smooth muscle cells led to the memory deficits. Concerning this speculation, further investigations are warranted. Concerning the trigger in the current case, the close relation between our patient and the deceased person suggests that strong emotions of mourning and grief may have been the initiating event. Concerning the triggers in the nine previously reported cases of TTS and TGA they were always emotional stress. Concerning the type of TTS, all previously described patients presented with the classical type (Table 1 ), Among these nine patients treatment for TTS was applied in two (Table 1 ). The outcome was favorable in all cases so far reported.\n\n【22】### Established facts\n\n【23】Simultaneous occurrence of TGA and TTS has been only rarely reported.\n\n【24】### Novel insights\n\n【25】Since TTS may be associated with a TGA a causal relation may exist.\n\n【26】A possible common pathomechanism could be overstimulation of adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, the cerebrum, or the coronary or cerebral arteries.\n\n【27】A trigger for both conditions could be severe emotional stress from loss of a close relative.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】This case shows that TTS may be accompanied by a TGA suggesting that a causative relation could exist between these two conditions. A possible trigger for both conditions could be severe emotional stress from the loss of a close relative. A possible common pathomechanism could be overstimulation of adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes, neurons, or vascular smooth muscle cells. Pre-existent cardiomyopathy may facilitate the development of TTS. Also males can be affected by TTS and TGA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The nodules usually involve the lower extremities. Pancreatic panniculitis is commonly associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis, and occasionally with pancreatic cancer, especially acinar cell carcinoma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 77-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant medical history was referred to our center with multiple painful, itchy, and warm red/blue cutaneous nodules on the left lower leg. These skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. The skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis. Further analysis revealed high lipase serum of > 3000 U/L (normal range < 60 U/L), and on computed tomography scan a mass located between the stomach and the left pancreas was seen. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma. After discussing the patient in the pancreatobiliary multidisciplinary team meeting, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy including splenectomy and en bloc wedge resection of the stomach due to tumor in-growth was performed. The cutaneous nodules on both legs disappeared 1–2 days after surgery. No long-term complications were reported during follow-up. One year after surgery, the patient presented with similar symptoms as preoperatively. Computed tomography scan showed local recurrence and distal metastases, which were subsequently confirmed by biopsy.

The patient died 2 months later, 13 months after surgical resection.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case illustrates the importance of clinically recognizing cutaneous nodules and pathological recognizing the specific microscopic changes as sign of a (malignant) pancreatic disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Pancreatic panniculitis, first described by Chiari in 1883 \\[ 1 \\], is a rare skin manifestation characterized by a specific type of subcutaneous fat necrosis, namely saponification of fatty tissue. It is a rare presentation of a pancreatic disease, appearing in approximately 2–3% of all patients with a pancreatic disease \\[ 2 \\]. The disease is commonly associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis, although more rarely it is also associated with pancreatic cancer, especially acinar cell carcinoma \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Patients with pancreatic panniculitis most commonly present with erythematous cutaneous nodules on the lower extremities as first manifestation of the underlying pancreatic disease, but nodules at other sites have been reported \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】The pathophysiology is unclear, but it is believed that the release of pancreatic enzymes, in particular lipase, into the circulating system, leads to this characteristic form of fat necrosis \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【11】We describe a case that highlights the importance of recognizing cutaneous nodules as a potential warning sign of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 77-year-old Caucasian women was referred to our dermatology department with multiple painful, itchy, and warm red/blue cutaneous nodules on the left lower leg. The cutaneous nodules had progressed over time and were visible on both legs. The patient had no significant medical history, was a former smoker, used 14 units of alcohol per week, and had done office work. She had not experienced abdominal discomfort or weight loss. Both her parents had died from lung cancer, and there was no further family history of gastrointestinal or pancreatic cancer. She was the mother of three children and used the following medications: allopurinol, metoprolol, omeprazole, perindopril/indapamide, and pravastatin.\n\n【14】Physical examination revealed three cutaneous nodules ranging in diameter from 1 to 4 cm on both legs (Fig. 1 ). One was slightly red, while the other two were dark red to purple–blue. All were painful during palpation. According to the dermatologist, the skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Further neurological and physical examination was not performed.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Cutaneous nodules on both legs during presentation\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis (Fig. 2 ). Based on this finding, further diagnostic analyses were performed including blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scan followed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle biopsy. A lipase serum level of > 3000 U/L (normal range < 60 U/L) and a mass located between the stomach and the left side of the pancreas, with a diameter of 7.4 cm, was seen (Fig. 3 ). There were no signs of metastases. EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy was obtained, and the histopathological diagnosis was acinar cell carcinoma.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Skin biopsy showing the subcutis with local saponification of fat\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Mass located in the left pancreas, in contact with the stomach\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The patient was discussed during the pancreatobiliary multidisciplinary team meeting. Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy including splenectomy was advised. Upon hospital admission, pulse, blood pressure, and temperature were normal. The patient underwent this procedure laparoscopically including en bloc wedge resection of the stomach owing to tumor in-growth. Operation time was 7 h. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 after an uncomplicated hospital stay. During the hospital stay, she received paracetamol, oxycodone, pheneticillin because of the splenectomy, and magnesium hydroxide. Her renal and liver function were normal. No additional urinalysis or microbiology was performed. The cutaneous nodules on both legs had disappeared 1–2 days after surgery.\n\n【29】The diagnosis on the resection specimen was acinar cell carcinoma, the resection margins were free of tumor (R0 resection), and there were no lymph node metastases found in 12 examined lymph nodes. The postoperative multidisciplinary team meeting advised the patient to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the added value of adjuvant chemotherapy for this rare form of pancreatic carcinoma has not been well researched \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Based on the available data, the patient rejected adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【30】During the first and second outpatient visit, at 4 and 6 months postoperatively, no long-term complications were reported, and the patient had recovered well. One year after surgery, the patient presented to the emergency room with similar symptoms as preoperatively. CT scan showed both local recurrence and distal metastases, which were subsequently confirmed by biopsy. She started with palliative folinic acid–fluorouracil–irinotecan–oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy but stopped after two cycles because of disease progression. The patient died 2 months later, 13 months after surgical resection.\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】We present the case of a 77-year-old woman with no contributing medical history who had cutaneous nodules on her legs as the only symptom of acinar cell carcinoma. The fact that the cutaneous nodules on her legs were the only symptom and that the underlying cause was acinar cell carcinoma makes our case unique. Literature describes pancreatic panniculitis as a rare skin manifestation that appears in approximately 2–3% of all patients with a pancreatic disease \\[ 2 \\]. Patients most commonly present with erythematous cutaneous nodules on the lower extremities \\[ 4 \\], and up to 45% of patients with pancreatic panniculitis show these nodules before recognition of the underlying pancreatic disease \\[ 11 \\]. In addition, acinar cell carcinoma is a very rare pancreatic malignancy that represents only 1–2% of all pancreatic malignancies \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【33】For the diagnosis, it is mandatory to obtain a skin biopsy because of the typical histological findings of lobular panniculitis, necrotic anucleate adipocytes called “ghost cells,” and neutrophilic infiltration \\[ 12 \\]. Blood tests usually show elevated pancreatic enzymes \\[ 13 \\], and instrumental investigations should be performed to diagnose or exclude an underlying pancreatic disease \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【34】The prognosis after surgery of resectable pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is usually more favorable compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma \\[ 9 , 15 \\], and moreover a potentially curative treatment \\[ 7 \\]. Therefore, surgical intervention is recommended if possible. The added value of adjuvant chemotherapy for this rare form of pancreatic malignancy has not been well researched, and current literature reports varying results on this subject \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】This case illustrates the importance of clinically recognizing cutaneous nodules as potential warning signs of pancreatic panniculitis due to a (malignant) pancreatic disease. In cases of nonspecific nodules on the lower extremities, a skin biopsy should be obtained alongside routine analysis to diagnose or exclude an underlying pancreatic disease. It is important that the pathologist is aware that certain types of fat necrosis are a sign of a pancreatic disease. A blood test to check for elevated pancreatic enzymes, CT scan of the abdomen, and biopsy are the preferred diagnostic tools to differentiate between a benign or malignant cause. The bottom line is that, in these rare diseases, a multidisciplinary team effort is essential.\n\n【37】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【38】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Counseling and possible medication adjustment should be added to clinical practice in those planning to decrease caloric intake through dedicated fasting including Ramadan or weight-loss-directed behavioral modifications, especially if taking sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is defined by certain diagnostic criteria, including blood glucose level of more than 13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), acidosis (arterial pH < 7.3 and serum bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L), and ketonemia \\[ 1 \\]. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is defined as follows: blood glucose level below 13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL), acidosis, and development of ketonemia \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【11】The first case of EDKA was described by Munro in 1973, whereby he studied 211 cases of DKA, 11 of which had blood glucose levels below 16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) \\[ 4 \\]. This was classically considered a rare incident, but it is likely underreported \\[ 2 \\]. The etiology of EDKA is unknown, but there are many stressors and conditions that can precipitate an episode in either a diabetic or healthy patient \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Such stressors include fasting, anorexia, gastroparesis, being on a ketogenic diet, and higher alcohol consumption \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. Furthermore, conditions such as pregnancy, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, insulin pump use, sepsis, cardiovascular events, and recent major surgery also play a similar role \\[ 3 , 8 \\].\n\n【12】The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have been extensively studied, including adequate glycemic control, weight loss, and more importantly, nephrological and cardiovascular protection \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Alternatively, life-threatening side-effects related to this class of medication, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and EDKA, have also been documented in literature \\[ 13 \\]. Therefore, a warning is included in the drug label for SGLT2 inhibitors \\[ 9 \\]. These medications, including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, increase the risk of inducing EDKA \\[ 3 , 15 , 16 \\]. Triggers inducing EDKA predispose the body to a carbohydrate deficit, which will result in lipid catabolism as a source of energy via the anaerobic pathway. Fatty acids are then produced by lipolysis, and high levels of fatty acids leads to ketone formation \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. Here, we present the first case of EDKA associated with 14 hours of fasting daily for 30 days while being on dapagliflozin.\n\n【13】The ritual of fasting in the Islamic nation is most significant in Ramadan. Ramadan is the month of fasting, which is a deed practiced by many Muslims. Muslims fast for thirty consecutive days from sunrise to sunset, and therefore, hours of fasting change from one country to another but generally range from 10 hours to 21 hours. Fasting during this time includes all forms of food or liquids, including water. At sunset, Muslims break their fast when they start consuming meals and drinks. Ramadan is followed by a huge population in the Islamic world, leading to the importance of addressing clinical risks associated with prolonged fasting in patients with diabetes, especially when treated with SGLT2 inhibitors \\[ 17 \\]. Here we present the first case of EDKA associated with Ramadan fasting that included a 14-hour daily fast sustained over a 30-day period while being on dapagliflozin.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 51-year-old Moroccan male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department for evaluation of his acute symptoms. He complained of epigastric pain and fatigue for 3 days. He was further reported to have bouts of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting associated with poor oral intake. He denied any chest pain, fever, or cough. He had no change in bowel habits. He reported no contact with a sick person or recent travel history. His family and psychosocial histories were unremarkable. Upon documenting his medication history, the patient was on metformin regularly for 10 years for his diabetes. Dapagliflozin 5 mg was added to metformin 1000 mg daily 12 weeks prior to presentation. The symptoms started the day following completion of Ramadan fasting over a 30-day period. Fasting from food and drinks lasted daily for approximately 14 hours daily. He broke his fast with a three-course meal, starting with a light meal which was mainly based on fruits and fluids, a second course of protein-based items along with vegetables and carbohydrate-containing items. Finally, the meal was concluded with carbohydrate-based items. Drinks were consumed throughout the fast-breaking period.\n\n【16】Vital signs in the emergency department were documented as follows: Kussmaul’s pattern of breathing, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min and a pulse rate of 112 bpm. The patient was otherwise alert and oriented. His chest and abdominal examination were unremarkable. DKA workup, blood sugar level, venous blood gas, and urine analysis were carried out; the results are presented in Table 1 .\n\n【17】**Table 1 Metabolic panel**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】Initial blood workup revealed a random blood glucose of 13.5 mmol/l (243 mg/dL). The venous blood gas results showed severe metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, pH of 6.9 and PCO <sub>2 </sub> of 20.4 mmHg with HCO <sub>3 </sub> of 4 mmol/L. The calculated anion gap was 30 mEq/L. Urine was positive for ketones and glucose. Based on the above presentation, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed. The patient was resuscitated with 4 L of normal saline intravenously, and insulin at a dose of 1 unit/kg was initiated.\n\n【20】The cause of ketoacidosis was investigated to rule out other precipitants for acidosis. Complete blood work-up showed a mild increase in white blood cells at 16.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (normal range of 4.5–11.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with a high neutrophil count of 14.56 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (normal range of 1.8–7.70 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, were within the normal range. Furthermore, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with minimal nonspecific changes in the inferior leads, which could be related to increased respiration. However, cardiac enzymes were within normal range. The patient did not report any respiratory symptoms; therefore, a chest X-ray was not indicated.\n\n【21】He was admitted to a regular medical ward and was kept on insulin and sodium bicarbonate infusions. Metformin and dapagliflozin were not resumed. The patient’s condition improved and as did his metabolic parameters (Table 1 ). The blood gas normalized, and the anion gap closed. His capillary blood glucose readings were optimal for the inpatient setting. The patient’s insulin infusion was bridged to subcutaneous insulin. He was discharged on insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime and aspart insulin 5 units before meals.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】We report a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis triggered by prolonged fasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EDKA with SGLT2 inhibitor use induced by decreased caloric intake due to Ramadan fasting. It is well known that prolonged fasting (as early as 12–14 hours of fasting) will result in ketone formation. Ketone formation normally augments insulin secretion, which can decrease the rate of ketone generation; however, in diabetic patients or those who use SGLT2 inhibitors, this mechanism is affected \\[ 3 , 6 \\].\n\n【24】Other stressors have been briefly mentioned in literature and even as case reports, but in this case, the severity of acidosis was remarkable especially in SGLT2 inhibitor-induced EDKA.\n\n【25】It was challenging to arrive at a diagnosis on presentation as the patient’s symptoms were generalized and could fit many differentials. However, the Kussmaul pattern of breathing and tachypnea along with history of diabetes mellitus prompted doctors to check venous blood gas to rule out acidosis. EDKA could result from multiple precipitants, but decreased oral intake is the most cited stressor for precipitating EDKA with or without SGLT2 inhibitor use \\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 \\]. In addition, studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors, in general, increase the risk of DKA by sevenfold \\[ 16 \\]. According to a report generated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), seventy-three cases of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization were reported from March 2013 to May 2015 in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors; however, out of 73 cases, 40 had an average blood glucose levels of 11.7 mmol/L (211 mg/dL).\n\n【26】Being on a carbohydrate-deficient diet leads to a hypoglycemic effect that will result in a shift from glucose to lipid utilization for energy production. This mechanism will also increase glucagon levels and decrease insulin stimulation, promoting ketogenesis \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. The exact mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors precipitate the development of EDKA is not yet clear. However, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that SGLT2 blockers decrease blood glucose levels by increasing glycosuria and decreasing endogenous insulin secretion. In addition, they directly stimulate α-cells to produce more glucagon in response to hypoglycemia and decrease insulin secretion. As a result of this effect, more glucagon is produced, which promotes hepatic ketogenesis. Another effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is an increase in the reabsorption of acetoacetate in the renal tubules, which contributes to the increase in ketone levels in the blood \\[ 16 , 20 , 21 \\].\n\n【27】In 2021, Tan reported three cases of EDKA in diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitors that were induced by a recent decrease in caloric intake \\[ 13 \\]. In contrast, our patient fasted for 14 hours daily but then broke his fast at sunset as part of observing Ramadan while being on dapagliflozin.\n\n【28】Possible precipitants mentioned above were ruled out upon our patient’s presentation, hence we presumed the cause of his ketoacidosis was fasting in Ramadan while being on dapagliflozin.\n\n【29】In 2017, a literature review described the effect of fasting for Ramadan on insulin-dependent diabetic patients. All studies concluded that there was no change but rather some improvement in glycemic control during fasting for Ramadan. Furthermore, the incidence of hyperglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis was insignificant \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【30】Similarly, a low-carbohydrate diet and an increase in fat in the diet can theoretically induce ketoacidosis \\[ 23 \\]. There have been case reports illustrating the effect of a low-calorie diet consumed by diabetic patients while on SGLT2 inhibitors, leading to EDKA \\[ 5 , 24 \\]. In contrast, in our case, the patient had been fasting long enough where there was no intake of food and drinks for long hours. This denotes an association between fasting and the development of EDKA while on a SGLT2 inhibitor \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【31】Typically, the treatment of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated EDKA is similar to the conventional DKA treatment protocol, with an emphasis on closer monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels. For this reason, our patient was fluid resuscitated and started on insulin infusion, and electrolyte disturbances were corrected \\[ 25 \\]. Universally, as a preventative measure, it is advised to stop SGLT2 inhibitors in the setting of acute illness to decrease the risk of EDKA \\[ 26 \\]. In clinical practice, the Australian and New Zealand Colleges of Anesthetists advocate that SGLT2 inhibitors be stopped 3 days prior to surgery or in other physically stressful situations \\[ 27 \\].\n\n【32】The practice in our institution in preparation for Ramadan fasting is to educate patients on switching the time of medication intake and instruct them to take it once they break their fast. Moreover, we advise them to increase fluid intake to keep hydrated. It is of crucial importance to educate patients if they undergo any dietary changes, such as carbohydrate restriction or being on a ketogenic diet \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【33】As a recommendation, patients on SGLT2 inhibitors are advised to keep themselves hydrated, have a balanced meal, and consider stopping the medication during prolonged periods of fasting and/or in case of illness \\[ 28 \\]. A discussion between the care provider and patient should occur before initiating a SGLT2 inhibitor. Counseling should include mentioning adverse events, especially in the setting of prolonged fast, to avoid pronounced ketone formation and acidemia. This case highlights the importance of counseling, especially in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of EDKA. More cases are now being reported as these medications are used in abundance in clinical practice. However, this is the first case report describing EDKA induced by prolonged fasting due to Ramadan while on a SGLT2 inhibitor. Physicians should have a high level of suspicion for EDKA if the patient is on a SGLT2 inhibitor. EDKA counseling and possible medication adjustment should be added to clinical practice in those on SGLT2 inhibitors who are decreasing caloric intake through weight-loss-directed behavioral modifications or dedicated fasting such as during the month of Ramadan.\n\n【36】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】Data sharing was not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】SGLT2:\n\n【40】Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2\n\n【41】DKA:\n\n【42】Diabetes ketoacidosis\n\n【43】EDKA:\n\n【44】Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The disease is more frequent in Asia and South America, with only few cases reported in Western countries. A prompt diagnosis, though often difficult, is a necessity due to the very aggressive clinical course of the disease.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the clinicopathological features of fulminant T cell lymphoproliferative disease that arose in the setting of acute primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Our patient, a 23-year-old man, presented to our facility with persisting fever, hepatosplenomegaly and severe pancytopenia. On bone marrow biopsy, an abundant lymphoid infiltrate was observed. Immunophenotypic and molecular studies revealed that the atypical lymphoid cells displayed a CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , Epstein-Barr-encoded-RNA-positive T cell phenotype with clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor genes, the final diagnosis being systemic Epstein-Barr-virus-positive T cell lymphoproliferative disease. On reviewing the literature we found only 14 similar cases, all presenting with very aggressive clinical courses and requiring extensive phenotyping and molecular techniques for final diagnosis.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Though extremely rare, this disease can occur in Europe, and a comprehensive diagnostic approach is thus recommended in all case of Epstein-Barr-virus-positive lymphoproliferative disorders. Unfortunately, at present no specific treatment is available; however, prompt administration of anti- Epstein-Barr virus treatment and rapid attempts to control the hemophagocytic syndrome are indicated.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Primary infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is commonly asymptomatic, but some children, adolescents and young adults develop infectious mononucleosis \\[ 1 \\] (IM), a benign febrile disease characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and increase of activated CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T lymphocytes in peripheral blood \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. However, exceptionally, younger patients can develop a very aggressive form, referred to in the past as 'fulminant infectious mononucleosis' or 'fatal haemophagocytic syndrome'. The disorder is characterized by rapid deterioration in previously healthy children, secondary to acute primary EBV infection; this syndrome is accompanied by high fever, skin rash, pulmonary infiltrate, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, haemophagocytic syndrome, and coagulopathy \\[ 3 \\]. Unfortunately, patients commonly die within a few weeks of diagnosis.\n\n【10】In addition, EBV is implicated in the pathogenesis of different types of lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD), which are related to diverse immune alterations or peculiar clinical backgrounds \\[ 4 \\]. Typically, EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders are derived from B cells, such as Hodgkin disease and Burkitt lymphoma, where memory B cells are the physiological reservoir of latent EBV \\[ 1 \\]. Nonetheless, rare EBV-driven T cell tumors have been recognized.\n\n【11】In this regard, fulminant mononucleosis has recently been demonstrated to be a monoclonal CD8 <sup>+ </sup> LPD, and is currently classified as systemic EBV+ T cell LPD of childhood in the World Health Organization classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues \\[ 5 \\]. This entity is a rare clonal proliferation of EBV-infected T cells with an activated cytotoxic phenotype \\[ 5 \\]; the disease occurs with increased frequency in immunocompetent children and young adults, appears to be more common in Asians and Native Americans, and is associated with rapid progression, high morbidity and mortality. It can develop after primary EBV infection or in association with chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV). Despite the name, the disease occurs not only in children but in adolescent and young adults as well, the median age being around 20 years \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【12】At morphology, neoplastic T cells are usually small and lack significant cytological atypia \\[ 6 \\]. However, cases with pleomorphic medium-sized to large-sized lymphoid cells, irregular nuclei and frequent mitoses have been described. The most typical phenotype is CD2 <sup>+ </sup> , CD3 <sup>+ </sup> , CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , CD56 <sup>- </sup> , and TIA <sup>+ </sup> \\[ 6 – 8 \\]; conversely, cases arising in the setting of severe CAEBV are CD4 <sup>+ </sup> . Neoplastic cells have monoclonally rearranged T cell receptor ( _TCR_ ) genes, and consistent Epstein-Barr encoded RNA (EBER) positivity at _in situ_ hybridization (ISH). Differential diagnosis mainly concerns reactive conditions as well as aggressive natural killer (NK) cell leukemia.\n\n【13】Here, we report the clinicopathological features of fulminant T-LPD that arose in the setting of acute primary EBV infection in our patient, characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected T cells.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 23-year-old Caucasian man was hospitalized for persisting fever resistant to conventional therapies. On physical examination, our patient presented with marked hepatosplenomegaly and abnormal sounds at thoracic auscultation. Laboratory findings consisted of severe pancytopenia (hemoglobin 9.3 g/dL, platelets 93 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, white blood cells 2.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, neutrophils 410 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, lymphocytes 1.570 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L), increased LDH, signs of disseminated intra-vascular coagulopathy (CID), and anti-EBV IgM positivity, while a chest X-ray showed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. No prior immunological abnormalities were recorded.\n\n【16】For the suspicion of either massive bone marrow infiltration by leukemia/lymphoma or hemophagocytic syndrome a bone marrow biopsy was performed. Results from the biopsy showed the bone marrow was hypercellular, with numerous atypical lymphoid cells and occasional hemophagocytes (identified by positive staining for CD68/PGM1) (Figure 1 ). Lymphocytes were more often small and without significant atypia; a smaller percentage was represented by larger cells (Figures 1 and 2 ). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) investigation results showed atypical lymphocytes were CD79a <sup>- </sup> , CD3 <sup>+ </sup> , CD2 <sup>+ </sup> , CD8 <sup>+ </sup> and TIA1 <sup>+ </sup> (Figure 2 ). ISH for EBER demonstrated that the majority of lymphoid cells were positive (Figure 2 ). Finally, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of the _TCRγ_ genes. IHC, ISH and molecular analyses were carried out as previously described \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【17】**Figure 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Pathological findings on lymph node biopsy** . Giemsa, Ki67 and CD68 immunostains are shown. Arrows indicate atypical cells (GM) as well as eritrophagocytic syndrome (CD68).\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Pathological findings on lymph node biopsy** . CD3, CD8, CD56, TIA1 immunostains and Epstein-Barr encoded RNA (EBER) _in situ_ hybridization are shown.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Based on the above findings, a final diagnosis of systemic EBV+ T cell LPD of childhood was made. Our patient was initially treated with two sequential doses of VP16 with moderate improvement of his clinical and laboratory data. In particular, the fever transiently improved, hepatosplenomegaly was reduced, and coagulation parameters were partially corrected; however, severe peripheral blood cytopenia persisted. Soon after, the patient developed a fever recrudescence in association with pulmonary fungal infection.\n\n【26】A second bone marrow biopsy was performed, revealing (hypo)aplasia with a minimum percentage of CD79a <sup>- </sup> , CD3 <sup>+ </sup> , CD4 <sup>- </sup> , CD8 <sup>+ </sup> , EBER <sup>- </sup> small lymphocytes and absence of the previously observed CD8 <sup>+ </sup> large cells. VP16 was then replaced with cyclosporine, obtaining a white blood cell count increase and a further decline of splenomegaly, but with no improvement in thrombocytopenia. A third bone marrow biopsy showed an increased cellularity with reappearance of numerous CD8 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes and evident hemophagocytosis.\n\n【27】Our patient then developed rectal hemorrhages only treatable with surgery, which turned out to be sustained by microvascular thrombosis on histological examination. Finally, after a short period of relative good health, our patient had a relapse of rectal bleeding and died soon after with cerebral manifestations.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Systemic EBV+ T cell LPD of childhood is a rare disorder characterized by an aggressive disease course and dismal prognosis \\[ 5 \\]. As death unfortunately often occurs within a few weeks, and at present there is no specific treatment, a prompt diagnosis is necessary. Our case report highlights the fact that, though rare, such a disease can occur also in Europe.\n\n【30】On reviewing the literature, we found only 14 cases reported in Western countries \\[ 6 , 11 – 14 \\], specifically cases recorded in Europe and the USA (Table 1 ). Interestingly, the majority of cases have been reported in eastern Asia \\[ 5 \\], specifically in Japan and Taiwan. The geographical distribution has been suggested to indicate possible genetically determined defects in T cell responses to EBV in certain populations.\n\n【31】**Table 1 Cases of systemic Epstein-Barr virus positive (EBV <sup>+ </sup> ) T cell lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) of childhood described in Western countries**\n\n【32】Full size table\n\n【33】Our review of Western cases showed that four of those 14 patients developed a T cell LPD after CAEBV infection \\[ 6 , 11 \\], and 10 presented a fulminant EBV T cell LPD following acute EBV infection. In the former group, ethnic origin was specified only in one case (white); in the latter group, one patient was of Caucasian descent, four were Asian or Native American, while in five cases the ethnic group was not specified. Mean age at onset was 17 years and the male/female ratio was 2.3:1. Common symptoms were fever, hepatosplenomegaly and hematophagocytic syndrome; the clinical courses were fulminant in patients with T cell LPD after acute IM. In particular, in the acute IM group three cases had a CD8 <sup>+ </sup> phenotype, two a CD4 <sup>+ </sup> phenotype and one showed double positivity for CD8 and CD4; in one case phenotype was not interpretable and in three cases it was not reported. _TCR_ α presented with clonal rearrangements in nine out of 10 patients and EBV genome was clonal in all but one case. In contrast, among patients with T cell LPD after CAEBV infection two were CD4 <sup>+ </sup> , one was CD45RO <sup>+ </sup> and one presented with an admixture of CD8 <sup>+ </sup> and CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes; three cases presented with monoclonal patterns with regard to rearrangement of both _TCR_ α genes and EBV genome. In the remaining case, only the EBV positivity was assessed.\n\n【34】In all described cases, an accurate diagnostic investigation including clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses was necessary in order to formulate a correct diagnosis. In particular, the differential diagnosis with aggressive NK cell leukemia was based on surface sCD3 and CD8 positivity, CD56 negativity, and evidence of _TCR_ α rearrangement in systemic EBV <sup>+ </sup> T cell LPDs, and also sCD3/CD8 negativity, CD56 positivity and germline _TCR_ α patterns in aggressive NK cell leukemia cases.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】In conclusion, our case report underlines the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach in the management of atypical EBV <sup>+ </sup> LPDs. In fact, though, at present, specific therapies are not available, the correct description of rare disorders is essential for improving current knowledge and possibly future therapeutic approaches.\n\n【37】Consent\n-------\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

{"seq_id": "7f5db58b-727b-4eff-ab95-b0f47e0fd352", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】When encountering solid pancreatic lesions, nonpancreatic primary metastases are rare and differentiating a metastasis from a primary neoplastic lesion is challenging. The clinical presentation and radiologic features can be similar and the possibility of a pancreatic metastasis should be considered when the patient refers to a history of a different primary cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound offers a key anatomical advantage in accessing the pancreas and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has become the gold standard method for diagnosing pancreatic lesions.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 58-year-old white Hispanic woman with a history of uveal malignant melanoma, presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. On admission, laboratory tests were performed (her total bilirubin was 6.37 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 5.30 mg/dL). Cross-sectional, abdominal computed tomography with contrast, showed a low-attenuating lesion localized in the pancreatic head (measuring 4 × 3 cm) and a thinner section of the distal bile duct suspicious for compression. Our patient was scheduled for an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration to establish a diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a solid, hypoechoic, well-defined lesion with regular contours (measuring 3.17 × 2.61 cm), localized between the head and neck of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed with a 22G needle and cytology confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Our patient subsequently underwent right orbital exenteration, followed by duodenopancreatectomy without complications. At the moment our patient is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at an outside oncology clinic.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】To the best of our knowledge, this is a very rare presentation of an ocular malignant melanoma with an isolated pancreatic metastasis causing symptomatic biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has proven to be the best method to diagnose solid pancreatic lesions. In this particular case, cytology was essential in confirming the diagnosis and guiding the most adequate therapy, which was a pancreatic resection, ocular exenteration of the melanoma, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Malignant pancreatic lesions generally arise from the gland itself. Nonpancreatic primary metastases are rare but usually seen in patients with widely metastatic disease \\[ 1 \\]. The frequency of this finding is variable, from 4.5 % in case series up to 11 % in data from autopsies. Isolated pancreatic metastasis can be found in only 2 % of cases \\[ 2 – 4 \\].\n\n【10】The most common malignancies that metastasize to the pancreas are: renal, lung, breast, and colon cancer, followed by sarcoma and melanoma \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Malignant melanoma commonly metastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, autopsy-derived data demonstrates that 50 to 60 % of metastatic malignant melanoma patients can have gastrointestinal metastases but the clinical diagnosis is made only in 1.5 to 4.4 % of patients \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【11】Metastatic malignant melanoma usually affects multiple sites. Isolated organ metastases are unusual and isolated pancreatic metastases are extremely rare. Uveal malignant melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy. The majority of patients present with visual complaints, but as part of their primary workup, abdominal cross-sectional imaging should be performed since the primary metastatic location is the liver, in over 90 % of cases \\[ 8 \\]. We found only one case report of a patient with metastatic uveal melanoma where the lesion spread to the gallbladder and head of the pancreas \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【12】Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides us with high-quality images to look at the pancreas and nearby structures and the linear array echo endoscope has a working channel that allows us to accurately target different areas of the pancreas with minimal trauma to surrounding tissues. For this reason, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is now the gold standard method for sampling the pancreas. In the particular case of pancreatic metastasis, EUS-FNA has shown to be very useful, since establishing a diagnosis with cross-sectional imaging alone is not possible and this method offers the advantage of real-time tissue acquisition for diagnostic confirmation. This is of particular importance for identifying adequate surgical candidates, for avoiding unnecessary surgeries, and helping triage nonsurgical patients for less invasive procedures \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【13】Since this is a rare finding, there is a scarce amount of data addressing the surgical management of these pancreatic metastases. Patients who have isolated nonpancreatic primary metastases have shown to have excellent surgical outcomes and long-term survival can be achieved in patients who have these lesions resected \\[ 4 , 12 , 13 \\].\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】This is the case of a 58-year-old white Hispanic woman with a history of uveal melanoma in her right eye (Fig. 1 ). She was admitted to the hospital with jaundice and abdominal pain for 10 days. On admission, laboratory tests were obtained (a complete blood count was within normal limits, amylase: 136 U/L, total bilirubin: 6.37 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 5.30 mg/dL). Cross-sectional, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast, showed a low-attenuating lesion localized in the pancreatic head (measuring 4 × 3 cm) and a thinner section of the distal bile duct suspicious for compression).\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Right eye uveal melanoma showing dark brown pigments with diffuse extrascleral extension\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】After a multidisciplinary meeting, our patient was scheduled for EUS-FNA. EUS showed a solid, heteroechoic with predominantly hypoechoic areas, well-defined lesion with regular contours (measuring 3.1 × 2.6 cm), localized between the head and neck of the pancreas (Fig. 2 ). There was no vascular or lymph node invasion identified.

Immunohistochemistry was positive for Melan-A, HMB45, vimentin, S-100 protein and negative for cytokeratin, all consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma. At the moment, our patient is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at an outside oncology clinic.\n\n【31】**Fig. 4**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】Surgical specimen after duodenopancreatectomy\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】Most of the solid pancreatic tumors are primary in origin and nonprimary pancreatic metastases are very rare \\[ 1 \\], with just a few reported cases in the literature. The most common primary locations are kidney, lung, and breast \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In this particular case, we identified a patient with a previous uveal melanoma that had an isolated pancreatic metastasis.\n\n【37】In general, over 50 % of patients with pancreatic metastases are discovered incidentally during imaging studies, only the minority of patients with pancreatic metastases present with symptoms of malignant biliary obstruction (jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss) making this a challenging clinical scenario \\[ 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【38】When evaluating solid pancreatic lesions, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and EUS are very sensitive diagnostic methods, however, EUS allows for sampling, making this the preferred method to secure a diagnosis \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【39】Studies have reported a sensitivity of 87–100 % using endoscopic ultrasound in detecting solid pancreatic lesions. Also, provides a high negative predictive value in ruling out pancreatic masses in the case these are not identified by EUS. \\[ 16 \\]. When compared to CT, MRI and EUS have a better performance in detecting small lesions, especially if they are less than 3 mm in diameter both within the pancreas and in the duodenal wall \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【40】As for the appearance of pancreatic metastasis in EUS, they are hypoechoic and usually are well-defined with regular margins, \\[ 6 \\] with similar characteristics to neuroendocrine tumors \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【41】To be able to distinguish a primary pancreatic tumor from a nonpancreatic metastasis, pancreatic sampling is critical. Aspirates of melanoma are cellular and consist of discohesive malignant-appearing cells with nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli. The admixture of malignant epithelioid and spindle-shaped cells and the presence of melanin pigment are helpful clues to establishing the diagnosis. Confirmatory immunostaining was demonstrating immunoreactivity for some or all of melanoma markers, such as S100, HMB-45, Melan-A and micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), can be used to aid the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【42】This case report illustrates an interesting and rare clinical scenario of nonpancreatic primary metastases from uveal malignant melanoma causing malignant biliary obstruction. That was conclusively proven using EUS-FNA.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【44】Uveal malignant melanoma is the most common intraocular malignancy and it commonly metastasizes to the liver, in over 90 % of cases. This is a rare case report of an isolated nonpancreatic primary metastases. EUS-FNA is the gold standard method to characterize and diagnose solid pancreatic lesions, making this an invaluable tool to help guide the clinical management and decide a patient’s surgical candidacy. In carefully selected cases, the resection of isolated nonpancreatic primary metastases has shown to have good outcomes and improve the survival of these patients.\n\n【45】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【46】CT:\n\n【47】computed tomography\n\n【48】EUS:\n\n【49】endoscopic ultrasound\n\n【50】EUS-FNA:\n\n【51】endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration\n\n【52】MRI:\n\n【53】magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The anatomical and physiological processes of the biliary system are reviewed. Failure is defined as an abnormality caused by infective, inflammatory, obstructive, malignancy, autoimmune and other pathological processes. The potential failures, their effect(s), main clinical features, and investigation that can help a clinician to diagnose at each anatomical part and physiological process are reviewed and documented in a modified failure mode and effects analysis table.

The table is the backbone and framework for further expansion. Reviewing and updating the table is an iterative and continual process. The relevant clinical features in the modified failure mode and effects analysis are then extracted and included in the relevant Ishikawa diagram.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】This article illustrates an application of engineering methodology in medicine, and it sows the seeds of potential cross-pollination between engineering and medicine. Establishing a modified failure mode and effects analysis can be a teamwork project or self-directed learning process, or a mix of both. Modified failure mode and effects analysis can be deployed to obtain inputs for an Ishikawa diagram which in turn can be used to enhance clinical experiences and clinical reasoning skills for clinicians, medical educators, and students.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Main text\n---------\n\n【11】Clinicians, medical educators, and medical students use various clinical reasoning tools such as Ishikawa diagram (which is also known as “cause-and-effect diagram”) to enhance their clinical experience and reasoning skills. The methodology of applying an Ishikawa diagram in a clinical setting is illustrated in another article \\[ 1 \\]. The methods that can be applied to gather information for an Ishikawa diagram include brain storming, focus group discussion, interview, survey, and literature searches and review are discussed in a book chapter \\[ 2 \\]. This article illustrates how to modify and apply failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to provide inputs into an Ishikawa diagram which in turn can be used as a clinical reasoning tool.\n\n【12】FMEA is a tool developed by engineers to systematically assess a complex design or process in order to identify elements that have a risk of failure \\[ 3 \\]. In the late 1940s, FMEA was established and deployed by reliability engineers to identify potential failures in military systems \\[ 4 \\]. Simplistically, the FMEA approach includes a meticulous study on the mode or mechanism by which a failure may occur and the effect(s) that it may cause. The severity of the effect (S), the probability of a failure occurring (O), and the probability that the failure would not be detected (D), are computed or estimated. Then, a risk priority number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying S, O, and D. The RPN is then used to prioritize the remedial and/or preventive measures. The FMEA approach is an ongoing iterative process. It should be updated when there is a change in the process or design, or when there is a failure or when a near-miss failure occurs. The ultimate objective of an FMEA is to provide a platform for the prevention, or at least reduce the likelihood and improve the detection, of failure in a system.\n\n【13】How can I relate this engineering approach to an application in medicine? In this article, failure is defined as an abnormality caused by infective, inflammatory, obstructive, malignancy, autoimmune and other pathological processes. I may not be able to relate the FMEA approach to the entirety of a complex human being with multidimensional complexities including psychosocial components, when an individual presents with a clinical manifestation (that is, a “failure”). Nonetheless, I am illustrating an application of the FMEA approach to a specific subsystem in a human. The “design or anatomy” of a human body and its underlying physiological processes have a potential risk of failing at its various parts anatomically and physiologically. The effect(s) of the failure could be manifested as clinical features (symptoms and signs). The severity, occurrence, and detection of the failure are complex and difficult to be estimated to compute a RPN. Hence, I am excluding RPN in this FMEA approach which I call a “modified FMEA” (in short, mFMEA). The ultimate objective of mFMEA is to provide a methodology to clinicians, medical educators, and medical students, to integrate in their clinical reasoning process and to deploy relevant clinical cases to set the scenario for teaching and learning a specific topic.\n\n【14】The mFMEA approach is applicable for general practitioners (GPs)/family physicians, specialists in various fields (internal medicine, surgery, emergency, intensive care, and so on), medical educators, and medical students. The bottom line is that a patient will always present with symptoms and signs (clinical features or syndromes) that need to be analyzed and put in perspective in an individualized context. An experienced clinician such as a physician or specialist may reach a spot diagnosis or provisional diagnosis, and manage the patient accordingly in a reasonably efficient timeframe. In an experienced diagnostician, the clinical reasoning and diagnostic skill seem to have become second nature to him/her, and the skills may not be explicit to an observer. However, a junior clinician or medical student may start from the first principle to work out a list of differential diagnoses using various clinical reasoning tools such as brain storming, mind mapping, and the Ishikawa diagram/fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram \\[ 1 \\]. For example, if a patient presents with a main complaint of pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen, a clinician will have a list of differential diagnoses including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, hepatitis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, and referred pain. These can be illustrated in an Ishikawa diagram (Fig. 1 ) which is subject to ongoing update. The Ishikawa diagram comprises “gastroenterology”, “other systems”, and “miscellaneous”. The biliary system is a branch under “gastroenterology”. The Ishikawa diagram will be continually expanded and refined based on other associated symptoms in the individualized context of the patient. Then, one may ask how a mFMEA approach would fit in a clinical setting. A mFMEA can provide inputs into an Ishikawa diagram. Once you have listed the common causes in an Ishikawa diagram via brainstorming, discussion, or self-directed learning process, you turn to mFMEA to explore the potential causes of the human biliary system (Fig. 1 ). I would like to elaborate this in the following paragraphs.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】An Ishikawa diagram for a main presenting complaint of “abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant”. _mFMEA_ modified failure mode and effects analysis\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】An English scientist, Richard Dawkins, once said, “Biology is the study of complicated things that have the appearance of having been designed with a purpose.” The notable quote underpins many biological and physiological processes within a human body; for example, the human biliary system. When we review the anatomical and physiological processes of the biliary system, we should ask “what is the potential failure and its effect(s)”, “the associated main clinical features”, and “investigations that can help a clinician to diagnose” at each anatomical part and physiological process, and document them in a mFMEA table (Table 1 ). The mFMEA table comprises six columns: “Anatomy and physiology”, “Potential failure or pathophysiological process”, “Effects of the failure”, “Main clinical features (symptoms and signs)”, “Investigation”, and “Note”. We can start with common knowledge found in the medical literature, and then proceed to search and extract the relevant medical and surgical cases (generally known as clinical cases in this article) to fill the mFMEA table. Establishing a mFMEA can be a teamwork project or a self-directed learning process, or a mix of teamwork followed by self-directed learning to continually update it.\n\n【20】**Table 1 A modified failure mode and effects analysis of the human biliary system**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】For example, the human biliary system is used for illustration (Table 1 ). Firstly, review the major anatomy and physiology of the biliary system, and list them in the first column. The anatomical figure of the biliary system (Fig. 2 ) will be helpful to provide visual cues to the physiological process. At each anatomical part or physiological process, we should explore what can be the potential failure or pathophysiological process, the corresponding effect(s), the resulting clinical features (symptoms and signs), investigation that can help a clinician to diagnose (in addition to the patient’s clinical history and physical examination), and special note. The treatment is not included in the table because the treatment option is dependent on the context of each individual. The note column is used for highlighting a key message or reminder, for example the authors of the case of clonorchiasis encourage clinicians to consider clonorchiasis or opisthorchiasis infection a possible diagnosis for all undiagnosed abdominal pain because the infection has the propensity to cause hepatic fibrosis, liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma \\[ 5 \\]. Also, the “note” column can be used to record citation of relevant new or additional cases (see Table 1 ).\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】The human biliary system. Image courtesy of Visible Body ( www.visiblebody.com )\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Let us walk through the steps to establish a mFMEA in Table 1 . You may refer to Table 1 and the references for citations of the relevant cases. Starting from the gallbladder, we have already known its common “potential failures” such as cholecystitis, cholecystolithiasis, and gallbladder cancer. By searching the medical literature, I have found some other failures such as gallbladder perforation, herniation, and torsion. The associated effects of the failures include obstruction, necrosis, and hernia. The main clinical features range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain with or without jaundice. The relevant investigations include abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).\n\n【28】In the cystic duct and common bile duct, obstruction (caused by gallstone or cancer) and infection are two common potential failures. In the hepatic duct (intrahepatic and extrahepatic duct), the potential failures include obstruction, infection, abscess, cancer, congenital-related abnormality, for example Caroli’s disease (congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts), choledochal cyst, and biliary atresia, immune-mediated destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts (primary biliary cirrhosis), intense inflammatory fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis), immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related cholangitis, and abnormality in the genes encoding for the bile canaliculi formation (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis). In addition to abdominal pain with or without jaundice, other symptoms and signs include systemic features such as fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, fatigue, pruritus, steatorrhea, dark urine, and hepatosplenomegaly. Other investigations include liver function test, liver biopsy, antimitochondrial antibody, and serum IgG4 level according to the context of the patient.\n\n【29】In the process of bile synthesis, conjugation, and transport, the potential failures are broadly categorized into Gilbert syndrome, Crigler–Najjar syndrome, Dubin–Johnson syndrome, and Rotor syndrome. The clinical features range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain with or without jaundice. The investigations include special genetic tests, liver biopsy, and urinary coproporphyrin level, and plasma sulfobromophthalein depending on the clinical history of the patient.\n\n【30】Other anatomical parts that relate to the biliary system include portal vein, hepatic artery, hepatic vein, sphincter of Oddi, ampulla of Vater, and the pancreas. The potential failures include iatrogenic injury from surgical procedure, thrombosis, spasm, stenosis, and cancer. The clinical features include Courvoisier sign, legs edema, ascites, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Special investigations include Doppler ultrasound of the suprahepatic and cava veins, abdominal CT and angiography, and sphincter of Oddi manometry.\n\n【31】The relevant potential failures of the hematological process, which is not restricted to a particular anatomical structure, include glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and hereditary spherocytosis. These abnormalities result in excessive hemolysis of red blood cells leading to hyperbilirubinemia. The clinical features include anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and kernicterus (in serious cases). The special investigations include serum G6PD level, genetic test, peripheral blood smear, and spherocyte osmotic fragility test.\n\n【32】An example of endocrinological condition has been reported in the New England Journal of Medicine - A patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus has excessive glucose in the blood leading to an increase in glycogen storage in the liver and inhibition of glycogenolysis resulting in glycogenic hepatopathy. The condition is manifested as hepatomegaly and pain in the RUQ of the abdomen.\n\n【33】After establishing the mFMEA in Table 1 , I can update the relevant Ishikawa diagram for “pain in the RUQ of the abdomen” (Fig. 1 ) to include the detailed inputs for the “biliary pathology” as shown in Fig. 3 .\n\n【34】**Fig. 3**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】An Ishikawa diagram for a main presenting complaint of “abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant” with inputs from a modified failure mode and effects analysis. _mFMEA_ modified failure mode and effects analysis\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】There are many sources of clinical cases such as:\n\n【39】*   _Journal of Medical Case Reports_\n    \n*   _BMJ Case Reports_\n    \n*   _New England Journal of Medicine_\n    \n*   Many other BioMed Central Open Access journals, for example _BMC Surgery_\n    \n\n【40】How to keep a mFMEA table up to date.\n\n【41】*   Set automatic notification when a relevant research or medical case report is published, for example setting a “search alert” in _Journal of Medical Case Reports_ . This can be easily done by using the advanced search function, perform your search, and save the search history that you want to activate “search alert”. You can always go back to your “saved searches” to refine your search algorithm.\n    \n*   Review an article and evaluate whether it fits into an anatomical or physiological part in a specific mFMEA, for example the biliary system. If a clinical case adds new findings in terms of pathophysiological process, unique clinical features, or investigation method, it should be added into the relevant columns in the mFMEA. This mFMEA process will collate and enrich the body of evidence for a specific clinical condition over time.\n    \n*   You may attach a copy of the case report in the citation as a file attachment in an electronic database such as EndNote software. This will provide handy access to the references.\n    \n*   The relevant main clinical features in the mFMEA, for example RUQ pain (or abdominal pain) can be extracted and reflected in the relevant Ishikawa diagram (see Figs. 1 and 3 )\n    \n\n【42】Advantages of weaving clinical cases into a mFMEA.\n\n【43】*   mFMEA is a methodology that collates common, important, and critical (but rare) potential causes of a clinical condition.\n    \n*   Studying clinical cases can reinforce clinicians’ reasoning and diagnostic skills, and clinical experience.\n    \n*   Clinicians may not have the opportunity to be involved in caring for patients with various potential “failure modes” of a clinical condition. Studying clinical cases and weaving them into a mFMEA will provide the opportunity to substantiate the lack of experience.\n    \n*   Medical educators can select relevant clinical cases from a mFMEA to set the scenario for teaching a relevant topic.\n    \n*   Medical educators should encourage medical students to attempt the approach of identifying the potential pathophysiology and diagnosis before providing the answer. It is acceptable to err in role playing the clinical case, and learn from the errors!\n    \n*   Interactive teaching and learning using clinical cases are more engaging and interesting compared to sole didactic teaching.\n    \n*   Medical educators can relate the clinical cases to a relevant Ishikawa diagram and mFMEA.\n    \n*   GPs/family physicians may use a mFMEA to identify and manage critical but rare conditions. They may not need to go into the details of certain pathophysiological processes which may not be relevant to their role as a GP/family physician, for example different types of gallbladder herniation. By contrast, surgeons could be interested to find out the various gallbladder herniations and surgical interventions reported in the literature to compare and enhance their clinical experiences.\n    \n\n【44】Concluding remarks\n------------------\n\n【45】The mFMEA can be deployed as a tool to generate inputs for an Ishikawa diagram. Clinicians may apply the tool in their clinical reasoning process; while medical educators may select relevant clinical cases to set the scenarios to teach and facilitate a discussion among medical students, and relate the clinical cases back into a relevant mFMEA and Ishikawa diagram.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Our sample may represent an unknown, novel genotype. Surveillance and regulating the immune state may represent a valuable approach for this rare disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is commonly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). There are four different epidemiological forms of the disease—classic, endemic, iatrogenic and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated. Classic Kaposi sarcoma (CKS) is a low-grade malignant tumor derived from the vascular endothelial cells, and is more common in Mediterranean elderly men aged 50 to 80 years \\[ 1 \\]. It is characterized by indolent clinical behavior and often causes skin damage at the end of the lower extremities, with less visceral damage \\[ 2 \\]. The disease is associated with ethnic and geographic background \\[ 3 \\]. In China, CKS cases are rare and have been reported in the Xinjiang region and Taiwan \\[ 4 \\]. There are reports that the prevalence of KSHV and incidence of CKS are high among people of Uygur ethnicity in Xinjiang \\[ 3 \\]. Here, we followed a CKS case for 7 years in a patient of Miao ethnic background in southwestern China.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 63-year-old Miao (southwestern China) man was initially diagnosed with CKS in April 2010, with a history of limb lesions for 37 years and left eyelid and binaural lesions for 9 years. The patient was a farmer who had been living in Zhijin County of Guizhou Province for many years. He had been abstaining from alcohol for 10 years and continued smoking. His test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative, with no associated immunodeficiency and no special family or psychosocial history. He denied having sexual contact with men. Routine laboratory tests were all normal. The vital signs were found to be stable. Examination of the skin showed multiple blue and purplish red patches and nodules varying in size from 1 to 4 cm, affecting the upper left eyelid, the bilateral auricle, limbs, hands and forefoot (Fig. 1 a–c). Pathological biopsy of the right foot skin tissue suggested proliferation of fusiform cells and endothelial cells, with extravasation of red blood cells and intervening slit-like spaces (Fig. 2 a).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Dynamic changes in the rash in this patient.

Histology and immunohistochemistry show positivity for CD31, CD34, D2-40 and Ki67 ( **c** , **d** , **e** , **f** )\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Several months later, he presented with lumbago and fever, and spinal tuberculosis in the lumbar vertebra was highly suspected after computed tomography scan (CT) in December 2010. Bone destruction at the upper and lower edges of the lumbar vertebra and the superior border of the sacrum was reported (Fig. 3 a–d). Physical examination showed stiffness in the physiological curvature of the spine and limited movement, along with decreased pain in both lower extremities, positive straight leg raising test, positive strength test of both lower extremities, positive for bilateral Thomas sign, positive for strong reflexes in both knees, negative for reflexes in left and right ankle joints, and positive for Babinski sign. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 96 mm/hour (normal range 0–15 mm/hour), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 209.40 mg/L (normal range 0.00–8.00 mg/L). Diagnostic treatment with isoniazid (300 mg/day) and rifampicin (450 mg/day) for 4 weeks showed poor efficacy, and skin lesions increased with fever (Fig. 1 d–f). He refused to continue taking antituberculosis drugs and returned home to recuperate. The patient's systemic symptoms resolved spontaneously after 3 months.\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Dynamic changes in the lumbar vertebra on computed tomography (CT) scan.

Laboratory investigations showed no abnormality with the exception of a slight elevation of the blood immunoglobulin G (IgG) to 17.6 g/L (normal range 11.51–14.22 g/L). The pathological examination of the skin lesions on the right foot again showed that the fissure-like blood vessels, erythrocyte extravasation and spindle cells were reduced, and the deposition of hemosiderin was increased (Fig. 2 b). Immunohistochemistry test results were positive for CD31, CD34 and D2-40(+); Ki67 was 20% positive (Fig. 2 c–f). A serology test for HHV-8 was negative. The open reading frame (ORF)-K1 of KSHV from skin tissue of the foot was amplified and sequenced \\[ 4 \\]. The sequence of our sample (JYP 2016) was compared to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to confirm its identity and to infer its relationship with related species using the Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) program and MrBayes version 3.1.2 Bayesian inference (BI) analysis, respectively \\[ 5 \\]. Based on the data analysis, the sequence was inferred as belonging to subtype A, and may represent an unknown genotype (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】A timeline of the patient's disease progression\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】The patient was followed up by telephone in December 2020, and the general situation was fine. The rash was slightly smaller in scope and lighter in color than before, accompanied by occasional itching, but no special discomfort was reported and no treatment was given. The patient is still being followed up. The timeline of his disease progression is show in Fig. 5 .\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】Consensus phylogram (50% majority rule) resulting from maximum likelihood and MrBayes analysis of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) open reading frame (ORF)-K1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence alignment, with the confidence values of bootstrap analysis above branches (> 50%). Genotypes are individually labeled\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【36】In this case, the diagnosis of CKS was confirmed based on clinical and pathological features and a positive HHV-8 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test of the cutaneous lesion. To our knowledge, this case from Guizhou Province in southwestern China is the first reported CKS patient of Miao ethnic background in the world.\n\n【37】There is still no standard treatment for CKS; however, the community agrees that the management should focus on controlling the disease \\[ 6 \\]. The prognosis and choice of treatment normally depend on the type of KS and the global assessment of the patient, in particular the patient's immune status \\[ 7 \\]. The presence of herpesvirus infection and any concomitant changes in the balance of the immune system are well-recognized factors promoting the development of this disease \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Vincenzi _et al_ . described the spontaneous partial regression of non-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-associated, non-drug-induced Kaposi's sarcoma \\[ 12 \\], which provides a potential treatment strategy where close monitoring and regulation of immune status may be a valuable approach in specific cases.\n\n【38】In our patient, the severity of the rash was consistent with the general immune status. When the patient was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis with low back pain, the rash had worsened all over the body. We were unable to verify the presence of tuberculosis due to the lack of evidence in pathology and etiology. We were also not sure whether CKS was responsible for the bone destruction, even though the absence of periosteum reaction and the cystic lesion of osteolytic bone did coincide with the imaging examination of bone destruction of CKS \\[ 13 \\]. The follow-up examination showed that the bone destruction in the patient had improved without special treatment, and the rash tended to resolve. As a result, we assume that a fully competent immune system may play a role in the observed regression of the disease without chemotherapy-induced damage. However, future studies are needed to verify the reliability of this hypothesis, and additional data are required to support close surveillance as a management strategy in this rare disease.\n\n【39】HHV-8 has oncogenic potential, since multiple viral genes could regulate the pathways controlling the switch between latent and lytic replication \\[ 14 \\]. Seven subtypes of KSHV (A, B, C, D, E, F and Z) have been identified and associated with the geographic and ethnic background of patients \\[ 4 , 14 \\]. Isaacs _et al_ . \\[ 15 \\] confirmed that subtypes A5 and B are predominant in South Africa, and A5 may be associated with more extensive disease \\[ 15 \\]. Xinjiang province is considered an endemic KSHV region in China, with higher incidence among adults of Kazak and Uyghur ethnicities. KSHV subtypes in the Xinjiang region include subtypes A and C, and subtypes A is predominant. Our case was identified as subtypes A, and may represent an unreported genotype. Typically, CKS has been predominantly found in elderly Uyghur men over 60 years of age in Xinjiang \\[ 3 \\], but our case represents the first CKS patient of Miao ethnic background reported from inland China. Herpesviruses have been considered to co-evolve with their hosts throughout the evolutionary history of vertebrates. KSHV is an ancient human virus and spread with the migration of its human hosts \\[ 4 \\]. Previous studies suggest that KSHV was introduced to the Xinjiang region along the Silk Road \\[ 4 \\]. However, Miao people have long been isolated in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, which is by no means part of the Silk Road belt and region. Further studies should be launched to elucidate the transmission pathway, the epidemiological pattern and the clinical relevance of KSHV infection in inland China.\n\n【40】In conclusion, the special genetic background of this case and the follow-up observational strategy in this study may provide a new perspective for further understanding of this disease. We hypothesize that maintaining a normal immune system, rather than administering chemotherapeutic drugs that disrupt the body's immunity, may play an important role in the outcome of CKS.\n\n【41】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】Data sharing is not applicable to this article, as no data sets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【43】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【44】CKS:\n\n【45】Classic Kaposi sarcoma\n\n【46】HHV-8:\n\n【47】Human herpesvirus 8\n\n【48】KSHV:\n\n【49】Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus\n\n【50】CT:\n\n【51】Computed tomography\n\n【52】ESR:\n\n【53】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【54】CRP:\n\n【55】C-reactive protein\n\n【56】IgG:\n\n【57】Immunoglobulin G", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Three years after its pandemic, we learn more about this novel coronavirus. As we expected, different co-infections with various organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and even fungi, have been reported. However, concurrent infection with two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 strains and cytomegalovirus is extremely unusual. We have only a rudimentary understanding of such co-infections and their long-term consequences for patients with cancer.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An 18-year-old young Iranian adult with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting following a recent history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The patient never experienced respiratory symptoms, and the chest imaging study was normal on admission. His primary laboratory investigation revealed prerenal azotemia and severe abnormal liver function tests (blood urea nitrogen 32 mg/dL, creatinine 1.75 mg/dL, prothrombin time 66 s, partial thromboplastin time 44.5 s, international normalized ratio 5.14, total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin 2.59 mg/dL). Cytomegalovirus disease was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction in his blood and stool samples. The patient’s gastrointestinal signs and symptoms improved shortly after receiving intravenous ganciclovir treatment. His gastrointestinal symptoms continued intermittently for weeks despite maintenance valganciclovir prescription, necessitating frequent hospitalizations. The patient was complicated by the recurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms during the sixth hospitalization, even though he had no respiratory symptoms, and the nasopharyngeal test revealed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 Wuhan strain for the first time. Remdesivir and valganciclovir were administrated due to persistent enteritis and evidence of intestinal tissue invasion by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and cytomegalovirus on multiple intestinal biopsies, which led to partial clinical responses. Cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 fecal shedding continued for more than 6 months despite repeated antiviral therapy, and the Wuhan and Alpha strains were also detected in his nasopharyngeal samples through repeated sampling (confirmed by four nasopharyngeal sampling and multiple stool specimens and several intestinal biopsies). Finally, during the Delta-variant (B.1.617.2) outbreak in Iran, the patient was admitted again with febrile neutropenia and decreased level of consciousness, necessitating respiratory support and mechanical ventilation. During the Delta-variant peak, the patient’s nasopharyngeal sample once more tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The patient died a few days later from cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has encountered patients with cancer with critical diagnostic and treatment challenges. Patients who are immunocompromised may co-infect with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 strains and cytomegalovirus, and even with timely diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis may be poor.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Over time, since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our knowledge regarding pathogenesis, different clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatment, and the various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complications has improved. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is now one of the well-known presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. In addition to the common GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, other GI complications have been described, such as acute hepatitis \\[ 6 \\], hemorrhagic colitis \\[ 7 \\], appendicitis \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\], pancreatitis \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 \\], and dysentery \\[ 14 \\]. GI involvement could be associated with prolonged viral shedding, and fecal specimens may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even 2 weeks after the nasopharynx clearance, especially in those with diarrhea \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. GI symptoms could be continued for up to 3 weeks \\[ 16 , 17 \\], while infected patients may have asymptomatic fecal shedding for a more extended period, even more than 8 weeks \\[ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 \\]. The clinical significance of prolonged fecal excretion of the virus is not well understood; however, affected patients may be implicated in viral transmission \\[ 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. There are few reports on SARS-CoV-2 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infection in the literature \\[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 \\]. Our current knowledge need to improve due to the significant complication of such co-infections \\[ 23 \\]. The odds of fatal COVID-19 outcomes are higher among immunocompromised patients, even those receiving primary vaccination \\[ 25 \\]. Although, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with more common seasonal viral infections such influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenoviruses has been thoroughly investigated \\[ 26 \\], more research should be done on less frequent viral co-infections. This report aims to represent a young adult male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed CMV enteritis concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and original wild-type (Wuhan strain) SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. We also discuss possible mechanisms of CMV reactivation during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Clinical history\n\n【12】On 27 December 2020, an 18-year-old young Iranian adult with a history of ALL who had been undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for more than 18 months and was in remission was admitted to our hospital owing to abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 month before admission and subsequently repeated hospitalization. The patient never developed respiratory symptoms and did not fulfill the criteria for remdesivir treatment on first-time detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) test. The patient chemotherapy regimen consists of monthly vincristine (1.5 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), prednisolone (40 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) 5 days per month, weekly methotrexate (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and 6-mercaptopurine (50 mg) every night. He also received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 400/80 mg twice per day/three times per week for _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ prophylaxis and voriconazole (VCZ) 200 mg twice per day concurrent with his chemotherapy. He has a history of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pan-sinusitis (8 and 4 weeks before admission, respectively). He was hospitalized with severe GI signs and symptoms in another academic hospital (leading to intensive care unit admission) without clinical improvement, leading to self-discharge. On admission, he was febrile (tympanic temperature 38.8 °C). He suffered from nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, oral aphthous lesions, skin rashes, excessive drooling, low appetite, weight loss, and decreased urine output. The results of his primary lab testing are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【13】**Table 1 Laboratory findings of patient coinfected with SARS-CoV-2/CMV on admission and during his admission course**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】On the basis of presenting signs and symptoms, severe abnormal liver function tests, and prerenal azotemia, we considered several differential diagnoses, including sepsis, drug–drug interactions or toxicities \\[methotrexate (MTX), vincristine (VNC), VCZ\\], SARS-CoV-2-induced gastroenteritis, biliary obstruction, portal venous thrombosis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection or VNC-induced veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and, finally, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), given the history of the repeated transfusion (especially non-irradiated blood transfusion). Accordingly, he was worked up for drug–drug interactions. No significant interaction was found except VCZ/VNC. VCZ was withheld and VCZ serum levels were checked for three consecutive days, and all were within therapeutic or subtherapeutic ranges, 0.329 µg/mL, 0.241 µg/mL, and 0.526 µg/mL, respectively. MTX serum level also was checked, which was not in the toxic range (< 0.1 µmol/L), CYP2C19A polymorphism was also checked, which was compatible with homozygote CYP2C19\\*17 alleles (ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype). Serum galactomannan was negative on two occasions \\[0.3 and 0.2 optical density index (ODI)\\]. Given the prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), a mixing test was requested. The mixing test corrected PT, PTT, and INR values in about 2 h. Factor assay was also performed, which showed decreased factor II and X levels, with acceptable factor V levels. On abdominopelvic ultrasonographic (US) study, the liver was normal in size with diffusely increased parenchymal echogenicity compatible with fatty liver change grade 2. Color Doppler sonography (CDS) of mesenteric and portal veins was done to investigate chemotherapy-induced VOD, which was normal.\n\n【16】When leukemia was diagnosed, the patient’s primary investigations revealed that he was CMV seropositive. Accordingly, a CMV blood PCR test was performed to check for CMV reactivation. The high viral load \\[98,500 copies/mL; cycle threshold (CT) 29\\] was suggestive of a significant CMV viremia. Stool was assessed for CMV by PCR because of hepatic impairment (abnormal liver function tests) and GI signs and symptoms. A fecal sample showed extremely high viral shedding (295,480,000 copies/mL; CT: 25). So, the patient was investigated for the possibility of disseminated CMV disease, including CMV encephalitis, despite having no central nervous system (CNS) signs or symptoms due to concurrent CMV viremia and CMV enteritis. CMV was not detected by PCR in CSF and urine specimens. We also investigated SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and stool PCR.\n\n【17】SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and stool RT–PCR also were positive (CT 31 and 24, respectively) for the Alpha strain. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P1 (Gamma) variant’s single-nucleotide deletions were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 by a multiplex PCR using type-specific probes described by Vogels _et al._ (Additional file 1 , Molecular Analysis for SARS-CoV-2 Variants Identification) \\[ 27 \\].\n\n【18】A summary of viral marker test results is presented in Table 1 . The patient’s clinical course timeline and key clinical events during repeated hospitalization are shown in Fig. 1 .\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】The patient’s viral markers status summary during repeated admissions (final admission not shown, see text for more information)\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】The results of his virologic investigation are summarized in Table 2 .

Data extracted from the WHO website last updated on 30 August 2021 (available at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/ir ) and Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education website (available at https://behdasht.gov.ir/ ). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) was first sequenced in September 2020 in the UK and subsequently spread globally ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\\_data/file/959438/Technical\\_Briefing\\_VOC\\_SH\\_NJL2\\_SH2.pdf )\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】The patient was treated with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg/dose Q12 hours as a loading dose) on 29 December 2020 once blood and stool CMV PCR confirmed CMV reactivation. Intragastrointestinal CMV replication was suppressed significantly after 1 week of ganciclovir treatment (stool PCR 20,800 copies/mL with CT 31.5). Blood viral load also decreased gradually up to the low level of detection (97,850, 1200, and 560 copies/mL) on repeated testing. Stool CMV PCR was negative (nondetectable) on follow-up testing in the sixth and seventh weeks of treatment. The patient’s treatment course was continued with oral valganciclovir 450 mg Q12 hours for 4 weeks. He had, however, experienced intermittent GI symptoms for several weeks following that, leading to recurrent hospitalizations. He received a short course of intravenous rehydration therapy (3–7 days) and supplementary electrolytes for correcting hypokalemia and hyponatremia in each admission. On 21 April 2021, a diagnostic rectosigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were carried out, and several biopsies from the right colon, terminal ileum, and rectum were taken. No macroscopic or microscopic abnormality was detected during the operation and immunohistopathologic evaluation. It should be noted that diagnostic rectosigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were postponed several times due to severe coagulopathy, profound neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, in addition to the patient’s self-discharge events from the hospital.\n\n【31】CMV was detected by PCR in all tissue samples. SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and original wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were also found in all three specimens. No specific CMV-cytopathic changes were reported on immunohistopathologic examination (Fig. 3 a–d). The SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal test was also positive for the _Wuhan_ strain (CT 28). On 8 May 2021, the patient was treated with intravenous remdesivir (200 mg as a loading dose and 100 mg daily for 4 days) despite having no respiratory signs or symptoms. All GI manifestations resolved a few days after antiviral treatment, and he was encouraged to undergo close follow-up monitoring.\n\n【32】**Fig. 3**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】**a** Low-power view of the terminal ileum with normal villi without ileitis \\[hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) ×40\\]; **b** higher-power view of the same picture in Fig. 1 .

The patient’s nasopharyngeal specimen tested positive again, and blood and stool CMV PCR also were positive (30,500 and 19,700 copies/mL, respectively). The patient’s chest X-rays revealed bilateral multifocal parenchymal involvement (Fig. 4 ). The patient died after cardiopulmonary arrest on 27 July 2021.\n\n【38】**Fig. 4**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】**a** , **b** The patient’s chest X-ray on his final admission leading to death. **a** Bilateral ground-glass opacities (more prominent in the left lung) on admission day; **b** rapid progressive parenchymal involvement of both lungs 4 days later\n\n【41】Full size image\n\n【42】We also perform immunological workups during the two periods of patient admissions, as shown in Fig. 5 (including the last two admissions where the second was 1 day before the patient died). The patient experienced severe neutropenia in both periods. Analysis of the serum cytokines revealed a similar pattern on two occasions; however, a substantial increase in IL-6 was found during the last admission (2593.5 versus 38 pg/mL) 1 day before the patient died. At this time, IL-17A and IL-17F decreased significantly to the nondetectable values. Analysis of the last lymphocyte immunophenotyping showed that the frequency of CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells was high (92%), whereas the levels of CD3 <sup>− </sup> CD16 <sup>+ </sup> CD56 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes (natural killer cells) as well as B lymphocytes (CD3 <sup>− </sup> CD19 <sup>+ </sup> CD20 <sup>+ </sup> ) were low (2% and 6%, respectively).\n\n【43】**Fig. 5**\n\n【44】 \n\n【45】**a** , **b** The graphs depict variations in the white blood cell counts and immunological factors in the last two periods of patient hospitalization (period 1 and period 2, respectively). Period 2 represents the day before the patient died. **a** White blood cell counts during the last 3 days of each hospitalization period; **b** the patient’s cytokine assay during period 1 and period 2\n\n【46】Full size image\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Here, we discuss a case with ALL that also had co-infection with CMV and two SARS-CoV-2 strains. The patient’s last bone marrow aspiration confirmed that he was in remission. The patient did not have other convincing reasons for the CMV reactivation, including the disease relapse, protocol change, anticancer agent dose intensification, or even nonadherence with chemotherapy treatment. On the other hand, CMV reactivation signs and symptoms (hepatic and gastrointestinal involvement) begin to develop immediately after COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated with ganciclovir due to CMV viremia and CMV enteritis even though he did not match the requirements for remdesivir treatment in the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test because he never developed respiratory symptoms. A nasopharyngeal test for the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain showed up positive on the fifth admission. The patient was treated with remdesivir and valganciclovir for persistent enteritis and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 and CMV invasion of the intestinal tissue.\n\n【49】### SARS-CoV-2 PCR re-positivity and re-infection\n\n【50】Aside from the facts concerning the patient’s clinical condition during repeated admissions, there are some important points regarding interpreting the patient’s repeated positive viral markers.\n\n【51】A positive PCR test within 3 months of past COVID-19 infection in an asymptomatic individual with a CT value higher than 35 is usually considered a PCR re-positivity, and there is no need for respiratory isolation \\[ 28 , 29 \\]. However, all CT values were lower than 35 in our case during more than 6 months of follow-up (Table 2 ), which could be explained by the patient’s immunosuppressed status \\[ 30 \\]. Accordingly, we considered respiratory precautions and isolation in his ambulatory visits and admissions. On the basis of available guidelines, those experiencing atypical clinical courses and having a history of exposure during outbreaks are suspected of re-infection \\[ 28 \\]. So, according to prolonged PCR re-positivity with low CT values and also due to his immunosuppressed status, he was suspected of contracting a new mutant SARS-CoV-2 strain, and he was investigated for other variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.351 (Beta) and P1 (Gamma).\n\n【52】Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain was detected in the patient’s pharyngeal sample. The re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain (CT value 28) is particularly intriguing, given that the patient’s pharyngeal specimen was positive about 16 days earlier with Alpha strain (CT value 21). It is unusual and unreasonable to document a new SARS-CoV-2 strain while the patient has recently had a positive pharyngeal test with another SARS-CoV-2 strain. It is worth noting that, unlike some bacterial strains, such as _Haemophilus influenza_ , which can have pharyngeal colonization for months, documentation of viral infection (such as the flu) in the upper respiratory tract is evidence of acute infection. The simultaneous presence of Wuhan and Alpha SARS-CoV-2 strains (all CT values lower than 35; Table 2 ), in addition to CMV in the patient’s intestinal tissue samples, is also a thought-provoking finding in our patient.\n\n【53】### SARS-CoV-2 GI involvement\n\n【54】Our patient suffers from prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding confirmed by consecutive positive PCR results from his nasopharyngeal and stool specimens for about 6 months. Although prolonged viral shedding is a well-known phenomenon in immunocompromised hosts after COVID-19 infection, it has never been reported for such a long time \\[ 31 , 32 \\]. It should be noticed that the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding in cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer-associated death and comorbidities \\[ 33 \\], as we described in this report.\n\n【55】GI, hepatic, hypercoagulability state, and prerenal azotemia successfully improved within a few days after treatment. Similar clinical presentation of COVID-19 was our main challenge; however, as we discussed here, CMV reactivation is the most probable cause of multiorgan involvement in this case. The possible CMV reactivation mechanisms are also briefly discussed here on the basis of current data regarding CMV reactivation in critically ill patients.\n\n【56】Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the lung cells, esophagus epithelial cells, and absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon \\[ 1 \\]. As a result, GI involvement could occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsen the patient’s outcome \\[ 15 \\]. Diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain are the most common signs and symptoms \\[ 16 \\]. GI involvement may be the sole manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in about 20% of affected individuals \\[ 15 \\]. The most common reported lab findings are elevated liver enzymes (mostly aspartate transaminase), elevated alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and abnormal PT values \\[ 34 \\]. The median time for GI symptom presentation is about 4 days after infection, and may last for up to 2 weeks \\[ 34 \\], although researchers found a shorter course in those with milder COVID phenotypes \\[ 15 \\]. Nonspecific, moderate microvesicular steatosis, mild mixed lobular, focal/portal necrosis, and portal lymphocyte infiltration suggestive of hepatic vascular involvement could be seen on liver histology \\[ 35 \\]. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 shedding may occur in about half of cases \\[ 34 \\], which usually lasts longer than nasopharyngeal viral shedding (about 2 weeks or longer) \\[ 36 \\]. GI manifestations rarely continued for more than 3 weeks \\[ 16 \\]. Altogether, based on the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, intermittent fecal viral shedding, PCR CT values higher than 30 in fecal specimens (in all tested samples), and the too late presentation, the patient’s signs and symptoms could not be attributed to COVID-19.\n\n【57】### Possible CMV reactivation mechanisms in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\n【58】Understanding the likely mechanism of CMV reactivation in SARS-CoV-2 infection is also a debatable issue with considerable importance.\n\n【59】CMV is a genetically diverse large virus with more than 200 open reading frames producing effector proteins, about one-quarter of them committed to CMV replication. It may potentially alter innate and adaptive host immune responses \\[ 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 \\]. There is very little information regarding CMV reactivation mechanisms in the literature. Immediate early (IE) CMV gene, which is expressed by TNF-α stimulation, sepsis-induced immunosuppression, decreased IFN-γ T-cell responses, natural killer (NK) dysfunction, and impaired dendritic cell function all could be attributed to CMV reactivation after sepsis from a bacterial origin \\[ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 \\]. The mechanisms of CMV reactivation during viral infections are much less known. However, elevated TNF-α and cyclic-AMP resulting from pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and stress catecholamine stimulation may play a role \\[ 47 \\]. Finally, the role of T-regulatory/T-helper 17 (Treg/Th17) imbalance has been described previously in the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus reactivation \\[ 48 \\].\n\n【60】On the basis of previous discussions, reactivation of cytomegalovirus may occur through previously known mechanisms in the context of COVID-19 infection. Gastrointestinal endothelial cells could be affected indirectly by lung infection due to immune regulation of the “gut–lung axis” in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of patients with COVID-19. Following SARS-CoV-2 lung infection, CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells infiltrate the infected site and express CCR9 upon stimulation. After that, lung-derived CCR9 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells migrate by the systemic circulation to the small intestine where epithelial cells express CCL25. Interaction between CCR9 and CCL25 is essential for recruiting effector T cells to the intestine \\[ 49 \\]. Upon infiltration of CCR9 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, a disturbance occurs in the intestine flora, affecting the balance between Th17 and regulatory T cells, leading to the increased polarization of Th17 and, consequently, more IL-17A production. IL-17A recruits neutrophils into the intestine, which can cause intestinal immune damage \\[ 50 \\]. As discussed earlier, Treg/Th17 balance is essential in the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus infection. During CMV reactivation/replication, decreased Treg/Th17 ratio could be observed with decreased Treg-related factors and increased Th17-related factors (Fig. 6 ), while in latent infection Treg/Th17 ratio usually increased secondary to robust Treg responses \\[ 48 \\]. Thus, mediators of host immune responses could be affected due to the SARS-CoV-2 leading to the CMV reactivation. However, the hypothesis will require additional investigation through thoughtful _in vitro_ experiments.\n\n【61】**Fig. 6**\n\n【62】 \n\n【63】Suggested cytomegalovirus reactivation mechanism after SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[ 43 , 44 , 45 \\]\n\n【64】Full size image\n\n【65】A few considerations should be considered regarding the justification of the negative cytopathic effect in the histopathologic examination. First, sample biopsies may be taken from the unaffected areas. Second, the likelihood of identifying a cytopathic effect in a critically symptomatic patient with severe diarrhea may be minimal due to the significant mucosal shedding of the injured endothelium. Finally, previous effective antiviral treatment may playing an important role. Despite the absence of the expected cytopathic effect, the extremely high fecal viral load shows extensive GI tract involvement when pathological investigation results are inconclusive. Besides, high-level CMV fecal shedding during CMV viremia without invasive intestinal disease may occur in immunocompromised patients as described previously \\[ 51 , 52 \\].\n\n【66】### Cytokine and biomarker investigation during CMV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in critically ill patient with cancer\n\n【67】We observed that, in contrast to the reduced leukocyte count, the levels of IL-6, which is essential for Th17 differentiation \\[ 53 \\], and IL-22 produced by Th22 and Th17 \\[ 54 \\] increased significantly in the final stages; however, IL-17A and IL-17F secreted by Th17 had the lowest levels. Regarding T-cell exhaustion in viral infections such as CMV and SARS-CoV-2 \\[ 55 , 56 \\], it seems that, besides leukopenia, higher IL-6 levels may also affect T-cell exhaustion and secretion of IL-17 by Th17 cells. So, the Treg/Th17 balance is disturbed at the terminal stages of the CMV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. To confirm bone marrow (BM) remission during the last admission, the patient underwent a trephine bone marrow aspiration/biopsy once more.\n\n【68】CMV co-infection may be fatal in high-risk patients such as transplant recipients \\[ 23 \\]. Prolonged intermittent GI symptoms in leukemic individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic may mimic more severe and prevalent GI illnesses such as GVHD or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), especially in the setting of CMV co-infection.\n\n【69】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【70】Patients with cancer have encountered critical diagnostic and treatment challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Human immune responses may be affected by SARS-CoV-2/CMV co-infection. Such reports may help us with current virus–virus interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further research is needed to confirm CMV reactivation/replication mechanisms in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【71】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【72】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this article.\n\n【73】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【74】SARS-CoV-2:\n\n【75】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2\n\n【76】CMV:\n\n【77】Cytomegalovirus\n\n【78】ALL:\n\n【79】Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\n【80】PCR:\n\n【81】Polymerase chain reaction\n\n【82】GI:\n\n【83】Gastrointestinal\n\n【84】COVID-19:\n\n【85】Coronavirus disease 2019\n\n【86】MTX:\n\n【87】Methotrexate\n\n【88】VNC:\n\n【89】Vincristine\n\n【90】VCZ:\n\n【91】Voriconazole\n\n【92】aGVHD:\n\n【93】Acute graft-versus-host disease\n\n【94】VOD:\n\n【95】Veno-occlusive disease\n\n【96】ODI:\n\n【97】Optical density index\n\n【98】PT:\n\n【99】Prothrombin time\n\n【100】PTT:\n\n【101】Partial thromboplastin time\n\n【102】INR:\n\n【103】International normalized ratio\n\n【104】CSF:\n\n【105】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【106】CT:\n\n【107】Cycle threshold\n\n【108】US:\n\n【109】Ultrasonographic\n\n【110】CDS:\n\n【111】Color Doppler sonography\n\n【112】ACE2:\n\n【113】Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n\n【114】NK:\n\n【115】Natural killer\n\n【116】Treg:\n\n【117】T-regulatory\n\n【118】Th17:\n\n【119】T-helper 17", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The patient presented with a 1-month history of progressive, non-painful, soft tissue oral mass, 1 month after completing treatment for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

First described by Moritz Kaposi in 1972 \\[ 2 , 3 \\], KS is an angioproliferative multicentric disease of lymphatic endothelium-derived cells. It is classified into four distinct clinicopathological subtypes based on the clinical condition in which it develops: (1) the classic or sporadic form mostly occurs in lower extremities in elderly patients of Mediterranean or Jewish origin, (2) the endemic form which is prevalent in middle-aged adults and children from sub-Saharan Africa, (3) the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-associated or epidemic KS, and (4) the iatrogenic form of KS, which is associated with immunosuppressive therapies for transplants or malignancies and other chronic inflammatory diseases \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. These variants portray different courses and epidemiology, but with similar histological features, and human herpes virus-8 (HHV8) is considered the causative agent for all forms of KS \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【10】The iatrogenic variant of KS occurs in patients who are immune-suppressed following organ transplant (particularly kidney transplants), chemotherapy, or rheumatologic disease \\[ 6 \\], usually appearing a year after the first administration of the drugs. However, the occurrence of KS in children as a second primary malignancy following acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy in general, and outside transplant settings in particular, are scarce. Herein we report a case of iatrogenic KS in a 5-year-old boy, who presented with oral KS lesions (with visceral involvement) following ALL treatment (2 years and 8 months from the time he was first diagnosed with and initiated treatment for ALL).\n\n【11】Case report\n-----------\n\n【12】A 5-year-old boy, of Bantu ethnicity, presented with a 1-month history of progressive, non-painful, soft tissue mass in the left palatal ridge, first noted in July 2021. He was otherwise well and had no reported constitutional symptoms, no jaw swelling and no abdominal or central nervous system symptoms. He had been earlier diagnosed with pre-B ALL \\[high risk owing to a high white blood cell count, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria\\] at 3 years of age, for which he was treated at our center according to local protocol (Additional file 1 ) between November 2018 and June 2021, with well-achieved remission \\[minimal residual disease (MRD) negative\\], and had started long term surveillance. He did not receive irradiation or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation during the first-line ALL treatment. His family and psychosocial history were unremarkable, and he had largely enjoyed normal growth, development, and health. A physical examination revealed a bluish–purplish mass in the left palatal ridge (Fig. 1 ) and no other significant findings (general or systemic).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Iatrogenic oral KS lesions in a 5-year-old patient\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】A biopsy of the suspicious lesion was taken, and the histology was compatible with KS nodular stage. The hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections, illustrated in Fig. 2 , showed a tumor composed of nodules of spindle-shaped cells with mild atypia (Fig. 2 A) and extravasated blood cells and proliferating vascular slits (Fig. 2 B).\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Histopathology (H & E staining) \\[40 ×\\]. **A** A tumor composed of nodules and spindle-shaped cells with mild atypia, **B** extravasated blood cells and proliferating vascular slits\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed multiple enlarged intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies (para-aortic and mesenteric), the largest approximately 2.5 cm in longest diameter. Occult fecal blood was positive. The plain chest radiograph was largely normal (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Chest radiograph. **A** Antero-posterior view, **B** lateral view, showing normal mediastinal and hilar regions.\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】The complete blood count, coagulation profile, and general chemistry were normal. The serological test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was negative. HHV8 assay and other immunological tests could not be performed at our center because of the lack of a testing facility. The final pathology diagnosis was iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma. The patient was started on bleomycin (B) 10 IU/m <sup>2 </sup> 3 weekly and vincristine (V) 1.5 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly (BV) according to local protocol, with complete clinical remission after four cycles of chemotherapy (Fig. 4 )—defined as the disappearance of all clinical manifestations, including tumor-associated edema. The child’s clinical course was monitored by routine physical assessment and basic imaging studies.\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Complete resolution of oral KS after chemotherapy\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】The repeat abdominal ultrasonography and chest radiograph were normal, and the fecal occult blood test was negative by the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. He went on to receive a total of six cycles of the BV treatment regimen and continues to be monitored with regular evaluation.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】This case is unique in the following aspects: While several cases of transplant-related iatrogenic KS have been described \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\], reports on the occurrence of KS in children as a second primary malignancy following acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy outside transplant settings are scarce. This is possibly only the second reported case of oral/visceral KS as a second malignancy in a child following ALL treatment, occurring outside the transplant setting. Further, KS has been infrequently reported as a complication following therapy of ALL in children.\n\n【35】Kaposi sarcoma (KS), first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872 \\[ 2 , 3 \\], is a spindle-cell, slowly progressive multifocal lymphoangioproliferative neoplasm induced by a gamma herpes virus, the human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8), in predisposed individuals \\[ 4 , 10 \\]. There are four known clinical variants of KS, with different courses and epidemiology, but similar etiology: (a) epidemic or AIDS-associated KS, (b) classic KS (in elderly Mediterranean men), (c) endemic or African KS, and (d) iatrogenic KS, affecting immunosuppressed patients and organ transplant recipients \\[ 4 , 10 \\].\n\n【36】Infection with HHV-8 underlies a common etiology of all the subtypes of KS. However, though considered necessary, HHV-8 is not sufficient for the development of sarcoma, implying other factors (genetic, immunological, and environmental) are also necessary for the pathogenesis, together with immunosuppression \\[ 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. The iatrogenic form of KS, due to immunosuppression, is typically associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplant recipients (particularly kidney transplants). It can also occur in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments for proliferative disorders/malignant processes or immune-mediated diseases \\[ 4 , 6 , 14 , 15 \\] as well as the use of oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents \\[ 6 , 16 , 17 \\], with KS appearing usually about a year after the first administration of the drugs in these cases.\n\n【37】Here we report a case, which according to our knowledge from the review of literature, could be only the second reported case of Kaposi sarcoma following treatment for ALL, occurring outside the setting of a transplant, and the first with iatrogenic KS developing just over 2 years of ALL diagnosis in a child. One earlier documented case in the literature was of a 5-year-old girl who developed visceral KS 7 years after ALL treatment and clinical remission, and was only identified in autopsy findings \\[ 1 \\]. A latter report by Sala _et al._ \\[ 18 \\] was of a 10-year-old who developed KS just over a year following partially matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【38】In a subsequent review of 61 reported cases of second neoplasms in children and adults with ALL, the most frequent second tumors were other acute leukemias \\[mainly acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\\], lymphomas \\[mainly Hodgkin disease (HD)\\], and other solid tumors \\[ 19 \\] other than KS. The majority of the secondary KS reported to date were in adults, mostly following solid organ transplants and immunosuppressive therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus \\[ 5 \\], Crohn’s disease \\[ 20 \\], asthma \\[ 21 \\], Wegener’s granulomatosis \\[ 22 \\], or following transplant \\[ 23 \\]. For instance, in Iran, Ramzi and colleagues reported a case of iatrogenic KS in a 44-year-old female after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) relapse \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【39】The pathogenic mechanism underlying KS in patients treated for ALL is still not well known, though decreased immunity seems to be the overarching factor. By and large, the current most accepted hypothesis for the development of iatrogenic KS, in general, is supposed to stem from a weakening of the immunological surveillance system by immunosuppressive agents, resulting in the reactivation of a pre-existent HHV-8 infection and giving rise to the proliferative transformation of the infected endothelial cells \\[ 14 \\]. In this respect, the pathogenesis is believed to relate to inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and reactivation of latent HHV-8 infection, which leads to the induction of angiogenesis \\[ 4 \\]. As postulated for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the role of an ineffective T-cell response to HHV-8 latent infection, consequent to the generally decreased immunity, cannot be ignored \\[ 10 \\], but other risk factors probably exist. Additionally, carcinogenesis may be a feature of chemotherapy in cancer treatment \\[ 25 \\] and, only in the case of some organ transplant recipients, HHV-8 seroconversion may follow the immunosuppression, suggesting infection from the donated organ \\[ 26 \\].\n\n【40】In general, the clinical manifestation of iatrogenic KS tends to be exclusive to cutaneous and/or mucosal involvement, though widespread disseminated forms with visceral involvement, as was the case in our patient, may also occur \\[ 14 \\]. The objective for the management of KS is to manage the symptoms as treatment is often not curative, and prognosis depends on the disease severity at presentation \\[ 27 \\]. Patients with systemic disseminated KS, as in our case, require systemic chemotherapy \\[ 28 \\]. The clinical manifestations of KS following significant immunosuppression generally resolve, in most cases, when the immunosuppressive therapy is changed, reduced, or discontinued \\[ 5 \\]. However, the reduction or elimination of immunosuppression does not always lead to the resolution of KS \\[ 4 \\], and maintaining immunosuppression frequently leads to further disease progression \\[ 14 \\]. Literature and current data regarding the treatment of KS following ALL treatment in children are lacking. Sala _et al_ . reported achievement of complete remission with pegylated lysosomal doxorubicin used to treat visceral KS in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, with a disease-free state after 33 months of ongoing follow-up \\[ 18 \\]. Pegylated lysosomal doxorubicin was similarly effective in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi patients in a report by Di Lorenzo _et al_ . \\[ 29 \\]. However, as noted by Sala _et al._ in their report, the use of anthracylines in the treatment of KS following ALL treatment may be limited by the increased risk of cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines administered during the first-line treatment of acute leukemia \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【41】Another agent, sirolimus, has shown mixed results when used in the treatment of dermal KS in post-renal transplant recipients. For instance, Stallone _et al._ \\[ 30 \\], just like other authors \\[ 31 , 32 \\], demonstrated a potential role of sirolimus in inhibiting the progression of KS in kidney transplant recipients, postulated to occur through the down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis \\[ 30 , 33 \\]. On the contrary, Tanja Graf _et al_ . reported no response to sirolimus when used in the treatment of cutaneous KS in a 36-year-old renal transplant recipient \\[ 34 \\]. Here we report a case of successful use of a combination of bleomycin and vincristine in the treatment of oral–visceral KS in a child following ALL treatment, with remarkable improvement noted by the fourth of the 3-weekly cycles of this regimen, with disease-free status after about 1 year of ongoing follow-up. We believe this presents a significant result, especially for the treatment of KS in a resource-limited setting, because of the main advantages of this regimen, which are low cost, ease of administration, and minimal adverse effects.\n\n【42】This case report derives its strength from its uniqueness—being one of very few reported cases of oral/visceral KS as a second malignancy in a child following ALL treatment that occurs outside the transplant setting. The main limitations of this case report include the lack of an immunological study for HHV-8 and the short duration of patient follow-up, which limits the conclusion on long-term prognosis.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【44】Visceral KS as a second malignancy may occur after pediatric ALL treatment, but its rarity makes it unlikely to raise suspicion among clinicians, thus precluding early diagnosis and treatment. We recommend routine evaluation for KS lesions in children undergoing long-term surveillance following treatment for childhood malignancies, including acute leukemia. The administration of a combination of bleomycin and vincristine in the setting of discontinued immunosuppressive therapy may represent a relatively safe, effective therapeutic approach for these children, especially in low-resource contexts.\n\n【45】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】Not applicable.\n\n【47】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【48】AIDS:\n\n【49】Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n\n【50】ALL:\n\n【51】Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\n【52】AML:\n\n【53】Acute myeloid leukemia\n\n【54】HIV:\n\n【55】Human immunodeficiency virus\n\n【56】H & E:\n\n【57】Hematoxylin and eosin\n\n【58】HHV8:\n\n【59】Human herpes virus 8\n\n【60】MRD:\n\n【61】Minimal residual disease\n\n【62】KS:\n\n【63】Kaposi sarcoma", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Italy and Realquality RQ-SARS-CoV-2, AB Analytical) was used to evaluate the swabs.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This data reflect the importance of postmortem swabs in all autopsy cases, and not only in potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related death, and also highlight the necessity to evaluate virus positivity a long time after the moment of death, even if a low initial viral load was assessed.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】As reported by the World Health Organization, from the outbreak of the pandemic until 25 February 2021, a total of 112,209,815 confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been recorded, including 2,490,776 deaths \\[ 1 \\]. Worldwide statistical–epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 spread show a mortality rate ranging between 0.8% and 4.2% \\[ 2 \\], most of these occurring among the elderly (age > 80 years), immunocompromised, or patients with comorbidities \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Through autopsies, pathologists can provide an important contribution to better understand the phenomenology of death in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, and to date, there is no evidence about the possibility of being infected from a corpse.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Herein we report the case of a 41-year-old Ukrainian man who went missing after swimming in the sea with a friend due to unfavorable weather conditions. About 16 hours after the event, the body was found wedged between rocks and an autopsy was ordered. Due to the current pandemic situation, having no information about the possible antemortem SARS-CoV-2 positivity of the man, who was described as completely asymptomatic, a postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was taken before the autopsy, according to the current guidelines. The swab identified SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Circumstantial data and external inspection of the corpse allowed death to be considered compatible with drowning.\n\n【13】Due to pending burial authorizations, the corpse was kept in the Chieti Hospital morgue, respecting the guidelines on management of SARS-CoV-2 deceased. The waiting period allowed us to follow the evolution of the positivity of the virus by performing multiple nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n【14】### Collection phase\n\n【15】The whole observation period of the corpse was 41 days. During this period, the body was stored in a cold room at 4 °C, inside a sealed and disinfected waterproof bag, in compliance with the guidelines issued for the management of SARS-CoV-2 corpses \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【16】Twenty-eight nasopharyngeal swabs were performed on the corpse. The collection of the samples was always performed by the same team, adequately prepared and with standardized procedures as per international guidelines \\[ 5 \\] and established protocols \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Since the collection of cadaver swabs does not induce any physiological reactions capable of generating aerosols, a negative-pressure room (BLS3) was not required. Two nasopharyngeal swabs (one for each nostril) were performed, using a kit consisting of two synthetic fiber swabs with plastic rod. After collection, each sample was placed inside a sterile tube containing 2–3 mL physiological solution with addition of an antibiotic. The tubes were then placed in two different 50-mL Falcon tubes, stored in a plastic bag with an adhesive closure, and then in another plastic bag with a zip closure. After sampling, the swabs were transported to the laboratory where they were stored for a maximum of 12 hours at a temperature of 4 °C, waiting to be processed.\n\n【17】### Laboratory phase\n\n【18】Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Italy) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was used to detect presence of SARS-CoV-2. This technique uses three genes: _ORF1ab_ , _N gene_ , and _S gene_ to quantify the viral load by the number of cycles for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold in RT-PCR. The threshold is 5000, the baseline is 5, and the cut-off is 37 cycles. A lower number of cycles means a higher viral load. According to the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2, samples are considered “positive” when at least two genes have a cycle threshold value <37; if the cycle threshold value is “undetermined” or > 37 for two or three genes, then the sample is considered “negative.”\n\n【19】A second RT-PCR kit (Realquality RQ-SARS-CoV-2, AB Analytical) was also used to check the positivity of the swab and to introduce a cellular control. This kit analyzes S and _RdRP_ viral genes and the _RnaseP_ gene for cellular control.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】All swabs performed during the observational period were reported as positive.\n\n【22】We compared the results of RT-PCR (TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Italy) of the first and last swab (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【23】**Fig. 1**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】RT-PCR (TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Italy). Amplification plot of first swab ( **a** ) and last swab ( **b** )\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】As shown in the amplification plot in Fig. 1 , in the first swab (a) all three tested genes were positive, with cycle threshold (Ct) values of 33 (S gene), 32 (N gene), and 31 (ORF1ab gene). The amplification plot of the swab on day 41 (Fig. 1 b) showed clear positivity of two of the three tested genes (S gene: Ct 37 and ORF1ab gene: Ct 36) and a doubtful result of the N gene (Ct 39). Nonetheless, the last swab was reported as positive due to the positivity of two of the three genes tested, according to the TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v2 indications.\n\n【28】To confirm the positivity and to obtain a cellularity check on the swabs, we then analyzed the samples with another RT-PCR kit (Realquality RQ-SARS-CoV-2, AB Analytical) (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【29】**Fig. 2**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】RT-PCR (Realquality RQ-SARS-CoV-2, AB Analytical) analysis results. First swab **a** showed positivity for both viral (S and RdRP genes, identified by purple and yellow arrow, respectively) and cellular (RnaseP, identified by the green arrow) genes. Day 41 swab **b** showed positivity for the two viral genes, while the cellular gene was not detectable\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Interestingly, we found that the first swab showed positivity for both viral (S and RdRP genes) and cellular (RnaseP) genes (a). Conversely, after 41 days, the two viral genes were still positive, while the cellular gene was not detectable (b)\n\n【34】It was not possible to perform other swabs beyond 41 days due to burial authorization and also the putrefactive state of the body (batrachian abdomen with abdominal and facial putrefactive spottings).\n\n【35】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【36】The pandemic situation has led to an intensification of scientific research to provide new data on SARS-CoV-2 virus behavior. Since the beginning of the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 to date, important knowledge has been obtained about the virus behavior in living subjects and on inanimate surfaces \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. Van Dormagen _et al._ \\[ 14 \\] detected SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces after 5 days at a temperature between 22 °C and 25 °C and 40–50% humidity, as well as on plastic after 72 hours, on stainless steel after 48 hours, and on copper after 8 hours. Another study conducted by Moriarty \\[ 15 \\] on a cruise ship reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the cabins up to 17 days after the passengers got off the ship. However, there is a lack of data on virus persistency on dead bodies and on the risk of contagion from cadavers. These data are of fundamental importance as the execution of the autopsies puts various categories of workers (pathologists, technicians, and so on) in contact with a possible source of biological risk \\[ 16 , 17 \\], with implications not only from a health point of view but also from a medicolegal one.\n\n【37】Specific guidelines have been developed to allow the execution of safe postmortem investigations \\[ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\], considering the available data. To date, we could not find any recent publication nor WHO report defining the risk of postmortem transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or how long body fluids remain infected in the cadaver.\n\n【38】In a study by Dijkhuizen _et al._ \\[ 22 \\], they tested viral RNA postmortem via nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and detected it up to 27 hours after death. The longest reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on a cadaver is 35 days \\[ 23 \\]. However, neither of these studies were able to define the contagiousness of the virus.\n\n【39】The present case shows the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA up to 41 days after death. Data about its persistence are of fundamental importance for pathologists to understand when the handling of the corpse is safe, and further studies are needed to estimate the virus contagiousness. Claims have also been reported about possible infection from a corpse for a few hours up to a day after death, but these statements are not supported by scientific data _in vivo_ . Nonetheless, a study conducted by Heinrich _et al._ \\[ 24 \\] shows maintained infectivity of a corpse; they took a tissue sample from the throat of SARS-CoV-2 deceased patients and found that the virus could replicate up to 35 hours postmortem.\n\n【40】The main route of virus transmission is inhalation of large respiratory droplets, but transmission via contact with contaminated body excretions, air, and fecal–oral route has also been suggested. When managing SARS-CoV-2-positive cadavers, the potential risk of transmission may be related to direct contact with human remains or body fluids where the virus is present, or to direct contact with contaminated fomites. Due to the postmortem presence of the virus, it is advisable to minimize the contact and exposure to infected body fluids, paying particular attention to the procedures that generate aerosols during an autopsy \\[ 25 \\]. Although an analysis of 75,464 SARS-CoV-2 cases in China \\[ 26 \\] did not report any transmission other than via droplets, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances in which procedures or support treatment are performed that generate aerosols. Currently, no evidence of virus transmission due to manipulation of infected corpses has emerged. One case seems to have been reported, even if the authors do not scientifically confirm that the infection occurred from a corpse \\[ 27 , 28 \\]. Another study conducted by Han _et al._ \\[ 29 \\] also reported no disease symptoms in autopsy participants after 24 examinations on SARS-CoV-2-positive bodies. Therefore, there is currently no scientific evidence proving contagiousness from a SARS-CoV-2-positive corpse \\[ 22 , 30 , 31 \\]. This case may contribute to increase the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 persistency in dead bodies.\n\n【41】This case shows a long resistance of the viral genome in a corpse kept in controlled environmental conditions (cold room temperature 4 °C) 41 days after death, with a low initial viral load. The man, who died from drowning, was completely asymptomatic when he was alive. Our data reflect the importance of postmortem swabs in all autopsy cases because asymptomaticity does not exclude the presence of the virus. Moreover, we found that only the viral genes, but not the cellular RNA, persisted after 41 days.\n\n【42】We are aware of the limitations of our study, mainly related to the exiguity of the sample, and further studies are needed to confirm postmortem survival of the virus and assess the possible risk of postmortem contagiousness.\n\n【43】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】Not applicable.\n\n【45】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【46】SARS-CoV-2:\n\n【47】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\n【48】RT-PCR:\n\n【49】Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The selected medical case reports are considered, using methods of quantitative examination and structural, narrative, and contextual analyses.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We developed structural and thematic typologies of Latin terms and expressions, and we conducted a quantitative analysis that enabled us to observe the tendencies in using these lexical units in medical case reports. The research revealed that the use of Latin fully complies with the communicative strategies of medical case reports as a genre. Owing to the fact that Latin medical lexis is internationally adopted and understood worldwide, it promotes the conciseness of medical case reports, as well as contributes to their narrative style and educational intentions.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】The adequate use of Latin terms in medical case reports is an essential prerequisite of effective sharing of one’s clinical findings with fellow researchers from all over the world. Therefore, it is highly important to draw students’ attention to Latin terms and expressions that are used in medical case reports most frequently. Hence, the analysis of structural, thematic, and contextual features of Latin terms in case reports should be an integral part of curricula at medical universities.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】The profound influence of Latin upon the genesis and development of English medical terminology is undeniable and well-grounded \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Approximately 95% of English terms are borrowed from or created on the basis of Latin and latinized Greek \\[ 4 \\]. Therefore, the English medical terminology cannot be “reasonably mastered without the knowledge of basic Latin” \\[ 5 \\]. Within the English terminological system, Bujalkova and Dzuganova distinguish (1) Latin terms that were assimilated into English (anglicized Latin terms, such as “muscle,” “vein,” “nerve,” and so forth), (2) terms that experienced a multiple assimilation (from Greek into Latin, from Latin into Old French, from Old French into English; for instance, “spasmos” − “spasmus” − “spasme” − “spasm”), and (3) terms preserved in the original Latin form (“vena,” “dorsum,” “nucleus,” and so forth) \\[ 2 \\]. The last-mentioned group of terms are preserved in the original Latin form up to the present but have undergone certain modifications in terms of pronunciation in accordance with English phonetic rules. Therefore, we suggest referring to this group of lexis as semiassimilated terms. In addition, we consider it necessary to distinguish the nonassimilated Latin terminology, represented by multiple-word terms that preserve the original features of the Latin grammatical system, such as the relationship between the parts of speech, agreement in gender, inflection rules, and so forth (for example, _per os_ , _cor pulmonale_ , _os ischii_ , _musculus latissimus dorsi_ , and the like).\n\n【12】Within the framework of medical discourse, virtually all genres are based largely on Latin and latinized Greek terminology. All medical research is built on the principles of _ab ovo_ (“from the very beginning,” literally “from the egg”), _ab incunabulis_ (literally “from the cradle”), and _ad fontes_ (“back to the sources”), which provide the intergenerational continuity of medical science. Indeed, all areas of theoretical and practical medicine (biology, anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical sciences, and so forth) as well as nomenclature corpora (taxonomies, International Nonproprietary Names, and so forth) are deeply rooted in the ancient nominative traditions. In this context, Latin occupies the firmest position in the anatomical vocabulary. Studies in Latin and Latin translations from Ancient Greek \\[ 6 \\] “were the foundation of scientific thinking that was born in the boards of first universities” and “remain relevant in the current official anatomical terminology” \\[ 7 \\]. _De humani corporis fabrica libri septem_ (“On the Fabric of the Human Body in Seven Books,” 1543) by Andreas Vesalius not only contributed to the formation of anatomy as a separate academic subject \\[ 8 \\] but also contained the data of pharmacological interest, such as the mention of _digitalis_ , which is still used to treat heart failure. Pathology ranks second to the prevalence of Latin terminology; apart from Latin terms, clinical medicine displays more intensive expression of national languages \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【13】Hence, it is natural that both original research (primary articles) and review articles (literature reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses) use Latin terms extensively. Within the structure of primary research literature, it is also necessary to distinguish such an important genre as medical case report (MCR). In fact, MCRs are of interest because publications in this genre present a detailed report of diseases, the symptoms and their localization, management, and prognosis. That is, each MCR represents and integrates several medical domains and activities (description of anatomical structures and physiological conditions, laboratory studies and experiments, diagnosis and treatment, and so forth) at the same time. Therefore, it is relevant to determine to what extent the Latin terms are spread and how they are used in contemporary MCRs, as exemplified in the _Journal of Medical Case Reports_ ( _JMCR_ ). In such a way, our present research provides medical professionals with an appropriate terminological arsenal to be ready to deal with the genre of MCRs.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】The objective of the research is to study the frequency of using Latin terminology in English-language MCRs and, in such a way, to provide relevant guidelines for medical professionals to produce effective MCRs. The material used for the present research is the corpus of 1275 papers published in _JMCR_ from February 2007 through August 2017. The material was selected by automatic search and sampling using the _Latin-Ukrainian Thesaurus of Clinical Terms_ \\[ 9 \\]. The search strategy was based on the authors’ teamwork: two groups of MCRs were formed and subsequently compared and discussed for their eligibility for inclusion. To standardize the selection of Latin terms, we developed the structural and thematic typologies of these units. The structural typology focuses on the major modeling patterns of Latin terminology in MCRs and comprises the following groups:\n\n【16】1.  1.\n    \n    _One-word terms_ : This category includes semiassimilated medical lexis that is deeply entrenched in the modern English language and is included in all English dictionaries (such as “abdomen,” “varicella,” “appendix,” and so forth). For objective reasons, these terms will not be subjected to quantitative analysis, because they virtually penetrate the entire English medical discourse. However, this group also embraces the Latin lexis, which is not that common and therefore can be studied quantitatively.\n    \n2.  2.\n    \n    _Two-word phrases_ : The group of two-word phrases is of particular interest because these terms are much less anglicized and preserve the original features of the Latin grammatical system. We believe that careful lexicogrammatical categorization of these terminological units will provide better understanding and deeper memorizing of them, which in turn will prevent possible spelling errors in MCR writing. We conducted quantitative analysis of the two-word terminological phrases and present them in descending order (highest to lowest frequency) within each subcategory. Hence, this group embraces the following subcategories:\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Preposition + noun in ablative case\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Preposition + noun in accusative case\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Preposition + adjective in ablative case\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Noun + adjective constructions\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Other types of two-word phrases represented by miscellaneous constructions, such as noun + pronoun, preposition + pronoun, adverbial constructions, noun + noun in genitive case, noun + participle in genitive case, and verb + adverb\n        \n3.  3.\n    \n    _Three-word phrases_ : The group of three-word phrases comprises the following subcategories:\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Noun + adjective + adjective\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Noun + noun + adjective\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Noun + adjective + noun\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Noun + preposition + noun\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Preposition + preposition + noun\n        \n4.  4.\n    \n    A subgroup of compound English-Latin word phrases, which we refer to as the _hybrid terms_ , containing both assimilated and nonassimilated lexical units\n    \n5.  5.\n    \n    The group of abbreviations\n    \n\n【17】Further, we organized the collected material into thematic groups and determined the frequency of their use in _JMCR_ :\n\n【18】1.  1.\n    \n    _Medical phenomena and processes_ :\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Anatomical descriptions\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Physiological conditions\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Methods of studies and experiments\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Indications for treatment and routes of administering medications\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Pathological conditions\n        \n2.  2.\n    \n    _Academic language_\n    \n\n【19】The selected MCRs were considered using the method of lexicogrammatical and stylistic analyses, with a focus largely on the structural peculiarities, narrative function, and contextual role of Latin terminology. The use of Latin terms and phrases was subjected to quantitative examination to determine their frequency.\n\n【20】Results\n-------\n\n【21】We studied 1275 papers published in _JMCR_ from February 2007 through August 2017 and containing Latin terms and terminological phrases. Within the structure of the selected research material, MCRs constitute an overwhelming majority ( _n_ \\= 1232), followed by errata ( _n_ \\= 17), research articles ( _n_ \\= 14), reviews ( _n_ \\= 10), and editorials ( _n_ \\= 2). We developed the structural and thematic typologies of Latin terms and conducted quantitative analysis of these terms. In this way, we determined the frequency of using Latin in MCRs, as well as detected the most prevalent and productive lexical units and phrases. The structural typology comprises the following groups:\n\n【22】1.  1.\n    \n    _One-word terms_ : We found four MCRs with the adverb _mane_ (meaning _in the morning_ ), which is used in prescriptions, for example: “She was treated for MDD with paroxetine 20 mg/ _mane_ in 2002” \\[ 10 \\]. There are four publications with the preposition _circa_ (meaning _approximately_ or _about_ ), which is used for descriptive purposes, for instance: “a reduced debit of the fistula of _circa_ 10 mL” \\[ 11 \\]. We detected 17 cases of using the noun _erratum_ (meaning _error_ ) for amending a published text. Furthermore, the one-word terms are represented by compound Latin lexis, such as _primigravida_ (“a woman who is pregnant for the first time”; _n_ \\= 30 cases) and _nullipara_ (“a woman who has never given birth”; _n_ \\= 2 cases).\n    \n\n【23】In this context, it is necessary to remark that pluralizing one-word Latin terms can sometimes be quite a challenge. For instance, a common mistake occurs when deriving the plural form of the Latin word _septum_ . This lexical unit belongs to the second declension of Latin nouns, neuter gender. Therefore, the correct plural form in Latin (and in English) is _septa_ . However, the plural form _septa_ is quite often mistaken for a singular form and consequently is erroneously pluralized as _septae_ (on the model of _vertebra_ / _vertebrae_ : the first declension, feminine gender). As a result, a misspelling ( _septae_ ) occurs. In fact, we found 66 publications in _JMCR_ with the correct plural form of the word under consideration. At the same time, it is to be noted that 20 papers contain the incorrect plural form of this word, for example: “In non-fibrotic lung tissue the alveolar _septa_ were edematous with sloughing of pneumocytes” \\[ 12 \\]; “surgical drainage of the hepatic abscess (that contained many _septa_ ) was performed” \\[ 13 \\]; “It also facilitates the removal of debris, purulent secretions, _septa_ ” \\[ 14 \\]; “Alveolar _septa_ were inflamed, thickened and fibrotic” \\[ 15 \\]; “eosinophilic cytoplasm delineated by thin fibrovascular _septa_ which separated the tumor cells” \\[ 16 \\]; “a 14.7 × 13.6 × 15.2 cm complex septated cystic mass arising from the peritoneum, containing enhancing _septa_ and solid nodules” \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【24】A similar error may occur with the word _dorsum_ , which also belongs to the second declension of Latin nouns, neuter gender. We found three cases of using the correct plural form of this word ( _dorsa_ ) and one MCR with a misspelling ( _dorsae_ ): “Her dermographism was improving but she had developed confluent erythema and slight hyperkeratosis between and over the _dorsa_ of her fingers” \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【25】Another challenging aspect of using Latin in MCRs is the subject-verb agreement in number. This type of error is not widespread within the selected research material, and only isolated cases were detected with the words _bacterium_ (singular)/ _bacteria_ (plural) and _labium_ (singular)/ _labia_ (plural): “The next closest _bacterium_ was _H. parainfluenzae_ with a 97% similarity score” \\[ 19 \\]; “\\[r\\]ight _labium_ was asymmetrically enlarged” \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【26】Thus, we believe that it is essential to draw authors’ attention to such potential errors when using Latin terms to improve the quality of MCRs writing.\n\n【27】1.  2.\n    \n    The group of two-word phrases embraces the following subcategories:\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Preposition + noun in ablative case: _in vitro_ (literally “in the glass,” meaning “performed outside the normal biological context”; _n_ \\= 192 cases); _in situ_ (“on site”; _n_ \\= 191 cases); _in utero_ (“in the womb”; _n_ \\= 44 cases); _ex utero_ (“outside the uterus”; _n_ \\= 4 cases); _in silico_ (meaning “performed on computer or via computer simulation”; _n_ \\= 3 cases); _ex vitro_ (literally “outside the glass” or outside the artificial tissue; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _ab initio_ (“from the beginning”; _n_ \\= 1 case); and _de facto_ (“in fact”; _n_ \\= 1 case).\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Preposition + noun in accusative case: _per rectum_ (“by way of the rectum”; _n_ \\= 70 cases); _postpartum_ (“after birth”; _n_ \\= 41 cases); _per os_ (“by mouth”; _n_ \\= 30 cases); _in toto_ (“in general”; _n_ \\= 6 cases); _ante mortem_ (“before death”; _n_ \\= 5 cases); _ante partum_ (“before birth”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _ad hoc_ (“for this”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _inter alia_ (“among other things”; _n_ \\= 1 case); and _post factum_ (“after the event”; _n_ \\= 1 case).\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Preposition + adjective in ablative case: _in vivo_ (literally “within the living,” meaning tested in the living organism; _n_ \\= 71 cases); _ex vivo_ (“out of the living,” referring to something that takes place outside a living organism; _n_ \\= 5 cases); _a posteriori_ (literally “from what comes after,” meaning when justification is dependent on experience; _n_ \\= 3 cases); _a priori_ (literally “from the earlier,” meaning when justification is independent of experience; _n_ \\= 2 cases); and _ex novo_ (“from the beginning”; _n_ \\= 2 cases).\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Noun + adjective constructions are represented by the following examples: _labia majora_ (“outer vulvar lips”; _n_ \\= 16 cases); _placenta previa_ (an obstetric complication in which the placenta is inserted partially or wholly in the lower uterine segment; _n_ \\= 12 cases); _foramen magnum_ (“great foramen”; _n_ \\= 10 publications); _cor pulmonale_ (“pulmonary heart”; _n_ \\= 10 cases); _vastus medialis_ (“medial vastus muscle”; _n_ \\= 10 cases); _vastus lateralis_ (“lateral vastus muscle”; _n_ \\= 8 cases); _placenta accreta_ (an obstetric complication in which the chorionic villi are attached to the myometrium; _n_ \\= 5 cases); _oculus dexter_ (“the right eye”; _n_ \\= 4 cases); _oculus sinister_ (“the left eye”; _n_ \\= 4 publications); _coxa vara_ (“a deformity of the hip”; _n_ \\= 4 cases); _placenta increta_ (an obstetric complication in which the chorionic villi penetrate the myometrium; _n_ \\= 3 cases); _virgo intacta_ (“a virgin”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _os sacrum_ (“sacral bone”; _n_ \\= 2 publications); _os ilium_ (“iliac bone”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _placenta percreta_ (chorionic villi penetrate the perimetrium; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _genu valgum_ (“the knock-knee deformity”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _hallux valgus_ (“the skewed toe”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _os peroneum_ (“peroneal bone”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _os odontoideum_ (“odontoid bone”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _os trigonum_ (“triangular bone”; _n_ \\= 1 case); _musculus sartorius_ (“tailor’s muscle”; _n_ \\= 1 case); and _labia minora_ (“inner vulvar lips”; _n_ \\= 1 case).\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Other types of two-word phrases are not so widespread in the analyzed MCRs as in the previous groups, and this subcategory is represented by miscellaneous constructions, such as noun + pronoun: _status quo_ (literally “the state in which,” meaning “the state of things”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); preposition + pronoun: _per se_ (“by itself”; _n_ \\= 27 cases; and adverbial constructions: _sensu stricto_ (“in the narrow sense”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _sensu lato_ (“in the broad sense”; _n_ \\= 1 case); noun + noun in genitive case: _caput Medusae os_ (“the radiating appearance of the superficial epigastric veins”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _pubis_ (“bone of pubis”); _os calcis_ (“bone of heel”); and _os ischii_ (“ischial bone”) ( _n_ \\= 1 case for each unit); and noun + participle in genitive case: _modus operandi_ (“mode of operation”; _n_ \\= 1 case); verb + adverb: _vide supra_ (“see above”; _n_ \\= 1 MCR).\n        \n2.  3.\n    \n    The group of three-word phrases is also remarkable for preserving the original features of Latin grammar. It comprises the following subcategories:\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Noun + adjective + adjective: _musculus rectus abdominis_ (“abdominal rectus muscle”), _musculus gastrocnemius medialis_ (“medial calf muscle”), _os tibiale externum_ (“external tibial bone”), _ductus hepaticus dexter_ (“right hepatic duct”), and _placenta previa percreta_ (an obstetric complication in which the chorionic villi penetrate the perimetrium) ( _n_ \\= 1 case for each unit).\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Noun + noun + adjective: _abductor digiti minimi_ (“little finger muscle”; _n_ \\= 6 cases); _levator palpebrae superioris_ (“the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid”; _n_ \\= 3 cases); _abductor pollicis brevis_ (“the short abductor muscle of thumb”; _n_ \\= 3 cases); _abductor pollicis longus_ (“the long abductor muscle of thumb”; _n_ \\= 2 cases); _levator labii superioris_ (“the lifter of the upper lip”; _n_ \\= 1 case); and _locus resistentiae minoris_ (“an area of little resistance”; _n_ \\= 1 case).\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Noun + adjective + noun: _musculus orbicularis oculi_ (“orbicular muscle of eye”), _musculus latissimus dorsi_ (“broadest muscle of back”), and _musculus rectus abdominis_ (“abdominal rectus muscle”) ( _n_ \\= 1 case for each unit).\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Noun + preposition + noun: _carcinoma in situ_ (“a group of abnormal cells, located in the place where they first formed”; _n_ \\= 26 cases) and _fissula ante fenestram_ (“a small connective tissue-filled cleft, located anterior to the oval window”; _n_ \\= 1 publication).\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Preposition + preposition + noun: _ex post facto_ (“from a thing done afterward”; _n_ \\= 1 case). It should be remarked that the latter construction is rather unusual for Latin; yet, such a rare expression still can be found in current medical discourse.\n        \n\n【28】Noteworthy is the contextual use of the expression _in situ_ . As is evident from the foregoing, this phrase can be used in oncology ( _carcinoma in situ_ ), as well as in the process of measurement taking, viewing anatomical structures, and medical simulation (for example, “She was treated operatively with an _in situ_ cannulated hip screw fixation and healed completely within eight weeks” \\[ 21 \\]), depending on the context. Hence, this is one of the most productive Latin lexical units in modern medical discourse.\n\n【29】1.  2.\n    \n    Further, we distinguished a subgroup of compound English-Latin word phrases (we refer to them as the _hybrid terms_ ) containing both assimilated and nonassimilated lexical units: _inferior vena cava_ ( _n_ \\= 122 cases), _latissimus dorsi muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 6), _latissimus dorsi flap_ ( _n_ \\= 6), _carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma_ ( _n_ \\= 5), _dorsum of the tongue_ ( _n_ \\= 5), _the abductor hallucis muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 4), _quadriceps femoris muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 3), _levator palpebrae muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 3), _orbicularis oris muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 2), _the rectus femoris muscle_ ( _n_ \\= 2), _ex vacuo dilatation_ ( _n_ \\= 1), and _quadratus femoris_ muscle ( _n_ \\= 1).\n    \n2.  3.\n    \n    The group of abbreviations is represented by lexical units such as _i.e._ ( _id est_ , meaning “that is”; _n_ \\= 85 cases); _e.g._ ( _exempli gratia_ , meaning “for example”; _n_ \\= 81 cases); _etc._ ( _et cetera_ , meaning “and so on”; _n_ \\= 18 cases); _q.i.d._ ( _quarter in die_ , meaning “four times per day” as used in prescriptions; _n_ \\= 12); _b.i.d._ ( _bis in die_ , meaning “twice per day”; _n_ \\= 11); _t.i.d._ ( _ter in die_ , meaning “three times per day”; _n_ \\= 8); _PRN_ ( _pro re nata_ , meaning “as and when necessary”; _n_ \\= 1); _qAM_ ( _quaque die ante meridiem_ , meaning “every morning”; _n_ \\= 1); _qHS_ ( _quaque hora somni_ , meaning “every bedtime”; _n_ \\= 1); and _qPM_ ( _quaque die post meridiem_ , meaning “every evening”; _n_ \\= 1).\n    \n\n【30】As a next step, we organized the collected material into thematic groups and determined the frequency of their use in _JMCR_ . Hence, the thematic typology comprises the groups of Latin terms that signify the following:\n\n【31】1.  1.\n    \n    Medical phenomena and processes:\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Anatomical descriptions (for example, phrases with terms such as _musculus, os_ , _levator_ , _abductor_ , and so forth)\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Physiological conditions (for example, _virgo intacta_ , _primigravida_ , _nullipara_ , _ante partum_ , _postpartum_ , and so forth)\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Methods of studies and experiments (for example, _in vivo_ , _in vitro_ , _in situ_ , and so forth)\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Indications to treatment and routes of administering medications (for example, _mane_ , _ter in die_ , _quarter in die_ , _per os_ , and so forth)\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Pathological conditions (for example, _cor pulmonale_ , _carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma_ , _placenta previa percreta_ , and so forth)\n        \n2.  2.\n    \n    Academic language that maintains the coherence and cohesion of the discourse (for example, _inter alia_ , _in toto_ , and so forth).\n    \n\n【32】Table 1 demonstrates the results of our quantitative analysis and shows the correlation between the structure and thematic content of Latin terms in _JMCR._\n\n【33】**Table 1 Latin terms and terminological collocations in _Journal of Medical Case Reports_**\n\n【34】Full size table\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】The research revealed that Latin terminology is most frequently used to refer to methods of studies and experiments (464 two-word phrases). Next are the categories of anatomical descriptions (236) and academic language (258), followed by indications for treatment (139 units). Latin terminology, used for denoting physiological conditions, is represented by 135 units, whereas the group of pathological conditions is the least “latinized” category (65 cases). In fact, the majority of MCRs under consideration give preference to English equivalents of names of pathological conditions (for instance, _acute abdomen_ rather than _abdomen acutum_ as in \\[ 13 \\]).\n\n【37】In our opinion, Latin terminology is well-preserved in the names for methods of studies and experiments, because it is neutral (favoring no particular national language), constant, and internationally accepted. Furthermore, it is necessary to observe that this group of terms is dominated by two-word expressions, which enable the authors to render their message accurately and concisely.\n\n【38】One cannot overestimate the role of Latin in anatomical nomenclature, “whose international version remains Latin in the full extent” \\[ 5 \\]. Among the advantages of Latin in anatomy, one should mention terminological continuity and constancy \\[ 5 \\], which date back to early human history. In fact, the first anatomical descriptions were written by Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen and subsequently improved by Vesalius, Fabricius, and Harvey \\[ 22 \\]. For instance, the names of muscles have not changed since their introduction by Vesalius in 1543 \\[ 23 \\]. Thus, Latin anatomical terminology provides a rich and well-established stock of vocabulary that releases modern researchers from the necessity of “reinventing the wheel.”\n\n【39】Moreover, it is highly important to use Latin correctly. Indeed, the use of correct Latin terms reflects the author’s excellence and scholarly accomplishments. It is also essential for “the rigor, stability, and universality of the nomenclature” \\[ 24 \\]. The problems of correct use of Latin terms in medical research have repeatedly attracted scholars’ attention. For instance, Neumann has extensively studied these issues in anatomy \\[ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 \\]. It is necessary to instruct students about the potential spelling errors that may occur when using Latin terminology, for example, in the subject-verb agreement in number or when pluralizing terms such as _septum_ , _dorsum_ , _labium_ , and so forth. Table 2 demonstrates the most challenging cases of using plural forms of Latin in MCRs.\n\n【40】**Table 2 Latin plural endings in English medical terminology**\n\n【41】Full size table\n\n【42】Latin terms in the names of indications for treatment (such as _PRN_ \\[ _pro re nata_ \\], _t.i.d._ \\[ _ter in die_ \\], and so forth) are widely used in the modern clinical settings all over the world. This is due to the fact that these terms are transnational, stable, and internationally understood. Furthermore, such terms are effective and concise tools of conveying the author’s message as quickly as possible.\n\n【43】Latin has a unique status as the fundamental principle of scientific style and academic language. Mastering the basics of Latin has survived from ancient times as a continuous tradition and an effective means of capturing, reflecting, and disseminating scholarly knowledge. In fact, scientific genres such as thesis, monograph, article, report, polemic presentation, and textbook were written in Latin until as late as the 19th century. Unlike many ancient languages that are now forgotten, Latin became the language of science with a clearly focused international communicative status, particularly in medicine, and “went far beyond the territory occupied by its speakers in ancient times” \\[ 8 \\]. Throughout human history, Latin performed the epistemological function and served as a means of “accumulation, reception, transmission and popularization of achievements in various areas of medical science” \\[ 8 \\]. Nowadays, the use of Latin academic expressions is a strong tradition in scholarly communities. In other words, Latin maintains the position of _lingua franca_ among educated people _,_ regardless of their nationality. Besides this respect for tradition, these terms enable authors to express themselves succinctly and concisely.\n\n【44】The pathophysiology nomenclature is rooted in the ancient Greek tradition, which subsequently underwent latinization. For instance, terms such as _arthritis_ , _carcinoma_ , _cholera_ , _emphysema_ , _erythema_ , _herpes_ , _kyphosis_ , _nephritis_ , _pleuritis_ , _typhus_ , and many others were first described in _Corpus Hippocraticum_ (in the fifth to fourth centuries b.c.e. ) and are still used today. Among the names for pathological conditions, one should also mention eponyms, such as _facies Hippocratĭca_ , _succussio Hippocrătis_ , _unguis Hippocratĭcus_ , and so forth, which are also internationally used and understood. In our opinion, such eponymic terms disclose the evolution of medical research and practice, provide continuity of scientific knowledge, and contribute to the formation of terminological competence of medical students \\[ 29 \\]. Furthermore, eponyms “bring colour to medicine, embed medical traditions and culture to our history” \\[ 30 \\]. Thus, Latin clinical terminology is the result of the centuries-old history of world medical development, which provides a neutral ground for medical professionals from different countries. Moreover, Latin and latinized Greek are productive tools for coining new terms. For instance, the term _appendicitis_ was used for the first time in 1886 in _American Journal of Medical Science_ . Hence, the ability to build new compound words also indicates the viability of this terminological corpus.\n\n【45】In terms of structure, one-word terminological phrases (that is, pure Latin terms) are found in 57 MCRs (physiological conditions, _n_ \\= 32; academic language, _n_ \\= 21; indications for treatment, _n_ \\= 4). At the same time, the one-word semiassimilated terms were not calculated in this study, owing to their widespread occurrence in the medical language and strong penetration into English dictionaries. Meanwhile, the nonassimilated multiple-word terms are of particular interest because this lexical layer preserves the grammatical features of Latin. The two-word terms are used most often, comprising 810 cases (mostly the methods of studies and examination, _n_ \\= 464; followed by indications for treatment, _n_ \\= 100; physiological conditions, _n_ \\= 97; anatomical descriptions, _n_ \\= 64; academic language, _n_ \\= 52; and pathological conditions, _n_ \\= 33). Three-word collocations are least frequently used, comprising 52 cases (anatomical descriptions, _n_ \\= 24; pathological conditions, _n_ \\= 27; and academic language, _n_ \\= 1); compound (“hybrid”) English-Latin word phrases, comprising 162 cases (mostly anatomical descriptions, _n_ \\= 151; followed by physiological conditions, _n_ \\= 6; and pathological conditions, _n_ \\= 5); and abbreviations, comprising 219 cases (academic language, _n_ \\= 184; indications to treatment, _n_ \\= 35).\n\n【46】The present study demonstrates the long-standing predominance and viability of Latin in modern MCRs. One can observe that the undeniable advantage of one-word Latin terms, as in the example of _mane_ , is their conciseness, which is essential for MCRs as a genre \\[ 31 \\]. Likewise, two-word Latin terms, such as _in vitro_ , _ex vitro_ , _in vivo_ , _ex vivo_ , _in situ_ , and so forth, as well as abbreviations enable the transfer of the maximum amount of necessary information using the minimum linguistic tools.\n\n【47】In modern MCRs, three-word Latin terms, for example, _abductor digiti minimi_ , _levator palpebrae superioris_ , and so forth, are represented largely by anatomical notions. This feature results from the well-developed system of anatomical terminology that was meticulously arranged and organized by the ancient Romans. Hence, it is essential for medical professionals to be aware of correct forms of nominative plurals, genitive singular and plural, Latin adjectives, and so forth in order to avoid misspelling in medical writing.\n\n【48】The use of “hybrid” (English-Latin) word phrases in MCRs indicates that Latin and English in modern medical terminology reside in a state of natural symbiosis. We strongly agree with Marecková _et al_ . \\[ 5 \\] that, on the one hand, Latin has found its “continuation” in English and thus has managed to retain “its unique standing” and, on the other hand, the spread of English medical terminology all over the world was facilitated largely by its Latin origins.\n\n【49】Several studies \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\] have addressed the issue of replacement of Latin by English. It is our opinion that, despite the spread of the English language, Latin firmly maintains its important and relevant position in the modern world. First, Latin is unbound in terms of territory: It possesses a unique status of a globally neutral vehicle of medical communication, and thus its use gives respect to other national languages. It should be remembered that the official languages of the United Nations (UN) are the six languages used for written documents and meetings of the UN. In other words, Latin terms are not only international but even “supranational.” Latin terminology is unambiguous, succinct, concise, and easy to pronounce. Furthermore, knowledge of Lain etymologies promotes correct English spelling and understanding of medical terminology. Moreover, through studying Latin, a person gains an understanding of the mechanisms and structure of any other language \\[ 32 \\]. In addition, for representatives of Slavic nations, Latin becomes virtually a key to Western civilization because it is incorporated into most European languages. Hence, by means of learning Latin, English medical terminology becomes transparent and understandable for the Slavs. It should be noted that most Latin and latinized Greek terms have been used for over 2000 years. As a result, the use of Latin provides the intellectual and terminological continuity of Western medicine that is rooted in ancient times. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the original version of _Magna Charta Universitatum Europaeum_ (1986) was written in Latin to celebrate and encourage the deepest values of European university traditions.\n\n【50】Thus, using Latin terms promotes the conciseness of MCRs, contributes to the coherence and cohesion of narratives in MCRs, and constitutes a rich and viable academic layer of medical terminology. Thus, our present research reveals that the use of Latin fully complies with the communicative strategies of MCRs as a genre, such as conciseness, narrative style, and educational value \\[ 31 \\].\n\n【51】It is also essential to identify the countries where Latin terminological units are the most common in medical writing. According to our country-wise analysis of using Latin in MCRs, the following are the countries where Latin terminological units are the most common in medical writing (from highest to lowest frequency): the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, India, Germany, Australia, Greece, France, Japan, Malaysia, China, Nigeria, Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Kosovo, New Zealand, Senegal, Tanzania, Cameroon, Egypt, Iran, Brunei, and Thailand.\n\n【52】Recent research \\[ 33 \\] has been focused on the relevance of Latin in the modern curricula at universities. Marecková _et al_ . referred to the neo-Latin adage “ _Invia est in medicina via sine lingua Latina_ ” (“The way without Latin is impassable in medicine”) \\[ 5 \\] and advocated the need for teaching Latin terminology at medical universities. These scholars contended that it is essential to provide students “with a functional instruction on precise and linguistically correct usage of the terminological apparatus” \\[ 5 \\]. Rein conducted a survey of students in Estonia and found that more than half of respondents answered that Latin continues to maintain its position “as the international language of medicine” \\[ 33 \\]. Smith _et al_ . \\[ 34 \\] provided scientific evidence that students’ awareness of Greek and Latin etymologies improves their academic performance when learning medical terminology. Turmezei \\[ 35 \\] asserted that understanding anatomical etymology enhances the training process and reinforces memorization. Likewise, Stephens and Moxham \\[ 36 \\] contended that medical students should acquire basic understanding of and “have some formal or informal instruction in classical Greek and Latin” as they pertain to medical terminology. In our previous research \\[ 37 , 38 \\], we also observed that instruction in medical terminology promotes the development of core competencies of a future doctor.\n\n【53】It is our belief that the analysis of structural, thematic, and contextual features of Latin terms in case reports should be an integral part of curricula at medical universities. In countries where higher medical education includes academic subjects such as “Latin and Medical Terminology” and/or “English for Specific Purposes” (for example, in Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Russia), the use of Latin in MCRs should be added as an extracurricular submodule during the first year of study. At the same time, for countries where Latin and English are not a compulsory part of the medical curriculum, these issues should be discussed in the framework of an additional module (for example, “Latin for Academic Purposes”).\n\n【54】The results of this research will be integrated into the curriculum of Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy with the aim of improving the writing proficiency among undergraduate students. The implementation plan comprises the following steps:\n\n【55】1.  1.\n    \n    Curriculum planning and design\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Defining curriculum objectives and instructional strategies\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Identifying the stakeholders\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Analyzing students’ needs and staff resources\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Reviewing the existing curricula and available instruction resources\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Developing and expanding the cocurricular resources: republication of educational literature, developed by the authors of this paper ( _Latin-Ukrainian Thesaurus of Clinical Terms_ \\[ 9 \\] and _English for Professional Use: Dentistry_ \\[ 39 \\]), with additional units and sections on Latin terms and expressions that are used in MCRs most frequently; publication of _Medical English for Academic and Teaching Purposes_ \\[ 40 \\], focused on improvement of the writing skills demonstrated in MCRs and development of teaching staff\n        \n    6.  f.\n        \n        Aligning the submodule with the existing curricula of academic subjects “Latin and Medical Terminology” and “English for Specific Purposes” that Ukrainian students learn during the first and second years of study\n        \n2.  2.\n    \n    Project management\n    \n    1.  a.\n        \n        Integrating the results of the present research with the existing curriculum in Ukraine through adding an extracurricular submodule on “Latin for Academic Purposes” to medical training courses\n        \n    2.  b.\n        \n        Monitoring the project by analyzing short-term, midterm, and end-of-year outcomes (collecting samples of student writing to measure progress)\n        \n    3.  c.\n        \n        Quality control by questionnaire surveys of students\n        \n    4.  d.\n        \n        Reviewing the results and troubleshooting\n        \n    5.  e.\n        \n        Evaluating and communicating the results with the stakeholders\n        \n3.  3.\n    \n    Incorporating best practices by developing comprehensive national guidelines for using Latin in MCRs for further dissemination\n    \n\n【56】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【57】The adequate use of Latin terms in MCRs is an essential prerequisite of effective sharing one’s clinical findings with fellow researchers from all over the world. First, using Latin promotes the conciseness of MCRs because the Latin lexis is internationally adopted and understood. Second, Latin expressions contribute to the coherence of narratives in MCRs. Third, Latin terms constitute an ever-present and timeless lexical layer of medical terminology, and their appropriate use adds to the overall scholarly value and educational intentions of MCRs. Therefore, it is highly important to draw the attention of future medical professionals to the Latin terms and expressions that are used in case reports most frequently. It is our belief that the use of Latin in MCRs requires further examination in other scholarly journals that are registered in PubMed and other databases \\[ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 \\], which will consequently enable the conduct of comparative studies of different academic periodicals and provide a deeper understanding of the role of Latin in modern medical discourse.\n\n【58】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【59】_JMCR_ :\n\n【60】_Journal of Medical Case Reports_\n\n【61】MCR:\n\n【62】Medical case report\n\n【63】UN:\n\n【64】United Nations", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Recently, some evidence has been emerging on the use of Ayurveda for treatment of COVID-19. The classical texts of Ayurvedic medicine such as _Charaka Samhita_ and _Sushruta Samhita_ contain descriptions of pandemics of similar proportions and describe them as _Janapadoddhvansa_ , meaning the destruction of communities, along with their causes and treatment.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The case reported herein is a 55-year-old man from Delhi, India, with confirmed (tested) COVID-19, who first took MWM for 7 days before seeking integrative therapy. The patient has comorbidities including DM, HTN, hypothyroidism and CKD and had developed symptoms including fever (which was resolved by the time integrative therapy was started), sore throat, dry cough, body aches, weakness, bad taste and smell, and heaviness in the abdomen. Based on the patient’s symptoms and comorbidities, a treatment plan including Ayurvedic medicines, Yoga protocol, dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications was prescribed by a registered Ayurveda doctor and a Yoga consultant. The patient started experiencing improvement in all the symptoms within 2 days after starting the treatment; he reported approximately \\\\(75\\\\%\\\\) relief from the symptoms after 5 days, and almost complete relief within 9 days. Also, the blood sugar levels (both fasting blood sugar \\[FBS\\] and postprandial blood sugar \\[PPBS\\]) exhibited significant improvement after 5 days, and decreased to within the normal range within 12 days. Besides relief in symptoms, the patient’s real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test done on the 19th day returned negative results.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Integrative therapy was found to be effective in mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19 in this patient with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, a significant improvement in blood sugar levels (not under control with modern medicine) was also achieved. Integrative therapy based on the classical texts of Ayurveda and Yoga may offer a promising and scalable treatment option for COVID-19 patients. A case series or a suitably designed randomized controlled trial is needed to assess its efficacy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc on every aspect of human life on planet Earth. As on August 28, 2020, more than 24.4 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 227 countries and territories, resulting in more than 831,827 deaths \\[ 1 \\]. Although there are several clinical trials underway, no cure has yet been found for COVID-19 in modern western medicine (MWM).\n\n【10】The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or old age leads to poorer clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\], and presents additional challenges in the management of the illness. Physical inactivity, high-fat diet and uncontrolled HTN in addition to superposed infection are strong risk factors for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial toxicity in COVID-19 \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The mortality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China has been reported as \\\\(3.1\\\\%\\\\) \\[ 2 \\], while among these hospitalized patients, for those who have one or more of the nine comorbidities (DM, HTN, COPD, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hepatitis B infection, malignancy, chronic kidney disease \\[CKD\\], immunodeficiency), the mortality rate has been reported as \\\\(8.8\\\\%\\\\) \\[ 2 \\]. In the same cohort, the percentage of patients for whom the illness progresses to a severe stage has been reported at \\\\(16\\\\%\\\\) , whereas for patients with comorbidities, the corresponding percentage is substantially higher, at \\\\(32.8\\\\%\\\\) . Although the precise figures may vary with geography, the fact that the presence of comorbidities leads to poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients has been independently confirmed in many studies from various countries \\[ 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【11】Ayurveda is a system of traditional Indian medicine which is based on sound therapeutic principles and has a proven history of empirical use \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. It is one of the world’s oldest holistic healing systems. According to the Ayurvedic system of medicine, a healthy person should have a stable equilibrium (congenial homeostasis) of _Doshas_ ( _Vata_ , _Pitta_ , _Kapha_ —psycho-biological rhythms), _Agni_ (metabolism/digestion), _Dhatu_ (body tissues/elements that provide them nourishment) and _Mala_ (excreta), and the well-being of senses, mind and soul \\[ 10 \\]. Every individual has a unique combination of these constituent elements, which is known as the individual’s _Prakruti_ or unique mind-body constitution (Ashtanga Hridaya, Sharira Sthana, Chapter 3, Verse 83) \\[ 12 \\]. When an imbalance occurs in this equilibrium, it causes disease, and the Ayurvedic system of medicine seeks to remove this imbalance, to regain a healthy state \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【12】The occurrence of disease can be further understood as follows: the abovementioned constituent elements have a propensity to change, influenced by various factors such as the environment we live in, change in seasons, the food that is consumed, negative experiences, presence of physical toxins, irritants, microorganism or impurities, unhealthy habits and emotions. These influences distort the natural balance of these elements in an individual, increase _ama_ (toxins), contributing to _vikruti_ (vitiation of the constituent elements); this imbalance manifests as a lack of energy, excess mucous, inflammation, and a wide variety of dysfunction and diseases \\[ 10 , 11 , 13 \\]. By using the Ayurvedic principles, the unique _Prakruti_ (constitution) of the individual is assessed, the _vikruti_ (vitiation) that has occurred is diagnosed and a personalized treatment plan is advised accordingly. Thus, the Ayurveda system of medicine is inherently personalized, which treats the patient by considering the individual constitution ( _Prakruti_ ) as well as the causes of the symptoms ( _vikruti_ ).\n\n【13】Classical Ayurveda texts such as _Charaka Samhita_ ( _Vimana Sthana_ , Chapter 3) \\[ 11 \\] and _Sushruta Samhita_ ( _Sutra Sthana_ , Chapter 6, Verses 19, 20) \\[ 10 \\] contain descriptions of pandemics and describe them as _Janapadoddhvansa_ —Jana-pada (meaning community) + Udhvansa (meaning destruction), literally translating to “destruction of communities.” These texts offer specific guidelines with regard to the treatment of diseases that affect people during _Janapadoddhvansa_ .\n\n【14】Yoga is yet another ancient wisdom from India, which is an extremely deep science that helps one lead a harmonious life \\[ 14 \\]. The classical text _Yoga Vasishta_ \\[ 15 \\] (Book 6, Chapter 81) describes a healthy person as one who is free from physical disease as well as from erroneous affections of the mind. Yoga deals with the holistic principle of body-mind-soul, which proclaims that a human being can experience five dimensions of gross and subtle existence, called _Pancha kosha_ , or five sheaths, namely _Annamaya_ (physical body), _Pranamaya_ (energy field), _Manomaya_ (mental dimension), _Vijnanamaya_ (related to intuitive knowledge) and _Anandamaya_ (level of bliss) _kosha_ ( _Taittiriya Upanishad_ ) \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. _Prana_ (the vital life force that is responsible for all the gross and subtle activities) pervades all five sheaths, and nourishes and sustains them \\[ 17 \\]. Yogic practices are aimed at achieving the proper distribution and circulation of _Prana_ within the gross and subtle realms of existence, for holistic well-being.\n\n【15】Ayurveda also describes the concept of _Panchaprana_ or _Pancha Vayu_ (five manifestations of the vital life force in the human body) ( _Ashtanga Hridaya_ , _Sutra Sthan_ , Chapter 12, Verse 4) \\[ 12 \\]. _Panchaprana_ govern different areas of the body and different physical, neurological and mental activities. When they are functioning harmoniously, they promote the health and vitality of the body and mind, and elevate one spiritually.\n\n【16】Thus, both Ayurveda and Yoga are powerful sciences that are aimed at the proper modulation of _Prana_ in the human being, and when administered together in an integrative manner, these can be extremely effective with regard to restoring health, as well as managing or curing diseases.\n\n【17】In this paper we report presumably the first high-risk case of COVID-19 (with reference to the studies available in peer-reviewed open literature), treated successfully using integrative therapy comprising Ayurveda and Yoga. Although there have been some case reports (see the section on Related Works) and theoretical works on the use of Ayurveda or Yoga for COVID-19, the authors are not aware of any published work reporting the successful treatment of high-risk cases of COVID-19 through Ayurveda or Yoga. The present case offers sufficiently supportive evidence that an integrative therapy plan based on Yoga and Ayurveda can be useful in treating even high-risk cases of COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. With regard to the work ahead, a suitably designed case series or randomized controlled trial (RCT) would be advisable to further establish its efficacy for high-risk COVID-19 patients.\n\n【18】Related works\n-------------\n\n【19】There is emerging evidence that Ayurvedic treatment methodologies and herbal medicines may be effective in combating COVID-19. Girijaa and Sivan \\[ 18 \\] describe one of the first case reports of a patient with COVID-19 treated entirely with Ayurveda. In a study using molecular dynamics simulations, Kumar _et al._ \\[ 19 \\] report that withaferin A (Wi-A) and withanone (Wi-N), derived from a common Ayurvedic herb called _Ashwagandha_ , may block the entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells. Several herbs including _Tulsi_ ( _Ocimum sanctum_ ) and _Haldi_ ( _Curcuma longa_ —turmeric) used as Ayurvedic medicines are well known for their immunomodulatory properties \\[ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 \\]. Ayurvedic treatment has also been found to be effective in other COVID-like illnesses such as influenza \\[ 25 , 26 , 27 \\] and chikungunya \\[ 28 \\]. Several studies have been conducted to understand the COVID-19 pandemic and the conditions that it causes from the perspective of Ayurveda \\[ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 \\]. Based on these observations and the study of classical Ayurveda texts, several experts have proposed the use of Ayurveda for both prophylactic \\[ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 \\] and therapeutic purposes \\[ 34 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 \\] in COVID-19. Some studies have also suggested that lifestyle modifications, such as immunity-boosting food, can aid in fighting the current situation \\[ 59 \\]. Many studies have come up with suggestions for reforms in policies enabling the adoption of Ayurveda in the treatment plan for COVID-19 patients \\[ 42 , 60 , 61 , 62 \\]. The Government of India, Ministry of AYUSH, has issued an advisory comprising Ayurveda-based immunity-boosting measures for self-care during the COVID-19 crisis \\[ 63 \\], and an advisory for the general public on the use of Ayurveda (and other traditional systems of medicine) as a preventive measure for COVID-19 as well as for managing the symptoms of COVID-19 \\[ 64 \\]. The same department also issued guidelines for Ayurveda practitioners \\[ 65 \\] and Yoga practitioners \\[ 66 \\] for treating COVID-19 patients. Several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of Ayurveda-based interventions for both prophylactic and therapeutic use in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n【20】Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is based on principles similar to those of Ayurveda, has been used extensively in China for treating COVID-19. The Chinese government has actively promoted the use of TCM for management of COVID-19. As a result, several studies have been published on the use of TCM for COVID-19 \\[ 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 \\]. The Chinese doctors now recommend the use of TCM along with western medicine in treating COVID-19 \\[ 71 , 72 \\]. According to Yang _et al_ . \\[ 73 \\], more than 85% of the cases in China have received TCM-based treatment. Several RCTs on TCM are presently in different stages of completion. Most of the reviews on RCTs on the efficacy of TCM for COVID-19 \\[ 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 \\] report positive findings (see \\[ 79 , 80 \\] for reviews on the mechanism of action of TCM). Several countries have issued guidelines for the use of traditional medicine for COVID-19. See \\[ 81 , 82 \\] for a review of such guidelines.\n\n【21】Despite the above studies on TCM, caution has also been advised in the use of TCM for COVID-19. For example, Gray and Belessis \\[ 83 \\] state that the use of TCM may cause “more harm than good.” Cyranoski \\[ 84 \\] argues that TCM is still an unproven treatment and is being excessively promoted by certain governments. A review by Pang _et al._ \\[ 85 \\] reported that after a comprehensive literature search, they found 26 published clinical controlled trials of TCM for COVID-19, among which 11 were RCTs with 1301 patients, but none of the RCTs were placebo-controlled or double-blinded. There was significant variation in the types of patients, interventions and outcomes in different RCTs. Also, for most of the published trials, the protocols had not been registered before case recruitment. Thus, based on the above observations, it may be concluded that TCM may offer a promising option for treating COVID-19, yet suitably designed multi-country RCTs may be needed to assess its efficacy.\n\n【22】In light of the above observations, the present integrative therapy plan was designed, which comprises elements of Yoga and Ayurveda, along with dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications, as a treatment option for COVID-19. It was hypothesized that integrative therapy based on Ayurveda and Yoga would be effective in treating COVID-19 patients.\n\n【23】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【24】### Patient information\n\n【25】A Delhi-based 55-year-old man (confirmed positive) COVID-19 patient (height: 5′3″; weight: approximately 70 kg) completed the online registration and consent forms on July 1, 2020, to receive Yoga and Ayurveda-based integrative therapy via telemedicine. The Ayurveda doctor and the Yoga consultant talked to the patient over the phone the same day to take his medical history and symptoms pertaining to COVID-19, and to prescribe integrative therapy-based treatment. The patient reported that his oxygen saturation value ranged between 95% and 98% (never required oxygen supplementation) and his blood pressure was under control (with medication).\n\n【26】#### History of the present illness\n\n【27】The patient was asymptomatic 3 weeks prior to the first consultation for the integrative therapy. Later, he started developing symptoms of pneumonia, after which he went to a hospital and underwent the RT-PCR test. The patient was found to be positive on June 24, 2020. Subsequently, he was prescribed the following allopathic medications for 10 days: nitazoxanide 500 mg, doxycycline 100 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg, vitamin C, multivitamin (methylcobalamin, pyridoxine and folic acid) and levocetirizine 5 mg. On July 1, 2020, at the time of the first consultation for the integrative therapy, the patient was quarantined at home (although the doctors had advised hospitalization).\n\n【28】#### Complaints due to present illness\n\n【29】##### Resolved prior to the first consultation\n\n【30】The patient had fever for about 10 days until June 22, 2020, after which he never had fever again. He also reported having had a dry cough and body aches earlier, both of which no longer persisted at the time of his first consultation.\n\n【31】##### Existing at the time of the first consultation\n\n【32】The patient reported experiencing occasional obstruction in the throat while speaking for a substantial duration of time. He also felt weak and sounded very low and lacking in energy. According to the patient’s description, he experienced exhaustion even in doing his own daily chores. The patient had heaviness in the abdomen (gastric upset) and often experienced a bloated feeling. Also, the patient had been having a sense of bad smell and taste, which occurred less frequently then as compared to earlier. The patient’s appetite was reduced.\n\n【33】#### Other existing illnesses/comorbidities\n\n【34】The patient was found to have the following comorbidities at the time of the first consultation. He had type 2 DM for the past 10 years and had been on allopathic medication (glimepiride 2 mg, vildagliptin 50 mg, voglibose 0.3 mg) for the same. However, despite regular use of the prescribed medicine, the illness was not very well controlled, with fasting blood sugar (FBS) mostly remaining above 200 mg/dl and postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) above 250 mg/dl, as well as renal dysfunction (as evident in his reports dated June 23, 2020). The patient was also found to be hypertensive for the past 20 years, and had been on allopathic medication (Torcilin-10); HTN was under control with the medication. He had hypothyroidism for 22 years which was being treated with allopathic medication (levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg) and was under control.\n\n【35】#### Family and social history\n\n【36】The patient had a family history of HTN in the father, grandfather and paternal uncle. There was no family history of DM. The patient had no history of smoking or taking alcohol.\n\n【37】Since the patient was advised through telemedicine, physical examination was not possible.\n\n【38】#### Occupational details\n\n【39】The patient is a self-employed businessman.\n\n【40】#### History of past illnesses\n\n【41】The patient had undergone cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder) 20 years earlier.\n\n【42】#### Data from diagnostic tests\n\n【43】The data from hematology, biochemistry and ultrasound reports is as follows. The parameters marked with an asterisk (\\*) have values outside the reference range.\n\n【44】The hematology report of the patient, dated June 22, 2020, gave the following information:\n\n【45】*   Complete blood count (white blood cell count 6.54 × \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; neutrophil percent \\\\(68.5\\\\%\\\\) ; lymphocyte percent \\\\(20.8\\\\%\\\\) ; monocyte percent\\* \\\\(9.1\\\\%\\\\) ; eosinophil percent\\* \\\\(0.8\\\\%\\\\) ; basophil percent \\\\(0.2\\\\%\\\\) ; neutrophil number 4.48 × \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; lymphocyte number 1.36 × \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; monocyte number 0.6 × \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; red blood cell count 5.34 × \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; hemoglobin concentration\\* 11.4g/dl; hematocrit\\* \\\\(34.6\\\\%\\\\) ; mean corpuscular volume\\* 64.8fL; mean corpuscular hemoglobin\\* 21.3pg; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 32.9g/dl; red cell distribution width\\* \\\\(17.9\\\\%\\\\) ; platelet count\\* 50x \\\\(10^3\\\\) /μl; mean platelet volume 10.3fl; procalcitonin\\* \\\\(0.051\\\\%\\\\) ; platelet distribution width\\* \\\\(14\\\\%\\\\) —Remarks: hypochromia, microcytosis).\n    \n*   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\* 22 mm first hour.\n    \n\n【46】The biochemistry report dated June 22, 2020, gave the following information:\n\n【47】*   Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)\\* (high-performance liquid chromatography on D10 analyzer) \\\\(9.2\\\\%\\\\) — Remarks: Average blood glucose concentration is around 210–220 mg/dl.\n    \n*   Renal profile (blood urine nitrogen—kinetic ultraviolet test\\* 30.4 mg/dl; creatinine—kinetic color test\\* 1.83 mg/dl; uric acid—enzyme color test\\* 10.68 mg/dl; sodium\\* 132 mEq/l; potassium\\* 5.31mEq/l; calcium—color test 9.4 mg/dl; inorganic phosphorus—UV test 3.0 mg/dl—Remarks: deranged kidney function, electrolyte imbalance).\n    \n\n【48】The ultrasound (whole abdomen) report, dated June 23, 2020, mentioned:\n\n【49】*   Grade II hepatic steatosis, hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical hernia.\n    \n\n【50】### Ayurvedic interpretation of the patient’s condition\n\n【51】#### Diagnosis\n\n【52】Based on the above history and discussion with the Ayurvedic doctor and Yoga consultant, the diagnosis of the patient’s illness included COVID-19, with type 2 DM, HTN, hypothyroidism and CKD. Except for the inability to perform a physical examination, no known diagnostic challenges were encountered.\n\n【53】#### Pathophysiology\n\n【54】According to Ayurvedic principles, because _jwara_ (fever), _shvasa_ (respiratory distress) and _kasa_ (cough) are the three major symptoms of this _roga_ (disease), the _roga marga_ (pathway of disease) of this _roga_ can be considered to be _Abhyantara_ (internal origin) \\[ 18 \\]. Because there is respiratory distress, along with other symptoms, there is _Pranavaha Sroto Dushti_ (obstruction of the _Pranavaha Srotas_ , that is, the subtle micro-channels in the body that are the pathways for the vital life force); also, one of the primary seats of this disease is _Uras_ (chest region) \\[ 18 \\]. Based on these observations, this disease can be characterized as _Agantuja Sannipataja Jwara_ , wherein _Vata-Kapha doshas_ are primarily vitiated \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【55】In _Agantuja Sannipataja Jwara_ , _Agantuja_ implies _Agantu_ (external), which is caused by _Bhoota Abhishanga_ (external causative factors like a virus); this in turn causes the vitiation of all three _Doshas_ , that is _Vata_ , _Pitta_ and _Kapha_ \\[ 18 \\]. Because of the vitiation of all three _Doshas_ , the term _Sannipataja_ is used \\[ 18 \\]. As per Ayurvedic principles, the treatment of such a _Jwara_ is similar to that of _Nija Jwara_ , that is, one caused by vitiation of _Doshas_ \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【56】#### Etiology\n\n【57】According to Ayurvedic principles, this disease can be correlated with _Agantuja Sannipataja Jwara_ , wherein _Vata-Kapha_ are primarily vitiated \\[ 18 \\]. Furthermore, this is an extremely contagious disease, caused by _Bhoota Abhishanga_ (external causative factors like virus), that is characterized in Ayurvedic texts as a _Janapadoddhvansa_ disease \\[ 10 , 11 , 18 \\]. Classical Ayurvedic texts like _Charaka Samhita_ ( _Vimana Sthana_ —Chapter 3) \\[ 11 \\] and _Sushruta Samhita_ ( _Sutra Sthana_ , Chapter 6, Verses 19, 20) \\[ 10 \\] contain descriptions of similar pandemics, and describe them as _Janapadoddhvansa_ — _Janapada_ , meaning community + _Uddhvansa_ , meaning destruction—literally translating to destruction of communities. The symptoms of illness during _Janapadoddhvansa_ , as mentioned in classical texts, include cough, dyspnea, asthma, vomiting, nasal catarrh (common cold), headache and fever \\[ 10 \\]. These texts also offer specific guidelines with regard to the treatment of diseases that affect people during _Janapadoddhvansa_ , which include Ayurvedic medicines and spiritual practices \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【58】### Therapeutic intervention\n\n【59】This section presents the detailed treatment plan as well as the details of the subsequent compliance of the patient.\n\n【60】#### Treatment plan\n\n【61】The treatment plan comprised (1) Ayurvedic medicines, including _Giloy Ghanvati_ , _Ashwagandha vati_ , _Pathyadi Kwath_ ( _pravahi_ ) and _Diabecon_ ; (2) Yoga protocol, consisting of _Sukshma Vyayama_ , breathing exercises, _Asanas_ , _Shavasana_ , _Pranayama_ and _Dhyana_ ; (3) dietary modifications such as _Usha Paan_ , intake of fruits and green vegetables, and avoiding cold or heavy to digest food; and (4) lifestyle modifications such as adoption of spiritual practices.\n\n【62】The detailed prescription of Ayurvedic medicines including the dosage, specific details about each component of the Yoga protocol, and dietary and lifestyle modifications suggested, are given below.\n\n【63】The following Ayurvedic medicines were prescribed: _Giloy Ghanvati_ (three doses of two tablets each to be taken after meals with lukewarm water), _Ashwagandha vati_ (two doses of two tablets each to be taken after meals), _Pathyadi Kwath_ ( _pravahi_ ) (15 ml mixed with an equal quantity of lukewarm water to be consumed twice a day 30 minutes after meals), and _Diabecon_ (two doses of one tablet each to be taken 30 minutes before meals) (composition given in Table 1 ).\n\n【64】**Table 1 Composition of Ayurvedic medicines**\n\n【65】Full size table\n\n【66】The Yoga protocol designed for the patient included _Sukshma Vyayama_ (subtle joint movements for upper and lower body parts), breathing exercises (four exercises with five iterations in each), _Asanas_ ( _Parshva Sukhasana_ , _Sukhasana_ twist, _Utthana Mandukasana_ , _Ardha Ushtrasana_ , _Meru Vakrasana_ , _Ardha Halasana_ —with one leg folded, _Anantasana_ , _Pawan Muktasana_ ), _Shavasana_ , _Pranayama_ (sectional breathing and full yogic breathing, _Anulom-Vilom_ , _Bhramari_ , _Udgeet_ ),and _Dhyana_ (mindful breathing). Online guided sessions were given for the first 14 days, after which a recorded video of the protocol (with verbal instructions and demonstration) was provided for the patient to practice independently. Looking at the anxiety level of the patient, he was also advised to practice _Yoga Nidra_ \\[ 86 \\] (guided yogic sleep and relaxation practice), for which he was provided a link to guided audio instructions (in Hindi) by Swami Satyananda Saraswati; the duration of the session was 42 minutes.\n\n【67】The following dietary and lifestyle modifications were also recommended to the patient: beginning the day with _Usha paan_ , that is, drinking 2–3 glasses of lukewarm water, dietary intake of green vegetables, fruits, sprouts, barley, ragi flour, wheat porridge, _sahajan_ (drumstick), roasted gram, _methi_ (fenugreek), turmeric milk and dry fruits. Also, he was advised to refrain from cold, sour, fried, spicy or other food items that are heavy to digest; these included food items like curd, cold drinks, ice creams, chilled water, any refrigerated food items, black gram pulse (or any food item prepared with black gram), jackfruit and so on. Besides the above dietary recommendations, the patient was encouraged to undertake spiritual practices such as meditation and chanting at his convenience, for which he was provided a link to the suggested spiritual practices \\[ 87 \\].\n\n【68】A detailed justification of the proposed treatment plan is provided in Additional file 1 .\n\n【69】#### Compliance\n\n【70】The compliance details for the patient are given in Table 2 .\n\n【71】**Table 2 Compliance chart**\n\n【72】Full size table\n\n【73】Results\n-------\n\n【74】The first consultation with the patient was on July 1, 2020. He was under home isolation during the entire course of treatment. He started observing improvement in symptoms 2 days after the beginning of the treatment. The second RT-PCR was done on July 6, and was positive. A slight modification was made in the intervention on July 9, as reported in Table 3 . By the ninth day after starting the treatment, all the symptoms reported by the patient were resolved, except mild heaviness in the abdomen. The third RT-PCR done on July 14 was inconclusive, and another test was done on July 20, which was negative. Moreover, the patient’s uncontrolled blood sugar level showed significant improvement, with FBS of 90 mg/dl and PPBS of 140 mg/dl. Most importantly, the patient was in a much better state of mind (as evident in his feedback during consultations) and sounded much more confident by the end of the treatment.\n\n【75】**Table 3 Progress of the patient and evolution of the treatment plan**\n\n【76】Full size table\n\n【77】### Timeline of COVID-19 symptoms and treatment\n\n【78】A detailed description of the progress made by the patient and the medicines given during the course of the treatment is given in Table 3 .\n\n【79】### Follow-up\n\n【80】Follow-up was carried out until August 01, 2020. The patient continued to report mild heaviness in the abdomen until July 26, 2020. Thereafter, beginning July 27, 2020, he reported complete relief and rejuvenation. Besides the symptoms that appeared after infection with the coronavirus, it was observed that the other ailments which the patient had a history of were also positively impacted. Table 4 summarizes the improvements observed in the reports of the patient received on August 14, 2020, as compared to those received on June 23, 2020; significant improvement can be seen in the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values and renal profile parameters. In a more recent follow-up taken on October 23, 2020, the patient reported that he has continued to take the prescribed integrative therapy and is feeling complete relief of all his symptoms, including those related to his comorbidities. He further reported that, after looking at his present condition and most recent diagnostic test results, which indicated normal values for HbA1c, renal and lipid profile, his consulting physician further reduced his dosage of MWM for DM and HTN.\n\n【81】**Table 4 Follow-up details**\n\n【82】Full size table\n\n【83】Discussion\n----------\n\n【84】This study reports the successful treatment of a high-risk case of COVID-19 in a patient with several comorbidities, using an integrative therapy plan based on Yoga and Ayurveda, along with government-mandated modern western medicine treatment. Various unique aspects of this treatment approach are discussed below.\n\n【85】Since the patient’s fever was already controlled before enrollment in the integrative therapy, it is possible that he may have been in the convalescent phase at the time of enrollment. It must be noted that the Ayurveda system of medicine does not treat a disease condition in isolation; it treats a patient holistically for overall health while strengthening the body’s innate mechanisms involved in the restoration of health. The patient had uncontrolled blood sugar levels (which is known to adversely impact the immune system \\[ 88 \\]) for the past 10 years despite MWM treatment. The rapid reduction in the blood sugar levels after the initiation of integrative therapy may have contributed to a rapid recovery from the other symptoms and provided a faster path to the patient’s overall well-being. Besides the data presented in Table 4, according to a more recent follow-up taken on October 23, 2020, the patient has continued to use the prescribed integrative therapy as an adjunct to his MWM treatment for DM and reported HbA1c within normal limits. His MWM dose for DM has been further reduced by his consulting physician.\n\n【86】Besides the variety and severity of physiological symptoms posed by COVID-19, it deeply affects patients psychologically as well \\[ 89 , 90 \\]. Owing to the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus, the social stigma associated with the disease and the mandated isolation period have a deep adverse impact on the already nervous patients \\[ 91 \\]. This stress and anxiety may tend to further weaken the already compromised immune system, thereby potentially creating a vicious cycle. The patient treated in the present case was undergoing a similar situation at the time of the first consultation. With his symptoms prevailing for a long period, and two more of his family members being infected (one of them being hospitalized), the patient was in severe distress and exhibited anxiety. The integrative therapy administered to him not only helped manage his physiological symptoms, but also helped control his anxiety and stress (see for example \\[ 92 , 93 \\] for reviews on Yoga for anxiety). Within a week, an observable change in his confidence level was seen, and he appeared much more calm and peaceful. This change may be attributed to his regularity in attending the Yoga sessions, in addition to the relief experienced as his COVID-19 symptoms subsided. The authors believe that apart from boosting immunity, Yoga and _Pranayama_ practices contributed immensely to his overall healing by inducing a relaxation response \\[ 94 \\] in the body.\n\n【87】Promising results observed in several research studies suggest a favorable impact of Yoga on immune function, stress response, mental health and quality of life \\[ 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 \\]. The usefulness of nasal irrigation, a yogic practice, in improving the symptoms and health status of patients with sinonasal disease has also been observed \\[ 101 \\]. A key symptom associated with COVID-19 is the onset of dyspnea between the fourth and tenth days of illness \\[ 102 \\]. Studies suggest that COVID-19 patients with hypoxia or dyspnea may have a higher risk of mortality or developing severe symptoms \\[ 103 , 104 \\]. It has been reported that a simple intervention such as prone positioning improves clinical outcomes in such cases \\[ 105 , 106 \\]. Yoga and _Pranayama_ have been found helpful in cases of high-altitude hypoxia \\[ 107 \\] and several similar interventions in pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/COPD \\[ 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 \\]. Owing to its role in stress reduction and immune modulation, Yoga has been proposed as a complementary therapy in the management of infectious conditions like COVID-19 \\[ 115 \\]. Bushell _et al_ . \\[ 116 \\] suggest Yoga practices and meditation as a potential adjunctive treatment for COVID-19. In light of the above observations, and looking at the results of the present study, it is hypothesized that the integrative therapy plan, which comprises elements of Yoga and Ayurveda, along with dietary recommendations and lifestyle modifications, would be effective in treating COVID-19 patients, either as an adjunct to MWM or as a stand-alone treatment. A case series involving a larger number of high-risk patients or a suitably designed RCT is needed to systematically assess its efficacy.\n\n【88】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【89】The success of the integrative therapy in this high-risk case of COVID-19 is evident in that the patient not only recovered from the symptoms, but a sense of overall well-being was bestowed on him.\n\n【90】This successfully treated case certainly calls for more well-designed studies on the proposed integrative therapy approach, possibly leading to its adoption in the standard treatment provided to COVID-19 patients.\n\n【91】Patient’s perspective on the treatment\n--------------------------------------\n\n【92】After recovery from symptoms and a negative RT-PCR report, a subjective feedback was taken from the patient to understand his perspective on the intervention. The patient expressed immense satisfaction and a sense of confidence. He was amazed and delighted to find that besides aiding in a speedy recovery from the symptoms of COVID-19, including weakness, anxiety and depression, Yoga and Ayurveda had managed to control his blood sugar level as well. The normal sugar levels observed by the end of the treatment were astounding given that regular allopathic medication could not achieve this. The patient was so convinced about the efficacy of Yoga and Ayurveda that he suggested his spouse (who was also tested positive for COVID-19 and had been pursuing only allopathic medication) seek Ayurvedic consultation. Most importantly, he is determined to adopt Yoga in his lifestyle.\n\n【93】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【94】All necessary data are available (in de-identified form) from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【95】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【96】SARS-CoV-2:\n\n【97】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\n【98】DM:\n\n【99】Diabetes mellitus\n\n【100】HTN:\n\n【101】Hypertension\n\n【102】CKD:\n\n【103】Chronic kidney disease\n\n【104】FBS:\n\n【105】Fasting blood sugar\n\n【106】PPBS:\n\n【107】Postprandial blood sugar\n\n【108】RT-PCR:\n\n【109】Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\n\n【110】COPD:\n\n【111】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\n【112】ARDS:\n\n【113】Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【114】TCM:\n\n【115】Traditional Chinese medicine\n\n【116】RCT:\n\n【117】Randomized controlled trial\n\n【118】QRT:\n\n【119】Quick relaxation technique\n\n【120】DRT:\n\n【121】Deep relaxation technique", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

This report provides the first documentation of uneventful octreotide LAR use during three pregnancies in a woman with bronchial carcinoid-associated adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 25-year-old Arabic woman presented to our emergency department with rapid onset of headache, flaring acne and hirsutism, facial puffiness, weight gain and paroxysmal myopathy, and paranoiac thoughts of rape and sexual intimidation. After undergoing surgical removal of a mass by left lower lung lobectomy, her residual lung disease medical therapy failed. Chronic octreotide LAR injections were initiated as indicated by a positive octreoscan.\n\n【5】Follow-up revealed a long-lasting positive response to octreotide. Avidity of octreotide to somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 was later confirmed by a positive somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 in the resected tumor specimen. Against our instructions, the patient had three spontaneous pregnancies leading to delivery of three full-term healthy children while her octreotide LAR therapy continued.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】This case adds more data supporting the potential for the safe use of octreotide and the feasibility of octreotide LAR use during pregnancy, making compliance with the patient's preference not to withdraw octreotide therapy as soon as her pregnancy is confirmed a thoughtful option.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】The safety of octreotide use during pregnancy does not lend itself to conducting a controlled prospective study. Hence, such assessment is presently dependent on case reports. Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome associated with bronchial carcinoid is well recognized. Though infrequent, it is the leading etiology (30%) of ectopic, non-pituitary ACTH secretion (EAS) \\[ 1 \\]. Currently, the prognosis for patients with bronchial carcinoid EAS is good \\[ 1 – 4 \\], even when it persists or manifests as multiple lesions \\[ 5 \\]. This outcome is in contrast to the poor prognosis attributed to this disease in the past \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【11】When feasible, surgical removal of the causative tumor is the mainstay of treatment. Medical treatment can bridge the gap until surgery is performed or provide adjunctive long-term therapy to suppress hormonal excess of residual disease.\n\n【12】Medical treatments include blockers of steroid synthesis \\[ 7 \\] and somatostatin analogues \\[ 8 \\]. In many case reports published during the past decade, somatostatin analogues were routinely discontinued once pregnancy was diagnosed. Of special interest is that these case reports comprised seven pregnant women, five of whom had pituitary acromegaly \\[ 9 – 13 \\], one of whom had nesidioblastosis \\[ 14 \\], and one of whom had a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-producing pituitary macroadenoma \\[ 15 \\], who had uneventful deliveries concomitant to octreotide therapy throughout all trimesters. Five of these women were treated with the short-acting preparation of octreotide, and in two women octreotide LAR was administered \\[ 12 , 15 \\]. Until recently, only one case report described short-period (one-month) use of a long-acting somatostatin analogue preparation, lanreotide, before it was discontinued at the time of pregnancy confirmation \\[ 16 \\]. Herein we present the first case report describing a patient who delivered three healthy babies following three consecutive pregnancies while being treated with octreotide LAR for residual ectopic EAS.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 25-year-old Arabic woman presented to the emergency department of our medical facility with rapid onset of headache, flaring acne and hirsutism, facial puffiness, weight gain and paroxysmal myopathy, and paranoiac thoughts of rape and sexual intimidation. Her physical examination revealed pronounced facial acne and hirsutism, oily skin, moon face, buffalo hump, and classical Cushing's syndrome purplish skin striae in the abdominal, axillary, and flank regions. Her blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg.\n\n【15】Table 1 presents the patient's relevant endocrine profile. High-dose (2 mg four times daily) dexamethasone failed to suppress both serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels. Her serum testosterone, 5-dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 17-OH progesterone levels were within normal limits. Chest computed tomography revealed a 22 mm × 15 mm × 10 mm mass in the upper segment of the left lower pulmonary lobe. No adrenal mass was detected.\n\n【16】**Table 1 Patient's endocrine-biochemical laboratory tests <sup><b>a</b></sup>**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】She underwent a left lower lung lobectomy. The histopathological examination showed a typical carcinoid tumor without mitotic figures or necrosis and with positive immunohistochemical stains for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A, as well as strong positive staining for ACTH.\n\n【19】The patient became completely free of symptoms with abnormal, though decreasing, UFC levels. A year and a half after surgery she regained weight. Her physical examination confirmed moon face and re-darkening of previous striae. Her UFC levels were high and remained unsuppressed by either low or high doses of dexamethasone (Table 1 ).\n\n【20】Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen were normal, as was subsequent pituitary tomography. An indium-111 pentetreotide scan obtained to locate an occult focus of the carcinoid revealed a hot focus in the left lower pulmonary lobe and the upper right mediastinum. Treatment with steroid synthesis blockers was initiated.\n\n【21】Mediastinal and paratracheal histopathology of lymph node material obtained by performing a thoracoscopy showed a metastatic carcinoid. Following treatment with octreotide LAR 30 mg/month, she became symptom-free. Her endocrine laboratory results normalized (Table 1 ).\n\n【22】Almost three years after surgery, while undergoing octreotide LAR treatment, the patient became pregnant. She refused our recommendation to discontinue octreotide LAR therapy during the first trimester, as is routine \\[ 17 \\]. Rather, she insisted on continuing octreotide LAR for the duration of the pregnancy because of its effectiveness in maintaining disease remission. A healthy full-term baby was born (Table 2 ). Two and three years later, respectively, our patient delivered two more healthy full-term babies (Table 2 ). All three deliveries were by cesarean section. Octreotide LAR treatment was continued throughout this time period.\n\n【23】**Table 2 Data regarding patient's three pregnancies**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Recent routine follow-up chest tomography 10 years after the patient's initial presentation revealed normal mediastinal lymph nodes, with permanent post-surgical changes at the basal portion of the left lung. The result of a concomitant test for urine 5 _\\-_ hydroxyindoleacetic acid was 6.9 mg/day, which is within normal limits (1 to 7 mg/day).\n\n【26】An immunohistochemistry assay was performed to determine the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) sub-types in the tissue of the original carcinoid in the lung lobe as previously described \\[ 18 \\]. The carcinoid tumor tested positive for SSTR types 2A and 2B and negative for SSTR types 1, 3, 4, and 5. The samples taken from the lymph node metastases were inadequate for SSTR immunohistochemistry. Our patient's three babies had normal growth patterns during 128 months of follow-up (Figure 1 ).\n\n【27】**Figure 1**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】**Anthropometric measures of the patient's three children** . **(A)** Body length. **(B)** Head circumference. **(C)** Body weight.\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】In its short-acting preparation, octreotide has been used safely in humans since 1998. However, its safety during pregnancy is still uncertain. Its administration is usually stopped once pregnancy is confirmed \\[ 17 \\]. Information regarding its safety during pregnancy is sparse. We document the safe use of octreotide LAR (its long-acting compound) during one woman's three consecutive full-term pregnancies, all of which were uneventful and yielding healthy babies.\n\n【33】Octreoscan scintigraphy helps select carcinoid patients for somatostatin analogue treatment \\[ 19 \\]. A positive octreoscan indicates binding of the analogue for investigation ( <sup>111 </sup> In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-D-Phe <sup>1 </sup> \\]octreotide) to SSTR sub-types 2, 3, and 5 \\[ 20 \\]. However, 18% of patients with positive octreoscan results do not respond to somatostatin analogues \\[ 20 \\]. It is noteworthy that patients who have a good biochemical response or disease stabilization with octreotide treatment stain positive for SSTR2. Those patients who are non-responsive are negative for SSTR2 staining \\[ 21 \\]. It seems that a positive response is a result of octreotide binding to SSTR2 \\[ 20 \\]. Though not essential for therapeutic decision making, SSTR sub-typing may elucidate our understanding of this rare and heterogeneous disease.\n\n【34】Octreotide crosses the placenta, where it remains stable \\[ 12 , 13 , 15 , 22 , 23 \\]. Previously reported maternal and infant umbilical cord serum octreotide concentrations have been measured, respectively, as 1009 pg/mL vs. 353 pg/mL \\[ 12 \\], a range of 4638 pg/mL to 3676 pg/mL vs. 3483 pg/mL \\[ 13 \\], 890 pg/mL vs. 251 pg/mL \\[ 22 \\], and a range of 2888 pg/mL to 5021 pg/mL vs. 101 pg/mL \\[ 15 \\]. Moreover, the half-life elimination time of octreotide approaches 350 minutes in the infant \\[ 22 \\] compared to 90 to 110 minutes in adults \\[ 24 \\]. Fetal exposure to octreotide due to placental transfer and increased half-life in fetal serum has raised concern about its potential hazard to the fetus \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【35】Fetuses seem to be protected from the effects of octreotide. Of primary concern are fetal growth and growth hormone (GH) levels during fetal life. During the third trimester, increasing placental GH production leads to a significant rise in insuling-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. In this regard, physiological changes in placental GH and IGF-1 were observed during octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy \\[ 14 \\]. Similar changes during the last part of pregnancy were reported in a woman with a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma who was undergoing octreotide treatment at the time \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【36】Octreotide-driven suppression of GH, however, is tampered because placental SSTRs are mainly of sub-type 4, while SSTR1 remains non-functional as a result of its low affinity for octreotide \\[ 25 \\]. In another report, investigators found scanty binding of somatostatin and its analogues to both placental and umbilical cord diverse SSTR1 through SSTR5 \\[ 13 \\], which caused the maternal-fetal barrier to sufficiently hamper the functional response of SSTR1 through SSTR5 response to octreotide.\n\n【37】Detection of SSTR2 in the primary tumor of our patient is in accordance with both the effectiveness of octreotide therapy and its lack of detriment to the three fetuses as assessed by their normal post-birth anthropometric measurements.\n\n【38】Seven cases in the literature have reported the safe and effective use of octreotide for the treatment of nesidioblastosis, acromegaly, and TSH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma throughout pregnancy. No deleterious effects on anthropometric measurements during pregnancy \\[ 10 , 14 \\] or breastfeeding under octreotide treatment \\[ 9 \\] have previously been observed. Only one case report described low intra-uterine growth (5th to 10th percentile) with no other unusual morphological features \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【39】Herein we present the first case report in which octreotide LAR was used to treat carcinoid-associated Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy. Additional case reports are needed to verify the safety of octreotide and octreotide LAR therapy during pregnancy.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】First, our report demonstrates increased evidence for the safety of octreotide treatment throughout pregnancy in addition to that described in the seven previous case reports of safe octreotide therapy, using short- or long-acting preparations, during pregnancy. Second, it supports the effectiveness of octreotide LAR for bronchial carcinoid-associated EAS. Third, it supports the correlation between a good response to somatostatin analogue therapy and the presence of SSTR2 in the diseased target tissue. Fourth, it demonstrates the safe use of octreotide LAR throughout pregnancy and after birth on the basis of the anthropometric data of three babies to the age of two years and older.\n\n【42】Patient's perspective\n---------------------\n\n【43】\"Soon after the disease remission I realized that I resumed my health. I felt powerful enough to challenge the illness and overcome it. Establishing a family was my desire and inspiration. In my opinion having and growing babies, is a clear declaration that I won the combat! I wanted to see them leaving to the kindergarten with bags on their shoulder, exactly the same way other mothers say 'Bye bye' to their children. My father unconditionally supported me; he even stopped smoking for the sake of the first baby's health. The first success with treatment drove me to another two, thank God. All I need is a routine visit to the clinic, and doing some analysis. So what if all I need is a tiny injection every month!?\"\n\n【44】Consent\n-------\n\n【45】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Recent studies indicate that hepcidin deficiency is the underlying cause of the most known form of hereditary hemochromatosis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 44-year-old Asian man who developed type 2 diabetes mellitus had elevated serum ferritin levels (10,191 ng/mL). Liver biopsy revealed remarkable iron deposition in the hepatocytes and relatively advanced fibrosis (F3). Chromosomal analysis confirmed the presence of transferrin receptor type 2 mutations (c.1100T>G, c.2008\\_9delAC, hereditary hemochromatosis type 3 analyzed by Kawabata). The patient received intravenous infusions of Laennec (672 mg/day, three times/week) or oral administration with Porcine (3.87 g/day) for 84 months as an alternative to repeated phlebotomy. At the end of the treatment period, serum ferritin level decreased to 428.4 ng/mL (below the baseline level of 536.8 ng/mL). Hemoglobin A1c levels also improved after treatment with the same or lower dose of insulin (8.8% before versus 6.8% after). Plural liver biopsies revealed remarkable improvements in the grade of iron deposition and fibrosis (F3 before versus F1 after) of the liver tissue.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The discovery of hepcidin and its role in iron metabolism could lead to novel therapies for hereditary hemochromatosis. Laennec (parenteral) and Porcine (oral), which act as hepcidin inducers, actually improved iron overload in this hereditary hemochromatosis patient, without utilizing sequential phlebotomy. This suggests the possibility of not only improving the prognosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (types 1, 2, and 3) but also ameliorating complications, such as type 2 diabetes, liver fibrosis, and hypogonadism. Laennec and Porcine can completely replace continuous venesection in patients with venesection and may improve other iron-overloading disorders caused by hepcidin deficiency.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Iron is among the trace elements essential for the existence of all living organisms. It is required in an extensive diversity of metabolic processes, including Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, oxygen transport, energy production, and innate immunity; in the activation of iron-containing enzymes, such as the cytochrome system in the mitochondria; and in the expression of other enzymes involved in the oxidation or reduction of biological substrates \\[ 1 \\]. Excessively active cells need iron to maintain their metabolic vivacity because iron designates an appropriate chemical property for electron transfer, inducing biochemical interactions between many kinds of atoms, molecules, and chemical compounds. If inadequate iron exists in different ionic states, cells would lose their capacity for electron transport and oxidative energy metabolism. Elevated iron quantities can be extremely toxic due to the ability of iron to donate and accept electrons that catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause unfavorable cell injuries and fatal organic damage \\[ 2 \\]. As there is no known physiological mechanism for removing a large amount of iron appropriately and efficiently, even in severely iron-overloaded conditions, a crucial element in maintaining systemic iron homeostasis is effective communication among cells that absorb iron from the diet (duodenal enterocytes), use iron (mainly erythroid precursors), and store iron (hepatocytes and tissue macrophages). Therefore, when the iron intake exceeds cellular requirements, and storage capabilities are saturated, toxicity due to iron overload may occur \\[ 3 \\]. Thus, the iron balance is maintained through sophisticated regulatory mechanisms.\n\n【10】The peptide hormone hepcidin interacts with the cellular iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) and is thus recognized as the principal regulator of systemic iron homeostasis \\[ 4 \\]. Recent studies have established the importance of hepcidin in iron homeostasis as a negative regulator of iron release into the bloodstream by duodenal enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Disturbances in the regulation of hepcidin are involved in the pathogenesis of several kinds of iron-related disorders, such as iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and nontransfused β-thalassemia; meanwhile, the overproduction of hepcidin is associated with the development of iron-restricted anemia, which is observed in patients with chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, some cancers, and inherited iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia \\[ 7 \\]. In anemia of inflammation, hepcidin production is increased up to 100-fold, which may account for the characteristic sequestration of iron in macrophages \\[ 8 \\]. As the human body does not have the capacity to deliberately increase the excretion of iron, untreated hemochromatosis will inevitably lead to bone and joint diseases, cirrhosis, liver cancer, diabetes, hypogonadism, impotence, depression, hypothyroidism, and premature death due to liver or heart failure \\[ 9 \\]. In genetic or acquired iron overload, the hepatocytes become the major site of iron deposition, presumably because their iron uptake exceeds their capacity for physiological export \\[ 1 \\]. Excess iron in the liver promotes steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma \\[ 10 \\]. Iron absorption increases several fold in patients with iron deficiency and is partly suppressed when there is excessive iron storage.\n\n【11】Human hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide produced by hepatocytes, may be a new mediator of innate immunity and a long-sought iron-regulatory hormone. The discovery of hepcidin and elucidation of its role in iron metabolism made it possible to develop new therapies for hemochromatosis, anemia of inflammation, and other iron-related disorders \\[ 8 \\]. Generally, hepcidin has a hyposideremic action, regulating iron metabolism in a sensitive manner. The regulation of hepatic synthesis of hepcidin is extremely complex and induces various signals and biological changes, some of which are indistinct. Indeed, hepcidin synthesis is stimulated by excessive iron uptake and inflammation, whereas it is repressed by iron deficiency and all pathological conditions that stimulate erythropoietic response (such as hemolysis, anemia, dyserythropoiesis, bleeding, and erythropoietin injections) \\[ 11 \\]. In 2000, hepcidin was initially reported as an antimicrobial peptide \\[ 12 \\]. In 2001, it was identified as the principal regulator of iron metabolism in humans, mainly decreasing iron absorption and increasing iron retention both in the macrophages of Reticuloendothelial system (RES) and Kupffer cells of the liver \\[ 13 \\]. Thereafter, the identification of hepcidin as the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis has enhanced our understanding of iron. Hepcidin has a distinct and essential role in controlling the dietary absorption of iron, its storage, and its release into the bloodstream. Hepcidin concentrations are strictly controlled, and their pathologic dysregulation leads to a number of human iron-related disorders. Our understanding of hepcidin regulation has rapidly increased, but numerous questions related to hepcidin pathobiology still need to be addressed \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【12】Recent studies reported that hepcidin is deficient in patients with HH as a result of mutations in transferrin receptor type 2 ( _TfR2_ ), _HFE_ , or hemojuvelin ( _Hjv_ ) genes \\[ 15 \\]. Therefore, these genes must encode the regulators of hepcidin synthesis. Recent studies have also shown that these molecules form a hepcidin-regulating complex, possibly involving bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors \\[ 16 \\]. However, how iron is sensed by these molecules and which signaling pathways they activate to regulate hepcidin in response to changes in iron concentrations still need to be elucidated further \\[ 8 \\]. Hepcidin acts by binding to FPN, the sole cellular iron exporter, and induces its internalization and degradation \\[ 17 \\]. As FPN is expressed in the duodenum, spleen, liver, and placenta, when hepcidin production increases, the level of FPN decreases, resulting in the inhibition of duodenal iron absorption, the release of recycled iron from macrophages, mobilization of iron stores from the liver, and the transfer of iron across the placenta \\[ 18 \\]. Hepcidin may also limit bacterial proliferation by decreasing iron levels in the plasma and extracellular fluids. With regard to immune activity, hepcidin synthesis is highly induced by inflammatory signals, such as interleukin-6, thus playing a major role in the development of anemia associated with chronic inflammatory diseases \\[ 19 \\]. Since the discovery of its hyposideremic action, considerable efforts have been made to explore the role of hepcidin in the management and regulation of iron. Almost all previous studies focused on the involvement of the liver as the major source of systemic hepcidin. However, interesting data have shown hepcidin production in several organs (kidney \\[ 20 \\], macrophages \\[ 21 \\], stomach \\[ 22 \\], adipose tissue \\[ 23 \\], and pancreas \\[ 24 \\]), but the involvement of hepcidin produced in several peripheral organs in local and overall iron homeostasis remains unclear \\[ 11 \\]. Serum hepcidin levels are mainly correlated with the actual levels of hepatic hepcidin expression \\[ 25 \\], demonstrating that hepatic hepcidin is the key regulator of systemic iron balance. Data published by Kulaksiz _et al._ \\[ 24 \\] concerning hepcidin expression in the pancreas demonstrated that hepcidin is produced in the pancreas of rats and humans. Further analysis showed that it was specifically localized in the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. The _in vitro_ experiments performed in this study demonstrated that the hepcidin expression in β-cells is directly regulated by iron. Iron is also important for maintaining normal insulin production and secretion. However, excessive levels of iron affect the β-cell function in hemochromatosis models \\[ 26 , 27 \\]. Phlebotomy (venesection therapy) is the standard treatment for patients with HH and has been used for more than 70 years. It is effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality rates among patients with HH \\[ 28 \\]. Iron overload leads to tissue injury mainly through the production of ROS, which damages the cell membranes and organelles, resulting in cellular death \\[ 29 \\]. Future hepcidin-based therapies might become a potential adjunct treatment for phlebotomy in both the induction and maintenance phases \\[ 29 , 30 \\].\n\n【13】In this case report, we present a newly developed “smart” treatment for HH utilizing placenta-derived drugs as “hepcidin inducers,” which have no apparent side effects and are more cost-effective (less than 250–300 USD/month in Japan) for clinical use. To confirm and clarify the fundamental background of this placenta-derived drug, we examined and analyzed the “hepcidin-inducing effect” of Laennec using primary liver cell cultures and HepG2 cells _in vitro_ .\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】The possibility of inducing hepcidin expression through the administration of Laennec was examined using rat primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells as target responders in vitro. Data in Fig. 1 a show that Laennec induces hepcidin messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) expression, in both rat primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells, in a dose-dependent manner; this suggests that in humans, the hepcidin-mediated action of Laennec could be one of the main processes involved in the regulation of iron metabolism and other iron-related pharmacological actions. Similar experiments were performed in an iron-rich medium (Fig. 1 b). In this environment, although the magnitudes of response to induce hepcidin expression are relatively attenuated, hepcidin mRNA is typically expressed in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that, in patients with hemochromatosis, cytotoxicity due to oxidative stress caused by high iron concentrations was controlled by administering Laennec, which stimulated the production of hepcidin. Laennec might induce hepcidin expression effectively and consistently, even in environments with high oxidative stress caused by iron overload.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】Laennec induces the expression of hepcidin mRNA in both rat primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. **a** The possibility of inducing hepcidin through the administration of Laennec was examined using rat primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells as target cells _in vitro_ .

During this period, the serum ferritin level increased to 150 ng/mL, whereas the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level improved from 8.8% to 7.5% without increasing the dose of insulin. A total of 20,800 mL (10,400 mg Fe) of blood was not collected. If the patient refused to undergo phlebotomy and did not receive treatments for 2 years, the “estimated FT elevation” was 9776 ng/mL. However, the actual FT level only increased to 156 ng/mL, equivalent to 1.5% of the estimated FT elevation (Fig. 2 ). During the period without phlebotomy, histopathological evaluation revealed remarkable attenuation of iron deposition in the hepatocytes (Fig. 3 ) and a noticeable improvement in liver fibrosis (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Hereditary hemochromatosis treated with Laennec.

A total of 39,600 mL (19,800 mg Fe) of blood was not collected. The actual ferritin level was only 146 ng/mL, which is equivalent to 0.78% of the estimated ferritin elevation (Fig. 5 ).

At the same time, the patients’ quality of life (QOL) significantly improved. Laennec can potentially enhance the iron loading condition without phlebotomy. During the treatment period, Porcine (a placenta-derived oral medicine) was replaced with Laennec, which was administered for 8 months; however, the efficacy remained the same (Figs. 7 , 8 ). At the end of the treatment period, the serum Ferritin (FT) level decreased without phlebotomy (a total decrease of 93.5 ng/mL compared with the baseline level), whereas the HbA1c level consistently improved and ranged from 6.8% to 7.5%, despite the sustained reduction of insulin levels for 2–3 years.\n\n【42】**Fig. 7**\n\n【43】 \n\n【44】Hereditary hemochromatosis treated with Laennec and Porcine. Approximately 67,200 mL (33,600 mg Fe) of blood was not collected: estimated ferritin elevation, 31,584 ng/mL (47/100 mL). However, the actual ferritin level decreased (a decrease of 93.5 ng/mL compared with the baseline level); meanwhile, the HbA1c level improved from 8.8% to 6.8% without increasing the dose of insulin\n\n【45】Full size image\n\n【46】**Fig. 8**\n\n【47】 \n\n【48】Pathological changes in hereditary hemochromatosis before and after Laennec treatment.

High hepcidin expression was associated with the regulation of iron observed in our HH case before Laennec treatment (hepcidin level before Laennec injection: 0.70 ng/mL; after Laennec injection: 3.40 ng/mL). In the present study, the efficacy of Laennec was possibly due to the hepcidin-inducing effect of this placenta-derived drug, which can completely substitute the phlebotomy treatment for HH patients.\n\n【51】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【52】### Mode of action of Laennec and Porcine\n\n【53】Iron concentration in the body is rigorously regulated. The intracellular supply and storage of iron is mediated principally by three proteins: transferrin (Tf), TfR, and FT. Tf is a serum glycoprotein responsible for transporting bound iron from the absorbed organs to the peripheral tissues \\[ 31 \\]. Furthermore, Tf, a component of an iron-sensing system, is essential for the maintenance of iron homeostasis by modulating hepcidin production \\[ 32 \\]. Most cells modulate iron uptake by regulating the expression and dynamics of TfR. Regulation is mediated by intracellular iron levels and iron-responsive elements within the cell: mRNAs that are recognized by special iron regulatory proteins \\[ 31 \\]. Hepcidin, a principal regulator of iron, is secreted into the bloodstream and interacts with enterocytes to adjust the rate of iron absorption \\[ 9 , 33 \\]. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)–SMAD (SMA and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog) signaling is modulated by various cofactors, including positive factors, such as _TfR2, HFE_ , and _Hjv_ , and negative factors, such as TMPRSS6 and soluble Hjv. The expression of BMP6 mRNA was recently shown to increase with iron loading in mice, suggesting that BMP6 is a signal that reflects the iron stores \\[ 34 \\]. BMP–SMAD signaling is known to regulate hepcidin synthesis. BMPs are cytokines belonging to the TGF superfamily that exist primarily and abundantly in placental tissues. They play crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis throughout the development of each tissue \\[ 35 \\]. Recent studies suggest that hepcidin, a peptide involved in iron homeostasis, is regulated by BMPs, apparently by binding to Hjv as a coreceptor and signaling through the SMAD4. The TfR2/HFE complex is also required for transcriptional regulation of hepcidin by the holo-Tf.\n\n【54】With the use of placenta-derived drugs as substitutes to phlebotomy, and based on the evidence from HAMP assays using HepG2 cells and primary hepatocyte cultures shown in Fig. 1 a, b, one of the possible mechanisms and surmised sites of action inducing the expression of hepcidin by placenta-derived extracts might be the stimulation and/or acceleration of the BMP–SMAD–Hjv axis, which is located downstream of the intrahepatic iron-sensing system.\n\n【55】### Possibility of hepcidin-inducing treatment: efficacy on liver fibrosis and iron deposition\n\n【56】Hepatic fibrosis is a complicated dynamic process caused by hepatocyte death and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Lipid peroxidation, including the generation of ROS, TGF-β, and TNF-α, is a cause of hepatic fibrosis. HSCs are regarded as the primary target cells that elicit an inflammatory response and produce extracellular matrix components. HSCs are activated by several factors, such as ROS, lipid peroxidation products \\[malonaldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal\\], and TGF-β, which is released when adjacent cells, including hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells, are injured by various types of disadvantageous pathognomonic abnormalities. The inflammatory generation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) depends on the Fenton reaction catalyzed by redox-active metals, of which iron predominates. Iron overload causes oxidative stress and subsequent mitochondrial and DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein modification, leading to the dysfunction of metabolically active inflated cells, such as cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, pituitary cells, chondrocytes, and pancreatic β-cells \\[ 36 \\]. In HFE-related HH, juvenile HH, and type 3 HH, iron is typically stored in periportal hepatocytes, with little or no iron stores in the Kupffer cells. As iron accumulation continues, the midzonal and centrilobular hepatocytes along with the biliary epithelium will progressively accumulate iron \\[ 37 \\].\n\n【57】New data from a recent study suggest that impaired BMP signaling underlies hepcidin deficiency in HFE-related HH. Moreover, the inhibitory SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, have been identified as potential disruptors of this signal and, hence, contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease \\[ 38 \\]. Although it is classically regarded that phlebotomy cannot reverse liver cirrhosis, diabetes, or hypogonadism \\[ 39 \\], our clinical data (Figs. 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) do not agree with these assumptions. By reducing iron-related ROS, which induce liver fibrosis and cause other organic injuries, the administration of Laennec (parenteral) and Porcine (oral) seems to treat these complications (diabetes and hypogonadism) in HH patients and other related pathological disorders (liver fibrosis and iron deposition in the hepatocytes).\n\n【58】### “A farewell to phlebotomy” in the treatment of iron-related disorders: disadvantages of venesection therapy\n\n【59】Phlebotomy (venesection therapy) is the standard treatment for patients with HH and has been used for more than 70 years. It is effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality rates among HH patients \\[ 28 \\]. Iron-depleted HFE C282Y patients have extremely low serum hepcidin concentrations, reflecting the combined effects of HFE mutation and phlebotomy on hepcidin expression \\[ 40 \\]. These patients demonstrated an exaggerated increase in the serum iron concentration upon oral iron loading. This observation indicates that reducing the hepcidin concentrations by phlebotomy in HH patients may exacerbate the underlying cause of iron overload, enhancing the excess release of iron into the circulation, with an ensuing “vicious cycle” that leads to the need for more frequent maintenance phlebotomies in HH patients \\[ 40 \\]. Correspondingly, intestinal iron absorption is greatly increased in patients with hemochromatosis, even when the iron stores are depleted by phlebotomy. It is important to continue phlebotomies even if the iron stores are depleted to prevent the reaccumulation of iron. However, phlebotomy cannot reverse liver cirrhosis, diabetes, destructive arthritis, cardiomyopathy, or hypogonadism, which are the major complications of HH \\[ 39 \\]. Although phlebotomy is specifically performed to remove excess “iron” in the blood, it can also reduce the amount of multiple nutrients, several kinds of essential hormones, and immune-related elements primarily contained in the blood of HH patients. Due to this inefficient and wasteful procedure, the QOL of HH patients tend to deteriorate, not only during the induction phase but also during the maintenance periods.\n\n【60】### Efficacy on T2DM and correlation between iron and glucose metabolism in iron-related chronic liver diseases\n\n【61】Persistent iron overload can generally lead to the development and progression of diabetes by lowering insulin production and promoting insulin resistance \\[ 41 \\]. In addition to the apparent iron overload in hepatocytes, an increase in the body iron pool can also cause insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and gestational diabetes \\[ 42 \\]. This assumption is empirically endorsed and based on the following observations: First, reduction of body iron pool by bloodletting or blood donation improves glycemic control and insulin resistance in patients with T2DM \\[ 43 \\]; second, chelation therapy and blood donation lower the risk of diabetes in healthy individuals as well as in those with mildly increased body iron stores; and third, iron deficiency enhances insulin sensitivity and lowers the risk of diabetes \\[ 44 \\]. Iron overload causes insulin deficiency by promoting pancreatic β-cell apoptosis. Because of their stringent dependence on mitochondrial glucose metabolism and their limited antioxidant capacity \\[ 45 \\], β-cells are extremely susceptible to oxidative stress. Through their divalent metal transporter, pancreatic β-cells avariciously take up non-Tf-bound iron \\[ 46 \\], which can promote oxidative stress by catalyzing the Fenton reaction. Diabetes is a one of the classic symptoms of HH, and some studies reported that the prevalence of diabetes in people with HH aged 45 years and older exceeds 20% \\[ 47 \\]. Several studies have shown an association between hemochromatosis and T2DM \\[ 10 , 48 \\]. Elevated iron levels oxidize various biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, which may contribute to the development of T2DM by decreasing insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, with concomitant increase in insulin resistance \\[ 3 , 49 \\]. With regard to the efficacy of bloodletting on T2DM, it is generally regarded that phlebotomy as a method used for achieving iron depletion does not improve diabetes control in all people with HFE-related hemochromatosis \\[ 50 \\].\n\n【62】In the first 24 months of Laennec treatment (Fig. 2 ), the HbA1c level has also improved from 8.8% to 7.5% without increasing the dose of insulin, and has further improved from 8.8% to 6.8% for 50 months without changing the medications for diabetes treatment (Fig. 7 ). These results are presumably due to the additive efficacy of Laennec in reducing iron-originated ROS, enhancing the antiinflammatory action with concomitant improvement in liver fibrosis, and diminishing the iron deposition in the hepatocytes. Laennec was also administered in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients with T2DM; treatment with Laennec significantly improved the T2DM, reduced the serum ferritin level, and decreased the iron deposition in the hepatocytes \\[ 51 , 52 \\]. The regulation of iron and glucose metabolism is possibly due to the pancreatic β-cells’ ability to co-release insulin and hepcidin. Even under pathophysiological conditions, there seemed to be a link between the secretion of insulin and that of hepcidin, since patients with HH not only exhibited a decrease in insulin secretion \\[ 53 \\] but also a reduction in serum hepcidin levels \\[ 54 \\]. As for the hepcidin expression in the pancreas, data published by Kulaksiz _et al._ \\[ 24 \\] demonstrated that hepcidin is expressed in the pancreas of rats and humans. Further analysis showed that it was localized in the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. In addition, the _in vitro_ experiments performed in this study demonstrated that hepcidin expression in β-cells is directly regulated by iron. Iron is important for normal insulin secretion. However, excessive amounts of iron can affect the β-cell function in hemochromatosis models \\[ 26 , 27 , 55 \\], causing iron accumulation in the islets, a reduction in insulin secretion, and an increase in the apoptosis of β-cells. By contrast, a decrease in the iron pool was shown to protect against diabetes and loss of β-cell function in an obese (ob/ob) mouse model \\[ 56 \\]. These observations suggest that hepcidin produced by β-cells may be involved in the intrinsic regulation of pancreatic iron and glucose homeostasis \\[ 11 \\]. Iron overload is a risk factor for diabetes. The link between iron and diabetes was first recognized in patients with HH and thalassemia, but high levels of dietary iron at the same time may enhance the risk of diabetes. Iron plays a direct and causal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, mediated by both β-cell failure and insulin resistance. Iron also regulates metabolism in most tissues involved in fuel homeostasis, with adipocytes playing an iron-sensing role. The underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are numerous and not completely understood, but include oxidative stress, modulation of adipokines, and intracellular signal transduction systems \\[ 33 , 57 \\]. Iron deposition also induces insulin resistance by inhibiting glucose uptake in fat and muscle tissues, and by reducing the capacity of the liver to extract insulin, which results in an abnormal increase in hepatic glucose production \\[ 58 \\].\n\n【63】It seems reasonable to consider that one possible mechanism for the efficacy of Laennec in improving T2DM was the induction of the action of “local hepcidin” from pancreatic β-cells. However, further examinations are necessary to clarify the pharmacological dynamics of placenta-derived drugs.\n\n【64】### Efficacy of Laennec and Porcine on other iron-related diseases, especially on NASH complicated with T2DM\n\n【65】Serum ferritin is an independent predictor of histologic severity and advanced fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is now recognized as a major cause of chronic liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Western countries \\[ 47 \\]. With the recent progress in the understanding of iron metabolism in patients with HH at the molecular level, accumulating evidence suggests a link between altered iron metabolism and NAFLD. In the last decade, many studies have found an intimate relationship between hepatic iron and NASH or its progression \\[ 3 , 59 , 60 \\]. When iron accumulates, it promotes oxidative free radical reactions, which have harmful effects on multiple organs. In HH, the accumulation of iron in the liver, heart, and pancreas leads to cirrhosis, heart failure, and diabetes, respectively. Even mild iron overload might aggravate insulin resistance, diabetes, atherosclerosis, colonic neoplasia, and NAFLD \\[ 51 , 52 , 57 , 59 \\]. Increased oxidative stress is widely regarded as a key factor in the progression and deterioration of chronic liver diseases \\[ 49 \\]. Recently, hepatic iron overload has attracted attention because excessive iron accumulation causes severe cellular dysfunction by facilitating the production of ROS, and the liver, which is the principal organ for iron storage, is readily damaged by iron-induced ROS. Moreover, this phenomenon has been frequently observed in patients with both hepatitis C virus infection and Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) \\[ 49 \\]. Patients with NAFLD frequently experience elevations in serum TS, SF, or both, and elevated serum iron markers may possibly indicate an iron overload \\[ 50 \\]. Previous studies \\[ 51 , 52 , 59 , 60 \\] revealed that the administration of Laennec significantly improved T2DM complicated with NASH and other chronic liver diseases, which suggests the importance of iron regulation on insulin-resistant T2DM showing hyperferritinemia \\[ 51 , 52 , 59 , 60 \\]. A high level of Serum-Ferritin (SF) is a component of insulin resistance (IR). High ferritin levels in IR patients are mainly the result of a chronic inflammatory state induced by NASH and complicated with a metabolic syndrome \\[ 61 \\]. Reciprocally, iron interferes with the action of insulin in the liver \\[ 62 \\]. In addition, iron is a potent pro-oxidant that increases cellular oxidative stress, causing inhibition of insulin internalization and action, which results in hyperinsulinemia, IR, and abnormal β-cell function due to iron toxicity \\[ 59 , 60 , 63 \\].\n\n【66】In our clinical experience, treatment with Laennec could improve, not only T2DM but also advanced liver fibrosis, even in patients with relatively progressed NASH \\[ 51 , 52 , 59 , 60 \\].\n\n【67】### Application of Laennec and Porcine as treatments for other iron-overloading diseases, such as β-thalassemia and myelodysplasia\n\n【68】Secondary hemochromatosis is usually caused by multiple blood transfusions in patients with hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS). Iron first accumulates in the RES macrophages and is later transferred to the parenchymal cells. With frequent blood transfusions, iron may accumulate faster in patients with genetic hemochromatosis; iron overload often leads to severe cardiomyopathy and liver cirrhosis, limiting the prognosis of iron overload disorders. β-thalassemia is prevalent in Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, southern China, and the Far East, as well as in countries along the north coast of Africa and South America \\[ 64 \\]. Therapy consists of iron chelators because erythroid disorders, such as β-thalassemia and MDS, are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and anemia, and are frequently accompanied by reduced expression of HAMP and followed by iron overload. The current standard of treatment for these disorders includes transfusion and iron chelation. Phlebotomies cannot be performed because of the underlying anemia \\[ 65 \\]. However, iron chelators have serious side effects, and transfusions can aggravate iron overload \\[ 66 \\]. The mainstay of therapy for β-thalassemia major is lifelong red cell transfusion to improve anemia and suppress ineffective erythropoiesis \\[ 67 \\]. Increased erythropoiesis suppresses hepcidin production, resulting in a greater supply of iron from duodenal absorption and iron storage release, allowing sufficient iron to be available for hemoglobin synthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating hepcidin suppression are not well understood \\[ 68 \\]. In iron-loading anemia (β-thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia), the suppressive effect of erythropoiesis on hepcidin production \\[ 69 \\] and the resulting increase in dietary iron absorption can cause systemic iron overload and iron-mediated damage to the liver and myocardium, even without blood transfusions. However, whether treatment with exogenous hepcidin can correct the cause of iron-loading anemias needs to be further elucidated \\[ 1 \\]. Patients with thalassemia intermedia experience iron overload even if they do not receive blood transfusions, and their urinary hepcidin levels are remarkably low despite high plasma Tf saturation and systemic iron overload \\[ 69 \\]. With the increasing use of transfusion therapy, iron overload has become a major cause of morbidity and premature mortality. More recently, the effective treatment of iron overload by iron chelation has dramatically improved patient survival \\[ 70 \\]. In patients with thalassemia, anemia induced by phlebotomy or hemolysis also suppresses the levels of hepatic hepcidin mRNA. Importantly, the suppressive effect of hemolytic anemia was observed even in iron-overloaded mice, suggesting that the suppression of hepcidin levels by anemia has a stronger effect than the stimulation of hepcidin expression by iron overload. This hierarchy of effects could explain why iron overload commonly develops in individuals with certain hemolytic disorders such as thalassemia. However, these observations do not explain why iron overload occurs more commonly in patients with intramedullary hemolysis than in those with peripheral hemolysis or nonhemolytic anemia \\[ 8 \\]. In thalassemia intermedia, hepcidin therapy is expected to have beneficial effects by curbing the hyperabsorption of dietary iron. Hepcidin agonists could be useful even in patients with transfused thalassemia. Although intestinal iron absorption contributes less to the total iron load in these patients, hepcidin therapy may help in the period when endogenous hepcidin levels decrease and intestinal iron uptake increases. Hepcidin diagnostics and future therapeutic agonists may help in the management of patients with β-thalassemia \\[ 71 \\]. Although these proof-of-principle studies show promise, no hepcidin therapies are yet available. Hepcidin has several characteristics that limit its potential use as a therapeutic agent. Due to its length and complex 4-disulfide structure, it is very expensive to produce.\n\n【69】Probably Laennec and Porcine, which can effectively induce the production of hepcidin, will improve the iron overload observed in thalassemia intermedia patients without any noticeable side effects. Placenta-derived extract Laennec and Porcine are effective drugs in this type of iron overload disorder. In Egypt, β-thalassemia is the most common genetically determined, chronic, hemolytic anemia, with an estimated carrier rate of 9–10.5% \\[ 72 \\]. Currently, thalassemias are managed with chelation therapy, but exogenous Tf \\[ 73 \\], exogenous hepcidin \\[ 74 \\], or hepcidin signaling agonists \\[ 75 \\] may be used as effective options in the near future. Our findings on the efficacy of Laennec and Porcine will help in the appropriate management of not only HH patients but also thalassemia (intermedia, trait, and major) and MDS patients.\n\n【70】This study is the first to present the possibility of applying the placenta-derived drugs Laennec and Porcine for the control of preferable and desirable erythropoiesis. β-thalassemia causes ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic anemia and is associated with iron overload from both multiple blood transfusions and increased iron absorption; the latter is mediated by suppression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin \\[ 76 \\]. In accordance with these backgrounds, we should seek to determine whether β-thalassemia major/intermediate/trait, with or without transfusion-mediated inhibition of erythropoiesis, will improve after treatment with Laennec and Porcine as a hepcidin inducer.\n\n【71】### Ideal treatment for HH and other iron-related diseases\n\n【72】#### Desirable future of HH therapeutics\n\n【73】Hepcidin-based therapies might, in the near future, become a potential adjunct treatment in place of phlebotomy. The possibility of using hepcidin is based on the pathognomonic decline in hepcidin levels in HH patients, which is responsible for the increased serum concentrations of iron and Tf saturation, and subsequently for iron overload \\[ 29 , 30 \\]. A low serum hepcidin level as the cause of hemochromatosis raises the possibility of using hepcidin analogs as treatments for patients with HH. However, the costs of parenteral peptide therapy should be compared with those of simple and low-cost phlebotomy therapy. For these reasons, oral iron chelators are not commonly used for the treatment of hemochromatosis \\[ 77 \\]. However, phlebotomy cannot reverse liver cirrhosis, diabetes, destructive arthritis, cardiomyopathy, or hypogonadism \\[ 39 \\]. Hepcidin replacement therapy could treat the underlying cause; thus, interest in the development of hepcidin therapeutics is growing \\[ 39 \\]. The manuscript by Liu _et al._ published in _Haematologica_ , reports the identification of novel compounds that can increase hepcidin expression in normal mice as well as in animals affected by hemochromatosis and β-thalassemia intermedia (or nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia) \\[ 78 \\]. The iron-mediated control of hepcidin is achieved through at least two mechanisms. First, hepcidin senses the amount of intracellular iron in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and responds by synthesizing BMP6 and other similar ligands belonging to the TGFβ-like family \\[ 79 \\]. Second, hepcidin increases the intracellular concentration of iron, which leads to the secretion of BMP6 from these cells \\[ 79 \\]. As a consequence, BMP6 binds and activates receptors that trigger the phosphorylation of the SMAD complex and stimulate hepcidin expression in hepatic cells \\[ 80 \\]. To date, most of the compounds that increased the expression of hepcidin show a very specific activity (that is hepcidin mimetics or FPN inhibitors) \\[ 81 , 82 \\]. In general, these drugs belong to one of the four main categories: (i) hepcidin mimetics, (ii) hepcidin inducers, (iii) FPN inhibitors, and (iv) erythroferrone inhibitors. TMPRSS6 inhibitors can be defined as hepcidin inducers and/or BMP/SMAD pathway activators \\[ 80 \\].\n\n【74】#### An optimum drug for treating iron overload\n\n【75】The ideal drug should be administered orally or injected subcutaneously very infrequently, and should have a long lifespan and prolonged activity. The drug should also show a large spectrum of activity, so that it can limit iron absorption in patients with nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia and HFE-related hemochromatosis, as well as in those patients with other conditions in which iron absorption is further increased (for example β-thalassemia major) or in which iron absorption needs to be further suppressed to achieve a significant benefit (as in polycythemia vera) \\[ 81 , 82 \\]. In addition, the drug should not cause any side effects, particularly under chronic administration conditions. Obviously, a low production cost would also be desirable. Furthermore, the drug should have a clear mechanism of action, if possible \\[ 80 \\].\n\n【76】#### Hepcidin treatment\n\n【77】Many human diseases are not only associated with but are also modulated by alterations in hepcidin concentrations \\[ 4 \\]. Hepcidin-targeted therapies may improve the outcomes of patients with iron disorders. Although no specific hepcidin therapies are currently available, several compounds are under development as hepcidin agonists or antagonists \\[ 83 \\]. Hepcidin agonists could be useful for preventing iron overload caused by hepcidin deficiency, such as Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), β-thalassemia, and other iron-loading anemias, and possibly some acquired forms of non-hemochromatotic iron-overload diseases \\[ 4 \\]. Furthermore, hepcidin has either a primary or secondary role in insulin resistance, which is a characteristic of T2DM. However, it remains inconclusive whether serum hepcidin levels are an independent risk factor in the etiopathogenesis of T2DM. Thus, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the claim that hepcidin plays a role in T2DM \\[ 87 \\].\n\n【78】These results, obtained from clinical trials conducted in patients with HH replacing phlebotomy with Laennec and Porcine treatment for more than 7 years, suggest the possibility that the corresponding drugs would be able to supervise hepatic iron metabolism through the transcriptional regulation of hepcidin. In summary, Laennec and Porcine are extremely promising treatment options and could be used in patients affected by iron-related disorders in which increased hepcidin expression is desirable. If proven safe and effective, their use in clinical practice will steadily increase.\n\n【79】In conclusion, our presented clinical course of HH treated by placenta-derived drugs Laennec and Porcine, as well as the fundamental data on hepcidin-inducing effects _in vitro_ using the corresponding drugs, suggest that they are involved in the supervision of hepatic iron metabolism through transcriptional regulation of hepcidin. This study demonstrates the novel therapeutic potential of placenta-derived drugs Laennec and Porcine in improving hepatic fibrosis and iron deposition in hepatocytes as well as complicated diabetes and hypogonadism. In addition, by inducing preferable and appropriate amounts of hepcidin, placenta-derived drugs could improve the clinical course of NASH complicated with T2DM and hyperferritinemia by attenuating iron-induced oxidative stress and iron accumulation in both hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells \\[ 76 \\].\n\n【80】Based on this study, the possibility of replacing phlebotomy with placenta-derived drugs, Laennec and Porcine, was indicated through the pharmacological mechanism of inducing hepcidin production and suppressing iron-related oxidative stress \\[ 85 , 86 \\]. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that Laennec and Porcine are quite effective not only for HH but also for other iron-loading diseases, such as β-thalassemia, MDS, NASH complicated with T2DM, and autoimmune liver disease \\[primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis\\] \\[ 51 , 52 , 59 , 60 \\]. These are promising drugs that can suppress iron-induced oxidative injury as well as iron deposition in multiple organs, which will improve the prognosis of patients who developed iron-overloading disorders \\[ 76 \\].\n\n【81】Optimistically, this will pave the way for “a farewell to phlebotomy” trial using iron removal strategies utilizing the placenta-derived drugs Laennec and Porcine. This will also open the way for preventing the progression of iron overloading liver diseases and their complications, including liver cirrhosis and HCC, by inducing the secretion of hepcidin and antiinflammatory effects through treatment with these placenta-derived drugs \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【82】Further studies should confirm the role of iron overload and hyperferritinemia in patients with chronic liver diseases, including NASH, and the action of placenta-derived drugs.\n\n【83】To the best of our knowledge, the presented study is the first to examine the efficacy of Laennec and Porcine in removing excess iron in hepatocytes and other organs, and the modulatory effect of hepcidin on erythropoiesis in patients with HH. We found that “hepcidin-inducing treatment” with placenta-derived drugs could completely replace phlebotomy. Furthermore, their efficacy surpassed that of the venesection treatment in terms of improvements in liver fibrosis, diabetes, hypogonadism, and QOL of patients \\[ 76 \\]. Thus, more experimental and clinical studies are needed to confirm the efficacy against other iron-related diseases \\[ 84 \\].\n\n【84】If the hepcidin-inducing substance cannot be identified clearly, a conclusive evaluation on the exact mechanism underlying the induction of hepcidin secretion with the use of Laennec and Porcine cannot be proposed; however, more attention should be paid to improving the condition of the patient if this procedure is effective in a number of medical situations, judging from the historical evaluations of the corresponding drugs. At any rate, it does not seem possible to discontinue the application of “phlebotomy” if it is difficult to manage iron-overloading diseases, such as HH and other iron-related disorders. In addition, in some types of β-thalassemia (especially intermediate), inducing hepcidin by administering Laennec and Porcine will improve the iron-overloading condition in these patients without affecting the underlying cause of their hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, even in iron-loaded chronic liver diseases, such as NASH, type B/C viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)), and Liver Cirrhosis/Hepatocellular carcinoma (LC/HCC), the efficacy of removing iron from the liver will improve the prognosis of patients with these types of hepatic disorders.\n\n【85】In summary, the placenta-derived drugs Laennec and Porcine are very promising treatment options and can be used in patients affected by such disorders in which increased hepcidin expression is desirable and advantageous. If proven safe and effective, their use in clinical practice will steadily increase \\[ 80 \\]. Similar to classical placenta drugs, Laennec and Porcine have also been used as “anti-aging” treatments and “skin care products.”\n\n【86】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【87】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this article.\n\n【88】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【89】HH:\n\n【90】Hereditary hemochromatosis\n\n【91】T2DM:\n\n【92】Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n\n【93】SF:\n\n【94】Serum ferritin\n\n【95】TfR2:\n\n【96】Transferrin receptor type 2\n\n【97】ROS:\n\n【98】Reactive oxygen species\n\n【99】FPN:\n\n【100】Ferroportin\n\n【101】Hjv:\n\n【102】Hemojuvelin\n\n【103】BMP:\n\n【104】Bone morphogenic proteins\n\n【105】HbA1c:\n\n【106】Hemoglobin subunit alpha\n\n【107】FT:\n\n【108】Ferritin\n\n【109】Tf:\n\n【110】Transferrin\n\n【111】SMAD:\n\n【112】SMA and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog\n\n【113】HSCs:\n\n【114】Hepatic stellate cells\n\n【115】DMT:\n\n【116】Divalent metal transporter\n\n【117】NAFLD:\n\n【118】Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n\n【119】HCC:\n\n【120】Hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n【121】IR:\n\n【122】Insulin resistant\n\n【123】ED:\n\n【124】Erection disturbance", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

In particular, trochanteric bursitis is an extremely rare manifestation of osteoarticular tuberculosis. We describe a case of tuberculous coxitis with trochanteric bursitis, successfully treated with a fourfold tuberculostatic therapy _._\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 43-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-negative Sudanese man with osteoarticular tuberculosis, who was originally admitted with the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Low grade fever together with the positive result of an interferon-gamma release assay test as well as findings from magnetic resonance imaging provided clues to the diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis could be set after a computed tomography-guided biopsy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Apart from a rare involvement pattern of osteoarticular tuberculosis, including trochanteric bursitis, this case highlights the increasing importance of osteoarticular tuberculosis as a differential diagnosis of rheumatic disorders. With the growing migration flows from tuberculosis-endemic African countries, clinicians in central and northern Europe may be more frequently confronted with atypical involvement patterns of osteoarticular tuberculosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis may affect various organs, causing a broad range of clinical manifestations \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. It provides an important source of mortality, especially if not diagnosed in time. Moreover, in cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis, misdiagnosis of an autoinflammatory disease and the consequent immunosuppressive therapy can further enhance morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis. Here we report the case of a 43-year-old African refugee, who was referred to our clinic with the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 43-year-old man – a refugee Sudanese man – who had been living in Germany for 19 months was referred to our clinic by his rheumatologist with low back pain and the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. On admission our patient complained of low back pain radiating into his right hip, which started gradually during the last 4 months. He described the pain as persistent and more intense at night so that he could not sleep. Fever, weight loss, and night sweats were denied. In the clinical examination, movements of his right hip were painful. Before admission treatment with 25 mg prednisolone and diclofenac had been already initiated since spondyloarthritis was suspected. Prednisolone therapy was started 2 months before admission with an initial dose of 40 mg/day and was tapered to 25 mg/day until admission. On admission his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal and his C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (87 mg/l, normal range < 5 mg/l). The rest of routine laboratory tests were normal, except for a slight increase in gamma glutamyltransferase (gamma GT, 78 U/l; normal range < 55 U/l). The immunological tests showed a low titer of antinuclear antibodies (1:160) with no specification in the extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screening test. The tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were negative. An HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) test was also negative. A conventional chest X-ray revealed no pathological findings. During his in-patient stay low grade fever was discovered. Conventional radiographs of his right hip, pelvis, sacroiliac joints, and his lumbar spine revealed osteosclerosis of his left sacroiliac joint without further abnormalities. In correlation with the pain in the area of his right hip, a pelvis and hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed synovitis of his right hip with trochanteric bursitis (Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, there was left-sided osteitis of the sacral bone. We then performed an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), which was positive. Therefore, we collected material for microbiological as well as pathological diagnostics by puncture of his left hip joint. Histological examination of the periarticular tissue revealed the formation of granulomas with caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). Despite a negative acid-fast stain of the gained tissue sample, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culture for mycobacteria remained negative. All other specimens submitted for microbiological testing (blood culture and sputum probes) remained culturally and PCR negative for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis._\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging scans; T2-weighted images.

Molecular testing yielded no evidence of mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin. We therefore started a four-drug anti-mycobacterial regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Prednisolone was gradually reduced until its complete discontinuation. After 2 months of therapy, ethambutol and pyrazinamide were stopped. Rifampicin and isoniazid were continued for 7 more months. In the follow-up, 6 months after starting therapy and 2 months after completion of a 9-month anti-mycobacterial regimen, his CRP was normal, and low back pain and painful motility of his right hip resolved completely. Conventional radiographs of his right hip showed a slight joint space narrowing with no further pathological findings. In the absence of functional limitation no surgical treatment was required.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】According to the last “Global tuberculosis report” of the World Health Organization, the number of new cases of tuberculosis has tended to decrease over the last decades \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Despite that, tuberculosis remains an important source of mortality, especially in developing countries. In 2014 tuberculosis caused 0.97–1.3 million deaths worldwide. In Germany, tuberculosis is relatively rare. However, in view of the recent developments in migration of refugees from Africa and Arabic countries to Europe, tuberculosis may become a more frequent entity in central and northern Europe in the future \\[ 4 \\]. At present, osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for 1–4.3% of all cases of tuberculosis \\[ 3 \\]. In Germany, approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis had an extrapulmonary focus \\[ 5 \\]. Osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for 8.1% of newly diagnosed cases and is more common among patients of Asian or African origin. Tuberculous coxitis is thought to arise as a consequence of prior pulmonary tuberculosis through hematogenous spread of mycobacteria \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. Retrograde lymphatic or contiguous dissemination are also possible but less common.\n\n【23】Symptom onset is typically insidious (for example low grade fever, night sweats, and weakness) in cases of skeletal tuberculosis. Localized skeletal pain may appear later delaying the diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis for many months \\[ 7 \\]. The mean time until diagnosis after symptom onset has been reported to be approximately 16–19 months.\n\n【24】A positive IGRA or tuberculin skin test (TST) is crucial for diagnosing tuberculosis \\[ 8 \\]. IGRAs have a higher specificity and sensitivity in comparison to TST. Despite the high specificity of the currently commercially available IGRAs, their sensitivity remains relatively low (ranging from 80 to 88% depending on the study and the assay) \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Skeletal tuberculosis presents no specific radiological findings \\[ 7 , 12 \\]. In cases of spinal tuberculosis, destruction of the intervertebral disc and both adjacent vertebral bodies is characteristic. The appearance of an osteolytic lesion can mimic metastatic tumors or primary osseous lesions. Computed tomography (CT) scans cannot discriminate between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. MRI scans are more sensitive in showing early inflammatory lesions and, thus, suggesting the diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis at an earlier stage. Typically, hypointense or isointense signals appear on T1-weigted images and hyperintense abnormalities appear on T2-weighted images of osseous and soft tissue lesions. The sensitivity of MRI can reach 100% whereas the sensitivity of CT may be around 88%.\n\n【25】A definitive diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis requires the obtaining of specimens from the relevant sites for microscopy and culture, although the sensitivity of these procedures is relatively low \\[ 13 \\]. CT-guided or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration is essential for accurate diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis \\[ 14 \\], which is also reflected in the presented case. Revelation of granulomas and detection of mycobacteria by means of imaging-guided needle aspiration is the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis. Isolation of mycobacteria may have therapeutical consequences by revealing possible drug resistances. The application of sensitive molecular techniques can be extremely helpful especially in cases of samples with low numbers of mycobacteria.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】This case presents a rare involvement pattern of osteoarticular tuberculosis, including trochanteric bursitis. With the increasing migration flows from African countries, which are endemic for tuberculosis, osteoarticular tuberculosis arises as an important differential diagnosis of rheumatic disorders in central and northern Europe.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Conjoined nerve root anomalies are easily missed even in preoperative advanced imaging modalities, which can be potentially troublesome during and after surgery. In this report, we present a case of conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root in a patient with lumbar disc herniation, accompanied by spina bifida occulta, which was undiagnosed on preoperative imaging studies.\n\n【3】### Case report\n\n【4】A 55-year-old Asian (Japanese) woman presented with low back pain and right leg radiating pain due to lumbar disc herniation at the right L5/S1. Physical examination revealed a positive Lasègue sign and the range of the straight leg raising test was 20° on the right side. The right patellar tendon reflex was normal; however, the right ankle jerk reflex disappeared. Although no obvious hypoesthesia was noted, mild muscle weakness (4/5) was observed in the right leg on the manual muscle test. We planned the lumbar discectomy under a microscope. During surgery, the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root, which was compressed by herniated nucleus pulposus, was encountered. Although it was very thick and less mobile, some pieces of herniated nucleus pulposus could be removed piece by piece from the axillary part. After sequential decompressive procedures, the tightness of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root decreased but its mobility did not improve much. The laterality of the thickness and exit angle of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root was retrospectively confirmed on T2 coronal magnetic resonance images and magnetic resonance neurography. Postoperatively, right leg pain was immediately alleviated and complete improvement of muscle weakness was achieved 1 week later (5/5).\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Magnetic resonance neurography is extremely useful for the accurate diagnosis of anomalous nerve roots because of clear visualization of the neural tissue. Discectomy under a microscope, which enables magnified three-dimensional observation of the surgical field, must provide a valid and safe procedure to achieve not only secure resection of herniated discs but also adequate exposure of anomalous nerve roots.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The lumbar nerve root, which is surrounded by a root sleeve extension of the dura mater, normally runs from the medial to lateral direction beneath the corresponding vertebral pedicle, exiting through the respective intervertebral foramen \\[ 1 \\]. However, a nerve root anomaly (NRA), typified by a conjoined nerve root (CNR), is a rare finding. NRAs likely result from aberrant migration of the involved roots during embryological development \\[ 2 \\]. A CNR is defined as two adjacent nerve roots that share a common dural envelope at some time during their course from the thecal sac \\[ 3 \\]. CNR anomalies are easily missed, even in preoperative advanced imaging modalities, which can be potentially troublesome during and after surgery \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Lumbosacral NRAs were first described by Zagnoni \\[ 5 \\] in 1949. Subsequently, Ethelberg _et al_ . \\[ 6 \\] reported that four cases (0.34%) of significant NRAs were found in 1162 patients who underwent lumbar laminectomy in 1952. In 1962, Cannon _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] encountered an NRA in 2% of lumbar surgery cases, and categorized them into three types: conjoined roots, anastomotic roots, and transverse roots. Similar case reports have sporadically appeared in the literature.\n\n【11】The prevalence of lumbosacral NRAs has varied widely since early reports, as previously shown. The anatomical dissections of 100 cadaveric specimens by Kadish _et al_ . \\[ 7 \\] revealed 23 NRAs in 14 lumbosacral spines (14%). Postacchini _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] found 46 lumbosacral NRAs in a series of 2123 patients who underwent myelography for low back and radicular pain (2%). Haijiao _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] detected 65 cases of congenital NRAs in a retrospective analysis of 376 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine for low back pain and/or radicular pain (17.3%). Artico _et al_ . \\[ 10 \\] identified three patients with lumbosacral CNRs, representing 0.25% of 1200 patients who underwent lumbosacral CT/MRI procedures. White _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\] detected that in their 25-year series of 4726 disc operations, 63 CNRs were identified unequivocally, with an incidence of 1.3%. Scuderi _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\] reported that 4 in 80 patients were intraoperatively found to have evidence of a CNR (5%). In a more recent report of a cohort undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy by Lotan _et al_ . \\[ 12 \\], the incidence of CNR identified during surgery was 5.8%.\n\n【12】In this report, we present a case of conjoined L5–S1 nerve root in a patient with lumbar disc herniation, accompanied by spina bifida occulta, which was undiagnosed on preoperative imaging studies.\n\n【13】Case report\n-----------\n\n【14】A 55-year-old Asian (Japanese) woman presented with low back pain and right leg radiating pain without any apparent cause. She received conservative treatment, such as pain killer administration and lumbar root block injection under the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation at the right L5/S. However, her symptoms gradually worsened until she could not walk because of severe right leg pain and mild muscle weakness. She then referred to our hospital for surgical treatment.\n\n【15】Physical examination revealed a positive Lasègue sign and the range of the straight leg raising test was 20° on the right side. The right patellar tendon reflex was normal; however, the right ankle jerk reflex absent. On the manual muscle test (MMT), mild muscle weakness (4/5) was observed in the right tibialis anterior (TA), peroneal longus et brevis (PL et B), extensor hallucis longus (EHL), flexor hallucis longus (FHL), and triceps surae (TS). Although there was occasional mild numbness in the right lower leg, no obvious hypoesthesia was noted in the definitive area.\n\n【16】On plain radiograph, spina bifida occulta at the L5 neural arch was detected in the anteroposterior direction, and slight disc space narrowing at the L4/5 and L5/S intervertebral disc levels was seen in the lateral direction (Fig. 1 ). Myelography and computed tomography (CT) following myelography (CTM) showed a defect in the right L5 and S1 nerve roots (Fig. 2 ). Magnetic resonance (MR) images revealed a herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) on the right side at the L5/S1 intervertebral disc level (Fig. 3 ). Our preoperative diagnosis was right S1 radiculopathy originating from a usual HNP that compresses the right S1 nerve root in accordance with the findings of L5 radiculopathy suspected by muscle weakness of the TA, EHL, and PL et B.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Preoperative plain radiographs. Spina bifida occulta at the L5 neural arch was detected in the anteroposterior direction (white arrow), and slight disc space narrowing at the L4/5 and L5/S intervertebral disc levels was seen in the lateral direction (open arrows). **a** a-p view. **b** lateral view.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Myelography and CT following myelography (CTM).

First, wide fenestration at the right L5/S interlaminar space was performed to identify the right S1 nerve root that was compressed by HNP. However, an anomaly of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root was observed. There was no adhesion between the yellow ligament and neural tissue. The epidural space was filled with sufficient adipose tissue. An HNP extruding from the right L5/S intervertebral disc space was confirmed beneath the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root, which was severely compressed and shifted backward. Mild adhesion between the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root and capsule of the HNP was observed. Next, to ensure safe discectomy, the area of the fenestration was enlarged while assuring that the facet joint was not disrupted. Although the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root was very thick and less mobile, some pieces of HNP could be removed piece by piece from the axillary part of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root. After these decompressive procedures, the tightness of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root decreased, but its mobility did not improve much (Fig. 4 ). The laterality of the thickness and exit angle of the conjoined right L5–S1 nerve root was retrospectively confirmed on preoperative T2 coronal MR images and MR neurography (Fig. 5 ).\n\n【30】**Fig. 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Intraoperative image and schema.

At 6 months after surgery, she complained of mild pain at the back and the bilateral thighs, similar to myalgia but was able to walk without any support (Fig. 6 ).\n\n【39】**Fig. 6**\n\n【40】 \n\n【41】Plain radiographs at 6 months after surgery.

They divided NRA into three types and subtypes according to the way the nerve roots exit the dura and the spinal canal. However, more recently, Burke _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] suggested a fourth entry where a confluent nerve root exits the foramen with two contributions from two adjacent nerve roots arising separately from the thecal sac (Fig. 7 ).\n\n【45】**Fig. 7**\n\n【46】Classification of nerve root anomalies (NRAs) by Neidre and Macnab including a fourth entry of NRA described by Burke _et al_ . Type 1 anomalies include those of conjoined nerve roots arising from a common dural sheath. Type 2 anomalies are most common, where two nerve roots exit through the same foramen. Type 3 anomalies are those in which adjacent nerve roots are connected in the form of a transverse or vertical anastomosis. Type 4 anomaly is a confluent nerve root with two contributions arising from the thecal sac coalescing to form a single nerve root that exits via the intervertebral foramen\n\n【47】Full size image\n\n【48】There are some atypical clinical findings in patients with disc herniation with CNRs. CNRs are rarely associated with other spinal anomalies, including defects in the neural arch, spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis, spina bifida occulta, or other bony anomalies \\[ 2 \\]. Jokhi _et al_ . \\[ 15 \\] reported a case of a conjoined L4–5 nerve root accompanied by spina bifida at the L5 level with severe lumbar canal stenosis. In addition, Okuwaki _et al_ . \\[ 16 \\] introduced a case of conjoined L5–S1 nerve root associated with a partial defect of the right neural arch of L5 in a patient who showed radiculopathy without definite lumbar disc herniation. In the present case, radiography revealed spina bifida occulta at the L5 level.\n\n【49】In clinical symptoms, twin dermal involvement even in a single intervertebral lesion has been proposed to be indicative of CNRs because two roots may be compressed by the ruptured discs. Another clinical clue to the suspicion of CNRs is a negative Lasègue sign despite radiculopathy \\[ 4 \\]. The present case also showed right leg radiculopathy originating from the S1 and L5 nerve roots, suspected from the distribution of the muscle weakness, as well as from the lumbar disc herniation at the right L5/S1 intervertebral disc level. In contrast, the Lasègue sign was strongly positive at 20° on the right side, even though the CNR was inherently less mobile, that is, impingement or strain were unlikely to occur. One of the causes might be due to the strange shapes of pedicle and lamina, which could even impact vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen although a detailed imaging evaluation has not been done.\n\n【50】Radiological diagnosis remains challenging despite improvements in the imaging modalities. MRI is the gold standard for differentiating CNRs from other space-occupying processes. Especially, T2-weighted coronal MR images exactly describe the course of each nerve root \\[ 17 \\]. MR neurography is also effective because it enhances selective multiplanar visualization of neural tissue and pathology by encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and diffusion imaging pulse sequences \\[ 18 \\]. However, even in MR neurography, it is difficult to demonstrate the CNR when a large disc herniation or severe stenosis is present in the spinal canal. Additional conventional myelography will be helpful if MRI cannot be performed or does not offer reliable results \\[ 14 \\]. Kang _et al_ . \\[ 19 \\] reported the “sagittal shoulder sign,” defined as a vertical structure connecting two consecutive nerve roots and the overlying herniated disc on parasagittal MRI. Additionally, Song _et al_ . \\[ 20 \\] described three radiological signs on standard axial MRI at the level of discs: “corner sign” described as an asymmetric structure of the anterolateral corner of the dural sac with one side being angulated compared to the other, “fat crescent sign” that refers to the presence of extradural fat between the CNR and the asymmetric dural sac, and “parallel sign” that denotes an unusual course of the entire nerve root at the disc level, running parallel to the disc plane. In the present case, a CNR could not be indicated in conventional myelography because sufficient description by contrast medium was not achieved. However, only the laterality of the thickness and exit angle of the conjoined L5 and S1 nerve roots that was identified as Type 1A in T2 coronal MR images and MR neurography was retrospectively confirmed although specific signs on MRI were lacking.\n\n【51】The operative management of NRAs depends on neurological problems and the clinical conditions of each individual case. Asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed cases do not require treatment. The presence of NRAs may affect the success of discectomy \\[ 21 \\]. Congenital NRAs of the lumbosacral spine that are unexpectedly encountered during surgery for lumbar disc herniation could be mistaken for a proportion of protruding or herniated disc and incised inadvertently, resulting in iatrogenic neural injury \\[ 1 \\]. Cannon _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] reported unsatisfactory results with hemilaminectomy and discectomy in patients with lumbar disc herniation and CNRs. White _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\] stated that only a 30% success rate may be achieved with a standard discectomy technique, and emphasized the importance of additional pediculectomy to remove the pedicle until it had become flush with the corresponding vertebral body. Furthermore, CNRs are less mobile than the normal roots. Greater root thickness and root exit angle make it much more difficult to retract medially, thus leading to later-onset neuropathy and root injury \\[ 21 \\]. Wide exposure by hemilaminectomy allows adequate visualization and mobilization of the involved roots and aids defining the CNRs and their origin, thereby avoiding the risk of laceration and excessive traction \\[ 22 \\]. Artico _et al_ . \\[ 10 \\] stated that it is necessary to keep in mind that a hemilaminectomy with sufficient exposure of the intervertebral foramen or lateral recess should be performed to avoid alterations in stability and to ensure correct mobility of the lumbosacral spine. In our case, a CNR could be confirmed through meticulous exposure by enlarged fenestration under a microscope during surgery. Eventually, the fragments of HNP were completely removed piece by piece from the axillary part of the involved CNR, which was thick and less mobile.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【53】In summary, correct diagnosis, clinical and prognostic evaluation, surgical planning, and management must be carefully performed in cases of lumbar disc herniation accompanying an NRA represented by CNR. MR neurography, which is extremely useful for the clear visualization of the neural tissue, should be proactively considered in HNP cases accompanied by the bony anomalies of the lumbosacral spine, especially in the lumbosacral lesion to detect an NRA. Discectomy under a microscope, which enables magnified three-dimensional observation of the surgical field must provide a valid and safe procedure to achieve adequate exposure of herniated discs for secure resection and satisfactory alleviation of clinical symptoms.\n\n【54】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【55】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【56】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【57】NRA:\n\n【58】Nerve root anomaly\n\n【59】CNR:\n\n【60】Conjoined nerve root\n\n【61】MMT:\n\n【62】Manual muscle test\n\n【63】TA:\n\n【64】Tibialis anterior\n\n【65】PL et PB:\n\n【66】Peroneal longus et brevis\n\n【67】EHL:\n\n【68】Extensor hallucis longus\n\n【69】FHL:\n\n【70】Flexor hallucis longus\n\n【71】TS:\n\n【72】Triceps surae\n\n【73】CTM:\n\n【74】CT following myelography\n\n【75】HNP:\n\n【76】Herniated nucleus pulposus", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Alzheimer’s disease is commonly characterized by progressive impairment of recent memory. Primary progressive aphasia is also often observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, language-associated symptoms, such as primary progressive aphasia, are diverse and varied in Alzheimer’s disease. However, nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia is not generally considered a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. To date, there has been no longitudinal study of primary progressive aphasia in Japanese-speaking patients or in patients speaking other languages with pathologically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease. Here we present a longitudinal study of primary progressive aphasia in a Japanese patient pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 75-year-old Japanese man, whose wife reported that his memory was impaired, also suffered from suspected aphasia. He was pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease using <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography. Based on clinical observation and the results of the Japanese standard language test of aphasia, he was also diagnosed with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia. During the subsequent 2 years, his cognitive impairment, aphasia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia progressed. Furthermore, progression of pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition was revealed through <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography. Although the results of \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography suggested corticobasal degeneration, this was not observed on the \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (DaTscan). A previous study had reported that Alzheimer’s disease with a nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia was accompanied by corticobasal degeneration; however, this was not true in our case.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This is possibly the first longitudinal study of nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia in a Japanese-speaking patient with pathologically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease, but without corticobasal degeneration.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which is caused by the deposition of pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein in the cerebral cortex. Currently, the pathological criterion for AD is limited to significant accumulation of pathologic amyloid-β deposits.\n\n【10】AD is commonly characterized by progressive recent memory impairment, alongside additional progressive symptoms such as visuospatial cognitive impairment, executive functional impairment, primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and behavioral psychiatric symptoms. Language-associated symptoms including PPA in AD are diverse and varied.\n\n【11】PPA can be classified into the following three types: nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA), semantic variant PPA (svPPA), and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA) \\[ 1 \\]. However, other types of PPA that cannot be classified into these three types (or a mixture of types) also exist \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【12】Different variants of aphasia may reportedly appear in AD, as follows: 100% of lvPPA is due to AD, 25% of mixed PPA is due to AD, and 4% of nfvPPA is due to AD complicated by corticobasal degeneration (CBD) \\[ 2 \\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal study of PPA in patients with pathologically diagnosed AD has been conducted to date. We present here a longitudinal study of nfvPPA in a Japanese-speaking patient pathologically diagnosed with AD.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 75-year-old Japanese man with suspected PPA visited our clinic, accompanied by his wife. He was a university graduate. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, which was controlled by a pacemaker, and diabetes, which was under control. His family medical history was not particularly remarkable. His family had recently observed memory impairment and stuttering in the patient, which prompted his visit to our clinic. During the medical interview, his speech was effortful with stuttering; however, inconsistent speech sound errors were not obvious.\n\n【15】The following tests were performed four times in total, at baseline, half a year after base line, 1 year after baseline, and 2 years after baseline (Table 1 ): Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Japanese version (ADAS-cog), frontal assessment battery, digit span of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (WAIS-III), logical memory subtest I of the Wechsler Memory Scale–Revised (WMS-R), logical memory subtest II of the WMS-R, copy of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCFT), delayed recall of the ROCFT, and the Japanese reading test. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was performed twice in interviews with his wife, both at 6 months and 2 years after baseline. The Japanese Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) was performed 6 months after baseline. The results are shown in Table 1 . The results of the logical memory subtest and ROCFT indicated that the patient’s verbal memory was severely impaired at baseline, and his visual memory impairment at baseline showed gradual worsening, respectively. The results of the MMSE and ADAS-cog showed worsening of general cognitive impairment. His behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia also showed progression, as revealed by the results of the NPI. The RCPM was performed once 6 months after the baseline; the patient scored 26 out of 36, which indicated nonverbal cognitive impairment \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【16】**Table 1 The results of neurocognitive tests**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】The Japanese Standard Language Test of Aphasia (SLTA) was also performed at each of the four time points \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The SLTA was developed in Japan and consists of 26 items for evaluating aphasia; the test kit is commonly used and easily available in Japan \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The results of the SLTA are shown in Table 2 . Scores worsened over the 2 years for all of the following subtests: auditory comprehension (ability to obey verbal commands), naming, verbal explanation of behavior of persons and movement of others in pictures, verbal explanation of Manga, verbal fluency, reading comprehension of short sentences (ability to point at pictures), reading comprehension (ability to obey written commands), writing words with Kana (ability to represent pictures), writing explanation of Manga, dictation of Kana letters, dictation of Kanji words, dictation of Kana words, dictation of short sentences, and four arithmetic operations on paper. All other subtest scores were stable throughout the 2 years. Scores for auditory comprehension of words (ability to point at pictures), word repetition, reading aloud Kana letters, reading aloud Kana words, reading comprehension of Kanji words (ability to point at pictures), and reading comprehension of Kana words (ability to point at pictures) showed no errors during the 2 years.\n\n【19】**Table 2 The results of all subtests of SLTA**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Briefly, the results of the SLTA showed impaired comprehension of syntactically complex sentences, whereas single word comprehension and object knowledge were spared. Additionally, the content of his speech during the SLTA subtest of verbal explanation of Manga showed that his agrammatism in language production had progressed. These clinical symptoms met the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of nfvPPA \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【22】The results of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography ( <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT), <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET), and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 (THK5351) PET at baseline and 2 years are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The MRI results showed global cerebral atrophy, which progressed during the 2 years (Fig. 1 ). PiB-PET and THK5351 PET, which indicated pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition, did not show obvious laterality (Fig. 2 ); however, <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT imaging showed significant regional hypoperfusion dominantly in the left hemisphere, particularly in the bilateral parietal and temporal association cortex, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex, the frontal association cortex, and the occipital lobe, which suggested CBD (Fig. 1 ). These figures showed that pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition progressed during the 2 years, and that hypoperfusion also progressed during this period. The finding of <sup>18 </sup> F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy- d \\-glucose (FDG) PET at baseline was almost the same as that of <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT, that is, glucose uptake was decreased dominantly in the left hemisphere, particularly in the bilateral parietal and temporal association cortex, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex, the frontal association cortex, and the occipital lobe, which also suggested CBD. There were no remarkable findings on either \\[123I\\] FP-CIT SPECT (DaTscans), which was performed twice.\n\n【23】**Fig. 1**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**a** and **b** are magnetic resonance images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively. **c** and **d** are \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography images showing hypoperfusion at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively, using statistical voxel-based analysis using three-dimensional stereotactic surface software.\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】**Fig. 2**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】**a** and **b** are <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively. **c** and **d** are <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively.\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Collectively, taking into account all results, the patient was diagnosed with nfvPPA with definite AD \\[ 1 \\]. The patient also met the DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria for AD \\[ 6 \\]. The patient’s clinical features included occasional urinary incontinence, progression of personality and behavioral changes based on the NPI, limb-kinetic apraxia at around 6 months after baseline, some inability to recognize grandchildren and old friends at around 18 months after baseline, and progression of ideomotor apraxia. A score of 3 was found on the modified ranking scale both 6 months and 2 years after baseline. These clinical symptoms did not meet the criteria for CBD \\[ 7 \\]. Neither the patient nor his spouse expected to receive any pharmacotherapy. We did not introduce speech and language therapy because it would have been painful for the patient. However, we advised the couple to use an elderly adult day-care center, and the patient regularly went to such a center near their home.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】We present the first longitudinal case study of nfvPPA in a patient with pathologically diagnosed AD. We observed nfvPPA in a patient who was pathologically diagnosed with AD based on PiB PET and THK5351 PET evaluations. This is not commonly observed; a previous study by Spinelli _et al_ . reported that there were cases of nfvPPA with AD and CBD but not with AD alone \\[ 2 \\]. Furthermore, nfvPPA has recently been considered an exclusion criterion for probable AD dementia \\[ 8 \\]. This discrepancy may be because the criteria for agrammatism differ between Japanese and US/UK researchers owing to their distinct grammar systems.\n\n【34】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of a Japanese-speaking patient with PPA observed in pathologically definite AD, using SLTA. Aphasia in AD is not well understood and is often only discussed with other neurocognitive impairments that appear in AD. Only a few studies have investigated aphasia in detail using SLTA in only clinically diagnosed AD \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, PPA in neurodegenerative dementias other than AD have been investigated longitudinally using SLTA in only a few studies \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【35】The results of both \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT SPECTs (DaTscans) indicated that there was no CBD. However, there have been studies of dopamine transporter binding in autopsy-confirmed CBD, one of which reported that it is possible that patients with CBD have delayed neuronal loss in the substantia nigra \\[ 10 \\]. Thus, our \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT SPECT (DaTscan) results cannot be used to rule out CBD. However, considering that clinical features did not yet fully meet the criteria for CBD, our results also do not indicate CBD in our patient, although we believe that he might progress to CBD in the future. This is because the results of IMP SPECT, FDG PET, and nfvPPA suggested CBD. This type of progression is a feature of some dementias caused by neurodegenerative diseases. For example, patients who are diagnosed with AD initially sometimes progress to dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\n【36】Radiation to the skull from nuclear medicine imaging and cardiovascular risk factors, including atrial fibrillation, can precipitate the onset of dementia in the elderly. Also, diarrhea and subsequent frailty following internal exposure might lead to dementia, in which case dementia may be prevented by probiotic supplementation \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【37】Our study had several limitations: (1) we presented only one case of aphasia progression in a Japanese-speaking patient with AD, and (2) we used the SLTA to evaluate aphasia, including agrammatism. The SLAT, which was developed during predecessor conferences of the Japan Society for Higher Brain Dysfunction, is only available in Japanese and is commonly used only in Japan \\[ 4 \\]. Because Japanese grammar is very different from that of other languages, the definition of “agrammatism” is also very different. Therefore, though we hope that the SLTA will be standardized to enable its use to evaluate aphasia in non-Japanese-speaking people in both clinical and research settings, it would be too difficult to standardize the SLTA.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】We present the first longitudinal study of nfvPPA in a Japanese-speaking patient with pathologically diagnosed AD; we were not able to find evidence of CBD in the patient.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】Data sharing is not applicable to this article because no data sets were generated or analyzed during the study.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】AD:\n\n【44】Alzheimer’s disease\n\n【45】ADAS-cog:\n\n【46】The cognitive subscale of Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Japanese version\n\n【47】CBD:\n\n【48】Corticobasal degeneration\n\n【49】DSM5:\n\n【50】Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition\n\n【51】<sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT:\n\n【52】\\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] Iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography\n\n【53】FDG:\n\n【54】<sup>18 </sup> F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy- d \\-glucose\n\n【55】lvPPA:\n\n【56】Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia\n\n【57】MMSE:\n\n【58】Mini-Mental State Examination\n\n【59】MRI:\n\n【60】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【61】nfvPPA:\n\n【62】Nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia\n\n【63】PiB:\n\n【64】<sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B\n\n【65】PET:\n\n【66】Positron emission tomography\n\n【67】PPA:\n\n【68】Primary progressive aphasia\n\n【69】RCPM:\n\n【70】Japanese Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices\n\n【71】SLTA:\n\n【72】Japanese Standard Language Test of Aphasia\n\n【73】svPPA:\n\n【74】Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia\n\n【75】THK5351:\n\n【76】<sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351\n\n【77】WAIS-III:\n\n【78】Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition\n\n【79】WMS-R:\n\n【80】Wechsler Memory Scale–Revised", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Molecular analysis revealed high-MSI with an altered expression of MSH2 and MSH6 at immunohistochemistry. Two months after 6 chemotherapy cycles with Docetaxel associated to an LHRH analogue, a computed tomography scan showed stable disease. After palliative RT (30 Gy/10 fractions) directed to the tumor mass with a 3D-conformal setup, a follow-up computed tomography scan at 8 weeks revealed an impressive response that remained stable at computed tomography after 9 months, with sustained biochemical response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of such a sustained response to low dose RT alone in high-MSI LAPC.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Routine evaluation of MSI in patients with locally problematic advanced tumors might change treatment strategy and treatment aim in this setting, from a purely palliative approach to a quasi-curative paradigm.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Microsatellite instability (MSI) is characterized by mutations in repetitive DNA sequence tracts, as a consequence of an insufficient DNA mismatch repair system. Deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) results from bi-allelic mutational inactivation or epigenetic silencing of any of the genes in the MMR pathway. Consequently, MSI status is used as a biomarker indicative of dMMR.\n\n【10】MSI has been most closely studied in colorectal cancers (CRC), where it is present in up to 15–20% of cases \\[ 1 \\]. However many other type of cancer showed MSI, like ovarian, endometrial and gastric cancer \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【11】Several studies have reported MMR protein loss and MSI also in prostate cancer (PC), especially in advanced stages (APC). The prevalence of MSI-H/dMMR in PC, however, is still unclear, with frequencies ranging from 1.2% to 12.0% in previous reports \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【12】MSI appears to be influencing cancer radiosensitivity, first reported in particular for MSI CRC \\[ 4 \\], but still not clearly observed across other histologies. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that DNA MMR proteins may influence and/or are directly involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) following radiation induced double strand breaks (DSBs). Therefore, their deficiency that characterizes MSI CRC cancers may also be linked to radiosensitivity. Because of the role of DNA MMR, MSI could be involved in multiple steps of the DDR caused by radiation, for example the detection of the DSBs, their repair and the inhibition of consecutive apoptosis \\[ 5 \\]. Several studies using colony-forming assays demonstrated a correlation between MSI and cancer radiosensitivity, expecially for CRC \\[ 6 \\], and also between MSI and radiation exposure and normal tissue sensitivity (patients who developed severe acute reactions) \\[ 7 \\]. There is, however, no clear evidence in the literature regarding the influence of MSI on radiosensitivity in MSI PC.\n\n【13】Here we present a case of MSI APC, in whom an extraordinary radiological response after palliative radiotherapy (RT) was observed, with the tumor still being in remission 34 months after treatment.\n\n【14】Case report\n-----------\n\n【15】In April 2017 a 76-year-old Italian male was referred to the Urology Department of the University Hospital of Modena for acute prostatitis and rectal bleeding. The digital rectal examination showed a rectal mass and the colonoscopy confirmed a massive rectal mucosal infiltration by a neoplastic lesion. Pathology of rectal biopsy showed a completely undifferentiated PC (Androgen Receptor+, Prostatic Specific Antigen+) with no possibility to calculate Gleason Score.\n\n【16】In April 2017 Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed a 15 × 10 × 6 cm tumor mass which macroscopically infiltrated both bladder and rectum (Fig . 1 a). Staging was completed with a bone scan that was negative for distant metastases.\n\n【17】**Fig 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Radiographic CT response to treatment of local disease. **a** CT images of advanced disease at staging. **b** CT images after chemotherapy and LH RH analogue. **c** CT images of radiation response after two months. **d** CT images 9 months after radiation therapy\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】At time of diagnosis Prostatic Specific Antigen value was 21.45 μg/L. As the invasion of periprostatic tissue was massive and the overall disease volume was therefore extensive, upfront radiotherapy with radical intent was considered unfeasible. The results of recent studies were then discussed with the patient and the option of an individual treatment concept was offered. From May 2017, a Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LH-RH) analogue and chemotherapy with Docetaxel 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> q/21d was administered as first line therapy.\n\n【22】In June 2017 bilateral nephrostomy became necessary, due to bladder infiltration, and a urinary catheterization was performed.\n\n【23】In August 2017, chemotherapy was withheld after 6 cycles, continuing with LH-RH analogue only, as suggested by the relevant international guidelines.\n\n【24】In October 2017, a CT scan revealed substantially stable disease (SD) (Fig. 1 b). During chemotherapy the patient was hospitalized several times for Grade 3–4 anemia due to repeated episodes of haematuria and rectal bleeding requiring repeated blood red cell transfusions. In September 2017 the patient was referred to our Radiation Oncology Unit for palliative pelvic RT due to persistent anemia. For RT, a standard palliative regimen of 30 Gy in ten fractions (3 Gy per fraction) using 18 MV photon beams in a conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior technique (CT-based 3D-treatment plan) was prescribed. RT was delivered from 21/09/2017 to 04/10/2017 (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【25】**Fig 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Radiotherapy 3D-CRT plan represented in three planes. A conventional anterior–posterior/posterior–anterior technique was used to target the pelvic tumor mass\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】In December 2017 a restaging total body CT scan revealed a very impressive response to RT: the pelvic mass volume was reduced from 850 cc to 105 cc, then without evidence of bladder and rectal infiltration (Fig. 1 c).\n\n【30】As of March 2018, PSA decreased to 0.35 µg/L and in April 2018 the right nephrostomy was removed.\n\n【31】In July 2018, another total body CT scan showed further reduction of all tumor diameters (Fig. 1 d). No locoregional or distant metastases were found.\n\n【32】In September 2018 the last nephrostomy was removed as well as the urinary catheter in January 2019. The patient was then followed with regular PSA value blood sampling and the last reported value was 0.13 µg/L (January 2020).\n\n【33】The patient is still on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with LH-RH analogues.\n\n【34】Molecular real time PCR analyses of biopsy showed high microsatellite instability and Immunohistochemistry showed an altered expression of MSH2 and MSH6 (Fig. 3 a–d).\n\n【35】**Fig 3**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】Tumor histology, microsatellite instability molecular analyses and IHC. **a** hematoxylin and eosin stain, **b** instability of CAT25 and NR27 markers, **c** immunohistochemistry for the MMR protein MSH 2, **d** immunohistochemistry for the MMR protein MSH 6. For the last two, background stroma and lymphocytes provide internal positive control\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】This represents, to our knowledge, the first reported case of an unusually dramatic and durable tumor response to palliative intent RT after SD obtained initially with 6 cycles of Docetaxel and ADT in PC patients.\n\n【41】MMR defects are represented in all tumor histology subtype (mostly endometrial, colorectal and gastric), and it is estimated that dMMR cancers are approximately 2–4% of all those diagnosed \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Loss of MMR activity, due to the lack of function of any of its functional elements, is associated with tumor development and MSI. At the genomic level, dMMR tumors accumulate large numbers of frameshifts (FS) and single-nucleotide variants (SNV), and are therefore characterized by high mutational burden \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【42】The peculiar genomic landscape of MSI tumors uniquely contributes to the quality of the tumor neoantigen profiles. Neoantigens result from FS and SNV, therefore an increasing number of FS and SNVs increases the probability that the tumor forms immunogenic antigens which can induce an immune response. Tumors with a fewer number of mutations are less likely to produce immunogenic antigens and probably will be less responsive to immunotherapy and vice versa \\[ 11 \\]. Likely as a consequence, when compared with their microsatellite stable (MSS) counterpart, MSI tumors typically have a higher density of Th1 and effector-memory T cells, more in situ proliferating T cells, upregulated expression of immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs), including programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and higher infiltration by mutation-specific cytotoxic T cells \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【43】Based on the assumption that MSI plays a key role in the genetic tumor development and ongoing genetic modifications in established tumors, a potential correlation between response to ICIs and dMMR has been investigated. Le _et al._ evaluated immunotherapy with pembrolizumab in patients affected by MSI cancer (both CRC and non CRC) and MSS CRC. Objective response rates (ORRs) for MSI CRC and MSI non CRC were 40% and 71%, respectively, compared with 0% for microsatellite stable CRC \\[ 13 \\]. These data suggest that MSI tumors might be particularly responsive to ICIs. Subsequent retrospective analyses have been conducted to confirm previous results \\[ 14 \\]. Pembrolizumab was finally approved in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for unresectable or metastatic MSI-H solid tumor treatment, if progressed after standard treatment and in the absence of other valid alternatives.\n\n【44】The role of MSI in response to anti-PD-1 ICIs in PC was largely unknown because only one patient with PC was included in the series by Le _et al._ \\[ 13 \\]. More recent \\[ 15 , 16 \\] demonstrated that pembrolizumab leads to responses or stable disease in subsets of patients with MSI-H CRPC, including those whose tumor expressing PD-L1. Although molecular features that contribute to response are currently not completely known, it seems now clear that MSI leads to an enhanced and effective immune system response, if stimulated by ICIs.\n\n【45】The role of RT in stimulating immune response has been investigated for a long time. To date we know that radiation causes DNA DSBs and Deng _et al._ suggested that RT damage plays a key role in stimulating interferon (IFN) expression, perhaps most efficiently by moderately hypofractionated RT regimens \\[ 17 \\]. Furthermore Dewan _et al._ demonstrated that RT with hypofractionated regimens can stimulate “abscopal responses” when combined with ICIs \\[ 18 \\]. Other studies hypothesized also that, in some cases, RT may successfully immunize the patient against the cancer, converting the irradiated tissue into an in situ _vaccine_ and endowing the host with a set of new and powerful tools to control systemic disease \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【46】Clinical experiences regarding the response of MSI tumors to RT are mainly retrospective.\n\n【47】Main evidence obviously relates to CRC and several studies showed no significant correlation between MSI and a better response to RT \\[ 20 \\], contrary to what could be expected from the in-vitro analyses mentioned above \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Further investigations have been conducted in the context of MSI endometrial cancer. These retrospective analyses again did not highlight a correlation between MSI and radiosensitivity \\[ 21 \\], but rather showed a significant association between MSI and poorer 10-year local disease-free survival, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival \\[ 22 \\] , while on the other hand an excellent response and even abscopal effects were reported for the combination of RT and ICIs \\[ 23 \\]. Therefore, the correlation between RT response and MSI has yet to be clearly understood, as controversial results between preclinical and clinical data have been reported and as there are inconclusive data regarding the effect of RT only vs. a combination of RT and IT.\n\n【48】Our experience, however, suggests that investigation of MSI-status in these patients may be worthwhile in patient-specific treatment choice with minimal toxicity, either as monomodality treatment (for example in the case of RT with moderate doses to large volumes encompassing all macroscopic disease) or—even more likely to result in local and systemic response—as a combination of RT and IT \\[ 23 \\], which may result in a dramatic benefit for these patients. The concept of applying moderate RT doses to macroscopic disease in combination with newer sensitizing systemic agents is currently investigated in various settings, with first promising results, for example for the combination of palliative dose RT and Trabectedin in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, having been reported recently \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【49】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【50】Our report adds to the overall evidence suggesting that extraordinary radiosensitivity may be encountered at least in a subset of MSI-H cancers and to our knowledge it is the first description of this phenomenon in a patient with MSI-H APC. This report therefore raises the possibility that also in these selected patients, in addition to their excellent response to RT alone, there is potential for synergy between RT and ICIs, having both potentially also systemic immune-enhancing effects as observed in other cancers. Given the low prevalence of PC with MSI, further investigations are necessary to better understand the effect of RT alone and in combination with immunotherapy. The value of MSI markers as predictive biomarkers should be formally evaluated further. Nevertheless, this and other reports suggest that routine evaluation of MSI in patients with a similar clinical situation is worthwhile and may change treatment strategy from a purely palliative approach to a quasi-curative paradigm.\n\n【51】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【52】Not applicable.\n\n【53】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【54】ADT:\n\n【55】Androgen deprivation therapy\n\n【56】APC:\n\n【57】Advanced prostate cancer\n\n【58】CRC:\n\n【59】Colorectal cancers\n\n【60】CT:\n\n【61】Computed tomography\n\n【62】DDR:\n\n【63】DNA damage response\n\n【64】DSBs:\n\n【65】Double strand breaks\n\n【66】dMMR:\n\n【67】Deficient DNA mismatch repair\n\n【68】FS:\n\n【69】Frameshifts\n\n【70】ICIs:\n\n【71】Immune checkpoints inhibitors\n\n【72】IFN:\n\n【73】Interferon\n\n【74】LAPC:\n\n【75】Locally advanced prostate cancer\n\n【76】LH-RH:\n\n【77】Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone\n\n【78】MSI:\n\n【79】Microsatellite instability\n\n【80】ORRs:\n\n【81】Objective response rates\n\n【82】PC:\n\n【83】Prostate cancer\n\n【84】PD-1:\n\n【85】Programmed cell death-1\n\n【86】PD-L1:\n\n【87】Programmed cell death ligand-1\n\n【88】RT:\n\n【89】Radiotherapy\n\n【90】SD:\n\n【91】Stable disease\n\n【92】SNV:\n\n【93】Single-nucleotide variants", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

On the fourth day following her admission, she had a rapid clinical deterioration, with subsequent radiological investigations revealing a splenic rupture. Her morphology, biochemistry, flow cytometry and histology were strongly suggestive of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Spontaneous splenic rupture is not an expected complication of low-grade lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of early spontaneous splenic rupture due to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Our case highlights that despite the typical disease course of low-grade hematological malignancies, signs and symptoms of imminent splenic rupture should be considered when formulating a clinical assessment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】According to current World Health Organization (WHO) consensus, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is defined as a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) with bone marrow involvement and an IgM of any concentration \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Although a familial component has been identified in up to 20 percent of patients, WM is generally considered a sporadic disease \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The most important risk factor is IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Another implicated epidemiological factor in the development of LPL is concomitant chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection, which is thought to potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】The presentation of WM is most commonly heralded by the onset of non-specific symptoms, such as weakness and fatigue. As the disease progresses, specific symptoms such as cytopenias, visceral abdominal pain, visual disturbances and peripheral neuropathies become evident. These symptoms reflect tumour infiltration of lymphoid tissues and bone marrow, increased serum immunoglobulin, tissue deposition of IgM, and auto-antibody activity of IgM \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【11】Splenic rupture is a well-documented potential complication of high-grade lymphomas and massive splenomegaly, but it is a rare phenomenon in low-grade lymphomas, and previously has not been reported in WM. We report the case of a patient with a spontaneous splenic rupture due to WM.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 49-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our emergency department by her general practitioner regarding a three-week history of generalised malaise, night sweats, weight loss of 6 kg, intermittent nausea and vomiting, progressive upper abdominal pain and easy bruising.\n\n【14】Our observations revealed she had a low-grade fever, blood pressure of 111/81 mmHg, a pulse rate of 80 bpm, and SpO2 of 97 percent on room air. Examination revealed a tender hepato-splenomegaly, with cervical, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n【15】Our initial investigations demonstrated a normo-chromic-normo-cytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 103 g/L. Leukocytosis of 12.9/nL; with a lymphocytosis of 9.9/nL. Thrombocytopenia of 82/nL, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm. Her biochemistry showed a total protein of 93 g/L, with a hypoalbuminemia of 29 g/L. A cholestatic picture was suggested on liver function assay, with her alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase elevated at 142 units/L and 78 units/L respectively. Her lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 315 units/L and her international normalised ratio was 1.2.\n\n【16】Her peripheral blood smear on medium-power field revealed rouleaux formation, atypical lymphocytes and plasmacytoid cells (figure 1 ). High-power magnification detected atypical B cells in her peripheral blood with cytoplasmic expansion, coarse chromatin, multiple distinct nucleoli and peripheral vacuolation (figure 2 ).\n\n【17】**Figure 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Medium-power field of peripheral blood smear showing rouleaux formation, small atypical lymphocytes, plasmacytoid cells and mild thrombocytopenia** .\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**High-power field of peripheral blood smear revealing a large, atypical B cell with mild cytoplasmic expansion, coarse chromatin, multiple distinct nucleoli and peripheral vacuolation** .\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Her bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a population of small atypical lymphocytes admixed with normal cells (figure 3 ). Interestingly, a hematoxylin and eosin stain of her bone marrow trephine identified large intratrabecular lymphoid aggregates but the absence of CD10 (figure 4 ). A further stain confirmed strong CD20 positivity of the lymphoid aggregates (figure 5 ). The flow cytometry of her bone marrow sample demonstrated that 77 percent of the lymphoid cells were CD19, CD20, CD79b, and cytoplasmic kappa positive. They were CD5, CD10, CD38 and CD138 negative (figure 6 ).\n\n【26】**Figure 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Medium-power field of bone marrow aspirate demonstrating a population of small atypical lymphocytes admixed with normal cells of erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid lineage** .\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Figure 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Hematoxylin and eosin stain of bone marrow trephine identifying large intratrabecular lymphoid aggregates but CD10 negativity excluding follicular lymphoma** .\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】**Figure 5**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**CD20 stain of bone marrow trephine confirming the strong CD20 positivity of the lymphoid aggregates** .\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Figure 6**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】**Flow cytometry of bone marrow demonstrating that 77 percent of lymphoid cells are CD19, CD20, CD79b and cytoplasmic kappa positive** .

Her cytogenetics were 46 XX.\n\n【43】**Table 1 Serum electrophoresis**\n\n【44】Full size table\n\n【45】She progressed without event until the fourth day following her admission, when a medical emergency call was initiated for an episode of worsening abdominal pain and hypotension at 88/67 mmHg. Fluid resuscitation was inadequate to maintain her systolic blood pressure at greater than 100 mmHg. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan illustrated that her spleen was enlarged with a craniocaudal extent of approximately 20 cm, with an extensive hemoperitoneum secondary to an active hemorrhage from a laceration of the superior/anterior pole of her spleen (Figure 7 ). Para-aortic, celiac axis and porta hepaticus adenopathy was noted, with the largest node measuring 19 mm.\n\n【46】**Figure 7**\n\n【47】 \n\n【48】**Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showing significant hemoperitoneum, with extravasation of contrast into the right flank/para-colic gutter** .

Approximately 82 percent of lymphocytes were CD19, CD20, CD22 positive, Kappa positive B cells. A total of 25 percent were CD38 and 21 percent CD138 positive.\n\n【60】Discussion\n----------\n\n【61】As mentioned previously an epidemiological link has been established between HCV infection and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), (including LPLs), which is especially pronounced in Southern-European, Japanese, and Brazilian populations, conferring an estimated relative risk of 2.5 in the development of any NHL. Marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) are the most commonly-encountered HCV-related lymphoma \\[ 3 \\]. Despite this association, the exact pathogenetic role of the virus is not yet clearly established \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【62】The 2008 WHO consensus on hematological malignancies bases the diagnosis of WM on a number of findings, including morphology, flow-cytometry, cytogenetics, and biochemistry. With regard to morphology, the predominant features of WM are that of a diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by small lymphocytes, plasma cells and plasmacytoid cells. Splenic architecture, when available, demonstrates a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, composed predominantly of small lymphocytes that may form small nodules in the red pulp or appear more diffusely infiltrated into the splenic parenchyma \\[ 2 \\]. Typically the immunophenotype of WM is CD19, CD20, CD79a positivity, with light chain restriction. This is identical to that of our patient. No cytogenetic aberration is specific to WM and the karyotype is usually normal, as opposed to B-cell lymphomas such as splenic MZL and nodal MZL, which demonstrate immunoglobulin heavy and light chain aberrations in many cases \\[ 2 , 4 \\]. Serum electrophoresis demonstrates markedly elevated levels of IgM protein; in addition, reciprocal depression of IgG and IgA can be seen in up to 25 percent of cases \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【63】In our case report, an increase in IgG was seen. Immunofixation showed that this was polyclonal and therefore likely to be attributable to the underlying HCV infection. It is of particular note that antiviral therapy directed against HCV infection in the setting of some LPLs has been associated with a favourable prognosis in terms of disease regression \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【64】Clinicians are often faced with a diagnostic dilemma when attempting to establish a definitive diagnosis of WM due to the overlap of clinicopathological features with other B-cell lymphomas, including MZL (splenic and nodal), mantle cell lymphoma, small cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and even diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. As mentioned previously, the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma utilizes a combination of both clinical features and a myriad of cellular parameters. In the absence of specific disease markers (such as in WM), this combination of factors is important in attaining a 'pattern of best-fit' when formulating a diagnosis.\n\n【65】Splenic rupture is not an expected sequela of WM. Although infiltration of tissue parenchyma, venous congestion, and IgM-induced coagulopathies are features of WM, they have not yet been reported to lead directly to splenic rupture in the absence of a precipitating event. In our case report, the absence of a previously abnormal spleen, a precipitating traumatic event or a transformation into a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma suggests that our case may represent a more aggressive phenotype of WM.\n\n【66】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【67】Spontaneous splenic rupture is a complication of rapid disease progression, and therefore is not an expected complication of low-grade LPLs, such as WM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of early spontaneous splenic rupture due to WM.\n\n【68】Our case report highlights that, despite the typical disease course of low-grade hematological malignancies, signs and symptoms of imminent splenic rupture should be considered when formulating a clinical assessment.\n\n【69】Consent\n-------\n\n【70】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Most cases of pediatric enterocolitis are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive _Clostridiodes difficile_ , or viruses. This is the first published case report of a toddler with methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterocolitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 16-month-old non-Hispanic White boy with no past medical or psychosocial history initially presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and emesis. Past family history was pertinent only for his father having a history of constipation. He was diagnosed with intussusception and underwent successful contrast reduction on hospital day 0. The following day, the patient had recurrent symptoms and a repeat contrast enema showed no evidence of recurrent intussusception. A computed tomography scan was obtained, which was concerning for possible recurrence with compromised bowel. He was taken to the operating room for operative reduction and underwent an ileocecetomy with primary handsewn end-to-end anastomosis. His postoperative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak on hospital day 6 necessitating reoperation and creation of an end ileostomy with mucous fistula. He received intravenous metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime antibiotics during his hospital course. On postoperative day 12, the patient developed a sudden increase in ileostomy output, and stool cultures were obtained. His symptoms persisted despite diet modifications, stopping antibiotics, and initiating loperamide. Three days later, stool cultures resulted negative for _Escherichia coli_ , _Salmonella_ , _Shigella_ , _Campylobacter_ species, and _Clostridiodes difficile_ but were positive for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ . The patient was started on a 10-day course of oral vancomycin and discharged home in good condition 4 days later. After 12 weeks, the patient underwent reversal of the ostomy and is doing well at the 1 month postoperative follow-up, now 5 months from his initial surgery.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】To our knowledge, this is the first published report of a toddler being diagnosed with methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterocolitis. Because methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterocolitis is rare and has overlapping symptoms with more common gastrointestinal pathologies, it is often misdiagnosed. When a patient presents with diarrhea or high ostomy output along with fecal cultures negative for _Clostridiodes difficile_ and other common pathogenic agents, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ should be considered.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) enterocolitis is a rare disease that typically affects immunocompromised adults \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. While MRSA is a common cause of nosocomial infection, its colonization in the upper respiratory tract does not typically migrate to the gastrointestinal tract \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Because signs and symptoms of MRSA enterocolitis include a pseudomembrane seen on colonoscopy, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, this illness is often misdiagnosed as _Clostridiodes difficile_ infection \\[ 1 \\]. The causes of enterocolitis in pediatric patients are typically Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive _Clostridiodes difficile_ , or viruses. While case reports of MRSA enterocolitis in adults and infants have been published, this is the first case to be published of a toddler with MRSA enterocolitis \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. We propose that an unexplained increase in ostomy output or frequent diarrhea should lead to stool cultures screening for MRSA alongside other common gastrointestinal pathogens.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An otherwise healthy 16-month-old non-Hispanic White male with no past medical or psychiatric history presented to the emergency room with 2 days of abdominal pain and emesis. Family history was only positive for constipation in the patient’s father. The patient lived at home with his parents and sister and had no financial, language, or cultural challenges. Upon admission, the patient’s physical exam was within normal limits and, particularly, his abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender to palpation with no masses. He was diagnosed with intussusception, which was successfully reduced by radiology via water-soluble contrast enema. The following day, he had persistent symptoms and was taken for repeat contrast enema to evaluate for recurrent intussusception. The contrast enema was negative for recurrence, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained for further evaluation. CT scan did not demonstrate intussusception, but raised concern for small bowel obstruction with compromised bowel. At this time, the patient’s physical exam continued to be within normal limits, but he subjectively appeared uncomfortable with increased fussiness and agitation. Given the patient’s history, there was concern for recurrent intussusception requiring operative reduction. The patient underwent operative exploration and was found to have an intussusception in his terminal ileum. This was manually reduced but noted to have necrotic small bowel which was resected with a primary, end-to-end anastomosis, and an appendectomy was performed. The pathology report postoperatively described the specimen as being from the small intestine with ischemic necrosis along with an intraluminal fibrin and fragments of necrotic bowel mucosa.\n\n【12】The patient’s course was complicated by an anastomotic leak along with three small bowel perforations on hospital day 6 requiring an exploratory laparotomy with abdominal washout, small bowel resections, and temporary abdominal closure. Pathology showed segments of small intestine with patchy ischemic necrosis, serositis, and numerous transmural defects. He was taken back 2 days later for end ileostomy with mucous fistula creation. Total small bowel resected was 20–30 cm.\n\n【13】During his postoperative course, the patient was initially treated with IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole followed by ceftazidime and metronidazole. He was placed on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on hospital day 9 and had return of bowel function on hospital day 10. By hospital day 19, antibiotics and TPN were stopped and he was advanced to a regular diet. On hospital day 20, he developed two episodes of nonbilious emesis and high ileostomy output at 50–60 mL per kilogram (kg) per day. At this time, the patient continued to have a normal abdominal exam. His ostomy was pink, patent, and productive. The patient received replacement fluids, and stool cultures were collected. Ileostomy output remained high despite interventions which included loperamide, modifying feeds, and correcting electrolyte abnormalities. During this time, the patient was otherwise asymptomatic, tolerating a diet, and had normal labs and physical exam. Stool cultures resulted on hospital day 24 and were negative except for a large growth of MRSA. The patient was diagnosed with MRSA enterocolitis and started on 13 mg/kg oral vancomycin three times daily. The patient tolerated this well, and his ostomy output normalized by hospital day 27. The patient was discharged home in good condition on hospital day 29.\n\n【14】A summary of the patient’s postoperative clinical course is as follows. He was seen by a gastrointestinal rehabilitation specialist 3 weeks after discharge, and no complications were noted. He was later seen in clinic by his pediatric surgeon 5 weeks after discharge with no complications and was deemed ready for ileostomy reversal. He underwent ileostomy reversal 12 weeks after discharge and is currently doing well now at his postoperative visit 5 months after his initial surgery.\n\n【15】Timeline of case progression:\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) enterocolitis is a rare and devastating disease. While there are many documented cases of adults being diagnosed with MRSA enterocolitis, there are few pediatric cases. Specifically, there are no existing published reports of a toddler diagnosed with MRSA enterocolitis \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【19】While MRSA is a common nosocomial infection, it is typically manifested in the skin with colonization in the upper respiratory tract \\[ 5 \\]. Most cases of bacterial enterocolitis are caused by Gram-negative bacteria due to its abundance in the intestinal microbiome. MRSA enterocolitis is of particular interest because it is caused by an infection with an aerobic, Gram-positive organism and is found most often in immunocompromised adults. Common risk factors include old age, previous surgery, antibiotic use, and preexisting disorders affecting the immune system \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. Because of the potential development of a pseudomembrane and the common symptom of diarrhea, MRSA enterocolitis is often misdiagnosed as _Clostridium difficile_ infection \\[ 1 \\]. Other reported symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and malaise \\[ 3 , 9 \\]. In a retrospective study performed by Gravet _et al._ of 60 patients with MRSA associated diarrhea, 98% had been treated with one or more antibiotics within a month before symptoms appeared \\[ 4 \\]. Gastrointestinal flora is a balance of primarily Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that can be disrupted by antibiotics. This disruption results in an imbalance of bacteria, allowing the colonized MRSA to grow and overcome other, nonpathogenic bacteria, resulting in infection \\[ 9 \\]. Elderly individuals and those who have undergone recent surgery not only have suppressed immune systems but also are often in environments (such as nursing homes and hospitals) where the risk of a MRSA outbreak is elevated \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【20】While there is a lack of consensus on how MRSA colonizes the gut, evidence in the literature suggests that MRSA, already colonized in the upper respiratory tract, travels through the digestive system and, aided by antibiotics, grows opportunistically in the patient’s bowel \\[ 6 \\]. The most frequently cited treatment for MRSA enterocolitis is oral vancomycin, but it is critical to reestablish a healthy gut microbiome containing primarily Gram-negative bacteria \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. This can be done by introducing probiotics and prebiotics such as _Bifidobacterium breve_ , _Lactobacillus casei_ , and galactooligosaccharides to the patient after treatment with antibiotics \\[ 9 \\]. Studies have also supported reestablishing a balanced gut microbiome through a fecal microbiota transplant \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【21】This case report underscores the importance of a broad differential and clearly demonstrates that increased ostomy output has the potential to be associated with MRSA enterocolitis. The limitations of this report include the patient’s complicated surgical and medical history, which may confound our conclusions.\n\n【22】In conclusion, MRSA enterocolitis is an uncommon form of enterocolitis and even more rare in the pediatric population. To our knowledge, there has not been another report published of a toddler with MRSA enterocolitis \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. This disease is often misdiagnosed and carries a high mortality rate. An unexplained increase in ostomy output or frequent diarrhea should lead to stool cultures screening for MRSA alongside other common gastrointestinal pathogens. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical to decreasing the morbidity and mortality of this disease process.\n\n【23】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【24】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【25】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【26】CT:\n\n【27】Computed tomography\n\n【28】GI:\n\n【29】Gastrointestinal\n\n【30】IV:\n\n【31】Intravenous\n\n【32】kg:\n\n【33】Kilogram\n\n【34】MRSA:\n\n【35】Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_\n\n【36】TPN:\n\n【37】Total parenteral nutrition", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

She had left-sided ataxic hemiparesis with one-and-a-half syndrome with bilateral seventh and right fifth nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain revealed acute non-hemorrhagic infarct in the right posterolateral aspect of pons and medulla, with normal brain vessels angiography. We described her disorder as twenty-and-a-half syndrome. She was put on antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Twenty-and-a-half syndrome is reported for the first time. It is due to posterior circulation stroke; in our case, it was due to lacunar infarcts in the pons and medulla, manifesting as one-and-a-half syndrome with bilateral seventh and right fifth nerve palsy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】There are many syndromes that describe disorders affecting eye movements and cranial nerves, such as one-and-a-half syndrome, eight-and-a-half syndrome, fifteen-and-a-half syndrome, sixteen-and-a-half syndrome, and twenty-four-and-a-half syndrome. In 1967, C. Miller Fisher reported horizontal gaze palsy to one side along with ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) resulting in loss of all horizontal movements in the ipsilateral eye, except abduction of the contralateral eye, with the lesion within the ipsilateral pontine tegmentum, naming it numerically as one-and-a-half syndrome. Anatomically, involvement of a combination of medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) plus abducens nerve nucleus or involvement of MLF plus paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) can cause one-and-a-half syndrome. The involvement of a facial nerve with one-and-a-half syndrome was termed eight-and-a-half syndrome by Eggen-Berger who first reported three such cases.\n\n【10】In continuation of this concept, we report a new neuro-ophthalmological syndrome, twenty-and-a-half syndrome, comprising one-and-a-half syndrome with bilateral seventh and right fifth nerve palsy, which has never been described before in the medical literature; furthermore, this novel syndrome gives an insight into the brainstem and its connections, in particular, the dorsolateral pons and medulla.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 45-year-old, right-handed, Asian Hindu woman presented with acute onset dizziness with imbalance and vomiting of 1 day’s duration. She was a known case of hypertension and had a history of complete recovery from a stroke with left hemiparesis 4 years earlier, for which she was put on aspirin 150 mg a day, atorvastatin 10 mg a day, and clonidine 0.1 mg three times a day. She had a non-contributory family history for cardiac and neurological events. She was a housewife, she did not drink alcohol, she did not smoke tobacco, and she belonged to lower economic class; she resided in a rural area, living in a pucca (solid and permanent) house in a clean environment. At the time of admission she was conscious, and oriented to time, place, and person. Her pulse rate was 80/minute, regular, normovolemic, all peripheral pulsations were well felt with no carotid bruits. Her blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg in supine position. She was afebrile. A cranial nerve examination revealed right horizontal gaze and right eye adduction restriction with horizontal nystagmus on abduction of left eye. An absent bilateral corneal reflex and decreased sensation over right half of face along with bilateral lower motor neuron (LMN)-type facial nerve palsy was present. A motor examination revealed left ataxic hemiparesis. An MRI of her brain was done which revealed diffusion restriction and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) correlation in the right posterolateral aspect of pons and medulla most likely representing acute non-hemorrhagic infarct with lacunar infarcts suggestive of small vessel ischemia (Fig. 1 ). A magnetic resonance (MR) angiography of her brain showed normal posterior, anterior circulation, and neck vessels (Fig. 1 ). A color Doppler of her neck and echocardiography were normal. Her hemoglobin was 10.3, packed cell volume (PCV) 30.9, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 90.7, total leukocyte count (TLC) 13,500, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 11, and serum homocysteine 13.63. The results of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) tests were normal. A peripheral smear showed mild hypochromia with anisocytosis. Serum sodium was 136, potassium 3.72, serum creatinine 0.67, blood urea 20, random blood sugar (RBS) 107, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.32, total cholesterol 111, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 31, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 66, and triglycerides 67.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Right paramedian pontine infarct with normal brain angiography\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】She was admitted for 10 days, during this time she underwent treatment as well as physiotherapy. She was put on aspirin 150 mg twice a day, atorvastatin 20 mg a day, and ramipril 5 mg once a day. At the time of discharge, she had a modified Rankin Scale (MRS) of 3 with improvement in her ataxic hemiparesis and persistence of the cranial nerve deficits. During her 6-month follow-up she was able to walk without support but still had difficulty in tandem walk. Her facial asymmetry showed marginal improvement. Her corneal reflexes appeared. No further brain imaging was done.\n\n【17】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【18】We described a patient with right horizontal gaze and right eye adduction restriction with horizontal nystagmus on abduction of left eye suggestive of right INO, absent bilateral corneal reflex, and decreased sensation over right half of her face suggesting right fifth cranial nerve palsy along with bilateral LMN-type facial nerve palsy suggestive of bilateral LMN-type seventh cranial nerve palsy with etiology being ischemic posterior circulation stroke due to small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain.\n\n【19】In this case we propose twenty-and-a-half syndrome characterized by one-and-a-half syndrome with bilateral seventh and right fifth nerve palsy (1.5 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 20.5) due to brainstem infarct in our case. There are similar syndromes described on the basis of the effect on cranial nerves, such as eight-and-a-half syndrome, fifteen-and-a-half syndrome, sixteen-and-a-half syndrome, and twenty-four-and-a-half syndrome. However, to date, twenty-and-a-half syndrome has not been reported and our case adds a new neuro-ophthalmological syndrome to this numerical list.\n\n【20】One-and-a-half syndrome consists of horizontal gaze palsy to one side along with ipsilateral INO, leading to loss of all horizontal movements in the ipsilateral eye with horizontal nystagmus in the abducting contralateral eye, with anatomical localization within the ipsilateral pontine tegmentum wherein there is involvement of MLF with abducens nerve nucleus, or MLF + PPRF. As per C. Miller Fisher, pontine base infarction may produce ataxic hemiparesis as pontocerebellar fibers are widespread at this level and may get easily involved \\[ 1 \\]. The clinical findings of our case were explained by involvement of right dorsolateral pons and medulla except left LMN facial palsy. This can be explained by the fact that a diffusion image can be negative in 8% of all patients who have had a stroke, especially in SVD and posterior circulation strokes \\[ 2 \\]. The large blood vessels of our patient were normal in MR angiography, and carotid Doppler further supported pure SVD. Lacunar infarcts are small, discrete, often irregular lesions, ranging from 1 to 15 mm in size, frequently located in the putamen and the pallidum, followed by the pons, thalamus, caudate nucleus, internal capsule, and corona radiata. These lesions are not found in the cerebral or cerebellar cortices. On histopathologic examination, these small cavities usually show fine strands of connective tissue resembling cobwebs. The lacunes and microemboli are responsible for infarct in SVD. The underlying vascular brain damage is attributed to obliteration of arterial lumen by the thickened arterial media, obstruction of the penetrating arterial lumen by parent large intracranial artery intimal plaques, or microatheromas arising at the origin of the branch itself. C. Miller Fisher analyzed the lacunes and termed these pathological changes as segmental arterial disorganization and lipohyalinosis \\[ 3 \\]. Impaired perfusion in penetrating artery territory secondary to intrinsic occlusive disease of penetrator vessel, along with compromised collateral circulatory capacity of deep penetrator vessel territory or branch artery orifice occlusion by a plaque in parent artery leads to deep small infarcts as well as infarcts larger than the territory of acutely compromised penetrating vessel \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【21】This patient behaved in a true manner of small vessel brain disease. Despite being on antiplatelet drugs she had a second stroke. It was thought that antiplatelets have a doubtful role in SVD, but after Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study (CSPS) \\[ 4 \\] that view has been revised. Small vessel ischemic strokes have a recurring nature leading to subsequent strokes not antiplatelet failure \\[ 5 \\]. Thus, to conclude, this numerical novelty, twenty-and-a-half syndrome, due to posterior circulation stroke, adds to our existing knowledge in medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

If the immunoglobulin M of _Toxoplasma_ is positive on screening, the interpretation of the result is not simple, especially when immunoglobulin M stays positive persistently.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 34-year-old Asian male developed fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy with tenderness, which was initially diagnosed as meningitis. Antibiotics were started, and diclofenac sodium was used for the fever. Although his symptoms were alleviated in a week by the treatment, gradual decline in renal function was noted, prompting a renal biopsy that indicated acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis. A week later, tenderness in both eyes with blurred vision appeared and revealed iritis and keratic precipitations in both eyes; hence, the diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and bilateral uveitis syndrome was made. _Toxoplasma gondii_ \\-specific immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M titers were both positive. Although we could not rule out recent infection of _Toxoplasma gondii_ , which may cause uveitis initially, _Toxoplasma_ immunoglobulin G avidity test indicated a distant infection, which allowed us to rule out meningitis and uveitis as responsible for the complication of recent _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, or lymphocyte transformation test of diclofenac sodium, was solely positive among the tested drugs. Uveitis was alleviated only with ophthalmic steroid, and renal function returned to normal without administration of systemic steroid.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We experienced a case of diclofenac-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome. In ruling out infections, _Toxoplasma_ immunoglobulin M was persistently positive, and _Toxoplasma_ immunoglobulin G avidity test indicated a “distant” infection. From these two results, we ruled out recent infection. However, it should be noted that “distant” infection indicated by commercial immunoglobulin G avidity is still a multiplex profile consisting of reinfection, reactivation, and latent infection. Narrowing down the infection profile of _Toxoplasma_ is challenging in some cases. Therefore, careful diagnosis and extended follow-up of such patients are needed.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare oculorenal multisystemic autoimmune disease that may occur in response to various environmental triggers, including drugs and microbial pathogens \\[ 1 \\]. Since TINU syndrome was first described by Dobrin in 1975 \\[ 2 \\], only about 200 cases have been recorded until 2018 \\[ 1 \\]. Matsumoto has identified a total of 102 Japanese cases from literature in the period between 1977 and 2013 \\[ 3 \\]. Patients with TINU syndrome can present with systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue, malaise, asthenia, or headache), uveitis (bilateral eye pain, redness, blurred vision, or photophobia), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (rise in serum creatinine and urinary protein). Noncaseating granulomata were found in 13% of renal biopsy specimen \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】_Toxoplasma gondii_ is an intracellular protozoan parasite with worldwide distribution that infects more than one-third of the global population \\[ 5 \\]. The clinical presentation of this parasite varies from asymptomatic in healthy individuals to neurological symptoms (encephalitis \\[ 6 \\], meningitis), ocular symptoms (uveitis, such as posterior uveitis) \\[ 6 , 7 \\], myocarditis, pneumonitis, or opportunistic infections mostly in immunocompromised hosts. Although the renal manifestation of _Toxoplasma_ infection is not frequent \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\], _Toxoplasma_ infection is listed as a differential diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) \\[ 11 \\] or of granulomatous interstitial nephritis \\[ 10 \\]. Even in immunocompetent hosts, some (10–15%) \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\] individuals develop acute systemic manifestations. Most frequent symptoms are lymph node enlargement (94.6%), asthenia (86.5%), headache (70.3%), and fever (67.6%). Retinochoroiditis (10.8%) is also present in the analysis of 37 immunocompetent adults with acute acquired toxoplasmosis \\[ 16 \\]. The severity of subacute toxoplasmosis of the primary infection may vary depending on the virulence of the strain or the amount of inoculum \\[ 17 \\]. Although most of the symptoms in immunocompetent adults are self-limited and last from a few weeks to months \\[ 16 , 18 \\], life-threatening pneumonia or death has also been reported \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【11】The prevalence of recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ in immunocompetent adults is best studied with pregnant women. Primary infection at early pregnancy is well known to cause congenital toxoplasmosis. The positive rate of both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) specific to _Toxoplasma gondii_ in pregnant women varies worldwide: New Zealand, South Korea, USA 0.1–0.5%, Japan 1.0–1.5% \\[ 20 , 21 \\], or 3.8% \\[ 22 \\], Africa, and Eastern Mediterranean 2–5% \\[ 21 \\]. To make matters more complicated, _Toxoplasma_ IgM can persist for several months \\[ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\] or years \\[ 28 \\] after the acute phase of primary infection (recent infection). _Toxoplasma_ IgG avidity test is a key tool to distinguish “true” recent infection from distant infection, widely used for the screening of pregnant women. Among the initially screened IgM-positive pregnant women, as much as 59% (in Brazil) \\[ 29 \\], 56% (in Turkey) \\[ 30 \\], and 71.4% (in Japan) \\[ 31 , 32 \\] of them are reported to have a higher titer of IgG avidity, indicating distant infections of more than 5 months before \\[ 33 \\]. This high frequency of persistent IgM in the initially screened IgM-positive population is one of the reasons for the lack of reliability in serological tests of _Toxoplasma_ \\[ 34 \\].\n\n【12】In the diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, differential diagnosis of dozens of systemic diseases including infections are required. Some infections are difficult to exclude because of symptoms similar to a suspected autoimmune disease. A combination of TINU syndrome and _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection is one of them. If the IgM of _Toxoplasma_ \\-specific antibody is present, the diagnostic processes become more challenging. Such cases might be misdiagnosed as TINU syndrome with coexisting active toxoplasmosis, or underdiagnosed as just toxoplasmosis. Differential diagnosis of TINU syndrome and interpretations of _Toxoplasma_ serological tests in immunocompetent hosts will be discussed. The chances of encountering this combination might not be so rare considering the worldwide prevalence of _Toxoplasma gondii_ .\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 34-year-old Japanese male with a medical history of gastric ulcer for 20 years, regular use of esomeprazole for the last 3 years, no known allergies, and no family history of kidney or eye disease presented to his local emergency department with complaints of having 2 days of 40 ℃ fever, headache, myalgia, general fatigue, and vomiting. These symptoms developed 2 days after an incised finger wound with a small amount of bleeding due to an injury during his sewage plumber work. A rapid test for influenza A and B antigens was negative; owing to concern for bacterial infection, he was started on amoxicillin and ibuprofen. His symptoms did not improve for 5 days, and he was referred to the neurology department of another hospital on day 6 of illness. On admission, he was alert. The headache and neck pain were triggered by his movement. His temperature was 38.5 °C, heart rate 88 beats/minute, and blood pressure 133/69 mmHg. Although the finger exhibited no redness, swelling, or abscess formation, physical examination revealed bilateral cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy with tenderness. As meningeal irritation signs, neck stiffness was positive, and Kernig sign was positive at 60 degrees. No other neurological deficits were noted. White blood cell (WBC) count was 8200/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with 70% neutrophils, 12.5% lymphocytes, 6.0% eosinophils, and 9.3% monocytes. Serum creatinine (Cre) was 0.91 mg/dL (80 μmol/L), and blood urea was 6.0 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm/hour, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was 11.58 mg/dL. Urine was negative for glucose and protein, the sediment contained < 1 white cell and < 1 red cell per high-power field, and two blood cultures were negative. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain did not identify any source of fever. A lumbar puncture was also performed in the neurology department. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. Initial pressure was high at 235 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O. CSF cell count was 1 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/L (1/μL) without red blood cells, glucose level was 3.66 mmol/L (66 mg/dL) \\[plasma glucose level 5.55 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)\\], and protein level was 0.31 g/L (31 mg/dL); no organisms were observed on Gram stain. No bacterial growth was detected in bottles of CSF and in bottles of blood. Then, treatment with oral levofloxacin 500 mg/day was initiated on day 6 of illness. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents/drugs (NSAIDs), that is, diclofenac sodium suppositories 25 mg, were also administered three times a day for a week until remission of high fever on day 13 of illness (Fig. 2 c). After the initiation of the treatment, contrary to the improvement of the inflammatory findings and parameters, kidney function deteriorated. Serum CRP levels were 11.58, 9.01, and 0.67 mg/dL, and serum Cre levels were 0.98, 1.28, and 2.74 mg/dL on day 6, 9, and 17 of illness, respectively. WBC count was 10,600/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with mild elevated 12.5% eosinophil (reference value < 6.0%) on day 11. There was no skin eruption on extremities. Levofloxacin and esomeprazole were discontinued on day 17, and rapid reduction of kidney function prompted a transfer to our hospital on day 20 of illness for further evaluation and management (Fig. 2 a,b). On admission, he had no fever and no complaints. There was no weight increase or pretibial pitting edema. The finger cut had healed without any scars or redness, and bilateral cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy had diminished with little tenderness. Laboratory studies showed a WBC count of 10,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> , with 60% neutrophil, 25% lymphocytes, 8.0% eosinophils, and 4.0% monocytes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm/hour, serum CRP was 0.85 mg/dL, serum Cre was 2.09 mg/dL (185 umol/L), blood urea was 27.3 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L), serum beta-2-microglobulin was 3.8 mg/L (reference value < 2.0 mg/L), urinary beta-2-microglobulin was 1589 ug/L (reference value < 229 ug/L), and urinary _N_ \\-acetyl-β- d \\-glucosaminidase (NAG) was 7.9 IU/L (reference value < 6.9 IU/L). The results of laboratory tests showed that the levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, total protein, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and uric acid were normal. IgG was 1073 mg/dL, immunoglobulin A (IgA) was 129 mg/dL, and IgM was 78 mg/dL. Urine remained negative for glucose and protein, and the sediment contained 0–1 white cell and 0–1 red cell per high-power field. Serum cystatin C measurement was 1.79 mg/L (reference value 0.57–1.01 mg/L), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 61 mL/min/m <sup>2 </sup> . His fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was elevated to 2.1% (reference value < 1%). Renal sonography revealed normal level in resistance index.\n\n【15】A percutaneous renal biopsy performed on day 22 of illness revealed focal or belt-like distribution of numerous mononuclear cell infiltrates in the interstitium, associated with focal tubular atrophy, tubulointerstitial edema, and mild tubulitis. The moderate diffuse interstitial inflammation was composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils with mild fibrosis (Fig. 1 b). Four interstitial granulomas composed of lymphocyte, plasma cell, macrophage, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells were identified (Fig. 1 a). Glomerular and vascular structures were well preserved. Immunofluorescence showed no evidence of IgG, IgA, IgM, or immune complex deposition. Acid-fast staining for _Mycobacterium_ was negative, and Grocott staining for detection of fungi was also negative. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was normal (11.4 U/L) (reference value 8.3–21.4 U/L). Chest X-ray and computed tomography did not reveal any abnormal masses, or mediastinum or hilar lymphadenopathy in the lung. Gallium scintigraphy did not show any abnormal accumulations. Saxon test results were normal (5.10 g/2 minutes) (reference value > 2.00 g/2 minutes). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SS-A/SS-B, anti-beta-2GPI, anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-ssDNA, anti-Scl70, and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were negative. IgG4 was at a normal level, soluble IL-2 receptor was 1050 U/mL (reference value 157–474 U/mL), and IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-specific antibodies against _Chlamydia_ did not indicate a recent infection. Serologies for human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) 1 and 2, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. Anti- _Treponema pallidum_ was negative, Epstein–Barr (EBV), mumps, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologies were not compatible with acute infection. According to these findings, we diagnosed the patient with granulomatous interstitial nephritis.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Renal biopsy. **a** Light microscopy of the renal biopsy (periodic acid–Schiff stain) revealed normal glomerulus with formation of interstitial granulomas indicated by arrow heads. Granulomas were composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells. Bar = 100 μm. **b** Magnified picture of marked area in **a** , revealing a focal distribution of mononuclear cell infiltrates in the interstitium, associated with focal tubular atrophy, with tubulointerstitial edema as indicated by black arrow head, and with mild tubulitis with intraepithelial lymphocytes, as indicated by white arrow heads. The moderate diffuse interstitial inflammation is composed of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Bar = 50 μm\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】On day 29 of illness, eye pain, conjunctival hyperemia, tenderness, photophobia, and blurred vision appeared in both eyes. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.2 in the right eye and 1.5 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were normal (right 11 mmHg/left 14 mmHg) with deep anterior chamber. Slit-lamp examination revealed iritis and keratic precipitation (corneal endothelial inflammatory precipitates/deposits) in both eyes. Anterior chamber cells were 1+ right and 0.5+ left. Dilated fundoscopic examination revealed that retina and vitreous body had nonspecific findings. No fever and no lymphadenopathy were observed. Hence, the diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and bilateral uveitis (TINU) syndrome was made, and ophthalmic steroid therapy was initiated (Fig. 2 b, c). Symptoms of uveitis, eye pain, redness, and blurred vision disappeared in 1 week. Keratic precipitations were reduced in 1 week, and disappeared in 2 weeks. His serum Cre level gradually improved to 1.29 mg/dL on day 44 of illness without any systemic medical interventions, and systemic steroid therapy was not provided throughout the course of the disease. Mild elevation of eosinophils was also gradually improved. Percentage of peripheral eosinophils/total WBC count were 8.0%/10000, 11.6 %/6700, and 5.0%/7600 on day 20, 24, and 44 of illness, respectively.\n\n【21】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Summary of clinical course. **a** : Symptoms related to meningitis are shown. CRP levels are shown in the line chart. The _x_ \\-axis shows day of illness (nonlinear scale). Onset of fever is defined as day 0 of illness. Key days are shown in the bottom line; day 6: initiation of diclofenac sodium; day 17: peak day of serum Cre (red line); day 29: development of uveitis (blue line); day 44: date of discharge; day 71: restart of esomeprazole; day 239: second sampling of IgG avidity test. The same time scale is shared by **a** , **b** , **c** , and **d** . **b** : Symptoms related to TIN and uveitis are shown. Serum Cre and percent peripheral eosinophils of the total WBC counts (eosinophils %) are shown in the line chart. ★ : Renal biopsy was performed on day 22 of illness. **c** Duration of each administered drug is shown with rectangles. The patient had been administered esomeprazole for 3 years on day 0. The results of lymphocyte transformation test (LTT)/drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) (performed on day 37 of illness) are shown in parenthesis on the right side. The drug positive for LTT/ DLST is shown in bold line. **d** Values of _Toxoplasma gondii_ \\-specific IgG, IgM, and IgG avidity along with the clinical course are shown in a table. The positions of the days of illness are adjusted to match the time scale of **a** , **b** , and **c** . High IgG avidity indicate a distant infection of more than 5 months before. IgG avidity test of day 20 (cryopreserved serum) and day 239 were performed together on day 239\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】To rule out toxoplasmosis, which could also develop into lymphadenopathy, meningitis, and uveitis, _Toxoplasma_ \\-specific IgG and IgM titers were evaluated on day 37 of illness, and revealed to be both positive 219 IU/mL (reference value < 6 U/mL) and 4.2 IE/mL (reference value < 0.8 U/mL) respectively. He had a dog for a pet, but not a cat. Despite the positivity of _Toxoplasma_ IgM antibody, the bilateral uveitis responded well to the ophthalmic steroid therapy, lymphadenopathy disappeared,and no signs of meningitis was observed. We decided that antimicrobial therapy was not needed, and he was discharged on day 44 of illness. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) or lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), performed by a commercially based clinical diagnostic testing service (SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), confirmed that the patient had a negative stimulation index (SI) score for levofloxacin, esomeprazole, ceftriaxone, and amoxicillin, while he had a high SI score exclusively for diclofenac sodium of 207% (reference value < 180%).\n\n【26】After discharge, uveitis recurrence was not detected, and ophthalmic steroid was terminated after 2 months of use. However, the titer of IgM of _Toxoplasma_ remained at a high level for an additional 6 months; we were not sure whether _Toxoplasma_ infection was implicated in this TINU syndrome (Fig. 2 d). To address the question, _Toxoplasma_ IgG avidity test was performed with serum sample of day 20 of illness stocked in freezer, and with fresh serum sample from day 239 of illness. The test was performed by a laboratory company (SRL) using Platelia (TM) TOXO IgG AVIDITY (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, optical density (OD) indicating _Toxoplasma_ IgG in serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after dissociating the link between antibody and antigen. Urea was used as the dissociating agent. Target antigen of the ELISA was purified from _Toxoplasma gondii_ RH strain. Avidity Index (AI) was measured by the ratio of OD(dissociating agent treated) to OD(dissociating agent untreated). IgG AI of the above samples was 0.62 (day 20) and 0.66 (day 239) (reference value: low AI < 0.4, mid 0.4 ≤ AI < 0.5, high 0.5 ≤ AI), indicating a chronologically distant infection of more than 5 months before fever onset. Hence, we determined that the pathogenesis of TINU syndrome in our case was not implicated with a recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ .\n\n【27】No recurrence of renal dysfunction was observed in the 18 months of follow-up; serum Cre levels were 1.21, 1.03, and 1.04 mg/dL on day 71, 92, and 239 of illness, respectively. Urinary beta-2-microglobulin was reduced to 234 μg/L (reference value < 229 μg/L) on day 204 of illness. HLA typing showed HLA-A3101, HLA-A3303, HLA-B4002, HLA-B4403, HLA-DR0802, HLA-DR1302. HLA-DQB1 0302, and HLA-DQB1 0604, none of which was reported to have strong association with TINU syndrome.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】To diagnose TINU syndrome, differential diagnosis of infections and dozens of other systemic diseases are required. Among infections, _Toxoplasma gondii_ is a pathogen with considerable prevalence on a global scale. Since IgM of _Toxoplasma_ is known to persist in many cases \\[ 32 \\], the chances of encountering patients with TINU syndrome with _Toxoplasma_ IgM like our patient might not be so rare. Our case illustrates the difficulties in determining the pathogenic contribution of _Toxoplasma gondii_ in a case of lymphadenopathy and meningitis followed by TINU syndrome. IgG avidity test seemed to rule out recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ and led us to conclude that TINU syndrome in our case was not implicated with a recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ . However, this process of interpretation may not be enough for a precise understanding of the infection profile of _Toxoplasma_ in similar situations. The limitations of current commercial serological tests are also discussed here.\n\n【30】### Diagnosis of TINU syndrome\n\n【31】A T-cell-mediated mechanism has been postulated for pathogenesis of TINU syndrome \\[ 1 , 4 , 35 \\]. On analysis of kidney biopsy specimens from drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), oligoclonal proliferation of drug-antigen-specific T cells was detected by staining of specific T-cell receptor beta-chain variable-region (TCR Vβ) \\[ 36 \\]. The oligoclonal immune response is also reproduced _in vitro_ with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same patients \\[ 36 \\]. Also in TINU syndrome, under the same scenario, the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells initiates the adaptive immune response, which activates the humoral response with B cells. This process, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions of type IV, causes immunopathologic damage to the uvea and renal interstitium \\[ 1 \\]. Autoantibodies against modified CRP (mCRP) is proposed to be a marker for distinguishing TINU syndrome from drug-induced TIN \\[ 37 , 38 \\]. mCRP is presumed to be one of the common target autoantigens in renal and ocular tissues \\[ 37 , 38 , 39 \\]. To demonstrate antigen-specific T cells, an _in vitro_ assay called lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), or drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) is utilized as a useful diagnostic procedure for drug-induced TIN \\[ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 \\] and for TINU syndrome \\[ 44 \\]. However, the sensitivity of this test for the detection of causative agents of drug hypersensitivity reactions is not adequate in some drugs (such as anti-tuberculosis drugs) \\[ 45 \\]. Though the results of LTT/DLST may not be absolute \\[ 41 , 42 , 44 , 46 \\], we considered that our case was drug-induced TINU syndrome caused by diclofenac sodium. Diclofenac sodium was administered 5 days before the increment of serum Cre and 3 weeks before the development of uveitis, suggesting it is chronologically reasonable to infer that TIN and uveitis were both induced from diclofenac sodium. LTT/ DLST was performed as described by Pichler _et al_ . \\[ 40 \\]. In brief, 0.20 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> whole peripheral lymphocytes were stimulated with titrated density of medicine in culture medium (complete RPMI1640 medium), together with separately prepared serum from the same patient. Cultures were started in triplicate. After 72 hours, \\[ <sup>3 </sup> H\\] thymidine was added and cultured for an additional 24 hours, and the thymidine uptakes were counted from the harvested cells.\n\n【32】The major histologic changes of tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) are interstitial edema and intraepithelial infiltration of inflammatory cells in renal tubules, accompanied with destruction of tubular basement membranes (TBM), called tubulitis \\[ 47 \\]. The infiltrated cells consist of T lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells \\[ 43 \\].\n\n【33】In a review of 40 renal biopsies of patients with granulomatous formation (37 of them are TIN), sarcoidosis was present in 50% of the patients, and drug-induced TIN was present in 18% \\[ 48 \\]. In an area where infection is a more likely etiology, microbial pathogens such as _Mycobacterium_ , tuberculosis, fungi, bacteria, spirochetes, and parasites ( _Leishmania_ , _Toxoplasma_ ) are associated with granulomatous TIN \\[ 48 \\]. ANCA-associated vasculitis, Crohn’s disease, and TINU syndrome can also cause granulomatous formation in renal interstitium \\[ 43 , 48 \\]. Histological findings of tubulitis are classified into three groups by immunohistochemistry \\[ 47 \\]: (1) negative for antibodies and immune deposits \\[ 49 , 50 \\]; (2) positive staining of immune complexes along the TBM that sometimes associates with complement \\[ 51 \\]; and (3) linear staining of the TBM, usually with IgG and complement. The third group is known as anti-tubular basement membrane (anti-TBM) disease \\[ 52 , 53 \\].\n\n【34】Detailed diagnostic criteria for TINU syndrome were developed by John T. H. Mandeville and James T. Rosenbaum \\[ 4 \\]. These criteria adopt a probabilistic approach to the diagnosis using the presented clinical features \\[ 1 \\]. Based on the criteria, our patient is diagnosed as “definite” TINU syndrome (Table 1 ). As is noted in the criteria, the diagnosis of TINU syndrome requires the presence of both acute TIN and uveitis, without other systemic diseases that can cause TIN and uveitis. The important differential diagnosis suggested by the combination of fever, lymphadenopathy, anterior bilateral uveitis, and granulomatous interstitial nephritis is as follows; sarcoidosis, Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatous with polyangiitis (GPA), Behcet’s syndrome, Epstein–Barr virus–associated infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis, bacterial/fungal infections, toxoplasmosis, and histoplasmosis \\[ 4 , 54 \\].\n\n【35】**Table 1 Diagnostic criteria for tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome**\n\n【36】Full size table\n\n【37】Distinction of sarcoidosis from TINU syndrome is particularly difficult \\[ 1 \\]. In 736 patients of sarcoidosis, the percentage of renal involvement (renal sarcoidosis) was only 0.7% \\[ 55 \\]. Another retrospective analysis of 47 patients with renal sarcoidosis reported that 90% of them had intrathoracic lesions, 66% had proteinuria, and 55% had increased ACE \\[ 56 \\]. The lymph node enlargement in sarcoidosis is typically firm, nontender, and freely movable \\[ 57 \\]. As opposed to this clinical phenotype, our case had lymphadenopathy with tenderness and did not have hilar lymphadenopathy, proteinuria, elevated ACE, and other findings such as hepatomegaly, nephrocalcinosis, or nephrolithiasis on CT scan and on Gallium scintigraphy. Moreover, uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and TIN activity in our case were appreciably alleviated without using systemic steroid in the 18 months of follow-up, which is contrasting to the high relapse rate of renal sarcoidosis even after strong steroid therapy \\[ 56 \\]. This clinical presentation made drug-induced TINU syndrome more likely than renal sarcoidosis. Long-term follow-up would be needed to confirm this presumptive diagnosis.\n\n【38】The first TINU syndrome cases were described as “Acute eosinophilic interstitial nephritis with uveitis” by Dobrin \\[ 2 \\]. From this description, one can infer that eosinophils may play a certain role in the pathogenesis of TINU syndrome. Eosinophilia is included in the diagnostic criteria of TINU syndrome as one of the manifestations of acute interstitial nephritis \\[ 4 \\]. Systemic eosinophilia is reported in 17% of TINU syndrome patients (21 of 122 cases) \\[ 4 \\]. Mild elevations of eosinophils were observed also in our case. Interestingly, the level of peripheral eosinophils showed two peaks in the clinical course. These peaks were noticed when reviewing the data retrospectively. The first peak was recorded in parallel with the upregulation of serum Cre, or the development of TIN. The second peak was recorded around 4–5 days before the development of uveitis. These fluctuations of eosinophils might reflect the pathogenesis of TINU syndrome. Whether peripheral eosinophils can be used as a prognostic or activation marker of TINU syndrome symptoms should be investigated.\n\n【39】TINU syndrome is probably an underdiagnosed disorder \\[ 4 \\]. TINU syndrome would not have been diagnosed if the association of interstitial nephritis and uveitis were not clinically evident, or if one of the symptoms had resolved by the time other symptoms developed. TINU syndrome cases are diagnosed in 0.2–2% of patients attending specialist uveitis services \\[ 58 \\], and in 0.4% ( _n_ \\= 15/3830) of uveitis patients in Japan \\[ 59 \\]. Drugs and infections have been proposed as the leading acquired risk factors for the development of TINU syndrome. Larger datasets from renal literatures also suggest that most cases of TINU syndrome are caused by drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction \\[ 58 \\]. Contrary to the differential diagnosis described in the above paragraph, specific infective agents reported as being possibly associated with TINU syndrome include tuberculosis \\[ 60 \\], EBV \\[ 61 , 62 , 63 \\], herpes zoster reactivation \\[ 63 \\], systemic toxoplasmosis \\[ 8 \\], and generalized lymphadenopathy \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【40】A review summarizing 133 TINU syndrome cases noted that the main drugs proposed as risk factors for TINU syndrome are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (18%) and antibiotics (24%) \\[ 4 \\]. There is a case of levofloxacin-related anterior uveitis, vitritis, and macular edema that required oral prednisone to return to baseline vision in an adult female \\[ 64 \\]. The most common causative drug for uveitis is bisphosphonate, which is employed in the treatment of osteoporosis or of dystrophic disease involving the skeletal system. Bisphosphonates have been associated with uveitis, nonspecific conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and scleritis. Several antibiotics have been causally linked to uveitis, most notably rifabutin, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. Sulfonamide-associated uveitis develops quickly, often as fast as 8 days \\[ 64 \\]. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), was resumed 2 months after discontinuation, without any complications thereafter. This indicates that esomeprazole had little effect on the pathogenesis of our TINU syndrome, although PPIs are common causative drugs for drug-induced TIN, like antibiotics and NSAIDs \\[ 65 , 66 \\]. Increased pH in stomach helps the survival of tachyzoites of _Toxoplasma gondii_ \\[ 67 \\]. In the view of susceptibility to ingested infectious agents, the high pH may make it difficult to completely deny the contribution of esomeprazole to pathogenesis.\n\n【41】TIN and uveitis symptoms are not always concurrent. The review summarizing 133 TINU syndrome cases noted that ocular symptoms were concurrent with systemic symptoms in only 15% of cases; in 21% of cases, uveitis occurred before systemic symptoms, occurring up to 2 months beforehand; in 65% of cases, uveitis occurred after systemic symptoms with a median of 3 months, up to 14 months \\[ 4 , 58 \\]. Based on the study, eye pain and redness were observed in 41% ( _n_ \\= 55/133), blurred vision in 10.5% ( _n_ \\= 14/133), anterior uveitis in 73% ( _n_ \\= 97/133), and keratic precipitation in 9.8% ( _n_ \\= 13/133) of the TINU syndrome cases \\[ 4 \\]. Another review summarizing 2619 uveitis cases reported that viral infections were seen in 8.6% ( _n_ \\= 226/2619) and parasitic infections in 7.5% of cases ( _n_ \\= 198/2619), most of which were _Toxoplasma_ infection ( _n_ \\= 173) \\[ 68 \\]. Most viral infection-related uveitis anatomically localized in the anterior (81%, _n_ \\= 183/226), whereas most parasitic infection-related uveitis localized in the posterior part (77%, _n_ \\= 153/198). This suggests that the bilateral anterior uveitis observed in our case was more likely to be TINU syndrome or viral infection related rather than parasitic infection related.\n\n【42】Urinary beta-2-microglobulin is widely used as an interstitial damage marker. In our case, it was highly elevated in the acute phase and gradually reduced to a normal level in parallel with remission of the illness. Consistent with our case, a review reported that urinary beta-2-microglobulin levels were elevated in all cases of tested TINU syndrome (100%, _n_ \\= 37/37) and persisted for months \\[ 4 \\]. Persistent histological change was reported in the two tested cases even at second biopsy 9 months after the first diagnosis of TINU syndrome \\[ 69 \\]. They suggest a requirement of immunosuppressive therapy in selected TINU syndrome patients \\[ 69 \\]. Urine TNFα and IL-9 levels are proposed to be good biomarkers to improve the prebiopsy diagnosis for acute interstitial nephritis \\[ 70 \\], because TINU syndrome is thought to be a lymphocyte-mediated immune response \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【43】### Interpretation of _Toxoplasma_ serology\n\n【44】The second most common cause of encephalitis deaths in the USA is _Toxoplasma gondii_ , following herpesvirus \\[ 6 \\]. A common cause of uveitis in immunocompetent hosts is _Toxoplasma gondii_ . As many as 2% of _Toxoplasma_ \\-infected patients exhibit ocular toxoplasmosis, which can be present either in the context of recently acquired infection (recent infection) or of reactivated disease as retinochoroiditis \\[ 71 \\]. Retinochoroiditis scarring has been considered as a finding of congenital infection, but is increasingly recognized as a result of acquired recent infection \\[ 72 \\]. Therefore, clinicians have a good chance of seeing an immunocompetent patient with subacute _Toxoplasma_ infections. However, medical literature related to acquired toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients is not enough \\[ 16 \\], probably because acquired toxoplasmosis has been considered to be basically self-limiting.\n\n【45】IgG avidity test of _Toxoplasma_ was originally developed by Hedman and his associates in Finland \\[ 73 \\]. Maturation of antibody affinity to target antigen occurs in the weeks or months after the primary infection. IgG avidity is initially low in the first 3 months (may remain to be low for 1 year), and achieves a higher level in the late phase of (distant) infection (4–5 months) \\[ 34 \\]. IgG avidity is necessary as confirmatory testing to distinguish the recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ from patients with persistent IgM or false positive IgM \\[ 32 \\]. In our case, although positivity of IgG and IgM of _Toxoplasma_ was obtained, we only periodically monitored the level of IgG and IgM. Despite the lack of headache, fever, and uveitis, the persisting IgM confused our interpretation of the serological results, and urged us to perform IgG avidity of _Toxoplasma_ . The test is still in the research phase and not covered by health insurance in Japan. The IgG avidity test performed on the frozen sample of day 20 of illness indicated a distant infection. Therefore, complication of a recent infection of _Toxoplasma_ on his pathogenesis was excluded accordingly.\n\n【46】A limitation of our investigation is that commercial _Toxoplasma_ IgM and IgG tests cannot distinguish different strains of _Toxoplasma gondii_ . Although reinfection of _Toxoplasma gondii_ does not basically occur in immune-competent hosts except in some rare case reports \\[ 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 , 78 \\], this may be true exclusively for the same strain. There are several strains in _Toxoplasma gondii_ with different virulence, and prevalence varies depending on geographical factors \\[ 79 , 80 \\]. Contrary to the accepted notion above, a reinfection experiment in sheep model demonstrated that reinfection of a different strain of _Toxoplasma gondii_ on preimmune sheep with the preceding infection does occur \\[ 81 \\]. There is a case report of human reinfection by a different strain of _Toxoplasma_ that was not protected by the immunity of the preceding strain of _Toxoplasma_ \\[ 82 \\] (Fig. 3 a, lower right). The authors and others \\[ 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 \\] also confirmed that acquired immunity against a preceding strain of _Toxoplasma_ may not protect against reinfection by another strain, based on mouse model experiments. Although there is no evidence of increased risk of _Toxoplasma_ infection for plumbers who are frequently exposed to sewage water \\[ 87 \\], oocysts are persistent and prevalent in water, soil, and foods \\[ 88 \\]. Also, vegetarians and certain occupations such as farmers are significantly more associated with _Toxoplasma_ IgM seropositivity \\[ 89 \\].\n\n【47】**Fig. 3**\n\n【48】 \n\n【49】Toxoplasma serology tests in primary infection, reactivation, and in reinfection. **a** The transmission of _Toxoplasma gondii_ to immunocompetent humans (intermediate host) occurs by ingestion of oocysts, normally via contaminated food or water. Infection can also occur via consumption of undercooked meat or raw meat containing tissue cysts with bradyzoites. The majority of cases (85–90%) are asymptomatic, but around 10–15% of the infected individuals develop systemic symptoms \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]. In either case, chronic (distant) infection can persist for the life of the hosts. If the hosts become immunodeficient or immune-suppressed, bradyzoites reactivate, which causes cerebral or ocular toxoplasmosis. If primary infection occurs during pregnancy, parasites can also infect the fetus by congenital transmission. Typical _Toxoplasma_ serological changes of primary infection in immunocompetent patients are shown in **b** . The first isotype antibody to appear in the very early phase of the primary infection is IgM, followed by the appearance of IgG, which is required for confirmation of the infection. _Toxoplasma_ IgG avidity test is a critical tool to distinguish recent infection from distant infection in pregnant women, because IgM of _Toxoplasma_ is known to persist in many cases of distant infection \\[ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 \\] (persistent IgM is marked with \\* in this figure). However, congenital transmission also occurs in distant/latent infected host when the host becomes immunodeficient ( **a** , lower left) or reinfected with different strains of _Toxoplasma gondii_ ( **a** : lower right). In such cases, commercial IgG avidities give high-level results even before the onset of reactivation or reinfection, because the hosts have been distantly/latently infected. Therefore, clinicians cannot interpret IgG avidity test as they do in primary infection. Clinically symptomatic phases are highlighted in yellow. Blue dot line indicates the “distant infection” profile, which consists of three infection profiles: latent infection, reactivation, and reinfection. Different strains of _Toxoplasma gondii_ are described as oocysts-2 or tissue cysts-2. Representative changes of _Toxoplasma gondii_ serology in reactivation and in reinfection are shown in **c** and **d** . In **d** , distinctive serological changes of reinfection from serum of reactivation are written in red letter. _IgG_ , _IgM_ , _IgA_ , _Toxoplasma gondii_ \\-specific IgG, IgM, IgA; _Inf_ , infection; _Pos_ , positive; _Neg_ , negative; _Pos/higher_ , positive or higher level; _v.e_ , very early phase of infection. Recent infection is highlighted in pink, and distant infection is highlighted in light blue.

L: \\[ 17 \\]\n\n【50】Full size image\n\n【51】Besides reinfection, recurrence or reactivation of the primary infection is another type of “distant” _Toxoplasma_ infection profile. Reactivation mostly occurs in immunosuppressed conditions \\[ 15 \\]. Reactivation causes cerebral, ocular, or congenital toxoplasmosis \\[ 90 , 91 \\] (Fig. 3 a, lower left). A retrospective serological analysis found that, among 217 cases of serologically positive ocular toxoplasmosis, only 3.2% were in recent primary infection profile, while 68.2% were in a distant (chronic) infection profile based on IgG avidity test \\[ 92 \\]. Direct detection of _Toxoplasma gondii_ is basically required for the confirmation of reactivated toxoplasmosis. For the detection, bioassay of suspected biological materials in laboratory mice or PCR tests targeting gene sequences of _Toxoplasma_ are utilized \\[ 5 \\]. Thus, the initial serological results of our case (positive IgG and IgM) indicate any of the following profiles: (1) recent primary infection; (2) latent/distant infection of primary infection (with persistent IgM); (3) recent infection of a different strain (reinfection); or (4) recurrence/reactivation of latent infection. The following serological results and the high IgG avidity in our case excluded the possibility of (1) recent primary infection. However, high titer and high avidity IgG generated by distant/preceding infections might mask the detection of low avidity IgG generated by a recent infection with a different strain. Therefore, the “distant” infection indicated by commercial IgG avidity test is still a multiplex profile consisting of (3) reinfection, (4) reactivation, and (2) latent infection \\[ 93 \\]. Ranges of distant infection are described as light blue rectangle at left side in Fig. 3 a.\n\n【52】The positivity of serum _Toxoplasma_ IgA is reported to be a proof of reinfection and not of reactivation \\[ 74 , 77 , 82 , 94 \\]. In primary infection, _Toxoplasma_ IgA appears shortly after IgM and persists for some time (usually 6–7 months) \\[ 95 \\]. Reappearance of _Toxoplasma_ IgM in previously infected patients is another serological marker of reinfection and not of reactivation \\[ 74 , 91 , 96 \\], although this rule is applicable only in the absence of persistent IgM. However, reappearance of IgM is not always detected in reinfection-presumed cases \\[ 75 , 76 , 77 \\]. Increased IgG of _Toxoplasma_ observed at reinfection \\[ 74 , 76 , 77 \\] or at reactivation \\[ 93 \\] should be interpreted carefully, because such a rise is also observed in a delayed serological response to antigens after treatment of toxoplasmosis \\[ 97 \\]. Serological variations in each infection profile are summarized in tables in Fig. 3 b–d.\n\n【53】Evaluation of _Toxoplasma_ IgA was not performed in our case. PCR detection from suspected biological materials was not attempted. The fact that the patient was not immunodeficient or immune-suppressed suggested that (4) reactivation was not likely. No remarkable change in _Toxoplasma_ IgG throughout the clinical course suggested that (2) latent/distant infection was more likely than (3) reinfection or (4) reactivation. On the other hand, our case fortunately satisfied the diagnostic criteria for TINU syndrome. Based on the whole clinical course, we were able to interpret the serological results of _Toxoplasma_ as (2) latent infection rather than (3) reinfection. It should be noted that making this diagnosis in the middle of the course was difficult. Protein microarray survey has identified a number of target antigens for IgG and IgM, from serum of _Toxoplasma_ \\-infected patients \\[ 98 \\]. Several efforts to identify strain-specific antigens \\[ 80 , 83 , 99 , 100 , 101 \\] or stage-specific antigens \\[ 102 , 103 , 104 \\] that enable more specific serotyping of _Toxoplasma gondii_ have been reported. Future development of serological examination of _Toxoplasma_ should facilitate the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune diseases such as TINU syndrome.\n\n【54】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【55】This case illustrates the difficulty in determining the infection profile of _Toxoplasma gondii_ in the diagnosis of TINU syndrome. Performing the IgG avidity test in a timely manner is recommended to determine the chronological assessment of the putative _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection. However, these serological examinations still have limitations in their precise determination of the infection profile. Therefore, careful monitoring and extended follow-up of such patients are critical.\n\n【56】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【57】Data sharing is not applicable to this article because no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【58】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【59】TINU syndrome:\n\n【60】Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome\n\n【61】DLST:\n\n【62】Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test\n\n【63】LTT:\n\n【64】Lymphocyte transformation test\n\n【65】TBM:\n\n【66】Tubular basement membranes\n\n【67】BCVA:\n\n【68】Best-corrected visual acuity\n\n【69】KP:\n\n【70】Keratic precipitation\n\n【71】NSAID:\n\n【72】Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent/drug\n\n【73】CRP:\n\n【74】C-reactive protein\n\n【75】Cre:\n\n【76】Creatinine\n\n【77】CT:\n\n【78】Computed tomography\n\n【79】CSF:\n\n【80】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【81】WBC:\n\n【82】White blood cell\n\n【83】NAG:\n\n【84】_N_ \\-acetyl-β- d \\-glucosaminidase\n\n【85】GFR:\n\n【86】Glomerular filtration rate\n\n【87】FeNa:\n\n【88】Fractional excretion of sodium\n\n【89】ACE:\n\n【90】Angiotensin-converting enzyme\n\n【91】ANCA:\n\n【92】Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\n\n【93】ANA:\n\n【94】Anti-nuclear antibody\n\n【95】GBM:\n\n【96】Glomerular basement membrane\n\n【97】EBV:\n\n【98】Epstein–Barr virus\n\n【99】CMV:\n\n【100】Cytomegalovirus\n\n【101】SI:\n\n【102】Stimulation index\n\n【103】HLA:\n\n【104】Human leukocyte antigen", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Aromatase inhibitors are associated with significant musculoskeletal adverse effects, likely through growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 modulation, while tamoxifen reduces insulin-like growth factor 1 production. We describe the case of a patient who was treated successfully with tamoxifen for her hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and acromegaly.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 57-year old White female with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer was diagnosed with acromegaly. She received adjuvant endocrine therapy with anastrozole but could not tolerate this medication because of severe arthralgia, so she was switched to tamoxifen. Shortly after starting tamoxifen, the patient’s musculoskeletal symptoms resolved and her insulin-like growth factor 1 levels normalized. She has remained in remission of her acromegaly and breast cancer since initiating tamoxifen.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case highlights the dual benefit of tamoxifen therapy in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and acromegaly. Unlike anastrozole, tamoxifen has the benefit of lowering insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, which underscores its advantage in reducing adverse musculoskeletal symptoms during the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. We offer the first reported use of tamoxifen monotherapy for the successful treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. While tamoxifen may offer an additional, oral option for acromegaly patients who do not respond to or tolerate conventional growth-hormone-lowering therapy, additional studies are necessary.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Acromegaly is a chronic disease caused by growth hormone overproduction, most commonly by a pituitary adenoma, with characteristic bone and soft tissue changes. Individuals with acromegaly are subject to extensive comorbid illnesses and complications. An increase in neoplasia incidence with acromegaly remains controversial, but increased rates of breast cancer have been noted previously \\[ 1 \\]. While on treatment with antineoplastic agents, mortality rates from cancer are higher in acromegaly patients whose growth hormone levels remain elevated, and those with reduced growth hormone levels have a mortality rate similar to the general population \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】Hormone-receptor (that is, estrogen receptor \\[ER\\] and progesterone receptor \\[PR\\]) testing is recommended for all invasive breast cancers, as this predicts which patients may benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy. Since ER-positive breast cancers portend an increased risk of late recurrence, recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guidelines recommend extended adjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AI) or tamoxifen for 10 years total \\[ 3 \\]. Unfortunately, AI are associated with significant musculoskeletal adverse effects, including bone pain and arthralgia in as many as 61% of users, with up to 20% of patients discontinuing therapy because of pain \\[ 4 \\]. While several potential etiologies have been proposed for AI-induced arthralgia \\[ 5 \\], an intriguing possibility involves growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) modulation by AI therapy with subsequent development of adverse musculoskeletal effects. AI therapy has been shown to result in increased IGF-1 levels and an increased incidence of arthralgia in women treated for breast cancer, while tamoxifen reduced IGF-1 levels and the overall incidence of musculoskeletal side effects when used as adjuvant therapy \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 57-year-old White female with past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, nontoxic multinodular goiter, and hypertension underwent a routine mammogram, which revealed a focal asymmetry in the right breast; this was subsequently characterized on ultrasound as an irregular, hypoechoic solid mass with indistinct margins measuring 14 mm. A biopsy revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1, ER 100%, PR 100%, HER2/neu 1+ with a Ki-67 index of 5%. The patient underwent partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and subsequently received radiation therapy.\n\n【13】The patient was then referred to our endocrine clinic for treatment of her osteopenia, when it was noted that she had features consistent with growth hormone excess, including frontal bossing, jaw protrusion, wide-spaced teeth, deep voice, diaphoretic palms, and enlarged hands and feet. Symptomatically, she noted episodic headaches and diaphoresis of the hands but denied arthralgia or change in ring, shoe, or hat size. Biochemical evaluation for growth hormone excess at this time revealed an IGF-1 level of 535 ng/mL by LC/MS (reference range 50–317 ng/mL, _Z_ \\-score > 3) and morning fasting growth hormone level of 1.57 ng/mL (reference range 0.01–3.61 ng/mL). Two-hour oral glucose tolerance testing was performed, which showed failure of growth hormone to suppress, with a nadir level of 1.4 ng/mL. Dynamic 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) of the pituitary with gadolinium administration revealed subtle asymmetry of the right aspect of the sella without discrete lesion noted (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】T1-weighted, dynamic 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary revealing subtle asymmetry involving the right aspect of the sella without focal lesion noted\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】The patient opted to address her malignancy first prior to consideration of definitive therapy of her acromegaly. She was started on adjuvant endocrine therapy with anastrozole for her breast cancer but developed severe arthralgia, so was changed to tamoxifen, with prompt resolution of her headache and musculoskeletal symptoms. Two months after tamoxifen initiation, the patient’s IGF-1 levels normalized and remained within the normal reference range for over 3 years while she continued tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 2 ). Her growth hormone levels ranged from 1.4 to 2 ng/mL while on tamoxifen therapy. Recently, the patient briefly discontinued the tamoxifen for 3 months to see if this was the cause of her diminished energy levels; her IGF-1 levels increased above the normal reference range from 249 to 446 ng/mL and her acral symptoms recurred, so she restarted tamoxifen, with successive normalization of her IGF-1 level to 205 ng/mL. Repeat imaging 3 months after restarting tamoxifen therapy again failed to reveal a discrete sellar lesion.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】IGF-1 levels (LC/MS) before and after anastrozole therapy, then while on tamoxifen therapy. Upper- and lower-normal reference ranges (50–317 ng/mL) shown as dashed lines\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Given the patient’s excellent IGF-1 response to tamoxifen, she has opted for continued medical therapy rather than surgical exploration. When she completes her course of tamoxifen next year, she prefers to transition to oral octreotide for ongoing treatment of her acromegaly. Regarding her breast cancer, she has had no evidence of recurrence 4 years since the time of diagnosis.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Orally administered estrogen inhibits hepatic IGF-I synthesis through first-pass hepatic effect but increases GH secretion by reduced feedback inhibition \\[ 7 \\]. This reduction in IGF-1 levels, despite an overall increase in circulating GH, is explained by an inhibitory effect on the metabolic action of GH mediated by oral estrogen. Oral estrogen therapy attenuates GH signaling by inducing suppressors of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS-2), thereby inhibiting JAK2 phosphorylation through the JAK/STAT pathway \\[ 8 \\]. Analogous to this effect of oral estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) act as an estrogen agonist on the liver \\[ 9 \\] and reduce IGF-1 production. This gives them a unique advantage both in the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer as well as in acromegaly. In a study of 17 subjects (15 men, 2 postmenopausal women) with acromegaly whose IGF-1 levels remained elevated despite conventional, GH-lowering medical therapy, the addition of tamoxifen reduced IGF-1 levels by an average of 90 ng/mL and normalized plasma IGF-1 in 47% of subjects \\[ 10 \\]. Tamoxifen also lowered IGF-1 levels in 13 out of 19 subjects with acromegaly (6 men, 13 women), normalizing IGF-1 levels in 21% of participants \\[ 11 \\]. Tamoxifen does not lower GH levels in acromegaly, however, since GH secretion remains autonomous. In a study of 16 male patients with refractory acromegaly, despite conventional therapy, the addition of clomiphene citrate, a SERM, reduced IGF-1 levels by 41% but caused a nonsignificant increase in GH levels \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【26】The GH/IGF-1 axis plays an integral role in breast development; furthermore, when GH and IGF-1 levels are experimentally perturbed, hyperplastic lesions may develop, increasing the chances of mammary carcinoma \\[ 13 \\]. The IGF-1 receptor is implicated in breast cancer, with up to 50% of breast tumors expressing the activated form of this receptor \\[ 14 \\]. Circulating IGF-1 levels are also associated with breast cancer risk, with pooled data from 17 prospective studies demonstrating a positive association between IGF-1 levels and estrogen-receptor-positive cancer risk \\[ 15 \\]. Furthermore, higher IGF-1 levels are related to reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy \\[ 16 \\]. Tamoxifen lowers plasma IGF-1 levels in individuals with breast cancer \\[ 17 \\], which may contribute to its antitumor action. While interventions aimed at inhibiting the IGF-1R have not improved outcomes in breast cancer subjects to date, various elements of study design may be contributory to this outcome \\[ 18 \\] and further studies are ongoing.\n\n【27】There are two cases in the literature describing cases of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in women \\[ 19 , 20 \\]. The first case details the response to breast cancer therapy in a woman with ER+/PR+ metastatic disease treated concomitantly with exemestane, an AI, and octreotide for her acromegaly; the subject’s breast cancer progressed when she was nonadherent with octreotide therapy \\[ 19 \\]. In the second case, the IGF-1 levels of a patient with acromegaly remained elevated despite lanreotide and cabergoline therapy \\[ 20 \\]. Shortly thereafter, the patient was diagnosed with ER+/PR− breast cancer. Tamoxifen was substituted for the patient’s cabergoline, with subsequent normalization of the patient’s IGF-1 levels. Our case differs from these two published cases in that our patient was not treated with conventional medical therapy for acromegaly; instead, she received initial therapy with anastrozole, which exacerbated her musculoskeletal symptoms, presumably mediated by the effect on her GH/IGF-1 axis. She was then switched to tamoxifen, which resolved her acral symptoms and normalized her IGF-1 levels. Ours is therefore the first-reported use of tamoxifen monotherapy for the successful treatment of acromegaly and hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】We report the case of a patient with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who was diagnosed with acromegaly prior to the initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Her symptoms worsened on anastrozole but improved significantly with tamoxifen, with durable control of her acromegaly and breast cancer. This case highlights the dual benefit of tamoxifen therapy in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer and acromegaly. Unlike anastrozole, tamoxifen has the benefit of lowering IGF-1 levels, which underscores its advantage in reducing adverse musculoskeletal symptoms during the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Additionally, tamoxifen offers an additional, oral treatment option for patients with acromegaly who might not achieve biochemical targets or cannot tolerate conventional medical therapy (such as somatostatin analogs or growth hormone receptor antagonists), though additional studies are necessary.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】Not applicable.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】ER:\n\n【34】Estrogen receptor\n\n【35】PR:\n\n【36】Progesterone receptor\n\n【37】GH:\n\n【38】Growth hormone\n\n【39】IGF-1:\n\n【40】Insulin-like growth factor 1\n\n【41】SERMs:\n\n【42】Selective estrogen receptor modulators", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

It is relatively uncommon in the Asian population and even more so in males. Despite the usual involvement of the brainstem, eight-and-a-half syndrome remains a rare first presentation in multiple sclerosis. Only a few cases have been reported previously, but none involving the Asian population. Eight-and-a-half syndrome, a neuro-ophthalmological condition, is characterized by one-and-a-half syndrome with ipsilateral lower facial nerve palsy, which localizes lesions to the pontine tegmentum. This case report demonstrates the first case of eight-and-a-half syndrome as the first presentation of multiple sclerosis in an Asian male.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A healthy 23-year-old Asian man presented with sudden onset of diplopia followed by left-sided facial asymmetry for 3 days. Assessment of extraocular movement revealed left conjugate horizontal gaze palsy. On right gaze, there was limited left eye adduction and horizontal nystagmus of the right eye. These findings were consistent with a left-sided one-and-a-half syndrome. Prism cover test revealed left esotropia of 30 prism diopters. Cranial nerve examination showed left lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy, while other neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed multifocal T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesions, involving bilateral periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial regions. A focal gadolinium contrast-enhanced lesion with open ring sign on T1 sequence was seen at the left frontal juxtacortical region. Multiple sclerosis was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical and radiological evidence, which fulfilled the 2017 McDonald criteria. Positive oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid analysis further confirmed our diagnosis. He had a complete resolution of symptoms 1 month after a course of pulsed corticosteroid therapy, and was subsequently placed on maintenance therapy with interferon beta-1a.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case illustrates eight-and-a-half syndrome as the first presentation of a diffuse central nervous system pathology. A wide range of differential diagnoses needs to be considered in such a presentation as based on the patient’s demographics and risk factors.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by loss of motor or sensory function due to immune-mediated inflammation, demyelination, and subsequent loss of axons \\[ 1 \\]. It is relatively rare in Asia, with a prevalence of 2–5/100,000 and a female-to-male ratio of 4:1\\[ 1 \\]. Despite known association of brainstem signs with MS \\[ 2 \\], eight-and-a-half syndrome remains a rare first presentation. There were a few cases reported previously, but none among the Asian population. Eight-and-a-half syndrome is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterized by one-and-a-half syndrome and ipsilateral lower facial nerve palsy, which was first described in 1998 by Eggenberger \\[ 3 \\]. This case report demonstrated the first case of eight-and-a-half syndrome as the first presentation of MS in an Asian male.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A healthy 23-year-old Asian man presented with sudden onset of diplopia followed by left-sided facial asymmetry for 3 days. On examination, he appeared well orientated without impaired cognition. Visual acuity and color vision was normal. Bilateral pupils were 3 mm equal and reactive to light with an absent relative afferent pupillary defect. Assessment of extraocular movement revealed a complete left conjugate horizontal gaze palsy. Upon right gaze, there was limited left eye adduction and horizontal nystagmus of the right eye upon abduction (Fig. 1 ). The impaired extraocular movement was not corrected by oculocephalic reflex. Prism cover test (PCT) revealed left esotropia of 30 prism diopters (PD). There was no ptosis and convergence was normal. Fundus examination was unremarkable. Cranial nerve examination showed left lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy, as demonstrated by the inability to wrinkle left frontalis, left lagophthalmos, and shallow nasolabial folds (Fig. 2 ). Other neurological examinations were normal.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Left gaze palsy in the nine diagnostic positions of gaze. Upon right gaze, left eye was unable to adduct past midline with right eye horizontal nystagmus upon abduction\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Left lower motor facial nerve palsy demonstrated by mild left lagophthalmos and loss of nasolabial folds\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done and showed multifocal T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense lesions without restricted diffusion, involving bilateral periventricular, juxtacortical, and infratentorial regions, which includes left pontine tegmentum (Fig. 3 ). A focal gadolinium-enhanced lesion with an open ring sign was seen at left frontal juxtacortical. A diagnosis of MS was made on our patient’s first presentation based on his MRI brain findings, which fulfilled the latest McDonald criteria (2017). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation revealed positive oligoclonal bands, which further confirmed our diagnosis. Pulsed steroid therapy was commenced, and his symptoms completely resolved after 1 month. He was subsequently placed on maintenance therapy with interferon beta-1a and followed up by our neuro-medical team.\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】MRI brain T2 FLAIR showing hyperintense lesion (white arrow) over left pontine tegmentum causing left eight-and-a-half syndrome in this patient\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】Horizontal gaze is regulated by parapontine reticular formation (PPRF), medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), abducens, and oculomotor nuclei. PPRF receives impulse from contralateral frontal eye field (FEF) and ipsilateral parietal cortex, acting as the last supranuclear relay involved in conjugate horizontal eye movement. The impulse is then relayed to ipsilateral abducens nucleus and via the MLF to contralateral oculomotor nucleus, causing contraction of ipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral medial rectus muscle, resulting in horizontal gaze.\n\n【27】One-and-a-half syndrome \\[ 4 \\] is a combination of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) and horizontal gaze palsy. INO is caused by lesions in the MLF, while horizontal gaze palsy may be due to lesions in PPRF, abducens nucleus, or fascicles. Since our patient demonstrated an impaired oculocephalic reflex, we presumed that the lesion involved abducens nucleus or fascicles, rather than an isolated PPRF \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【28】Rarely when the lesion extends to the ipsilateral facial nerve nucleus or its fascicles, which wrap around the abducens nucleus, does it result in ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The combination of both one-and-a-half syndrome (1.5) and lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy (7) is therefore termed as eight-and-a-half syndrome \\[ 5 \\] (8.5). This syndrome localizes lesions to pontine tegmentum (as shown in Fig. 4 ), which houses horizontal gaze center structures, facial nucleus, and fascicles.\n\n【29】**Fig. 4**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Schematic axial diagram of pontine tegmentum at the level of facial colliculus. The circled area represents the location of lesion in eight-and-a-half syndrome involving the left facial nucleus and its fascicle, in addition to the left horizontal gaze center structures, median longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), parapontine reticular formation (PPRF), abducens nucleus, and nerve\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Among reported cases of eight-and-a-half syndrome, the most common etiology is ischemic stroke \\[ 3 , 6 \\], followed by intracranial hemorrhage \\[ 7 \\], demyelinating lesion \\[ 3 , 6 \\], infection (tuberculoma) \\[ 6 \\], and vasculitis \\[ 3 \\]. Despite brainstem lesions in MS commonly accounting for 20% of clinical isolated syndromes \\[ 2 \\], eight-and-a-half syndrome is still a rare first presentation. To date, there have only been a few cases reported, including one case of childhood MS \\[ 8 \\]. Due to the rarity of MS among the Asian population, it is usually not among the top differential diagnoses for clinicians.\n\n【34】With the advancement of neuroimaging, clinical evidence of dissociation in space and time in MS can be demonstrated radiologically with the revised 2017 McDonald criteria \\[ 9 \\], allowing for the possible diagnosis of MS on the first clinical presentation.Our patient’s clinical isolated syndrome lesion was shown on MRI as T2/FLAIR hyperintensity over the left pontine tegmentum. Other asymptomatic T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions were found at typical locations for MS; namely, juxtacortical, periventricular, and infratentorial regions, which illustrate dissociation in space. Dissociation in time is evidenced by the presence of gadolinium-enhanced T1 lesion at the left frontal subcortical region with other concurrent non-enhancing lesions. It is therefore sufficient to diagnose our patient with MS on his first presentation, which was further supported by positive CSF oligoclonal bands.\n\n【35】To the best of our knowledge, this case demonstrated the first case of eight-and-a-half syndrome as the first sign of MS in an Asian male. Eight-and-a-half syndrome remains a relatively rare brainstem lesion. Despite localization of the lesion to pontine tegmentum, it can still present as a clinical isolated syndrome of diffuse CNS disease. A wide range of differential diagnoses needs to be considered in such a presentation as based on the patient’s demographics and risk factors.\n\n【36】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】The data and materials gathered during this study are included within the article.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】MS:\n\n【40】Multiple sclerosis\n\n【41】CNS:\n\n【42】Central nervous system\n\n【43】MRI:\n\n【44】Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n\n【45】CSF:\n\n【46】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【47】PPRF:\n\n【48】Parapontine reticular formation\n\n【49】MLF:\n\n【50】Medial longitudinal fasciculus\n\n【51】FEF:\n\n【52】Frontal eye field\n\n【53】INO:\n\n【54】Internuclear ophthalmoplegia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear but possible causes have been proposed mainly catecholamine cardiotoxicity, followed by metabolic disturbance, coronary microvascular impairment, and multivessel epicardial coronary artery vasospasm. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy accounts for 1–2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome with the majority of patients diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy being women > 55 years of age. Here, we discuss the case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with typical chest pain, electrocardiography changes and cardiac markers consistent with acute coronary syndrome, who was subsequently diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 38-year-old healthy American woman with negative past medical history presented to our Emergency Department with chest pain developing while participating in intense outdoor physical activities (Zumba) at a fundraising event. Our patient had typical substernal chest pain induced with exercise and was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin in the Emergency Department. The pain started after 2 h of intensive Zumba workout. On review of her history, our patient was noted to be taking spironolactone 125 mg once daily for hirsutism for the past year. Our patient denied any family history of cardiac disease or heart failure. She admitted to being a former occasional smoker and to drinking alcohol socially. She denied any illicit drug use. She works as a social worker, and reported that she does not experience much stress in her life and denied any “one big life-changing event” or any major stressful news. While in the Emergency Department, our patient was hemodynamically stable and an electrocardiography was performed and showed sinus rhythm with no ST elevation/depression but noted T-wave inversion in leads I and aVL, and T wave flattening in leads V1 and V2. Her troponin levels were 0.294 and 0.231 consecutively. An echocardiogram was done and showed hypokinetic apical and mid-distal walls and hyperdynamic basal walls of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 35–40%, consistent with apical ballooning syndrome. Cardiac catheterization was subsequently done and showed depressed left ventricle systolic function, ejection fraction of 30–35% with anteroapical dyskinesia and no evidence of coronary artery disease.\n\n【5】Our patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after fulfilling all four of the Mayo Clinic’s diagnostic criteria and was subsequently treated with a beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Our patient did not have one clear trigger for her overt Takotsubo cardiomyopathy other than the Zumba activity. Zumba is considered an activity with excessive sympathetic stimulation leading to catecholamine-induced microvascular spasm or through to direct myocardial toxicity, which is postulated to be behind the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Another interesting finding in our patient was her use of spironolactone, as treatment for hirsutism, which is an aldosterone antagonist. Aldosterone actually potentiates the effects of catecholamine and thus activates the sympathetic system. Spironolactone can thus be considered as cardioprotective against the effects of catecholamine on the heart and that is why it is considered to be beneficial and subsequently improves mortality in chronic heart failure as described in several studies.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or stress cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of coronary occlusion. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was first reported in 1990 in Japan and was given the name “Takotsubo” after the Japanese octopus trap, due to the resemblance of its shape to the appearance of the patient’s left ventricle in systole. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear but possible causes have been proposed mainly catecholamine cardiotoxicity, followed by metabolic disturbance, coronary microvascular impairment, and multivessel epicardial coronary artery vasospasm. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed with the most commonly used one being the Mayo Clinic 2004 diagnostic criteria that was modified in 2008: (1) transient hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid segments with or without apical involvement; (2) absence of obstructive coronary disease or angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture; (3) new electrocardiographic abnormalities or modest elevation in cardiac troponin; (4) absence of: pheochromocytoma and myocarditis. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy accounts for 1–2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome with the majority of patients diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy being women > 55 years of age \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【11】Here, we discuss the case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with typical chest pain, electrocardiography (EKG) changes and cardiac markers consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), who was subsequently diagnosed with TCM without having a clear trigger.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】On August 1, 2017, a 38-year-old American woman with a negative past medical history presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with chest pain. Our patient stated that pain started on the morning of July 31 around 11:00 am, while participating in outdoor physical activities (Zumba) at a fundraising event. After 2 h into the workout, she began to feel chest pain, that was substernal, pressure-like, and throbbing in nature. The pain was non-radiating, six out of ten in intensity, and associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Pain was alleviated in the ED when she was given sublingual nitroglycerin and intravenous morphine. She also stated episodes of a “fluttery feeling” and at times feeling lightheaded. She denied any previous history of a similar episode. She has no known cardiac history. Our patient did state that she never did any kind of exercise except for the activities of daily living. On review of her medical history, she stated that she was taking spironolactone for hirsutism, from August to January 2016 and then May 2017–present, with initial dosing of 125 mg titrated up to 150 mg and then back down to 125 mg due to muscle fatigue. Our patient had intentional weight loss of 30 lbs from March to July 2017. She follows a healthy diet and has a normal body mass index (BMI) of 24. Our patient denied any family history of cardiac disease or heart failure. She admitted to being a former occasional smoker and to drinking alcohol socially. She denied any illicit drug use. She works as a social worker, and reported that she does not experience much stress in her life and denied any “one big life-changing event” or any major stressful news. She reported a history of anxiety and was medicated approximately 4 years ago with alprazolam that was later discontinued as our patient was comfortable with her stress levels at that time.\n\n【14】While in the ED, patient was hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 60s–70s beats/min, respiratory rate of 12–20 breaths/min, blood pressure of 90s/60s mmHg, O <sub>2 </sub> saturation of > 95% on room air, and afebrile. On physical examination, our patient was awake, alert, oriented to self, others, time, and place. Her skin was warm, dry, with no apparent rashes. Her neck was supple and non-tender with no jugular venous distension or apparent masses. A cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs or gallops. Our patient did not demonstrate any lower extremity edema and pulses were intact bilaterally. Her lungs were clear with equal breath sounds. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. A neurological examination showed grossly intact cranial nerves 2–12, normal sensation, strength was full bilaterally, normal reflexes, intact coordination and normal gait. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed and showed sinus rhythm with no ST elevation/depression but noted T-wave inversion in leads I and aVL, and T wave flattening in leads V1 and V2. Her troponin levels were 0.294 and 0.231 consecutively. A chest X-ray showed mild atelectasis at the left lung base, prominent pectus excavatum deformity of the anterior chest wall, bilateral small pleural effusions or pleural scarring, and no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.\n\n【15】An echocardiogram was done and showed hypokinetic apical and mid-distal walls and hyperdynamic basal walls of the left ventricle (LV) with ejection fraction (EF) of 35–40%, consistent with apical ballooning syndrome (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Echocardiogram of the patient showing hypokinetic apical and mid-distal walls and hyperdynamic basal walls of the left ventricle\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Cardiac catheterization was subsequently done and showed depressed LV systolic function, ejection fraction of 30–35% with anteroapical dyskinesia and no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】Cardiac catheterization of the patient showing patent coronary vessels with anteroapical dyskinesia\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Our patient was subsequently treated with a beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Our patient was discharged with a LifeVest (a wearable cardiac defibrillator) and instructed to follow up in 1 month with the cardiologist to have a repeat echocardiogram. One month later, during her follow-up with the cardiologist, she denied any episodes of chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. At that visit, a repeat echocardiogram was done and showed normal findings with an EF of 60–65%, thus the LifeVest was discontinued. After that visit, patient was lost to follow-up. We followed CARE reporting guidelines in publishing our case report with important information from our case presented as a timeline (Table 1 ).\n\n【25】**Table 1 Timeline table**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Our patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after fulfilling all four of the Mayo Clinic’s diagnostic criteria \\[ 1 \\]. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), since the main provoking factor is thought to be the stress-induced release of catecholamines, specifically norepinephrine (NE) \\[ 3 \\]. Our patient did not have one clear trigger for her overt TCM other than the Zumba activity. Our patient was doing Zumba, an excessive exercise activity, when she developed the symptoms. Zumba is considered an activity with excessive sympathetic stimulation, which is postulated to be behind the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy through the effect of these catecholamine hormones that are released during exercise leading to catecholamine-induced microvascular spasm or through direct myocardial toxicity \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. On the other hand, another interesting finding in our patient was her use of spironolactone, as treatment for hirsutism, which is an aldosterone antagonist. Aldosterone actually potentiates the effects of catecholamine and thus activates the sympathetic system. Spironolactone can thus be considered as cardioprotective against the effects of catecholamine on the heart and that is why it is considered to be beneficial and subsequently improves mortality in chronic heart failure as described in several studies \\[ 4 \\]. This could prompt further studies to better understand the pathophysiology behind the association between catecholamine and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【30】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is another cause of sudden cardiac death in young people especially among those with physical or mental stressors that exacerbate this condition. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is still a complex entity with a complex and not well understood pathophysiology. Even though most of the young patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy recover or improve within 4–5 weeks, some patients do develop complications including: pulmonary edema, malignant arrhythmia, and even death. Therefore, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is getting more and more attention and physicians need to keep a high suspicion for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in young patients presenting with clinical manifestations similar to other cardiac diseases.\n\n【31】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【32】ACS:\n\n【33】Acute coronary syndrome\n\n【34】BMI:\n\n【35】Body mass index\n\n【36】CAD:\n\n【37】Coronary artery disease\n\n【38】ED:\n\n【39】Emergency department\n\n【40】EF:\n\n【41】Ejection fraction\n\n【42】EKG:\n\n【43】Electrocardiography\n\n【44】LV:\n\n【45】Left ventricle\n\n【46】NE:\n\n【47】Norepinephrine\n\n【48】SIC:\n\n【49】Stress-induced cardiomyopathy\n\n【50】TCM:\n\n【51】Takotsubo cardiomyopathy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

The classical form, defined by cortisol insufficiency, is accompanied by prenatal androgen excess causing variable masculinization degrees of external genitalia in babies with a 46, XX karyotype.\n\n【3】### Cases presentation\n\n【4】These five case reports highlight the management of Syrian females aged between 0 and 32 years with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Two of the patients have been raised as males, while two had reconstructive surgery and one had hormonal therapy. Becoming mother was achieved by two patients\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The integrated treatment of females with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia CAH, which includes appropriate surgical procedures and controlled hormonal therapy, gives these females the opportunity to live as they are, and perhaps as mothers in the future.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder \\[ 18 \\] caused by mutations in the _CYP21A2_ gene \\[ 19 \\], and is considered one of the most common causes of genital ambiguity \\[ 28 \\]. CAH clinical manifestations have been classified into two forms: classical CAH, which includes two types, severe salt wasting (SW) and non-SW or simple virilizing (SV), and a nonclassical (NC) form, in which postnatal androgen excess occurs during late puberty or early adulthood \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【10】Female patients having a 46, XX karyotype with classical CAH are born with variable degrees of external genital ambiguity due to excess androgen during _in utero_ development \\[ 3 \\]. In addition to ambiguous female genitalia, affected patients with SW may exhibit life-threatening salt-losing crises during the neonatal period. Accelerated growth and skeletal maturation, hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, and infertility are faced later in life if patients were not treated or are affected by NC \\[ 25 \\]. Appropriate treatment, regular follow-ups, and patient compliance are crucial factors for successful pregnancies. However, psychosocial factors or sexual orientation and the will to bear children influence the fertility rate \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【11】In Syria, in cases of virilized external genitalia, parents used to consider these females newborns as males, especially in cases of severe virilization, until proven otherwise.\n\n【12】Almost all females with SW-CAH and more than 50% of those with SV-CAH had undergone at least one genital surgery on the clitoris and/or the vagina early in their childhood \\[ 23 \\]. Early surgical treatment, rather than delayed or staged approaches for 46, XX CAH patients with specific degrees of genital virilization, has been included in guidelines for the Development of Comprehensive Care Centers for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【13】The role of the parents in sex assignment becomes crucial in all aspects of the decision-making process and all possible therapeutic options for the intersex child, particularly early versus delayed surgery \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【14】Here we report the cases of five CAH females, two of them have been raised as males, two had reconstructive surgery, and one had hormonal therapy.\n\n【15】Materials and methods\n---------------------\n\n【16】### Patients\n\n【17】The patients were being treated in the Children University Hospital, Al-Assad University Hospital, or in private endocrinology clinics between 2017 and 2020 in Damascus. Informed consent forms were signed by the patient or her guardian. This study was approved by the Damascus University research ethics committee (HRECPHARMDU Resolution No. 2). To establish the clinical diagnosis of 21-OHD, we collected the data from the medical records of each patient, including measurements of serum electrolytes, 17-hydroxy progesterone (17-OHP), glucose, bone age determination, and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography. Cytogenetic evaluation was performed for sex determination.\n\n【18】### Sample preparation\n\n【19】Peripheral blood samples were drawn from patients on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and frozen at −20 °C. We preformed DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and measured DNA concentration using NanoVue (Biochom, UK). The extracted DNA sample was kept at  4 °C and thereafter used for mutation analysis as reported by \\[ 26 \\]. Samples used for karyotype testes were heparinized peripheral blood and the Giemsa staining protocol was applied \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【20】### Case 1\n\n【21】In 2011, a first baby (46, XX) (Fig. 1 ) was born from a marriage between cousins. The baby had male-appearing external genitalia and untraceable testes. The abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of a uterus and ovaries. Blood analysis shown high level of 17-OHP and normal levels of Na and K (Table 1 ). This baby girl had SV-CAH, due to the hetero compound mutations V281L and Q318X \\[ 11 \\]. She was treated with hydrocortisone (20 mg/day).\n\n【22】**Fig. 1**\n\n【23】Karyotype results in case 1\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Table 1 Patients results at diagnosis**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Because the baby’s aunts had been previously diagnosed with classical CAH with ambiguous genitalia, her parents made the decision of eradicating the uterus and ovaries, and preserving the masculine appearance in the absence of gonads, regardless of the endocrinologists’ advice. This female was raised as a male but he is infertile, and the outcome of genital surgery was negative due to gender reassignment as a boy. She had not got menarche.\n\n【28】However, this infant has a sister who was born with SV-CAH and ambiguous genitalia, but who underwent reconstructive surgeries and was treated as a girl.\n\n【29】### Case 2\n\n【30】The first child of 5 years old was born to an unrelated couple in 1998. Despite the presence of ambiguous genitalia (Tunner V), the abdominal echography revealed adrenal hypertrophy and a vagina. High levels of 17-OH and potassium were detected, in addition to low levels of sodium (Table 1 ). This baby girl (46, XX) (Fig. 2 ), had SW-CAH due to the inheritance of the homozygote mutation Q318X \\[ 11 \\]. She was treated by hydrocortisone (30 mg/day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day). Only one reconstructive surgery was performed on her at the age of two, but the parents chose to treat her as a boy. Puberty had begun at age of 9 years, but it was disabled to increase the stature using hormonal therapy. Facial and pubic hirsutism appeared: she had a male look with beard and mustache, and she went to serve in the military. This case treatment had a negative outcome, and she had not got menarche due to hormonal therapy.\n\n【31】**Fig. 2**\n\n【32】Karyotype results in case 2\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】She had a sister with SW-CAH, who underwent reconstructive surgeries and was treated as a girl.\n\n【35】### Case 3\n\n【36】A baby was born in 2017 to a couple of cousins, she was their third child. At birth, ambiguous genitalia were present (Fig. 3 ), karyotyping revealed 46, XX (Fig. 4 ), and echography detected a uterus and ovaries. She had SW-CAH due to the inheritance of two heterozygote mutations I2G and V281L, in addition to the homozygote mutation I172N \\[ 11 \\]. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were detected (Table 1 ). Hydrocortisone (20 mg/day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day) were used as treatment, and the baby girl underwent several reconstructive surgeries to correct her external genitalia. This is a positive outcome as natal gender was preserved.\n\n【37】**Fig. 3**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】Ambiguous genitalia in case 3\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】**Fig. 4**\n\n【42】 \n\n【43】Karyotype results in case 3\n\n【44】Full size image\n\n【45】### Case 4\n\n【46】A female was born in 2002 to a couple of cousins. Ambiguous genitalia were present at birth. Karyotyping revealed 46, XX (Fig. 5 ), echography detected a uterus and ovaries, and 17-OHP was elevated (Table 1 ). She had SW-CAH, but mutations were not explored. She was treated with hydrocortisone (10 mg/day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg/day), and underwent reconstructive surgery at the age of 18 months. At the age of 15 years, she reached puberty, and she was followed-up well by the endocrinologist. She got married in 2020 and had a baby. A positive outcome.\n\n【47】**Fig. 5**\n\n【48】Karyotype results in case 4\n\n【49】Full size image\n\n【50】### Case 5\n\n【51】A female was born in 1990 to a couple of cousins. She was their first child out of four children (three females and one male).\n\n【52】At the age of 4 years, she was diagnosed with SV-CAH owing to the appearance of hirsutism in the genital areas, slight enlargement in the clitoris, and the detection of high levels of 17-OHP (Table 1 ). She got menarche at 14 years old, but a menstrual disorder appeared later. She had compound heterozygous of I2G and R356W mutations \\[ 10 \\]. She underwent treatment with hydrocortisone (20 mg/day) and was followed-up by an endocrinologist for the treatment of her menstrual disorder. She got married in 2014 and had twin daughters.\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】One of the genetic diseases prevalent in Syria is CAH caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 21-OH. The most important factor affecting its heredity is consanguineous marriage \\[ 11 \\]. A relatively high consanguinity rate of 30–39% is reported among the Syrian population \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【55】The percentage of consanguineous marriage in CAH studies conducted in Iraq was 82% \\[ 2 \\], 63% in Jordan \\[ 7 \\], 40% in Lebanon \\[ 9 \\], 65.5% in Egypt \\[ 13 \\], 28.8% in Turkey \\[ 5 \\], and 57.1% in Iran \\[ 14 \\]. It is important to avoid this regional social habit that helps spread the disease.\n\n【56】The differences in health care provision and treatment regimens affect the quality of life for patients with CAH. Challenges allegedly vary according to sex, but all patients are subject to the emotional stress of living with a chronic disease, and many have weight and height disturbances and are at risk of infertility \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【57】CAH Patients should be followed-up by a multidisciplinary team including a gynecologist, endocrinologist, pediatrician, and a psychologist \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【58】Female patients (46, XX) with CAH are born with variable degrees of external genital ambiguity due to excess androgen during _in utero_ development. Their internal reproductive anatomy includes a normal uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries with a potential for fertility. The ambiguous genitalia, and the often-related uncertainty regarding the gender assignment, can represent psychosocial trauma for the family, and carries a risk of social stigma for the patient \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【59】The study we conducted to identify the eight most common mutations in patients with classical CAH showed that the rate of female genital ambiguity is high in classical CAH (27/38 CAH female) \\[ 11 \\]. Upon reviewing the medical archives of a group of affected females with CAH, we noticed the role of the parents in making the decision to determine the gender of the newborn, and therefore the type of surgical procedure that is appropriate for the chosen gender. In the majority of cases, the chosen gender is compatible with the 46, XX karyotype.\n\n【60】In cases 1 and 2 in the present study, the masculine gender was selected by parents according to regional and cultural traditions of having a male that can be relied upon, despite the genetic and endocrinologist counseling. A similar unethical practice was also found in India \\[ 21 \\], Pakistan \\[ 16 \\], Algeria \\[ 20 \\], and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \\[ 1 \\]. The child has the right to develop according to their natal sex.\n\n【61】Reconstructive surgery, as in cases 3 and 4, could offer psychological relief, by resolving the sexual ambiguity of the genitalia, and may facilitate sexual intercourse, although it may enhance the feeling of being different \\[ 23 \\]. Psychological support provides the CAH female patient and those around her with the best solution to adapt to this health condition, which she inherited from her parents. Having the female reproductive system that is proportional to the genetic pattern favors the idea of dealing with the newborn as a girl, and removes the first and main problem in the parents’ behavior, and encourages them to support her morally.\n\n【62】When the endocrine aspects of fertility are normalized, a normal pregnancy rate could result, as in cases 4 and 5. Suppression of testosterone hyper secretion, which induces anovulation, is relatively simple to achieve. The consequence of genital surgery is a key factor for the fertility outcome as vaginal function and sexual activity are closely related \\[ 27 \\]. Recently, it was found that the fertility rate increases by 90% in women with classical CAH when they follow the stages of integrated treatment for CAH \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【63】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【64】The integrated treatment of females with classical CAH, which includes psychological support in addition to the use of appropriate hormones, appropriate surgical procedures to correct the external genitalia of an ambiguous appearance into a female appearance in the presence of a female karyotype, and the corresponding reproductive system, gives these females the opportunity to live as they are and perhaps as mothers in the future. Patients with CAH should be followed by a team including a gynecologist, endocrinologist, pediatrician, and a psychologist.\n\n【65】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【66】All the information about patients is in their medical records with the clinicians participating in this article.\n\n【67】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【68】CAH:\n\n【69】Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n【70】C:\n\n【71】Classical\n\n【72】NC:\n\n【73】Non-classical\n\n【74】SW:\n\n【75】Salt wasting\n\n【76】SV:\n\n【77】Simple virilizing\n\n【78】17-OHP:\n\n【79】17-hydroxy progesterone", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Molecular studies have been the gold standard modality for patient assessment since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In spite of that, there are cytogenetic abnormalities that can render the disease unresponsive to conventional therapy, thus making cytogenetics an important component of patient management guidelines.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a case of a Tajik, Afghan patient with chronic myeloid leukemia with del(6)(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome who, despite having typical clinical and hematological disease with initial response to therapy, progressed to blast crisis very early and thus required special interventions.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Cytogenetic monitoring is an important pillar in the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia that cannot be ignored. It should therefore be a part of patient management not only during diagnosis but also during management. We present an unusual cytogenetic abnormality in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia that resulted in early disease progression.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】BCR-ABL1, the oncogenic driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), results from a balanced translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene ( _ABL_ ) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region ( _BCR_ ) gene on chromosome 22q11.2 \\[ 1 \\]. This fusion gene is the main molecular target in the management of CML, and, since its first introduction in early 2000s, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has been very effective in improving outcome and prognosis in affected patients \\[ 2 \\]. The first agent with TKI activity that acquired license for treatment of patients with CML was imatinib \\[ 3 \\]. Then the new-generation drugs were added, including nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】The current therapeutic protocols are all based on cytogenetic and molecular genetic predictors of disease \\[ 1 , 5 \\]. For instance, the first tool to identify patient response with a great level of confidence was quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BCR-ABL1, aiming to assess patients for major molecular response, which was the deepest scrutiny into a disease process for its time \\[ 6 \\]. Since then, scrutiny of the disease process has grown deeper and deeper, with more agile and accurate methods of identifying abnormal clones with ratio of 1:10,000 versus normal clones, called the deep molecular response (DMR) \\[ 7 \\]. Now, patients who have achieved DMR and are able to maintain it for a specific time period are even entitled to be allowed complete discontinuation of TKI therapy \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【11】In spite of all the above-mentioned molecular progress in diagnosis and monitoring of CML, the role of cytogenetics is still undeniably very significant because molecular modalities, though very useful, might still be unable to identify extra Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) abnormalities, including the major route cytogenetic abnormalities that can affect management as well as prognosis \\[ 9 \\]. We present a case of a patient with CML who was diagnosed in chronic phase (CP) and subsequently started on TKI therapy with initial hematological response; however, within 5 months, the patient experienced a blast crisis due to acquisition of extra Ph abnormalities.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our patient was a 42-year-old Tajik, Afghan man with no known medical illness who presented to our institution with lethargy, anorexia, pallor, and progressive abdominal distension that had developed over a duration of 4 months. On examination, the patient was pale, not in distress, and had no lymphadenopathy. His abdominal examination revealed gross splenomegaly crossing the midline with the liver just two finger breadths in the subcostal region. His complete blood count revealed moderate anemia, thrombocytosis, and hyperleukocytosis (450,000 white blood cells per microliter), showing predominance of granulocytes with a bimodal peak of mature neutrophils (68%) and myelocytes (33%). The patient’s blast count was 4% with normal basophil count. The clinical impression at that time was CML in CP based on the initial clinical and hematological evaluation. The patient was counseled to proceed with cytogenetic analysis for confirmation and prognostication of disease, but, due to financial constraints, he opted to start on TKI therapy. Accordingly, the patient was started on conventional imatinib therapy 400 mg/day. Initially, he responded well with resolution of hyperleukocytosis and improvement in hemoglobin and platelet count toward normal, but he did not achieve complete hematological remission. A repeated complete blood count analysis revealed moderate anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and the presence of >90% blast cells in a total white cell count of 62,000/μl. After detailed counseling, the patient agreed to proceed with cytogenetic analysis, in which the analyzed metaphases of all 20 cells revealed 45,XY, presence of Ph chromosome (9q34;22q11.2), and additional complex chromosomal abnormalities, including deletion of chromosomes 6q23.3 to q27, monosomy 11, monosomy 12, insertion 12p13.3, and a marker chromosome, as shown in Fig. 1 . Ultimately, the patient and his family were advised to proceed with allogeneic bone marrow transplant, considering the patient’s complex karyotype and nonresponsiveness to TKI therapy.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Karyogram of one of the two cells assessed, showing 45,XY with del(6)(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome labeled as (mar)\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】CML, once an indolent but indefinitely progressive disease of the hematopoietic system, has now become a success story in the field of hemato-oncology \\[ 10 \\]. Almost all patients now achieve complete remission in a matter of months, and this success is attributable to the discovery of TKI agents and progress in the field of molecular genetics \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【19】The field of molecular genetics has enabled physicians not only to identify the disease burden but also to tailor management in accordance with measurable residual disease \\[ 1 , 13 \\]. All the guidelines since the advent of quantitative real-time PCR for BCR-ABL1, just two decades ago, include close patient monitoring with consideration of molecular targets \\[ 9 , 14 \\]. Quantitation of disease burden with consideration of established guidelines not only has enabled identification of patients for whom TKI therapy needs to be switched from one agent to a more potent one during therapy but also has made it possible to identify patients for whom a higher class of TKI must be considered right from the start \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【20】Targeting deep molecular response has enabled identification of individuals who can successfully achieve complete molecular remission with successful discontinuation of therapy \\[ 8 \\]. Novel, highly sensitive quantitative PCR analysis methods are now implemented to monitor patients who discontinue TKI therapy after successful achievement of molecular targets \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【21】Mutational studies have now become a commonplace practice in the management of patients with CML \\[ 10 \\]. The presence of mutation(s) of bad prognostic value implies that the patient needs commencement with expensive but more specific tyrosine kinase domain targeting agents, such as dasatinib and ponatinib \\[ 12 , 17 \\]. In such cases, it has been demonstrated that ponatinib, the newest agent in the market, is the agent that is effective in almost all the mutant forms of BCR-ABL1 demonstrated so far \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【22】Despite all the mentioned progression in molecular studies, cytogenetics plays a very important role and thus has always been incorporated in CML management guidelines \\[ 19 \\]. Chromosomal abnormalities that are acquired during either the pathogenesis or the treatment of CML have a deep impact on disease progression, prognosis, and thus shift the paradigm of management. Although even patients with the mutations of worst prognostic significance can benefit from third-generation TKI therapy, such as ponatinib, patients who harbor cytogenetic markers of prognostic significance have to be considered for alternative therapeutic modalities, especially allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplant \\[ 20 \\]. This is because it has been demonstrated that such clones that acquire additional cytogenetic abnormalities are resistant to conventional TKI inhibitor therapy \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【23】Our patient, despite having the characteristic clinical and hematological profile of CML, progressed to blast crisis early during therapy for harboring complex chromosomal abnormalities that were in addition to the pathognomonic Ph. Thus, the role played by cytogenetic analysis in the management of patients with CML along with the modern molecular modalities is absolutely not replaceable. Therefore, when feasible, cytogenetic studies must be included in the analysis of patients for whom molecular tests are being done.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【25】We present a case of a patient with CML who had an unusual “complex” cytogenetic abnormality in addition to Ph that resulted in early blast crisis. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with CML harboring del(6)(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome in addition to Ph.\n\n【26】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【27】All the generated data are included in this article.\n\n【28】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【29】ABL1:\n\n【30】Abelson gene 1\n\n【31】BCR:\n\n【32】Break point cluster region\n\n【33】CML:\n\n【34】Chronic myeloid leukemia\n\n【35】CP:\n\n【36】Chronic phase\n\n【37】PCR:\n\n【38】Polymerase chain reaction\n\n【39】Ph:\n\n【40】Philadelphia chromosome\n\n【41】TKI:\n\n【42】Tyrosine kinase inhibitor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

We report a case limited to calf muscles, fascia, and skin treated with local corticosteroid therapy directed to the affected areas by ultrasound guidance.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 36-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 10-month history of progressive right calf pain and swelling, which were unresponsive to treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy. An examination revealed a swollen tender right calf with indurated overlying skin. Laboratory investigations showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 24 mm/hour and a C-reactive protein of 15 mg/dl. Full blood count, renal profile, and creatinine kinase level were normal. A full autoantibody screen and hepatitis B and C serology results were negative. A chest X-ray was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right leg revealed increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images and this was suggestive of extensive inflammatory changes of the gastrocnemius muscle and, to a lesser extent, the soleus muscle. There were marked inflammatory changes throughout the gastrocnemius muscle and the subcutaneous tissue circumferentially around the right lower leg. A biopsy of affected skin, muscle, and fascia showed histopathological features consistent with polyarteritis nodosa, including small-vessel vasculitis with fibrinoid changes in the vessel wall and intense perivascular and focal mural chronic inflammatory changes. Our patient declined treatment with oral steroids. She received a course of ultrasound-guided injections of steroid (Depo-Medrone, methylprednisolone) in the involved muscle area and commenced maintenance azathioprine with a good response.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Limited polyarteritis nodosa is rare and affects middle-aged individuals. In most cases, treatment with moderate- to high-dose corticosteroids gives symptomatic relief within one week. Resistant cases require treatment with cytotoxics or intravenous immunoglobulins. This case demonstrates response to local targeted steroid therapy as an alternative to systemic steroids.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Classic polyarteritis nodosa is a multi-system, necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries in which involvement of the renal and visceral arteries is characteristic \\[ 1 \\]. Limited forms of polyarteritis nodosa have been described, and the skin is the most common organ to be involved \\[ 2 \\]. Cases of polyarteritis nodosa limited to gall bladder \\[ 3 \\], pancreas \\[ 3 \\], female \\[ 4 \\] and male \\[ 5 \\] genital tracts, kidneys \\[ 6 \\], and gastrointestinal tract \\[ 7 \\] have also been reported. Interest in these forms is based on their prognosis, which, in general, is more benign, and their quick response to corticosteroids alone \\[ 2 \\]. Polyarteritis nodosa limited to calf muscles is very rare and only 14 case reports have been published. It commonly affects middle-aged individuals (average age of 40 years), and there is no significant sex variation \\[ 1 \\]. Laboratory markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) were elevated in all previous reports. Creatinine kinase is usually within normal limits. Only two reported cases had positive autoantibodies: a positive perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in one \\[ 8 \\] and a positive anti-phospholipid antibody in the other \\[ 9 \\]. Unlike classic polyarteritis nodosa, which usually requires a combination of steroids and a cytotoxic drug such as cyclophosphamide for treatment \\[ 1 \\], limited polyarteritis nodosa usually responds well to treatment with corticosteroids alone with symptomatic relief within one week in most cases \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The dose of steroids used varied between 15 and 60 mg of prednisolone for initial treatment and 5 and 30 mg for maintenance. Two cases were reported to be resistant to corticosteroids but both of them responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and symptomatic response was rapid; however, one of the cases relapsed after six months and needed an increase in the oral steroid dose and the addition of methotrexate \\[ 10 \\]. Polyarteritis nodosa limited to calf muscles, fascia, and skin is a rare disease that runs a benign course and usually responds well to corticosteroid treatment. Resistant cases can be treated with cytotoxics such as azathioprine and methotrexate. The use of intravenous immunoglobulins is reported to induce a rapid symptomatic recovery in resistant cases, which may require cytotoxics for maintenance. The risk of progression to systemic disease is low, but close long-term follow-up of these patients may be advisable \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 36-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 10-month history of progressive right calf pain and swelling that severely limited walking and standing. Her condition had been diagnosed as Achilles tendinitis but had not responded to treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy. On examination, her right calf was swollen and tender with induration and thickening of overlying skin (Figure 1 ). In laboratory investigations, there was an elevated acute-phase response (erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 24 mm/hour and C-reactive protein of 15 mg/dl). Full blood count and levels of creatinine kinase, urea, and electrolytes were normal. Levels of anti-nuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigens, and anti-cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. The results of hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. A chest X-ray was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right leg revealed increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images and this was suggestive of extensive inflammatory changes of the gastrocnemius muscle and, to a lesser extent, the soleus muscle. Inflammatory changes of the subcutaneous tissues in the right lower leg were also found (Figure 2 ). Our patient underwent a biopsy of the involved skin, fascia, and muscles. Histopathology revealed mixed perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrate predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional eosinophils involving the deep fascial tissue, whereas the skin and subcutaneous fat were relatively unremarkable. Cutaneous changes could be secondary to tissue remodeling and edema due to the subjacent inflammatory process. In one fragment of muscle, there was small-vessel vasculitis with fibrinoid changes in the vessel wall and intense perivascular and focal mural chronic inflammatory changes. No granuloma was seen (Figure 3 ). Histopathological features were consistent with polyarteritis nodosa. Our patient declined treatment with oral steroids. She received four courses of ultrasound-guided injections of steroid (80 mg of Depo-Medrone, methylprednisolone) in the involved muscle and subcutaneous tissues at two weekly intervals. Azathioprine 50 mg once daily was added. After three months, our patient responded to treatment and no longer required analgesia when walking. A softening of the localized rash was also observed. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging at five months revealed almost complete resolution of edema. Our patient showed no signs of recurrence or progression to systemic polyarteritis nodosa more than one year after finishing treatment.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Right calf with swelling and induration of skin at presentation** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Magnetic resonance imaging images of both legs** .

Recently, we have seen an increase in cases of collapsing glomerulonephritis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, also known as coronavirus disease 2019-associated nephropathy. It has been noted to be seen with a higher incidence in African American patients who are carriers of the _APOL1_ variant allele.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 47-year-old African American male with a past medical history of asthma presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and worsening confusion. On admission, he was found to be hemodynamically stable, but labs were significant for elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, signifying acute kidney injury. He was admitted and taken for emergent dialysis. During his hospitalization, he was found to be positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Renal biopsy was done, which showed collapsing glomerulopathy, and the patient continues to require outpatient dialysis after discharge.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Collapsing glomerulonephritis has emerged as a complication in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This condition should be particularly suspected in African American patients who present with acute kidney injury, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and who are positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Current treatment options are limited to supportive treatment and renal replacement therapy. More clinical cases and trials are needed to better understand and improve therapeutic outcomes in these patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now recognized as a common complication of the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), affecting up to 46% \\[ 1 \\] of patients with acute tubular injury as the most common injury. In recent years we have seen an increase in cases of collapsing glomerulonephritis, also known as COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), with a higher incidence in the African American population, specifically those carrying the _APOL1_ allele \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. It is theorized that COVID-19 triggers an inflammatory cascade that may affect the _APOL1_ variant gene, causing glomerular impairment. The disease may range from mild progressive kidney disease to acute renal failure. Currently, the mainstay of treatment involves supportive measures and renal replacement therapy. The authors present a case in which COVAN occurred in an African American male who continues to require long-term renal replacement therapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 47-year-old African American male with a past medical history of asthma presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and worsening confusion. The patient was afebrile. In the emergency department, vitals showed an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. On physical examination, the patient appeared ill and drowsy. While able to answer questions, he required repeated arousing as he was somnolent. Lungs were clear on auscultation, and no murmur was appreciated. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. He denied any history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug abuse. There was no family history of confusion, dementia, or kidney disease. However, he reported exposure to COVID-19 in the past week.\n\n【12】While hemodynamically stable on admission, labs were remarkable for acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine of 31 mg/dL (normal 0.7–1.3 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 210 mg/dL (normal 6–24 mg/dL), potassium level of 7.6 mmol/L (normal 3.6–5.2 mmol/L), and a calcium level of 21.5 mg/dL (normal 8.6–10.3 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed significant proteinuria with levels equal to or greater than 500 mg/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 21–50/hpf, and red blood cells of 6–10/hpf. Urine studies were done, which showed a urine protein level of 8700 mg/dL. Urine protein electrophoresis was interpreted as a glomerular pattern with no monoclonal bands seen, often seen in nephrotic and nephritic syndromes. A serology panel was sent, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis panel were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with peaked T waves.\n\n【13】Further workup showed patient positive for COVID-19 by antigen test. As a result of the patient’s labs and condition, he was admitted and taken for emergent dialysis. A renal biopsy was performed, and light microscopy showed collapse of basement membranes in some glomeruli, along with severe tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and dilated tubules filled with hyaline and protein casts. Direct immunofluorescence did not show evidence of immune complex disease. Electron microscopy showed widespread effacement of foot processes, which correlated with proteinuria. These findings correlated with collapsing glomerulopathy (Figs. 1 , 2 ). Computed tomography (CT) of the head and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were done, which did not show any acute findings. After dialysis, his encephalopathy showed significant improvement. He was more awake, more alert, and able to have extended conversations. Unfortunately, his kidney function did not improve, and he continues to require outpatient hemodialysis after discharge. Understandably, this has frustrated him, however, he has been compliant with follow-ups and dialysis appointments.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Allochrome: glomerulus with collapsing features; including collapse of basement membranes with segmental accentuation and overlying hyaline droplet filled epithelial cells. Active cellular crescents, however, are not seen. Mesangial matrix is mildly expanded. In addition, dilate tubules filled with hyaline and protein casts, loss of brush borders, and intraluminal cellular and granular debris are also seen\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Electron microscopy: one non-obsolescent glomerulus was subjected to ultrastructural examination, with good tissue preservation. Podocytes display widespread effacement of foot processes, which correlates to proteinuria. Glomerular basement membranes are uniformly contoured except for a few segments with mild corrugation (mean glomerular basement membranes thickness, 303 ± 48 nm). Electron dense deposits were not seen\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】While cases of COVID-19 initially presented with severe respiratory distress syndrome, after vaccinations and the introduction of variants, the number of patients that are developing severe pulmonary disease has decreased, however, we have seen other complications such as renal impairment \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【24】Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a major cause of end-stage renal disease. It can present with several variants, including collapsing, tip, cellular, perihilar, and not otherwise specified \\[ 4 \\]. The collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is described as segmental and global collapse of the glomerular capillaries, marked hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of the podocytes. It is a severe form with high risk of progression to irreversible kidney failure \\[ 5 \\]. It was first described in patients with HIV infection \\[ 4 \\], known as HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). However, since the use and introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of HIVAN has decreased significantly. Collapsing glomerulopathy has also been associated with other viral infections, drugs, and ischemia \\[ 2 , 5 \\]. While other viral infections such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus have been associated with collapsing glomerulopathy, in recent years we have noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19-associated glomerulopathy, also known as COVAN. This pathology has been reported by several authors, and interestingly, all the affected patients are of African American descent with the _APOL1_ high-risk genotype \\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【25】Currently, the pathology is not well understood. As high-risk patients with the _APOL1_ genotype appear to be more affected, some authors believe COVAN parallels the development of HIVAN in patients with HIV. In HIVAN, it is believed that HIV causes a “second-hit” in patients with the _APOL1_ genotype \\[ 2 \\]. The infection, or inciting event, triggers an inflammatory response that activates the interferon–chemokine pathway. This in turn affects the _APOL1_ variant gene, causing glomerular impairment. It is believed that COVID-19 triggers a similar inflammatory response and this is why patients with the _APOL1_ genotype are more prone to developing COVAN. The theory is supported by immunostaining of COVAN biopsies increasing the expression of phosphor-STAT3, which is activated by interleukin-6 \\[ 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【26】Another mechanism of injury that has been proposed is direct viral deposition in the glomerular membrane. This theory is controversial, given that viral particles are not present in some of the COVAN kidney biopsies \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【27】Clinically, the patient presented with renal dysfunction and nephrotic range proteinuria with minimal respiratory symptoms. In several COVAN case reports, the outcome involves renal replacement therapy. The treatment for COVID-19 has been mainly directed toward acute respiratory failure, with medications such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, baricitnib, and toclizumab often indicated on the basis of oxygenation levels \\[ 16 \\]. When patients present with COVAN but without hypoxemia, treatment is mainly supportive. Our case report and others raise the question of whether initiating these therapies in patients with COVAN will change the course of kidney failure and possibly prevent the need for long-term renal replacement therapies.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】COVAN has emerged as a complication in patients with COVID-19. This condition should be particularly suspected in patients of African American descent who present with COVID-19, acute kidney injury, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. _APOL1_ variant carriers are at a higher risk of developing COVAN. More clinical trials are needed, especially in carriers of _APOL1_ , to better understand the pathophysiology behind this disease and improve therapeutic options for these patients.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】The datasets during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis is challenging for clinicians. Despite its indolence, diagnosis is often confirmed after orchidectomy. Surgery is mandatory, particularly to rule out the extremely rare association with malignancy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of splenogonadal fusion in a 38-year-old North African man presenting a palpable scrotal mass. We describe clinical aspects, pathogenic hypothesis, radiological features, as well as surgical management principles.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Splenogonadal fusion is rarely suspected and diagnosed preoperatively. A diagnosis is made once an ectopic testicular mass is associated with cryptorchidism and suggestive radiological signs. A better knowledge of the clinical and radiological features of splenogonadal fusion provides an opportunity for conservative surgery.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Splenogonadal fusion is a rare congenital defect, defined by the presence of ectopic splenic tissue in the scrotum. It is usually discovered in adolescents with a scrotal swelling. As imaging findings are not distinctive, histological diagnosis is often made after radical orchidectomy. We report a new case of splenogonadal fusion in an adult patient presenting a palpable scrotal mass. Pathogenic and clinical features, imaging findings, and surgical management will be described and discussed.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 38-year-old North African man, with no past medical history, consulted our out-patient clinic for a painless left scrotal mass. There was no history of previous orchitis or scrotal contusion. He noted the mass a month ago. A physical examination found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of his left testis. There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges. There was no bacterial growth in urine analysis, including _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ screening. A scrotal ultrasound showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma, with a conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of his testis. The mass was isoechoic to the testis parenchyma, and poorly vascularized Doppler (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Scrotal ultrasound: poorly vascularized mass appended to the upper pole of the left testis\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】He underwent a radical inguinal orchiectomy. We first performed a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The operative specimen included the testis and the tunica vaginalis in one piece (Fig. 2 ). The macroscopic aspect of the supratesticular mass looks similar to splenic tissue (Fig. 3 ). There were no macroscopic lesions of the testis and the spermatic cord. His postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the second postoperative day.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Operative specimen: left inguinal orchiectomy\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】The macroscopic aspect of the suspect mass looks similar to splenic tissue\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Histological examination of the operative specimen confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the suspect mass, without any signs of malignancy. The splenic proliferation had its proper and regular capsule, demarcating it from the testis. Testicular pulp, the albuginea and the tunica vaginalis had a preserved microscopic architecture (Fig. 4 ). He was examined 3 weeks after orchiectomy and he was examined again 2 months after the orchiectomy in our out-patient unit. An abdominal ultrasound showed an habitual location with standard measurements and a regular aspect of his spleen.\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Histology of the operative specimen: regular splenic proliferation, independent from the testis and its adnexa. Splenic tissue is on the _right_ , limited with a regular capsule. Testicular parenchyma is on the right, with an intact albuginea\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Splenogonadal fusion is a rare congenital anomaly, first described in 1883 by Boestrom \\[ 1 \\]. Since then, around a 150 cases have been reported. It is mainly observed in adolescents and young adults. Association with other congenital malformations is possible, mainly cryptorchidism, limb defects, and micrognathia \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【32】It occurs generally on the left side. Splenogonadal fusion is not exclusively observed in male patients. A few cases were reported in female patients. It is underdiagnosed in female patients, as ovaries are less accessible to physical examination \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【33】Two types, with an equal frequency, were described by Putschar and Manion \\[ 4 \\]: the continuous and the discontinuous form. In the continuous type, a cord of splenic or fibrotic tissue links the spleen to the ectopic gonad. In the discontinuous type, there is no connection to the spleen. An ectopic splenic tissue is annexed to the gonad, inside the tunica vaginalis, with a distinct capsule \\[ 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【34】The clinical presentation is not specific and diagnosis is often made on histological examination of the operative specimen. The discontinuous form usually presents as a hard scrotal nodule, mimicking a testicular tumor. In some cases, scrotal swelling is associated with specific splenic conditions, such as infectious mononucleosis or salmonellosis \\[ 7 \\]. A bowel obstruction may reveal the discontinuous form. Operative findings in groin exploration or abdominal laparoscopy for cryptorchidism may also aid diagnosis \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【35】Scrotal ultrasonography is not accurate enough preoperatively; as sonographic aspects are various, sensitivity and specificity are not high \\[ 9 \\]. Magnetic resonance imaging is associated with the same shortcomings. In the continuous form, the linking cord between the spleen and the ectopic testis may be visualized \\[ 10 \\]. Splenic scintigraphy using technetium-99m ( <sup>99m </sup> Tc) is a valuable option once splenogonadal fusion is suspected. Radioactive tracer fixation in the spleen and the suspect mass is similar, confirming the ectopic splenic origin of the testicular appended mass \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【36】Even if splenogonadal fusion is almost always a benign condition, surgery is still mandatory. In fact, histological examination of the operative specimen ensures formal diagnosis and rules out the infrequent association with testicular malignancies \\[ 11 \\]. The association with a testicular neoplasm was described in only four cases \\[ 4 \\]. There is no evident causality between splenogonadal fusion and malignant transformation. The rare observed cases were probably prone to develop a testicular neoplasm as they also presented cryptorchidism \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【37】Even if imaging affords a better prediction and diagnostic orientation, many patients still undergo unnecessary orchiectomies. Once operative aspects are known, a surgeon can opt for conservative treatment, saving the testis \\[ 13 \\]. In the case we report, our patient underwent an avoidable radical orchiectomy. An extemporaneous histological examination could have been useful to adjust the surgical attitude and preserve the testis.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【39】A better knowledge of splenogonadal fusion may increase the preoperatively indicated and diagnosed cases, in order to reassure patients and adjust the therapeutic attitude. Surgery remains essential, as malignancy must be ruled out. More specific imaging features and extemporaneous histological examination enable avoidance of an unnecessary orchiectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion. Studies report recent infections or certain drugs as precipitating factors of a lymphocytic oculorenal immune response. The prognosis is usually favorable with topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a literature review and the case of a 14-year-old white girl, who presented to the ophthalmology department with features of one-sided uveitis. Upon transfer of patient to nephrological care, diagnostic work-up revealed renal involvement. Renal biopsy showed a mixed-cell and granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis with some noncaseating granulomas, leading to a diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome. With topical ocular and systemic corticosteroid therapy, the patients’ condition improved over several weeks.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of this syndrome, where cross-specialty care typically leads to a favorable outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare multisystem autoimmune disorder, presenting mainly with oculorenal pathology. Since its first recognition by Dobrin _et al_ . \\[ 1 \\], more than 300 cases have been reported worldwide \\[ 2 \\]. Here we present the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented to our department with unilateral anterior uveitis and concomitant signs of acute interstitial nephritis. Upon extensive work-up, the diagnosis of TINU syndrome was confirmed.\n\n【10】The case is worth to be presented as it showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate with only mild urine and biochemical abnormalities, but important histological changes on renal biopsy. Also, a review of published case series is provided.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 14-year-old white girl with unilateral anterior uveitis and abnormal urinalysis was referred from the ophthalmological care to our nephrology unit in November 2018. She had been seen at our out-patient clinic at the age of 12 years in 2016. Her family history was positive for elevated blood pressure. She was the first child of an uneventful pregnancy, born at 40 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3990 g and birth length of 53 cm.\n\n【13】Upon visit, she was seen due to elevated blood pressure with occasional tension-type headaches, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperlipidemia, which were a result of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. She reported no first-degree family members with metabolic syndrome or its complications. Ambulatory blood pressure monitor values were within reference ranges (average 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure 117 and 66 mmHg, respectively), so we implemented nonpharmacological lifestyle approaches. During follow-up, she received extensive evaluation, including endocrinological and dietary assessment, and was continued to be seen by our pediatric nephrologist twice per year.\n\n【14】In October 2018, aged 14 years, she presented to the Department of Ophthalmology with 1 week of redness, pain, epiphora, and loss of visual acuity of the right eye. She denied any recent drug exposure, allergy, infection, or symptoms of systemic illness. A diagnosis of acute anterior uveitis was made, followed by topical corticosteroid and cycloplegic treatment, which led to symptom alleviation.\n\n【15】### Investigations\n\n【16】A broad diagnostic work-up was performed. Renal ultrasound was normal. Also, chest radiography was also normal (Fig. 1 ), which in conjunction with a normal serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level and absence of cough excluded sarcoidosis, a known oculorenal offender. However, upon laboratory evaluation, marked elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 98 mm/hour), mild elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 13 mg/L), mild normocytic anemia (Hb, 113 g/L), elevated serum creatinine (80 µmol/L), mild proteinuria (0.38 g/day), microalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 58 mg/g), elevated values of alpha-1 microglobulin (urine alpha-1-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio, 3.24 mg/g), and normoglycemic glycosuria (1+) were observed. Immunological screening revealed elevated C3 complement fraction (C3, 2.01 g/L), with negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies (anti-DNA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) antibodies. These values indicated mild renal involvement and prompted a referral to our nephrology unit.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Chest radiograph in posteroanterior view. The radiological appearance of lung parenchyma was normal, which aided in ruling out sarcoidosis, a possible differential diagnosis\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Upon admission, she had no history of unexplained fevers, weight-loss, or other systemic symptoms. She had a pulse of 100 beats/minute, blood pressure of 126/81 mmHg, and body temperature of 36.5 °C. Her review of systems was negative, with a gradual improvement of symptoms and vision of the right eye. She continued both-sided topical cycloplegic and topical corticosteroid therapy. Borderline blood pressure values with repeated and persistent abnormal values of ESR, serum urea and creatinine, proteinuria, and glucosuria, indicating kidney injury, prompted a kidney biopsy.\n\n【22】Histopathology revealed focal tubulointerstitial nephritis. Interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate was composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, fewer neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells and rare noncaseating granulomata, with foci of invasion of lymphocytes into the tubules (tubulitis). Tubules in the affected areas showed signs of acute tubular injury—flattened, irregular, and vacuolated tubular epithelium. Glomeruli and vessels were unremarkable (Figs. 2 , 3 ). Immunofluorescence was negative. Electron microscopy showed no specific pathological findings. On the day of renal biopsy, 1 month after first symptom presentation, she also developed contralateral, left-sided anterior uveitis. A diagnosis of TINU syndrome was confirmed, based upon histopathological findings.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Renal biopsy sample A.

Next-generation sequencing did not demonstrate any disease-related variants.\n\n【32】### Treatment\n\n【33】The patient was started on methylprednisolone 60 mg daily, which improved the laboratory markers of kidney injury and allowed us to continue an alternate-day corticosteroid therapy regimen. She also received pantoprazole 40 mg daily, trimetoprim–sulfametoxazole 480 mg twice daily every other day for _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia prevention, and vitamin D supplementation 2000 units daily, together with topical ocular therapy (scopolamine, nepafenac, dexamethasone). Because of elevated blood-pressure readings, she began therapy with ramipril 2.5 mg and later 5 mg daily and received regular follow-up.\n\n【34】### Outcome and follow-up\n\n【35】After 3 months, upon evaluation at our out-patient clinic, her ocular symptoms improved, although she started having pain in her lumbar spine. Clinical examination showed a Cushingoid appearance with a 4 kg increase in body weight since discharge. Blood pressure values with antihypertensive therapy were normal. Lumbosacral spine X-ray imaging was normal, without signs of osteopenia (Fig. 4 ). This allowed a slow reduction in corticosteroid therapy upon following weeks and motivated her for implementation of healthy lifestyle measures.\n\n【36】**Fig. 4**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Lumbosacral radiograph—anteroposterior and lateral views. The radiograph of the lumbosacral spine did not show any fractures, which might occur with the patients’ prolonged corticosteroid therapy\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】At the most recent ambulatory office visit, two and a half years after onset of TINU, the patient denied any further ocular exacerbations, but she gained weight and had a body mass index of almost 35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Her 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure values were normal, as well as renal ultrasound examination, without presence of renal scarring. She was receiving ramipril 2.5 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily each, together with education on necessary lifestyle changes.\n\n【41】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【42】Our article presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first Slovene case of TINU syndrome in a 14-year-old girl in published literature. The diagnosis was suspected by the presence of renal and ocular findings, combining acute interstitial nephritis and anterior uveitis, and confirmed by renal biopsy. Current literature suggests that approximately 300 cases have been published \\[ 2 \\]. We present a literature review of 580 described cases. Table 1 presents the case series published in the last 10 years. Countries with published case series are presented in Fig. 5 and in greater detail in Table 2 .\n\n【43】**Table 1 List of published case series with two or more patients, published after the year 2010**\n\n【44】Full size table\n\n【45】**Fig. 5**\n\n【46】 \n\n【47】World map of published case series of TINU syndrome.

Since then, studies have tried to elucidate the underlying mechanism of disease. Limited data suggest that modified C-reactive protein (mCRP), a uveal and renal tubular autoantigen, might play a role in eliciting an IgG-mediated oculorenal immune response \\[ 4 \\]. A novel human glycoprotein, Krebs von den Lungen-6, was also observed to be significantly increased in sera and distal renal tubules of TINU patients \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, certain interleukin-10 polymorphisms have been found to be more prevalent in TIN/TINU patients, broadening our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【53】### Differential diagnosis and epidemiology\n\n【54】TINU syndrome was shown to represent 15–65% of cases of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in pediatric renal care centers \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. It is essential to distinguish it from other causes of AIN, either drug-induced, autoimmune, metabolic, malignant, or consequential to a variety of infectious causes \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【55】A large case series \\[ 3 \\] suggests TINU shows a 3:1 female-to-male predominance, with a median age of 15 years. A UK-based study estimated the incidence as 1 per 10 million population per year \\[ 12 \\]. Several recent reviews confirmed peak incidence in adolescence and a female-to-male predominance \\[ 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\]. Genetic studies indicate a strong association with certain HLA haplotypes, especially variants DQA1, DQB1, DRB1, and DR14 \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\]. No disease-associated HLA variants were confirmed in our patient.\n\n【56】### Clinical presentation\n\n【57】TINU patients typically present with a viral-like illness, after which renal dysfunction is discovered. Alternatively, in about 20% of cases (including this case), the patient presents with symptoms of burning eyes and/or visual blurring \\[ 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\] and is subsequently discovered to have renal manifestations. This asynchrony prompts a high degree of clinical suspicion in treating young, female patients with AIN or acute uveitis. In a Finnish study \\[ 2 \\], which prospectively evaluated the presence of acute uveitis in biopsy-proven AIN at onset, at 3 and at 6 months afterwards, 16/19 (84%) of pediatric patients had uveitis within the observation period, half (8/16) without ocular symptoms. However, there are no guidelines or recommendations regarding ocular screening in patients with AIN.\n\n【58】Acute kidney injury is nearly universal in the setting of TINU and is usually in the mild-to-moderate range. It may be complicated with hypertension, which was also the case in our patient. In literature, cases of Fanconi syndrome and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in association with TINU have been described \\[ 23 , 24 \\], as well as progression to chronic kidney disease in adult and pediatric patients \\[ 25 \\]. Table 3 presents TINU characteristics in comparison with disease manifestations, seen in our patient.\n\n【59】**Table 3 Comparison of clinical characteristics of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis with our patient**\n\n【60】Full size table\n\n【61】### Pathohistological findings\n\n【62】Upon light microscopy, features of a predominantly CD3-positive lymphocytic infiltrate with fewer plasma cells and macrophages are present. A prominent eosinophilic infiltrate may be seen initially, as well as interstitial granulomas that can become confluent. Upon disease progression, the inflammation subdues, while variable amounts of interstitial fibrosis appear. The CD4-to-CD8 ratio varies. However, studies indicate a reciprocal T-cell profile in the kidney as compared with what is seen in peripheral blood, indicating that cellular immunity is active at the tissue level and decreased systemically \\[ 9 \\]. Tubular atrophy or tubulitis is also characteristic for TINU and is in accordance with clinical evidence of tubular dysfunction, reported in our patient and many cases of TINU \\[ 9 , 26 \\].\n\n【63】### Treatment\n\n【64】As in other uncommon disorders, there are no evidence-based treatment protocols, so the decision whether to initiate systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy depends on renal and ocular involvement. If nephritis is mild or in remission, topical steroids may be used to treat uveitis, though not efficient in posterior intraocular segment involvement \\[ 9 \\]. Systemic corticosteroids are generally reserved for cases of progressive renal involvement \\[ 3 \\] and are needed in about 80% of patients \\[ 27 \\]. Oral prednisone or prednisolone with a dosage of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day is usually used. The duration and schedule for tapering of steroid dose depends mainly on patient response \\[ 9 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 27 \\]. Because of frequent relapses and recurrences of disease, some authors suggest at least 12 months of oral corticosteroid therapy \\[ 28 \\], while others advocate an early and short course \\[ 29 \\], which was the case in our patient. We believe that, in the absence of evidence-based treatment protocols, a case-by-case management may be adopted \\[ 27 \\].\n\n【65】In a pediatric case series \\[ 2 \\], all 16 patients with TINU received topical ocular steroids. Mydriatic therapy was necessitated in 9/16 patients and antiglaucoma therapy in 6/16 cases. Surprisingly, oral prednisone did not influence occurrence of uveitis. In steroid-resistant cases or in exacerbation of disease after weaning from corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive medications such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil may be used \\[ 9 , 13 , 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【66】### Prognosis\n\n【67】Ocular and renal outcomes are usually good with appropriate treatment, as most respond to initial topical or systemic therapy. The disease may remit altogether or run a chronic or recurrent course, usually appropriately controlled through judicious use of immunosuppressive agents \\[ 9 , 20 , 30 \\]. Though early TINU literature held that renal disease often resolved spontaneously, repeat renal biopsy studies reported cases of continued nephritis after pulse corticosteroids \\[ 31 , 32 \\], mandating close follow-up of patients for several years after disease onset. Prompt corticosteroid therapy initiation also seems to play a role as demonstrated in a small case series, where a patient with delayed treatment demonstrated persistent elevations of beta-2-microglobulin and renal inflammation with subsequent renal damage \\[ 33 \\]. Additionally, severe TINU can lead to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis and kidney transplant \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【68】Most patients will maintain or improve eyesight from presentation. However, ocular disease recurs in up to 50% of patients after corticosteroid withdrawal \\[ 16 \\]. Younger age was identified as a risk factor for chronic uveitis, though few studies have evaluated the impact of systemic therapy on reducing that risk \\[ 16 \\]. Vision is seldom severely impaired, as demonstrated in a case series of 133 patients \\[ 3 \\], where vision outcome was rarely worse that 20/40. Therefore, optimal care incorporates joint nephrological and ophthalmic input, which was done in our patient.\n\n【69】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【70】This case highlights the need to maintain a high degree of suspicion and close follow-up in young, female patients who present with features of tubulointerstitial nephritis or uveitis. As there are no evidence-based protocols for treating TINU, management relies on case reports and case-series. The recommended treatment for uveitis is topical steroids. However, most cases necessitate systemic therapy with corticosteroids owing to renal involvement or in cases of posterior ocular involvement.\n\n【71】Immunomodulatory drugs may be used in resistant cases. With prompt therapy, prognosis of both renal and ocular involvement is usually favorable, though relapses might occur. Therefore, combined nephrological and ophthalmological care is warranted. Furthermore, there is a need for a multicenter study and registry formation to obtain important clinical data regarding follow-up and treatment of these patients, and a frameshift for implementation of multinational guidelines of treatment and prognosis.\n\n【72】### Learning points\n\n【73】*   •In patients presenting with uveitis and/or acute interstitial nephritis, a suspicion of TINU syndrome should be made, especially if young and/or female.\n    \n*   •Even when histological features of important tubulointerstitial nephritis and noncaseating granulomata can be found, as in our case, the urinalysis can show only mild urine changes with proteinuria and glucosuria, with no hematuria. In our patient with bilateral uveitis and marked elevation of ESR, a renal biopsy proved useful in guiding therapy.\n    \n*   •With prompt ocular and systemic corticosteroid therapy, prognosis of TINU is favorable, despite occasional relapses.\n    \n\n【74】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【75】I have to say that the overall care from both the Nephrology and Ophthalmology department was very professional. At first, I was quite shocked after I developed an inflammation of my eye, which did not allow me to see properly. Also, I was surprised that I had additional problems with my kidneys that I did not even notice. After several weeks of staying in the hospital, my nephrologist told me that I would have to undergo a kidney biopsy, the thought of which was quite scary. However, as I had already known the department staff for years, I trusted them fully and was not too worried after the diagnosis of TINU came. The therapy which was offered to me was quite tolerable, though I did not like gaining even more weight after being put on corticosteroids, which the doctors told me could happen. Coming home after more than a month, I am very happy to again attend school, and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as recommended.\n\n【76】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【77】Not applicable.\n\n【78】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【79】TINU:\n\n【80】Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis\n\n【81】ESR:\n\n【82】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【83】CRP:\n\n【84】C-reactive protein\n\n【85】ANA:\n\n【86】Antinuclear antibodies\n\n【87】anti-ENA:\n\n【88】Anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies\n\n【89】anti-DNA:\n\n【90】Anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies\n\n【91】ANCA:\n\n【92】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\n\n【93】HLA:\n\n【94】Human leukocyte antigen\n\n【95】mCRP:\n\n【96】Modified C-reactive protein\n\n【97】AIN:\n\n【98】Acute interstitial nephritis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}

Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed to confirm the diagnosis. On the other hand, a lipoma is usually a circular lesion, which is sometimes observed in the upper part of the face. The signals of both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images of MRI of a lipoma are, in general, relatively highly homogenous, and the signals decrease in fat-suppressed images. Therefore, differential diagnosis between a dermoid cyst and a lipoma is usually made with MRI, especially based on fat-suppressed images. Here, we present a case of misdiagnosis of a dermoid cyst as a lipoma because of atypical magnetic resonance images.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 24-year-old Japanese woman with a dermoid cyst around the lateral edge of the eyebrow. The cyst had been gradually increasing in size for the past 2 years. On MRI, it showed high internal signals on T1- and T2-weighted images. However, the signal intensity decreased homogeneously in the fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. The observed tumor had a yellowish appearance under the endoscope. On the basis of these findings, the lesion was considered a lipoma until it ruptured intraoperatively. The pathological diagnosis confirmed it to be a dermoid cyst.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Some dermoid cysts contain lipid-rich liquid, and these may be misdiagnosed as lipomas by MRI. When a tumor is located at a common site for a dermoid cyst, the MRI images should be validated carefully if it appears like a lipoma, and the differential diagnosis should be considered carefully.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Dermoid or epidermoid cysts are congenital lesions that manifest as subcutaneous tumors around the lateral sides of the eyebrows \\[ 1 \\]. They lead the list of differential diagnosis for tumors found in this part of the body \\[ 2 \\]. Computed tomography (CT) is often performed to confirm the positional relationship between the tumor and the surrounding facial bone as an imaging diagnosis, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sometimes chosen for a qualitative diagnosis \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. A typical dermoid cyst shows isointense or hyperintense signals on T1-weighted images on MRI, while it typically shows hyperintense signals on T2-weighted images \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【10】A lipoma is a space-occupying lesion. Its T1- and T2-weighted MRI images show high signal intensity. The signal intensity of the T2-weighted images usually decreases on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images uniformly. On the basis of this imaging characteristic, misdiagnosis of a dermoid cyst is considered to be rare.\n\n【11】This is a case report of a patient whose preoperative diagnosis was a lipoma based on the MRI images; however, the pathological findings revealed a dermoid cyst.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Onset and clinical course\n\n【14】A 24-year-old Japanese woman had a tumor located just above her right eyebrow. She had been aware of the lesion since she was 22 years old, and the tumor had been increasing in size without any subjective symptoms. She consulted a doctor at a clinic, as suggested by her family and friends. She had no past history of illness.\n\n【15】The skin above the right eyebrow was slightly distended, and the diameter of the dome was about 2.5 cm. The tumor was palpable beneath the skin. There was no adhesion between the tumor and the skin; the tumor appeared to be attached to a deeper tissue layer such as the bone. The surface of the lesion was smooth, elastic, and soft without fluctuation. The protrusion became remarkable with a strong bite movement. There was no sign of facial palsy (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【16】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Preoperative findings of the case report. **a** Front view of the patient’s face. A dome-shaped lesion can be seen on the lateral side of the right eyebrow. **b** Lateral view of the upper part of the patient’s face. The lesion is located between the lateral end of the eyebrow and the hairline. No facial palsy was observed based on these images\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】### Diagnostic imaging\n\n【21】One month after her initial consultation, she underwent MRI without any other imaging studies. The mass showed a homogenous, relatively high signal intensity compared to that of the muscle on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The actual diameter of the tumor was approximately 2.0 cm and was located between the superficial and deep temporal fascia. The signal intensity decreased homogeneously on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images; therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as a lipoma or an angiolipoma (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【22】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Magnetic resonance imaging before surgery. **a** T1-weighted image of the lesion. The tumor shows homogenous high intensity compared to the brain. A thin capsule is observed around the tumor. **b** T2-weighted image of the lesion. The tumor shows homogenous high intensity compared to the brain. This image also indicates a thin capsule. **c** Fat-suppressed T2-weighted image of the lesion. The internal signal from the tumor is almost completely suppressed compared to the normal T2-weighted image. **d** Another slice of the T1-weighted image of the tumor. The internal signal of the tumor is not homogenous when compared with the slice presented in **a** . This finding is thought to be atypical of a lipoma\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Endoscopic surgery with an incision near the front hairline was thought to be most appropriate to preserve the esthetics; also, the tumor was quite close to the facial bone \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\]. At that point, she was referred to our hospital for surgery, as the operation was considered more feasible under general anesthesia in order to use a nerve stimulator during surgical treatment and to perform a meticulous dissection. The surgery was performed 3 months after her first visit to our hospital.\n\n【27】### Intraoperative findings and clinical course\n\n【28】An incision was created at her front hairline followed by dissection with the assistance of an endoscope (Fig. 3 a, b). Blunt dissection was performed just above the deep temporal fascia to the caudal side with nerve hooks, and the tumor was found in the fat tissue. There was no movement of the frontalis muscle during these procedures, although a nerve stimulator with a 2-mA current was applied to the fibrous tissues that appeared to be nerves.\n\n【29】**Fig. 3.**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Intraoperative findings of this case report. **a** Design and markings. The orbital margin was marked with an interrupted line as a landmark. The incision line was made 1 mm behind the hairline with a lazy-S shape. The temporal branch of the superficial temporal artery, located just above the incision line, was marked with an interrupted line. The predicted lines of the temporal branch, the zygomatic branch, and the buccal branch of the facial nerve were also marked with long, interrupted lines. A small vein just above the tumor was also marked before the incision. **b** Insertion of the endoscope. The endoscope was used to check not only the tumor but also the surrounding tissues, especially fibrous tissues like nerves and blood vessels. The tip of the camera was angled at 30°. **c** Tumor appearance before rupture. The tumor could be observed directly from the incision. The color of the tumor was homogeneously yellow, like a lipoma; however, it was slightly translucent. **d** Endoscopic findings in the cavity after removal of the tumor. A circular cavity was observed endoscopically. The cavity was considered to be surrounded by the bone covered by the periosteum. There was no fibrous tissue (such as nerve fibers) in this view\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】The tumor was dark yellow and capsulated by thin fibrous tissue, making its identification easy in the surrounding fatty tissue (Fig. 3 c). While blunt dissection between the tumor and the surrounding tissue was performed with the endoscope, yellow and clear serous liquid suddenly drained from the tumor. After shrinkage of the tumor, the tumor capsule was separated from the surrounding tissue with sharp dissection. The periosteum of the upper margin of the orbit was considered to be the farthest margin of the lesion (Fig. 3 d). A strip of silicon drain was left on the periosteum through the incised portion to prevent hematoma formation in the dissected space. The wound was closed layer by layer with absorbable and non-absorbable strings. The right frontalis muscle did not move immediately after general anesthesia was discontinued.\n\n【34】### Clinical course after surgery\n\n【35】The clinical course after surgery was uneventful. The function of the right frontalis muscle recovered completely the day after the operation as expected. The pathological diagnosis was a dermoid cyst (Fig. 4 ac, Additional file 1 : Data S1). No adverse symptoms have been observed in the year following the surgery. There was no evidence of recurrence on the follow-up MRI performed 1 year after the surgery (Additional file 2 : Data S2a, Additional file 3 : Data S2b). The operative scar was inconspicuous 1 year after the surgery (Fig. 4 d, Additional file 4 : Data S3).\n\n【36】**Fig. 4.**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Pathological findings and postoperative scar. **a** Appearance of the resected tumor. As the tumor ruptured during surgery and almost all of the content was liquid, the resected lesion shrank; otherwise, it would have been extirpated en bloc. **b** Microscopic findings of the tumor in a low-power field. Two specimens are presented with a hematoxylin–eosin stain (HE stain). The inset with blue lines in the lower specimen is shown in **c** . **c** Microscopic findings of the tumor in a high-power field. The lumen of the tumor is covered with stratified cells with hair follicles (blue arrowhead). Many sebaceous glands are observed just below the stratified cells (red arrowheads). There are some daughter lesions in this specimen (black arrows). The scale bar is 100 μm. **d** Operative scar 1 year after surgery. The scar is inconspicuous as it is located just behind the hairline. The patient was aware and accepted that a scar would be left as a result of the surgery\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【41】This case report has two important “takeaway” lessons. Firstly, a tumor found just above the eyebrow should have a dermoid cyst in the differential diagnosis, as this area is a common site. The second one is that few cases of dermoid cysts show lipoma-like images on MRI. Therefore, details of the images such as the tumor capsule and the internal signals should have been considered \\[ 5 \\]. Tumors just above the eyebrow in the young are suspected to be dermoid or epidermoid cysts in most cases \\[ 1 \\]. However, surgeons usually perform operations in cases where preoperative MRI images show the typical pattern of a lipoma, especially when the internal signals are suppressed uniformly on fat suppressed T2-weighted images. In this case, we considered the tumor to be a lipoma until the yellow fluid drained out because the endoscopic findings revealed a round, yellow tumor.\n\n【42】Histopathological findings revealed many sebaceous glands in the subepithelial layers of the specimens. From these findings, it was inferred that these glands secreted the liquid found in the tumor, which was thought to be lipid rich. In retrospect, the preoperative MRI images of this case revealed that the tumor was surrounded by a thin capsule, and some T1-weighted images showed a heterogeneous internal signal that was not a typical pattern of a lipoma (Fig. 2 a, b, d).\n\n【43】Dermoid cysts are observed in intracranial and intraperitoneal spaces except around the orbit \\[ 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Therefore, surgeons could misinterpret the findings and approach a dermoid cyst, which contains lipid-rich fluid (as seen in the present case), as a lipoma regardless of the use of endoscopes. The aim of this case report is to draw the attention of surgeons to similar presentations in other patients.\n\n【44】In conclusion, we report a case of a dermoid cyst around the lateral eyebrow that was misdiagnosed as a lipoma based on the preoperative MRI findings. Imaging diagnosis should be examined closely not only regarding the major part of the lesion but also regarding the details such as the capsule and the irregular findings in the smaller areas. Common sites for some lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis, because some cases have atypical images that do not correspond with their pathological findings. In such cases, other imaging modalities and diagnoses should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis or misinterpretation of the MRI findings.\n\n【45】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【46】The data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n【47】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【48】CT:\n\n【49】Computed tomography\n\n【50】MRI:\n\n【51】Magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20240408", "version": "version1"}
