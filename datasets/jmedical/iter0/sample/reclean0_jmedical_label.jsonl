Acute cerebrovascular events associated with coronavirus disease 2019 are mainly due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced prothrombotic state. Bilateral basal ganglia ischemia is rarely reported.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 64-year-old Asian (Pakistani) gentleman who presented initially with fever, cough, and shortness of breath, likely due to respiratory involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Later, he developed bilateral lower limb pain, followed by confusion and decreased level of consciousness. Accentuated large hypodense opacities were seen in the left and right basal ganglia, with mass effects on the left frontal horn.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case demonstrates the importance of neuroimaging in the effective management of patients with neurological signs associated with coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations \\[ 1 \\]. A third of the infections are symptomatic. The predominant symptoms are consistent with respiratory involvement and include fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. However, a severe illness characterized by acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure leading to death is also reported \\[ 1 \\]. In addition, patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of developing prothrombotic complications, including deep venous thrombosis, acute limb ischemia, and ischemic stroke \\[ 2 \\]. Studies estimate that 0.8–6.4% of coronavirus patients experience an ischemic infarct \\[ 3 \\]. However, bilateral basal ganglia ischemia is rarely reported in COVID-19. We present a middle-aged gentleman with COVID-19 who developed bilateral basal ganglia ischemia. Such cases highlight the atypical neurologic sequelae of COVID-19, likely secondary to the associated prothrombotic state.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 64-year-old Asian (Pakistani) diabetic and hypertensive gentleman initially presented with fever, cough, and progressive shortness of breath for 3 days. Prior to this presentation, the patient was on a combination of metformin–sitagliptin 1000 mg/50 mg twice daily per oral (PO), atorvastatin 40 mg once daily, and valsartan–hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/25 mg daily PO. Patient was a never smoker and not an alcohol user. Patient was married and had two healthy kids. He was an accountant by profession. There was no personal or family history of malignancy, venous thromboembolism (VTE), or bleeding or clotting disorder. On presentation to the hospital, his blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate was 100 bpm, respiratory rate was 23/min, and oxygen saturation was 89% on room air. On examination, the patient had coarse crackles in bilateral lower lung fields, which did not change character with cough. Neurological examination was negative for meningeal signs and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. A chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated bilateral diffuse heterogeneous infiltrates, more pronounced on the right side. Due to high clinical suspicion, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected for SARS-CoV-2 Reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR), which was positive, confirming COVID-19.\n\n【12】A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest showed multifocal, multilobar ground-glass opacities in central and peripheral locations, more pronounced in middle and lower lobes, with septal thickening, giving a classical crazy paving appearance. Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) guidelines were used to calculate disease burden based on HRCT, and the score was 21/40 (severe disease burden) \\[ 4 \\]. During the hospital stay, the patient was admitted to the COVID-19 isolation unit, where he received moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, enoxaparin, and dexamethasone, based on the local COVID-19 treatment protocol at that time.\n\n【13】On day three of his hospital stay, the patient developed bilateral lower limb pain without any erythema, change in color, or change in the size of his lower limbs. An arterial and venous Doppler ultrasound was negative for occlusion or deep venous thrombosis. On day four, the patient was noted to have developed confusion and decreased level of consciousness. The GCS dropped from 15/15 to 10/15. The patient was emergently sedated, intubated, and mechanically ventilated to protect the airway.\n\n【14】An urgent non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the brain (Fig. 1 ) revealed accentuated hypodensities in the left basal ganglia (involving caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, and anterior limb of internal capsule), with mass effect on the ipsilateral frontal horn. Another smaller hypodensity in the right caudate nucleus was also seen. With a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, the patient received aspirin and continued to receive statin and antihypertensives. However, thrombolysis was not considered as the exact time of onset of symptoms was not documented, and the patient had well-developed ischemic changes on the NCCT, signifying being past the thrombolytic period.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the brain showing accentuated hypodensities in left basal ganglia (involving caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, and anterior limb of internal capsule) and a smaller hypodensity in the right caudate nucleus\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Over the next few days, the patient received care in the intensive care unit, but his general condition deteriorated, with increasing oxygen requirements. On day 27 of the hospital stay, the patient developed cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful, and he passed away. Autopsy was declined by the family and, hence, could not be done.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Our case describes a gentleman with severe COVID-19 pneumonia-associated bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhage. The incidence of bilateral basal ganglia ischemia during coronavirus infection is rare. A literature search performed on PubMed on 07 June 2021 using the Boolean operator strategy of “(basal ganglia) AND (ischemia) AND (COVID-19)” showed four results. The screening of abstracts revealed two cases by Matos _et al._ and Kulick-Soper _et al._ reporting basal ganglia ischemia \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Matos _et al._ attributed the stroke to vasculopathy and Kulick-Soper _et al._ attributed the ischemia to possible hypoxic-ischemic injury. The clinical and radiological features of both studies are listed in Table 1 . The common feature is presence of altered mental status. However, unlike other cases, paresthesia, apathy, or movement abnormalities were not present.\n\n【22】**Table 1 Clinical features of ischemia of basal ganglia reported in the literature**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】The increased risk of ischemic cerebrovascular complications associated with COVID-19 is an emerging concern. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, there has been a wide array of COVID-19-related neurologic manifestations, including encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain–Barre syndrome \\[ 5 \\]. COVID-19 has been linked to the hypercoagulable and prothrombotic state implicated in ischemic stroke \\[ 6 \\]. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 helps explain the neurovascular effects of the disease. SARS-CoV-2, upon entry into the human body, binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is expressed on pulmonary type 2 pneumocytes, cardiac myocytes, and vascular endothelial cells \\[ 7 \\]. Vascular endothelial cells are critical to the regulation of vascular permeability, maintaining hemostasis, and regulating hemolysis \\[ 8 \\]. This explains their role in COVID-19 vasculopathy and thrombosis. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 releases interleukin-1 (IL-1), interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which not only leads to increased vascular permeability and endothelial injury, but also to increased platelet activation factor and inhibition of thrombomodulin, leading to thrombosis, as suggested by Shams _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\]. In patients with COVID-19, native arterial occlusions are observed in both younger and older individuals, and more often in males than females in the general population \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【25】The basal ganglia and thalamus are paired deep gray matter structures affected by various conditions, including systemic or metabolic diseases, degenerative vascular disorders, and infections \\[ 11 \\]. Basal ganglia infarction is a type of cerebral infarct with unique clinical manifestations. Old age, diabetes, and hypertension are considered risk factors for cerebral ischemic lesions \\[ 12 \\]. In an observational study on COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms, about 5.5% of the patients were found to have basal ganglia lesions \\[ 13 \\]. COVID-19 is postulated to have neuroinvasive potential. In addition, the raised inflammatory markers may indicate a hyperinflammatory state, which may play a role in cerebral ischemia \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【26】Our study has certain limitations. First, we were unable to investigate which underlying diseases significantly increase the relative risk of presenting with neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular disorders. Second, due to clinical circumstances, we were unable to obtain the magnetic resonance imaging for the patient. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the association between COVID-19-associated basal ganglia ischemia and the underlying pathophysiology. This case further signifies the importance of neuroimaging in the effective management of patients who present with an altered mental status and neurological signs during their COVID-19 illness.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】COVID-19-associated basal ganglia ischemia may be multifactorial secondary to the prothrombotic state, hypoxic-ischemic injury, or vasculitis. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of basal ganglia involvement in COVID-19 and utilizing neuroimaging tools is vital in managing the neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【29】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【30】Not applicable.\n\n【31】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【32】COVID-19:\n\n【33】Coronavirus disease 2019\n\n【34】SARS-CoV-2:\n\n【35】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\n【36】RT-PCR:\n\n【37】Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction\n\n【38】HRCT:\n\n【39】High-resolution computed tomography\n\n【40】RSNA:\n\n【41】Radiological Society of North America\n\n【42】NCCT:\n\n【43】Non-contrast computed tomography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

No previous reports have described surgical management of concomitant occurrence of these neoplasms. We report a case of simultaneous surgical resection in a patient with coexisting cardiac myxoma and atypical thymic carcinoid.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 44-year-old Japanese woman underwent chest roentgenography revealing an abnormality in the mediastinum. Computed tomography revealed a 100 mm mass in the anterior mediastinum and also a 30 mm mass in the left atrium. The mediastinal tumor was diagnosed as atypical carcinoid by biopsy. Having completed resection of atypical thymic carcinoid, cardiac mass was successfully resected with careful consideration of minimizing operation time and optimizing patient safety and oncological treatment. The histopathological diagnosis of the cardiac mass was myxoma. No adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, and no recurrence was seen as of the 45 month follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The simultaneous surgery of cardiac myxoma and atypical thymic carcinoid was feasible and effective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe one-stage treatment of these neoplasms.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Anterior mediastinal tumors are often found incidentally during scrutiny of other diseases, but few cases have described surgical treatment of concomitant cardiac and mediastinal tumors. Cardiac myxoma is the most common type of primary cardiac tumor in adults, and warrants complete surgical resection owing to the risks of sudden death and embolism \\[ 1 \\]. Thymic carcinoid accounts for 2% of all mediastinal tumors, and is rarer and more malignant than pulmonary carcinoid \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Patients with atypical thymic carcinoid, which is usually categorized as an intermediate-grade malignancy, show a more aggressive clinical course than patients with typical carcinoid \\[ 4 \\]. The standard treatment of thymic carcinoid in the absence of distant metastasis involves definitive oncological resection \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. We report herein a case of simultaneous resection of cardiac myxoma and atypical thymic carcinoid via mediastinal sternal incision.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 44-year-old Japanese woman underwent chest roentgenography during a regular health checkup, revealing an abnormality in the left mediastinum. The patient had a medical history of hypertension and uterine myoma, and she was taking angiotensin II receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker. Her family had no medical history. She was married with gravida 2, para 2. She did not consume alcohol or tobacco. The initial vital signs were a temperature 36.5 °C, blood pressure 130/91 mmHg, heart rate 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and saturation 99% on room air. No significant findings were obtained from physical and neurological examination. Her initial blood work revealed hemoglobin of 146 g/L, leukocytes of 6.8 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, platelets of 348 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /μL, creatinine of 0.59 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 26 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 38 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase of 123 U/L, soluble interleukin-2 receptors of 177 U/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen of 2.0 ng/mL, cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA) of 1.3 ng/mL, and B-type natriuretic peptide of 6.5 pg/mL.\n\n【12】Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a 100 × 90 mm mass showing heterogeneous contrast enhancement in the anterior mediastinum, with no invasion into surrounding organs (Fig. 1 A). A 30 × 30 mm mass was also shown in the left atrium (Fig. 1 B). No lymph node metastases or distant metastases were identified. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a movable mass attached to the mitral valve, prolapsing into the left ventricle (Fig. 1 C). CT-guided needle biopsy (CTNB) diagnosed the mediastinal mass as atypical thymic carcinoid.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**A** Chest computed tomography showing a 100 × 90 mm anterior mediastinal mass with heterogeneous contrast (arrows). **B** Sagittal-view computed tomography.

The mediastinal tumor was located on the left lobe of the thymus, but showed no invasion into surrounding organs (Fig. 2 A). After complete resection without damaging the mediastinal tumor (Fig. 2 B), we cleaned the surgical field with physiological saline and changed the surgical devices to prevent any inadvertent scattering of microscopic tumor cells. The left atrial pedunculated tumor had developed from the interatrial septal oval fossa. The cardiac tumor was successfully resected, and atrial structures remained intact (Fig. 2 C). The time of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamp, and surgery was 68, 36, and 270 minutes, respectively. Histopathological examination of the resected tumor revealed atypical thymic carcinoid and cardiac myxoma (Fig. 3 A, B ). The patient recovered well and was discharged 13 days postoperatively. No adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The patient was followed up regularly with physical examination, chest roentgenography, echocardiography, and CT scan every 6 months, and no recurrence was seen as of the 45 month follow-up.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**A** Intraoperative view showing the mediastinal tumor in front of the heart and ascending aorta. **B** Macroscopic view of the mediastinal tumor. **C** Macroscopic view of the intracardiac tumor\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**A** Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mediastinal tumor.

Scattered spindle cells against a background of loose myxoid stroma indicate cardiac myxoma\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Although clinicians sometimes encounter patients with concomitant cardiac disease and other malignancies, the clinical approach should be decided based on the individual case because definitive treatment has not been established. There were no other reports that described simultaneous surgical resection of cardiac myxoma and thymic carcinoid in PubMed with the keywords “myxoma” and “carcinoid.” We report a case of complete resection of these tumors via mediastinal sternal incision with good clinical outcome.\n\n【28】About 75% of cardiac tumors are benign, and cardiac myxomas occupy about half of the cardiac benign tumors \\[ 6 \\]. However, cardiac myxomas are life-threatening tumors owing to the risk of embolization and sudden death, and should be resected prior to treatment of other tumors \\[ 1 \\]. Atypical thymic carcinoids are considered to be intermediated-grade malignant tumors and have poor prognosis. Jia _et al._ reported that the median overall survival of atypical thymic carcinoid was 3.6–6.4 years \\[ 2 \\]. Although the rarity of thymic carcinoids has resulted in a lack of extensive data, radical surgery is regarded as the only curative method. Patients whose tumor could not be completely removed had a shorter overall survival than those who underwent R0 resection \\[ 7 \\]. There are currently no data to support neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for resectable thymic carcinoids.\n\n【29】In the present case, we were able to diagnose both cardiac myxoma and atypical thymic carcinoid from the result of transthoracic echocardiography and CTNB before treatment. Approximately 100 mm of mediastinal tumor was localized in front of the heart, preventing open-heart surgery. We therefore performed simultaneous resection immediately without neoadjuvant therapy. The risk of systematic spread of the atypical carcinoid cell during the one-stage surgery had to be considered, since extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was needed during cardiac tumor resection. A two-stage surgery may have offered the advantage of a lower risk of scattering tumor cells, but would also have disadvantages such as a longer total duration of therapy and potential difficulties in the second stage due to adhesions. Several groups have reported surgical approaches for combined heart diseases and other malignancies, and concluded that simultaneous surgery was not associated with any adverse impacts on morbidity, mortality, or recurrence-free survival \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. On the other hand, Hasegawa _et al._ reported a case involving suspected hematogenous dissemination of malignant tumor cells via ECC \\[ 9 \\]. They pointed out that using aspirated blood for ECC could increase the risk of tumor cell dissemination. As a strategy to prevent tumor cell scattering, we initially performed en bloc resection of the thymus along with the mediastinal tumor, then cleaned the surgical field sufficiently with physiological saline and changed all surgical devices before performing cardiac surgery. Further, we reduced the use of aspirated blood as much as possible during ECC.\n\n【30】As this is the first report of coexisting cardiac myxoma and atypical thymic carcinoid, the relationship between these tumors is unclear. Approximately 7% of cardiac myxomas arise in patients with Carney complex (CNC), an inherited disorder characterized by spotty skin pigmentation, endocrine overactivity, and myxoma \\[ 10 \\]. Various endocrine tumors, including thyroid tumors, testes tumor, and ovary tumors, are also known to arise in patients with CNC. Atypical thymic carcinoids are a rare type of neuroendocrine tumor, and CNC may thus have been a possibility in this patient. However, no other significant clinical findings were suggestive of CNC, such as hormonal abnormalities or family history, and the patient declined genetic examination.\n\n【31】Additional postoperative therapy is not necessarily needed as long as the tumors were removed completely, though we believe that postoperative chemotherapy for thymic carcinoid that could not be removed completely and postoperative radiation therapy in the case of capsular invasion, positive margins, or positive lymph nodes are efficacious \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. In the present case, we did not give any postoperative therapies, and no findings of recurrence were detected as of the 45 month follow-up. CNC is reportedly associated with a high rate of recurrence for cardiac myxomas \\[ 13 \\]. Although the relationship with CNC in the present case remains uncertain, we will continue careful observation for not only the thymic carcinoid but also the cardiac myxoma.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】We encountered a case in which simultaneous surgery enabled complete oncological resection without any recurrence as of 45 months postoperatively. Because cases of concomitant cardiac myxoma and thymic carcinoid are extremely rare, definitive treatment has yet to be established. We will continue follow-up for the long term, but further case accumulation is needed.\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】All the data are available within the article.\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】CT:\n\n【38】Computed tomography\n\n【39】CTNB:\n\n【40】Computed tomography-guided needle biopsy\n\n【41】ECC:\n\n【42】Extracorporeal circulation\n\n【43】CNC:\n\n【44】Carney complex", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, the co-occurrence of the two pathologies is very rare and serious.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of an elderly Caucasian patient who was aware of having an abdominal aortic aneurysm but refused treatment and was subsequently admitted to the hospital’s emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms. A computed tomography scan raised the possibility of complication due to the characteristics of the aneurysm. The patient then agreed to emergency surgery. Laparotomy revealed the existence of an acute perforated appendicitis with a significant abscess in the right iliac fossa and an uncomplicated aneurysm. Appendectomy was performed and the abscess drained. The postoperative period passed without complications, and the patient again refused surgery for the aneurysm, which due to its anatomical characteristics was not a candidate for standard endovascular treatment.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In light of this experience, we review the literature about the relationship between abdominal aortic aneurysm and acute appendicitis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Abdominal aortic aneurysm and acute appendicitis are relatively common pathologies in elderly patients \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. However, the association of the two entities is very rare and serious \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Following our treatment of a patient with this association, in addition to presenting and discussing the clinical case, we review the literature on this unusual and complex relationship between abdominal aortic aneurysms and acute appendicitis.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The case report concerns an 85-year-old Caucasian patient with a personal history of arterial hypertension, but no other medical background of interest. In 2015, the internal medicine service of her local hospital requested computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax-abdomen-pelvis with and without intravenous contrast (26 January). The most significant findings of this exploration were: (1) a pulmonary granulomatous condensation, (2) an uncomplicated cholelithiasis, and (3) an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which started 3 cm below the renal arteries, with dimensions of 6.2 cm (antero-posterior) × 6.3 cm (transversal) × 10.0 cm (cranio-caudal), and a 2.4-cm-thick mural thrombus. The patient refused surgical treatment for the aforementioned aneurysm.\n\n【13】On 18 December 2018, the patient was referred from her regional hospital to the emergency department of our hospital because of the presentation of abdominal pain, with a diagnosis of complicated AAA. On arrival (3.00 a.m.), the patient was conscious and some vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) were within the normal range. At that time, she reported that a few hours before she had experienced sudden onset of abdominal pain, located in the epigastrium and radiating to both iliac fossae and located in the left iliac fossa. The most pertinent analytical results included a discrete leukocytosis (11.03 × 10/uL) with neutrophilia (88.1%), elevated C-reactive protein (6.45 mg/dL), and a normal level of procalcitonin (0.17 ng/mL). Otherwise, the patient had normal blood count, coagulation, biochemistry (including troponins), and blood gases.\n\n【14】An angio-CT was performed, which showed the known AAA to have measurements of 8 cm (antero-posterior) × 8.5 cm (transversal) × 10 cm (cranio-caudal), without signs of rupture (no free fluid or signs of retroperitoneal hematoma were observed), but with radiological signs of intraluminal thrombus hemorrhage (Fig. 1 a). A 2.2-cm transverse growth of the aneurysm since the CT performed 3 years before (at the time of diagnosis) was also observed. Jointly, in the pelvis, a 5-cm segment of the sigmoid colon presenting a thickening of the wall was observed. A slight increase in the echogenicity of the adjacent fat suggested the action of an inflammatory process (diverticulitis or non-specific colitis).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Preoperative computed tomography (transverse sections): **a** Aortic abdominal aneurysm of 8 cm (antero-posterior) × 8.5 cm (transversal), without signs of rupture (no free liquid or signs of retroperitoneal hematoma are visible), and radiological signs of intrathrombal hemorrhage (arrow). **b** Thickening of the sigmoid wall and slight increase in the echogenicity of the adjacent fat (5 cm in length). Inflamed appendix and increased echogenicity of adjacent fat (arrows)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】An uncomplicated cholelithiasis (already known from the previous CT) was noted. Finally, our center’s radiologist noted an inflammation of the appendix and an increase in the echogenicity of the adjacent fat (Figs. 1 b and 2 a, b).\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Preoperative computed tomography (coronal and sagittal sections): **a** inflamed appendix and increased echogenicity of adjacent fat (arrows). **b** Thickening of the sigmoid wall and slight increase in the echogenicity of the adjacent fat (arrow)\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】During the observation period, the patient was stable, although she had a fever with a peak temperature of 38°C. A second analysis showed an increase in leukocytosis (13.23 × 10/uL) with almost identical neutrophilia (87.2%), hyperglycemia (179 mg/dL), alteration of the ionogram (hyponatremia of 134 mmol/L, hypokalemia of 2.9 mmol/L, and hypochloremia of 95 mmol/L), elevated reactive-C protein (17.55 mg/dL), and procalcitonin above the reference values (0.53 ng/mL). All other analytical results were unchanged.\n\n【25】At this time, the patient was evaluated by the general surgery and gastroenterology services, which concluded that the clinical results and examination were very nonspecific. Therefore, the available data pointed most strongly toward a symptomatic and unstable AAA with a high risk of imminent rupture. Emergency surgery was therefore proposed to treat her AAA, to which the patient gave her consent. The anatomical characteristics of the neck of the aneurysm (short and with severe angulation) compelled us to rule out standard endovascular surgery.\n\n【26】Fourteen hours after admission, the vascular surgery team performed a xyphopubic laparotomy. There was a gangrenous appendix (with microperforations) and purulent free fluid in the right iliac fossa. The general surgery team on duty was notified that they should perform an appendectomy, wash out the purulent fluid, and take samples for culture. Given the high probability of infection of the prosthesis (to treat AAA) and the absence of retroperitoneal hematoma suggestive of complication, it was decided not to treat the AAA during this surgical session.\n\n【27】Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was prescribed until the result of the culture had been received. This revealed the presence of a strain of _Proteus mirabilis_ that was sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, and ceftriaxone.\n\n【28】The patient progressed favorably and was discharged a week later. She was re-evaluated 1 and 4 months after discharge (24 January and 12 April 2019) in the vascular surgery clinic. The patient again rejected scheduled surgical treatment of her aortic aneurysm (Fig. 3 ), after being informed in detail about the risk of AAA rupture and death. At the present time (31 August 2020), the patient, 87 years old, remains alive 56 months from the diagnosis of the aneurysm and 20 months after the referred appendectomy.\n\n【29】**Fig. 3**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Diagram of the patient and her problem\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Abdominal aortic aneurysm and appendicitis are two of the many abdominal pathologies that may affect the elderly. These pathologies usually occur in isolation, but in rare cases they can be associated, where upon their severity increases.\n\n【35】### Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)\n\n【36】AAA is a pathology occurring almost exclusively in the elderly population, and preferentially in males. Patients are initially asymptomatic, and when symptoms appear they are usually nonspecific (abdominal or back pain). Without treatment, its natural history leads to the growth and rupture of the aneurysm, which has a high mortality rate. In the case of breakage, the pain at the abdominal, back or flank level is more intense; the classic triad (hypotension, back pain, and palpable mass) is only present in 25–50% of cases \\[ 1 \\], and the symptomatology is often more oriented towards cholecystitis, lumbago, or renal colic. For these reasons, in atypical cases, the diagnosis of ruptured/leaking AAA is sometimes incorrect or delayed \\[ 2 \\]. Obviously, an ultrasound or a CT would clarify these doubts.\n\n【37】#### Indication for surgery\n\n【38】There is a broad consensus about the indication for elective AAA treatment (open or endovascular surgery). This is based on three criteria: (1) maximum transverse diameter of AAA (≥ 5.5 cm for men and ≥ 5.0 cm for women); (2) presence of symptoms; (3) AAA growth (> 1 cm/year) \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【39】In our patient, there was a clear indication to operate (initial transverse diameter of AAA = 6.3 cm and 8.5 cm at the time of appendicectomy), but the patient refused treatment because she did not accept the risk of open surgery, which would have been necessary because the anatomical conditions of the AAA did not allow standard endovascular treatment.\n\n【40】#### AAA rupture factors\n\n【41】A review has summarized the existence of numerous biological (large diameter and annual growth of the aneurysm), clinical (female gender, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking habit), and biomechanical and enzymatic (matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs) factors related to AAA rupture \\[ 5 \\]. A recent systematic review has defined the relevance of different potential factors (circulatory, biomechanical, and genetic) related to the growth and rupture of an AAA. According to this review, two factors have been identified that increase the risk of rupture: stress on the wall and the diameter of the aneurysm \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【42】Nine studies show that the diameter of the AAA is an important marker of rupture \\[ 6 \\]. There is even agreement, based on data from several studies, about how the annual risk of rupture of an AAA is related to its diameter: for those measuring 40–49 cm, the annual risk is 1%, while if the diameter exceeds 7 cm, the figure rises to 30–33% \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【43】The aortic wall contains certain structural proteins (collagen and elastin) and their activators and inhibitors (collagenase and elastase). Therefore, and with respect to the stress on the aortic wall, it has been shown that an increase in the level of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or their inhibitors increases the risk of aneurysm rupture. Specifically, MMP-9 and the MMP-1 inhibitors are markers of rupture \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【44】In this context, in 1980, Swanson _et al._ \\[ 9 \\] were among the first to draw attention to the fact that laparotomy is a precipitating factor for the rupture of abdominal aneurysms. The authors explain this in terms of a reduction in the collagen content of the wall of the aneurysm, which causes it to weaken. There is usually a balance between collagen synthesis and lysis, but the latter process is boosted by laparotomy. Evidently, lysis is concentrated in the area adjacent to the lesion, but may also take place at remote sites. It occurs particularly during the first postoperative week, after which, in the absence of sepsis or starvation, synthesis overcomes the lysis and the equilibrium is restored. Therefore, there is a risk of the aneurysm rupturing during this period. Subsequently, other authors have considered this to be speculative or doubtful. For some, its effect is minimal given that, in many situations, there is no direct trauma in the area of the aneurysm \\[ 10 \\]. Others, however, cannot discount that the possibility that the risk factor may exist, although it does not affect all aneurysms equally, since it depends on the degree of aggression of the laparotomy and the size of the aneurysm \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【45】Our patient presented the two aforementioned risk factors for rupture: (1) a large-diameter aneurysm and (2) stress on the wall (due to laparotomy and sepsis). Fortunately, the stress was not severe enough to trigger the rupture of the AAA during the postoperative period.\n\n【46】#### Preoperative risk prediction\n\n【47】Patterson _et al._ \\[ 12 \\] performed a systematic review to examine and compare existing preoperative risk prediction methods for elective AAA repair. They reviewed 28 articles encompassing 10 risk models. The most frequent risk prediction models were the Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality (POSSUM) predictor equation, and the Vascular Biochemistry and Haematology Outcome Model (VBHOM). All models had strengths and weaknesses. According to this systematic review, the GAS appears to be the most useful and consistently validated score at present for open repair. Recent work has shown that no scores consistently predicted the risk associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Since 2015, we have used the AAA Score tool \\[ 13 \\] in our department. This application, developed by Graeme Ambler on behalf of the British Society for Endovascular Therapy, implements preoperative risk prediction models, including endovascular procedures.\n\n【48】### Appendicitis in the elderly\n\n【49】Appendicitis is the most common reason for acute abdominal surgery in the general population. It is much more frequent in the young than in the elderly population, although it is becoming more common in the latter group because of their increasing life expectancy. The presentation of appendicitis (fever, pain in the right iliac fossa, etc.) in the elderly is not common, and for that reason the initial diagnosis is only correct in half of the cases \\[ 14 \\]. While computed tomography may represent a useful diagnostic tool and laparoscopic appendectomy may be appropriate for selected patients, neither has affected outcomes when measured for morbidity and mortality rates \\[ 15 \\]. The presence of atypical cases and the delay in diagnosis and surgery leads to an increase in the incidence of perforated appendicitis and higher mortality \\[ 16 \\]. A recent series of 112 appendectomies in elderly patients showed a perforation and morbidity rate of 40% and 28%, respectively. There was no mortality \\[ 17 \\]. Nevertheless, around half of appendicitis deaths occur in the elderly \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【50】In our patient, the clinical presentation of appendicitis was clearly atypical, and the CT, given the size and morphology of the AAA, led us to conclude symptomatic AAA with the risk of leakage or rupture, for which reason we recommended surgery. The possibility of a second pathology was not clearly suspected preoperatively. For all these reasons, our case is paradigmatic within appendicitis in the elderly: atypical clinical presentation, a CT scan of little value, and a perforated appendicitis.\n\n【51】### Association of AAA and appendicitis\n\n【52】AAA and various abdominal pathologies (cholelithiasis, colon cancer, appendicitis, etc.) are common in old age and, on rare occasions, may coexist. Although there are no figures in this regard, the finding of an AAA associated with another non-vascular intra-abdominal pathology area is increasingly commonly in the same patient. Under these circumstances, some surgeons will combine two operations in the same surgical session. Others limit themselves to treating the most serious pathology (usually, but not always, the AAA), leaving the other problem to be dealt with at a later time. This latter option could be considered the more prudent, since it is less complex and quicker, but it is also true that surgical aggression can exacerbate the untreated pathology. In any case, an optimal decision must seek to minimize: (1) the risk of rupture of the AAA after the first operation; (2) the risk of infection of the prosthesis, which is inserted when treating the aneurysm; (3) postoperative morbidity and mortality as a consequence of both pathologies \\[ 18 \\]. As we will explain later, the introduction of endovascular surgery assuredly modifies these postulates.\n\n【53】Despite this, there is no consensus about the best option for achieving the stated objectives of minimising risk: Should everything be done the same operation or in sequential surgical acts; if the latter, which pathology should be treated first?\n\n【54】Although the therapeutic dilemma has not been resolved, the risks can be minimized when cases for simultaneous surgery are well chosen, and when staged surgery is decided upon, the first pathology to be treated and the time between the first and second stages are well chosen \\[ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 \\]. Sometimes the aggressiveness of the first operation makes it necessary to significantly delay the second surgery, or even prompts the patient to reject it \\[ 20 , 21 \\].\n\n【55】In general, the symptomatic lesion should be treated first. If both conditions are asymptomatic, the relative risks and benefits of treatment should be balanced against the likelihood that one or both conditions will become symptomatic \\[ 23 \\]. However, there may be situations with two symptomatic pathologies, both of which may even require urgent treatment (e.g., complicated AAA plus perforated diverticula of the colon). Such combinations are particularly lethal and may require very aggressive synchronous actions.\n\n【56】Finally, we consider the endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) under these complex circumstances. This valuable tool could change the strategy by simplifying simultaneous treatment or by staging the procedures with a shorter delay \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【57】For all the above reasons, we believe that perhaps the most important action is to individualize each case, as we have done with our patient. We initially intended to treat her AAA but changed our decision when we found perforated appendicitis associated with localized peritonitis. Unfortunately, our patient was not a candidate for EVAR.\n\n【58】In 1960, Ochsner, Cooley, and DeBakey \\[ 24 \\] published the results of 480 \"accidental\" appendectomies in 931 patients with aneurysms without significant morbidity or mortality. We now know that \"prophylactic\" appendectomy provides little or no benefit and that it is not prudent to practice it in patients undergoing open surgery for AAA.\n\n【59】In 2000, Oshodi _et al._ \\[ 21 \\], in their series of 55 patients with AAA coexisting with some other non-vascular abdominal pathology, reported two appendectomies for appendicitis, in which there was simultaneous treatment of AAA. However, the article does not provide any further useful information (for example, regarding the type of appendicitis or the possible appearance of complications in the postoperative period).\n\n【60】In 2009, Al Samaraee _et al._ \\[ 3 \\] reported a case of AAA that was concomitant with acute appendicitis, an occurrence that, in the opinion of the authors, had never been published before. The patient, a 66-year-old man with acute abdominal symptoms, was diagnosed from a CT scan with acute appendicitis and infrarenal AAA (6.3 cm in diameter). Initially, open appendectomy (phlegmonous appendix) was performed; on a second occasion, after an interval of 10 days, and once the patient had fully recovered, open AAA surgery was performed. Thus, the symptomatic and life-threatening pathology was treated first, leaving, without discharging the patient, the treatment of the asymptomatic AAA but with a clear indication for surgery (diameter > 5.5 cm) for a later time. In the opinion of the authors, the simultaneous practice of both surgeries would have posed a risk of infection of the prosthesis.\n\n【61】Considering all the above, we are of the opinion that simultaneous surgery can be safe and cost-effective in cases of AAA and clean-contaminated (cholelithiasis) or even contaminated (with opening of the colon) surgery, but not in those of dirty surgery (abscess or peritonitis), as in the case reported here.\n\n【62】We think that our case is very different from that of Al Samaraee _et al._ \\[ 3 \\], since the appendicitis changed from phlegmonous to perforated with local peritonitis. The case reported by Al Wahbi and Tamimi in 2015 \\[ 25 \\] is similar to ours, where the patient, a 71-year-old man, had a huge AAA (10 cm diameter) concomitant with a diverticular abscess in the right iliac fossa. Initially, percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound was performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy (and other measures). Once this had resolved, on day 10, the authors carried out elective AAA open surgery. The patient was discharged after a further 10 days and showed no complications during a 3-year follow-up. The favorable incision-evacuation of the abscess and the successful medical treatment of diverticular disease were decisive in this case.\n\n【63】The relationship between AAA and appendicitis is rare and therefore scarcely described in the medical literature (Table 1 ). Its association modifies the clinical presentation (ruptured AAA that simulates appendicitis or the opposite as in our case) \\[ 26 , 27 \\] or induces serious complications, such as aneurysm \\[ 28 , 29 , 30 \\] or endoprosthesis \\[ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 \\]. Finally, cases of primary \\[ 35 \\] and secondary \\[ 36 , 37 , 38 \\] aorto-appendicular fistulas have been described.\n\n【64】**Table 1 Aortic abdominal aneurysm (AAA) and acute appendicitis (AAp)**\n\n【65】Full size table\n\n【66】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【67】Abdominal aortic aneurysm and acute appendicitis are relatively common pathologies in elderly patients. However, the association of the two entities is very rare and serious. In general, the symptomatic lesion should be treated first. If both conditions are asymptomatic, the relative risks and benefits of treatment should be balanced against the likelihood that one or both conditions will become symptomatic. However, there may be situations with two symptomatic pathologies, both of which may even require urgent treatment. Such combinations are particularly lethal and may require very aggressive synchronous actions.\n\n【68】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【69】The datasets used during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【70】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【71】CT:\n\n【72】Computed tomography\n\n【73】AAA:\n\n【74】Abdominal aortic aneurysm\n\n【75】MMPs:\n\n【76】Matrix metalloproteinases\n\n【77】EVAR:\n\n【78】Endovascular aneurysm repair\n\n【79】AAF:\n\n【80】Aortoappendiceal fistula", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It usually gives rise to few symptoms, and the impact is mainly functional and aesthetic. It is considered part of dystrophic calcinosis cutis. Surgical management is the only curative approach, and recurrence has been described in few cases.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report cases of two North African white patients with operated scrotal calcinosis. We describe the clinical and histological aspects as well as a pathogenic hypothesis and surgical management principles.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】A surgical approach to scrotal calcinosis must consider the aesthetic and functional aspects postoperatively. A complete excision prevents recurrence. Psychological support is required in association with surgery because the lesions are benign and concern an intimate part of the body.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Scrotal calcinosis is described as a skin condition of multiple hard, painless, asymptomatic cutaneous nodules without abnormalities in the phosphocalcic metabolism. It usually occurs in young adults with no histology of traumatism, genitourinary infections, or hormonal disorders. Diagnostic certitude is based on histology of the surgical resection specimen. Surgical resection should be as complete as possible, involving small nodular lesions, in order to rule out recurrence. The prognosis is favorable because, to our knowledge, malignant degeneration has not been described to date.\n\n【10】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【11】### Patient 1\n\n【12】A 48-year-old North African white married man, a father of two with no past medical history, consulted our institution for calcified nodules of the scrotal skin. He complained of an impact on his sexual performance. The nodules progressively increased in size over 4 months, with a whitish but nonpurulent discharge of the most voluminous nodule. He had no history of traumatism or genitourinary or hormonal disorders. His physical examination revealed multiple and bilateral calcified cutaneous lesions of the scrotum. No inflammatory lesions surrounding the nodules were observed. The nodules ranged in size from 10 to 15 mm (Fig. 1 ). The described lesions were exclusively scrotal; there were no extensions to the penis. The patient’s blood and urine test results, including mainly calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone, were normal. He underwent surgery under general anesthesia. A complete resection of the lesions was performed. The operative specimens included hard and thick-walled calcified nodules (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination revealed a dermal, basophilic, calcified material and an atrophic epithelium. Both nodules were surrounded by an intense fibrosis with multiple giant cells. Immunohistochemical investigation revealed a negative carcinoembryonic antigen, whereas cytokeratin was positive in the surface of epithelial cells. No recurrence has been noted after 5 years of follow-up. The patient was satisfied with the aesthetic result and reported better sexual performance.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Multiple calcified lesions of the scrotal skin\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Operative specimen: multiple hard and thick-walled calcified nodules\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】### Patient 2\n\n【22】A 28-year-old North African white single man with no particular history presented to our institution with a complaint of a 3-year history of evolving scrotal calcified lesions with a recently increasing volume and subsequent sexual discomfort. The nodules were yellowish, bilateral, and indolent with no discharge or inflammatory signs (Fig. 3 ). No other locations were noted in the physical examination. Plasma and urine calcium and phosphorus were at normal levels, and the results of routine blood and urine tests were normal.\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Calcified nodules of the scrotum measuring 5–15 mm\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Surgery was performed with a fine dissection between the dermis and the dartoic muscle, allowing the excision of ten calcified nodules (Fig. 4 ). The biggest one measured 20 mm. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful.\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Operative specimen: excision of multiple calcified nodules\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Operative specimen and histological examination concerned around ten calcified nodules. The epidermis was regular but thickened and hyperplastic. Confluent calcified areas were observed in the dermis and were surrounded by fibrotic tissue. These calcifications were bordered by Malpighian cell epithelium. There were no signs of active inflammatory or malignant processes (Figs. 5 and 6 ).\n\n【33】**Fig. 5**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】Calcified areas in the dermis\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】**Fig. 6**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】Calcified areas bordered by a Malpighian cell epithelium\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】The patient was examined in the outpatient clinic at 3 weeks and 2 months after surgery. The aesthetic result was judged satisfying, with sexual improvement reported by the patient.\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】Scrotal calcinosis is a benign condition first described by Lewinski over a century ago \\[ 1 \\]. It is reported to be more frequent in black patients between the second and fourth decades of life. Some cases have occurred in infants and in elderly patients \\[ 2 \\]. A delay between the beginning of symptoms and the first consultation is usually noted because the lesions affect an intimate part of the body.\n\n【44】Lesions are nodular and indolent, without any discharge or inflammatory and bilateral signs. A penile location has been reported for multiple scrotal calcinosis nodules causing sexual discomfort \\[ 3 \\]. To our knowledge, only one case of a unilateral form has been published in the English literature \\[ 4 \\]. Lesion size ranges from a few millimeters to several centimeters \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【45】The question about the etiopathogenesis is not resolved. As scrotal calcinosis is not associated to any metabolic or hormonal disorder, mainly the calcium and the phosphorus metabolism and the parathyroid hormone activity, the idiopathic character was previously approved \\[ 6 \\]. Song _et al_ ., analyzing more than 50 nodules of scrotal calcinosis, concluded that the common characteristic is a calcified dystrophy of epidermal cysts \\[ 7 \\]. This theory was widely recognized after the histological and biochemical evaluation of 100 cases of scrotal calcinosis by Dubey _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\]. Other authors supported the calcified dystrophy of the dartoic muscle \\[ 9 \\], but this theory is less convincing than that of Dubey _et al._ Histological examination using Von Kossa staining usually reveals a basophilic, calcified deposit in the scrotal dermis and the calcinosis nodules that is surrounded by giant cell granulomas in an intense foreign body inflammatory reaction \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【46】Surgery is usually performed in patients presenting with voluminous lesions carrying a psychological and a sexual prejudice. The total excision of calcified nodules may ignore small lesions, and there is potential for recurrence \\[ 5 \\]. Recently, Noel _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\] proposed a one-stage technique used mainly for giant nodules with a considerable skin defect. Elliptic resection is performed after making an incision centered on the median raphe and a thorough dissection of the scrotal dermis from the dartoic muscle, allowing more pertinent detection of small nodules than the classical resection of nodules detectable on the surface of the skin. This technique is a particularly attractive procedure because the vascularization provided by the external pudendal artery is peripheral \\[ 11 \\]. The aesthetic result is better after a median raphe incision and a fine dissection conserving the integrity of the skin integumentary capillaries.\n\n【47】The prognosis after surgery is favorable. Few cases of recurrence have been reported. Recurrence seems to be related to neglected millimetric nodules that increase in size later \\[ 5 , 12 \\]. No cases of malignant transformation have been reported \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【48】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【49】Scrotal calcinosis is a benign condition that occurs in young adults. Clinicians have to reassure patients because the nodules concern an intimate part of the body. Urologists have to keep in mind the aesthetic prejudice and the functional aspect of the surgery. An acceptable restitution of the scrotal skin integument after surgical excision is imperative. Better knowledge of the etiopathogenic aspects of scrotal calcinosis may lead to more efficient surgical procedures with the aim of ensuring better results and preventing recurrences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report the five-year clinical course of Alexander disease in one case using serial magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 12-month-old Japanese male was referred to the pediatrics department in our hospital because of developmental retardation. Alexander disease was diagnosed by gene examination of the mutation of a glial fibrillary acidic protein.

Serial magnetic resonance imaging examinations until the age of five were performed and changes in magnetic resonance imaging findings were compared to the progression in clinical symptoms.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Alexander disease is a very rare disease with a variety of clinical phenotypes. Therefore serial magnetic resonance imaging studies for long-term survival infantile cases including our case may be important in the analysis of the pathophysiological mechanism.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Alexander disease is a rare disorder resulting from a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene mutation which causes progressive degeneration in white matter. Most cases are solitary, but hereditary cases have also been reported. Abnormalities predominate in the white matter of both frontal lobes, making magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) useful for diagnosis. In this report, we show the clinical course of Alexander disease in one case using MRI.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 12-month-old Japanese male was referred to the pediatrics department of our hospital because he was unable to sit independently. At the initial examination, the 12-month-old could hold his head up but could not maintain a sitting posture. Macrocephaly was not noted. He had no history of perinatal abnormalities. Birth weight was 3058g, height 49cm, and head circumference 34.5cm. There was no family history of neurological disorder.\n\n【12】Brain computed tomography (CT) showed areas of low attenuation with frontal white matter preponderance, cyst formation near the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and cerebral atrophy predominant in the frontal lobes (Figure 1 a). T2-weighted images demonstrated symmetrical high-intensity areas in the white matter of both frontal lobes and deep gray matter, cyst formation in the white matter, and cerebral atrophy (Figure 1 b). T2-weighted images also showed slight abnormalities in the medulla oblongata (Figure 1 c). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images showed contrast enhancement of the peri-cystic area and caudate nucleus region bilaterally (Figure 1 d).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months. a** Computed tomography image demonstrates low attenuation areas in the white matter of the frontal lobes, putamen, external capsule and claustrum, and cystic formation in the white matter of the frontal lobes. **b** T2-weighted image shows areas of high signal intensity and cystic formation in the white matter of the frontal lobes, and significant deep gray matter structure abnormality. **c** T2-weighted image shows small, bilateral hyperintense lesions in the medulla oblongata. **d** Contrast T1-weighted image demonstrates contrast enhancement in the pericystic lesion and the caudate nucleus.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】These findings suggested infantile leukodystrophy, and other diseases in the differential diagnosis including Alexander disease, megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), van der Knaap disease, Canavan disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Alexander disease or MLC were strongly suspected, as these types of infantile leukodystrophy involve cyst formation. Alexander disease was diagnosed by gene examination, and Murakami _et al_ . already reported by the mutation of the _GFAP_ gene in this case: the patient had a heterozygous deletion of genomic sequence 1247-1249GGG>GG in exon 8 of the _GFAP_ gene \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【18】This case was followed with the best supportive care and careful rehabilitation for almost 5 years after the onset of the disease. His general condition was stable. The second MRI was performed at 4 years of age after his spastic quadriplegia began to slowly progress. Significant volume loss in bilateral white matter and deep gray matter as a cause of enlargement of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle was recognized from T2-weighted images (Figure 2 a). Furthermore, a periventricular rim of high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images was apparent (Figure 2 b), and high intensity lesions on T2-weighted images became more apparent in the medulla oblongata (Figure 2 c).\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】**Magnetic resonance imaging at 4 years. a** T2-weighted image shows significant volume loss in bilateral white matter and deep gray matter as a cause of enlargement of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. **b1,2** T1-weighted image and T2-weighted image show the periventricular rim around the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. **c** Abnormal signals in the medulla oblongata become apparent in T2-weighted image.\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】When the patient presented with sudden dyspnea and dysphagia at 5 years 4 months of age, emergency MRI was performed and found a further advance in the following: White matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe, volume loss in bilateral white matter and deep gray matter, and brain stem abnormalities since initial MRI images (Figure 3 a, b, c). Mild elevation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values was noted at affected sites (Figure 3 d, e).\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】**Magnetic resonance imaging at 5 years, 4 months. a** T2-weighted image shows increase in abnormal signals in the frontal lobe and volume loss in bilateral white matter and deep gray matter. **b** T2-weighted image demonstrates an increase in abnormal signals in the medulla oblongata. **c** Fluid attenuated inversion recovery image shows swelling and high intensity from the medulla oblongata to the top of the cervical spine. **d** , **e** Mild elevation in apparent diffusion coefficient values are recognized in affected areas.\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Pathological features in Alexander disease include deposits of Rosenthal fibers in astrocytes. Rosenthal fibers contain ubiquitin, heat shock proteins (HSP27) and partially degraded fragments of GFAP. Astrocyte function impairment is considered to cause adverse effects to adjacent structures, such as oligodendroglia and myelin sheath. Some cases result from autosomal recessive inheritance, but the majority is isolated (spontaneous mutations).\n\n【30】MRI is a crucial examination in the diagnosis and observation of Alexander disease. Under the MRI-based diagnostic criteria proposed by van der Knaap \\[ 2 \\], at least four of the five imaging findings below must be present for the diagnosis: 1) white matter abnormalities (swelling, signal change, atrophy, cysts) with frontal preponderance, 2) periventricular rim of high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, 3) abnormalities in the basal ganglia and thalami, 4) brain stem abnormalities, 5) contrast enhancement involving one or more of the following structures: ventricular lining, periventricular rim, white matter of the frontal lobes, optic chiasm, fornix, basal ganglia, thalamus, dentate nucleus, and brain stem. In our study, four of the five criteria proposed by van der Knaap except for a periventricular rim were seen at 1 year of age, and MRI findings at 4 years of age showed all five criteria exactly.\n\n【31】High signal intensity on T2-weighted images are reported to correspond to deposits of Rosenthal fibers or associated demyelination, and because these fibers cause breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, contrast enhancement is seen in sites with significant deposits \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Loss of brain tissue also leads to cyst formation. ADC and MR spectroscopy, although not included in van der Knaap’s diagnostic criteria, have been reported to be useful in diagonosing Alexander disease \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In our case, elevation of ADC values at the affected areas were recognized (Figure 3 d, e), which was thought to correspond with white matter degeneration.\n\n【32】As a result of a nationwide investigation, Yoshida _et al._ \\[ 4 , 5 \\] proposed a new classification on the basis of neurological and MR findings: cerebral Alexander disease (type 1), bulbospinal Alexander disease (type 2), and intermediate form (type 3) \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. According to this classification, our case is classified as cerebral Alexander disease at the onset, and then features of the bulpospinal type become apparent as the disease progresses.\n\n【33】Shiihara _et al._ \\[ 7 \\] reported MRI in a long survival case. Unlike our case, cyst formation was not seen in early MRI like in their case. However, in addition to the abnormalities in the frontal lobes, brainstem lesion and brain atrophy became apparent in the progression of the disease in a follow up period of 15 years. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the initial and serial MRI findings and clinical course after diagnosis.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】In our case, the initial MRI and MRI-based serial observations were essential to diagnose and ascertain the image-based progression of clinical symptoms. Initial MRI and MRI-based serial observations were essential to diagnose Alexander disease.

Prosthetic rehabilitation was provided three months after the completion of his periodontal and surgical therapy.

Proper periodontal treatment may alleviate systemic inflammatory mediators caused by the amyloidosis.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Reactive systemic AA amyloidosis, with a sustained acute phase response (APR), can complicate chronic inflammatory disorders. AA amyloid fibrils are derived from the acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein (SAA) through a process of cleavage, misholding, and aggregation \\[ 1 \\]. Renal disease is a frequent manifestation of the systemic amyloidosis and a major cause of morbidity \\[ 1 \\]. SAA is an apolipoprotein constituent of high-density lipoprotein that is synthesized by hepatocytes under the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokins \\[ 2 \\]. Sustained overproduction of SAA is a prerequisite for the development of AA amyloidosis. Amyloidosis affects a small proportion of patients that present with chronic inflammatory disorders \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The etiologies for this disease remain unknown. The activation pattern of SAA protein in the presence of inflammation is similar to that of C-reactive protein (CRP) \\[ 5 \\]. The level of SAA increases during acute and chronic infections \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. It has been shown that patients with chronic periodontitis display signs of a sub-clinical systemic inflammatory condition \\[ 8 \\]. Furthermore, treatment of advanced periodontitis by full-mouth tooth extraction reduced systemic levels of cardiovascular risk and inflammatory reaction \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【11】Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that plasma levels of inflammatory markers such as CRP, fibrinogen, IL-6 and leukocyte counts increase in periodontitis patients when compared to periodontally healthy patients \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Some studies have shown that effective periodontal therapy reduced levels of CRP \\[ 11 \\]. This implies that inflammatory reaction triggered by periodontitis contributes to the whole-body inflammatory burden.\n\n【12】Secondary amyloidosis, representing approximately 45% of all cases of systemic amyloidosis, has been associated with various chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and tuberculosis \\[ 12 \\]. Secondary amyloidosis has also been linked to malignant diseases such as Hodgkin's disease and mesothelioma \\[ 12 \\]. In addition, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), an autosomal recessive disease, primarily affects the population in the Mediterranean basin \\[ 13 \\]. FMF is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serosal inflammation along with a very intense APR. The most important complication of FMF is secondary amyloidosis \\[ 13 \\]. Mutation analysis of Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis for patients with an atypical presentation. Infection or inflammatory diseases may cause AA amyloidosis even without obvious infection or inflammation \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. The progression of secondary amyloidosis depends on the nature and status of the underlying chronic inflammatory disease. For example, secondary amyloidosis-associated tuberculosis has been shown to undergo remission when the chronic infection has been eliminated \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【13】Histopathologic examination of amyloid is essential for the diagnosis and classification of amyloidosis \\[ 17 , 18 \\]. The sensitivity and specificity of the histopathologic diagnosis depend on the biopsy site and the adequacy of the tissue sample \\[ 19 , 20 \\].\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】Our patient is 67-year-old Turkish man, a primary school graduate, and a forest ranger who lives in a rustic area. He was fully informed about the study and written consent was obtained from him prior to examination. In his medical examination he explained that his gums started bleeding at a very early age. At age 24, he started to smoke since he thought smoking would help to stop bleeding. Currently, he smokes 1-1.5 packs a day. At age 30, he started to experience difficulty in eating and complained of tooth mobility and gum bleeding. He claimed that his teeth ached a lot and as a result the teeth were extracted by a non-dentist or himself. Consequently, at the age of 50 to 60, he lost most of his teeth. At age 25, he was diagnosed with periodontitis. Nonetheless, he had not seen a dentist for this problem or performed any personal oral hygiene.\n\n【16】Our patient complained of pain in the oral cavity especially on the tongue, buccal mucosa and had difficulty in chewing and swallowing solid food for six months.\n\n【17】His past medical history was significant for a tonsillectomy as a child. All the symptoms in his medical reviews were negative. Spirometric pulmonary tests were normal. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed minimal emphysematous areas over both apices and non-specific sequelae (Figure 1 ). Head and neck examinations were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the tongue revealed no sign of abnormality. He underwent extensive tests to identify the etiologies associated with systemic amyloidosis. Tests such as rectal biopsy, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, abdomen tomography, serum and urine protein electrophoresis as well as liver function test were all normal. However, our patient was diagnosed as chronic renal failure with proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia (Table 1 ). Renal biopsy showed AA type amyloidosis.\n\n【18】**Figure 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed minimal emphysematous areas over both apices and non-specific sequalae** .\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Table 1 The effect of periodontal therapy on the inflammatory markers and some laboratory data**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】Clinical examination revealed poor oral hygiene and heavy plaque accumulation. Our patient was almost completely edentulous. The mean periodontal probing depth was 9.10 ± 0.84 mm (range 8-10 mm) in his remaining teeth. The tongue was diffusely enlarged (macroglossia) and clear red appearance and bilateral white plaques bleeding easily by gentle removing, and irregular translucent papules were present (Figure 2 ). Based upon our patient's history, these papules developed spontaneously or after minor trauma. The enlarged tongue has interfered with speech and swallowing, and caused sleep apnea. In addition, two painful, small flat-based ulcers with erythematous halos and a white ulcer bed were detected, localized on the right and left buccal mucosa.\n\n【25】**Figure 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**The tongue was diffusely enlarged (macroglossia), and bilateral white plaques and irregular translucent papules are seen** .\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Cultures from the plaques on the tongue and oral cavity were all negative for bacteria and fungi. The biopsies were obtained from the tongue, buccal mucosa and retromolar trigon. Secondary amyloidosis (AA type), was diagnosed by histological and immunohistochemical findings (Figure 3 ).\n\n【30】**Figure 3**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**Histopathologic examination findings: the Congo red method was used to detect amyloid in tissue sections** . Amyloid was identified as the AA type on immunohistochemical testing with the use of monoclonal antibodies specific to SAA. (A) Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen shows homogen, eosinophilic material (×20, hemotoxylin and eosin). (B) The amorphous extra-cellular material stains positively with Congo red (×2.5, Congo red). (C) This Congo red-positive material appears apple-green when viewed under polarized light (×20 Congo red-positive material appears apple-green when viewed under polarized light). (D) Extra-cellular and peri-vascular deposits of amyloid reveal positive immunoreactivity with an antibody against amyloid A (×40).\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Our patient received comprehensive periodontal therapy, which included careful oral hygiene instructions, curettage combined with non-surgical and surgical therapy. Serum inflammatory markers and some laboratory data improved dramatically at the second week of the periodontal therapy more than at any other time interval (Table 1 ). Restorative treatment started after his periodontal condition was stabilized (around three months after periodontal therapy). Intra-oral radiographs showed poor bone density (Figure 4 ).\n\n【35】**Figure 4**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】**Radiographic findings from the patient described in this case report** . Diffuse osteopeny in mandibular and prominence trabeculation of maxilla are present.\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】### Histopathologic examination findings\n\n【40】The Congo red method was used to detect amyloid in tissue sections \\[ 21 \\]. Amyloid was identified as the AA type on immunohistochemical tests with the use of monoclonal antibodies specific to amyloid A \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Our patient was 67-year-old man, a heavy and current smoker. He suffered severe chronic periodontitis and chronic renal failure. Our patient complained of pain in the oral cavity especially on the tongue, buccal mucosa and had difficulty in chewing and swallowing solid foods for almost six months. Biopsies were performed and secondary amyloidosis was diagnosed based upon histological and immunohistochemical findings. Our patient presented with typical signs of periodontal disease that include gingival tenderness, bleeding, recession, alveolar bone loss, tooth mobility, and tooth loss. In addition, several inflammation markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBC), fibrinogen and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were all elevated.\n\n【43】It has been shown that chronic infection or inflammatory diseases may cause secondary amyloidosis even without obvious infection or inflammation \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. Patients with chronic periodontal diseases had higher levels of SAA, the precursor protein of amyloid fiber in secondary amyloidosis, than patients without periodontal disease \\[ 22 \\]. To date, only a few reports address the interaction between periodontal disease and secondary amyloidosis \\[ 20 , 23 \\]. One study showed the prevalence of moderate to severe periodontitis was greater in FMF patients with amyloidosis than without amyloidosis \\[ 20 \\]. The other study was a case report that illustrated an interaction between systemic amyloidosis and severe periodontitis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis \\[ 23 \\]. Our case results were in line with findings reported in the literature.\n\n【44】The definitive method of diagnosing amyloidosis is tissue biopsy. Although biopsies can be obtained from compromised organs, blood vessel fragility associated with amyloid deposition carries a risk of bleeding. Biopsy of oral tissues has been advocated as an adjunctive or alternate method of detecting amyloid deposition. Gingival, tongue, buccal mucosa and minor salivary gland tissue have all been reported as potential sites for biopsy; however, there are inconsistent results with regard to the sensitivity of amyloid detection in each of these tissues \\[ 24 \\]. As a result, it has been reported that the anatomic location of the amyloid deposition within the tissue was consistent regardless of the location of the biopsy. This may have important implications for the biopsy technique used for the detection of amyloid \\[ 24 \\]. If intra-oral biopsies are used more commonly for patients with chronic periodontal disease, amyloid may be found more frequently than expected.\n\n【45】Our patient's differential diagnosis include pulmonary X-ray, pulmonary function tests, sputum cytology, fasting gastric juice and tuberculin skin testing, they were all negative for tuberculosis and bronchiectasis. His history, physical examination and laboratory findings were negative for rheumatoid arthritis and FMF patients (rheumatoid factor and MEFV gene mutation were negative, respectively). There was no evidence for chronic infection or inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and tuberculosis except chronic periodontitis. In addition, smoking is a strong risk factor for periodontitis \\[ 25 \\] and it certainly contributed to our patient's problems since he is a heavy smoker (more than 1-1.5 packs/day).\n\n【46】Secondary amyloidosis is also associated with malignant diseases such as Hodgkin's disease and mesothelioma. Clinical examination, abdominal and chest computed tomography were negative for any malignant disorders or airflow obstruction. With the decline of tuberculosis in the developed countries, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease remain the leading cause of secondary amyloidosis \\[ 12 \\]. However, in the developing countries, chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy are major causes \\[ 12 \\]. There was no clinical evidence for inflammatory bowel diseases or leprosy in our patient.\n\n【47】Although, our patient did not have any pulmonary system complaints, due to his habit of smoking, his pulmonary system was investigated extensively for disease that might trigger the secondary amyloidosis. All pulmonary function tests were normal except a mild emphysematous appearance on chest computed tomography. No bronchiectasis or obstruction was noted. So far, no secondary amyloidosis or increased inflammatory markers in patients with mild or moderate emphysema has been reported \\[ 26 \\].\n\n【48】A thorough investigation for the etiology that may cause secondary amyloidosis was carried out. None was identified except chronic periodontitis. Our patient developed reactive amyloidosis (AA-type), most likely secondary to his long-standing periodontitis. This could be attributed to the increase in the levels of systemic inflammatory mediators due to chronic periodontal disease/infection that led to the secondary amyloidosis. Indeed, patients with chronic periodontal diseases have higher levels of SAA protein in secondary amyloidosis than patients without periodontal disease \\[ 22 \\]. Chronic periodontal disease could exaggerate secondary amyloidosis via increased levels of systemic inflammatory mediators. In addition, our report highlights the possibility that amyloid deposition in patients with systemic amyloidosis causes accelerated periodontal destruction and bone loss of affected teeth. Amyloid deposition within the periodontium elicited an inflammatory reaction similar to that of foreign body material. Accelerated destruction of periodontium and associated supporting bone apparently is caused by this foreign-body-type giant cell reaction. Therefore, elimination of local infection associated with periodontal diseases will aid in the reduction of levels of systemic inflammatory mediators, which may slow the progression of secondary amyloidosis.\n\n【49】Sustained overproduction of SAA is a prerequisite for the development of AA amyloidosis, although the reasons for these remain unknown. Robbins \\[ 27 \\] proposed two possible explanations for this. First, SAA-protein is normally degraded to soluble end products via monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, individuals who develop amyloid have an enzyme defect that cannot breakdown SAA-protein completely hence insoluble AA molecules were produced. Second, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA-protein molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by monocytes. Evidence has suggested that individual genetic susceptibility to amyloidosis may influence the host's response to infection. Nibali _et al_ . \\[ 28 \\] have found the link between polymorphisms of genes encoding for neutrofil receptors and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in patients with aggressive periodontits. The authors then speculated that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome may be at the basis of a patient's susceptibility to aggressive periodontitis. Currently many investigators are trying to define the genotype-phenotype correlations and risk factors for the development of secondary amyloidosis.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【51】To our knowledge, this is the first case report that documents secondary amyloidosis supported by the tongue, buccal mucosa and retromolar trigon biopsies, while ruling out all possible known etiologic factors as a cause for secondary amyloidosis. In addition, this study has demonstrated that secondary amyloidosis can be slowed down if periodontal condition can be improved. Further studies in a larger population will provide insight of this rare but destructive systemic disease.\n\n【52】Consent\n-------\n\n【53】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

This benign tumor with excellent prognosis has no specific preoperative features that could justify a conservative management; a radical approach remains the therapeutic option for now.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Myxomas are rare benign soft tissue tumors. Renal myxomas are rare; very few cases have been reported in the English literature. There are no specific clinical and radiological features reported for this tumor that allow a preoperative diagnosis enabling a conservative treatment. We report a case of renal myxoma diagnosed after radical nephrectomy had been performed for a suspected malignant renal tumor. We present a computed tomography (CT) scan and the histopathological findings of the case.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 50-year-old Moroccan woman presented to our hospital for assessment of a right dull flank pain that had begun a year ago. She had a medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and was under calcium channel blocker and antidiabetic medication respectively.\n\n【12】A physical examination found no palpable mass in her abdomen but a slight right flank pain. All laboratory investigations were within normal limits. An abdominal CT scan objectified a hypodense well-defined mass in the mid-portion of her right kidney. It measured 4 × 3.5 cm and was slightly enhanced after intravenous contrast measuring 61 Hounsfield unit (HU; Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showing a slightly enhanced mass of the mid-portion of the kidney\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】She underwent radical nephrectomy for a suspected malignant renal tumor. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination:\n\n【18】*   A gross description of her right kidney measured 16 × 9 × 6 cm. A cut section showed a solid cystic gelatinous mass in the mid-portion of her kidney.\n    \n*   Microscopic examination revealed spindle cells with a hypervascular myxoid stroma with areas of hypercellularity. Moderate atypical cells with no mitosis were observed. No capsular invasion was found. Adjacent renal parenchyma had areas of chronic pyelonephritis (Figs. 2 , 3 ).\n    \n    **Fig. 2**\n    \n     \n    \n    A well-demarcated tumor.

She is well and asymptomatic at 3 months follow up.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Myxomas are rare benign soft tissue tumors that mainly occur in the heart and skin, although various anatomical locations have been described for this tumor \\[ 1 \\]. Renal myxomas are very rare; very few cases have been reported in the English literature. In 1887, Hulke reported “a large capsular myxoma of the kidney” \\[ 2 \\], which was the first reported case of renal myxoma \\[ 3 – 6 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, approximately 15 cases of renal myxoma have been reported since Hulke’s first reported case.\n\n【22】There are challenges with respect to its preoperative diagnosis as no specific clinical manifestation has been reported so far due to its rare occurrence, which limits its study. Documented cases of this tumor have shown nearly equal prevalence in males and females. Although the majority of reported cases of renal myxomas have been diagnosed incidentally, flank pain is the main clinical presentation in symptomatic patients for this tumor as in our case \\[ 7 \\]. Ultrasound can detect a renal mass but CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been promising in diagnosing and managing this disease \\[ 8 \\]. It usually has an appearance of a cystic solid mass highly suspicious for malignancy, which is similar to our case. This finding justified radical nephrectomy for almost all the cases, which was followed by histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of a pure renal myxoma as observed in our case. The availability of advanced imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), CT, or CT-guided biopsy, may help confirm the benign nature of this disease and differentiate it from other benign and malignant soft tissue tumors with very similar features. This will certainly justify conservative treatments for this tumor allowing the preservation of unaffected parenchyma in the remnant kidney \\[ 3 , 5 , 8 \\]. It is also encouraging to know that the prognosis of renal myxoma is excellent due to its benign nature. No case of recurrence has been reported so far \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【23】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【24】Myxomas of the kidney are very rare benign soft tissue tumors. Preoperative diagnosis of this disease allowing conservative treatment remains a challenge due to its very rare occurrence and its lack of specific clinical and radiological manifestations. Histopathological examination after radical nephrectomy remains the sure diagnostic tool for this disease. Advanced imaging modalities and investigations will probably help in diagnosing and managing this disease. This benign tumor has a good prognosis with no known recurrence.\n\n【25】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【26】CT:\n\n【27】Computed tomography\n\n【28】EMA:\n\n【29】Epithelial membrane antigen\n\n【30】HES:\n\n【31】Hematoxylin, erythrosine, and saffron\n\n【32】HU:\n\n【33】Hounsfield unit\n\n【34】PET:\n\n【35】Positron emission tomography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It can be seen in trisomy 9p where coexisting congenital heart disease additionally may complicate the therapeutic approach as illustrated in the current case report.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】At 20 months of age, a Caucasian girl with trisomy 9 and family history of an older brother and twin sister having the same syndrome displayed sign of congenital hydrocephalus due to increasing head circumference. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlarged lateral ventricles and a prominent choroid plexus, and the girl was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which 2 days later had to be replaced with a ventriculoatrial shunt as cerebrospinal fluid formation greatly exceeded the ability of the patient’s abdominal absorptive capability. At 16 years of age, the patient was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and diminished ejection fraction. Some months later, she was admitted to the neurosurgical ward showing signs of shunt dysfunction due to a colloid cyst in the third ventricle. Cystic drainage through endoscopic puncture only helped temporarily. Revision of the shunt system showed occlusion of the ventricular drain, and replacement was merely temporary alleviating. Intracerebral pressure was significantly increased at around 30 mmHg, prompting externalization of the drain, and measurements revealed high cerebrospinal fluid production of 60–100 ml liquor per hour. Thus, endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation was performed bilaterally leading to an immediate decrease of daily cerebrospinal fluid formation to 20–30 ml liquor per hour, and these values where stabilized by pharmaceutical treatment with acetazolamide 100 mg/kg/day and furosemide 1 mg/kg/day. Subsequently a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Follow-up after 1 and 2 months displayed no signs of hydrocephalus or ascites.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】High cerebrospinal fluid volume load and coexisting heart disease in children with trisomy 9p may call for endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation and pharmacological therapy to diminish the daily cerebrospinal fluid production to volumes that allow proper ventriculoperitoneal shunting.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】In children with trisomy 9p, congenital hydrocephalus due to choroid plexus hyperplasia is well documented alongside a variety of phenotypical manifestations including craniofacial dysmorphic features, growth retardation, mental retardation, hand and foot anomalies \\[ 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 16 \\], and congenital heart diseases including ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), hypoplastic left heart, and cardiomyopathy \\[ 3 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 16 \\].\n\n【10】Hydrocephalus is commonly treated by implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt). In patients with choroid plexus hyperplasia, however, the CSF production can exceed several liters a day, ultimately causing accumulation of CSF in the abdominal cavity and ascites \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Optional but rarely used treatment options such as ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, choroid plexus coagulation, and pharmacological treatment may thus be needed to control choroid plexus hyperplasia-derived hydrocephalus in trisomy 9p \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 15 , 16 \\]. However, the known risk of VA shunt-associated cardiovascular complications such as endocarditis, heart failure, intraatrial thrombus, and pulmonary hypertension may exclude this treatment modality in trisomy 9p patients with cooccurring congenital heart disease \\[ 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 16 \\], as illustrated by the current case report.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】We report the case of a Caucasian girl with trisomy 9p and family history of an older brother and twin sister having the same syndrome \\[ 1 \\]. The patient was born as twin A (birth weight 1800 g, length 45 cm) and showed dysmorphic features from birth including a large fontanel, low-hanging ears, and a bulbous nose (cf. Fig. 2C in Ref. \\[ 1 \\]). Clinodactyly, for example, short fifth fingers with only on flexion joint and palms with singular crease, was likewise noted \\[ 1 \\]. At birth, the head circumference was below average and like twin B.\n\n【13】At 20 months, her general practitioner discovered an acceleration in head circumference growth to two SD above average, compared with her twin sister (average for age). It was further noted that the girl was not able to walk independently yet, but apart from this there was no signs of neurological compromise, pain, or growth retardation. MRI of the brain showed enlarged lateral ventricles with a prominent choroid plexus (Fig. 1 ). At first, aqueduct stenosis was suspected, but this was later disproved by ventriculoscopy and ventriculography. Therefore, the patient was treated with a VP shunt at 2 years of age. On the second postoperative day, she showed signs of massive CSF accumulation into the abdominal cavity and fluid leakage through the abdominal cicatrices. Revision of the shunt showed no leakage and confirmed a functioning shunt system. The clinicians concluded that the CSF formation greatly exceeded the ability of the patient’s abdominal absorptive capability. Subsequently, the VP shunt was replaced with a VA shunt during the same admission.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】T1-weighted axial ( **a** ) and coronal ( **b** ) MRI images obtained at patient age 2 years, showing hydrocephalus due to enlarged lateral ventricles (LV) encompassing a prominent choroid plexus (\\*)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】At 6 years of age, the girl was now attending special classes due to slight psychomotor compromise, but she had language and independent ambulatory function. However, due to irregular episodes of headache and vomiting, hydrocephalus was suspected, resulting in an X-ray image showing displacement of the atrial part of the drain due to growth. Surgically prolongation of the drain was successfully performed, relieving the pressure symptoms.\n\n【19】At 14 years of age, irregular episodes of headache and vomiting reappeared. Shunt dysfunction was suspected, and cerebral MRI showed a large occipital cyst in contact with the right lateral ventricle. Operative fenestration was performed, successfully relieving the symptoms.\n\n【20】At 16 years of age, the patient was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing dilation of the left ventricle and diminished ejection fraction (EF, 49%). The TTE was performed because her twin sister had been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy several years before. Subsequent pharmacological treatment with ramipril was started.\n\n【21】Some months later, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ward showing signs of shunt dysfunction (that is, headache, vomiting, and tiredness). The neurological examination did not reveal any specific compromise, but subsequent ophthalmological examination (fundus photography) revealed papilledema, supporting the clinical suspicion of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). MRI of the brain was performed and showed a colloid cyst in the third ventricle, possibly occluding the foramen of Monro (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】T1-weighted axial MRI obtained at age 16 years, showing occlusion of the foramen of Monro by a colloid cyst (arrow) and a cystic enlargement of the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. \\* = lateral ventricle\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Cystic drainage through endoscopic puncture only helped temporarily. Revision of the shunt system showed occlusion of the ventricular drain, and replacement was likewise only temporary alleviating as the symptoms of headache, vomiting, and tiredness reappeared within 24 hours. Accordingly, the ICP was monitored by placement of an intracranial ICP monitor and found to be significantly increased at around 30 mmHg, prompting externalization of the drain and measurements of CSF production. Externalization of the drain relieved all clinical symptoms, but measurements revealed high CSF production of 60–100 ml liquor per hour. Endoscopic visualization showed that the choroid plexus was enlarged, hypertrophic, and well vascularized. Choroid plexus coagulation was performed bilaterally in the lateral and temporal horn of the ventricles, leading to an immediate decrease of daily CSF formation to 20–30 ml liquor per hour. Pharmaceutical treatment with acetazolamide 100 mg/kg/day and furosemide 1 mg/kg/day \\[ 12 \\] diminished daily CSF production to approximately 300 ml. Subsequently a VP shunt (DeltaSnap 1.0) was placed, and the remaining admission was uneventful.\n\n【27】Follow-up after 1 and 2 months displayed no signs of hydrocephalus or ascites. No complications or neurological deficits were found. At a regular follow-up 10 months later, it was noted that the girl trived and was more active and less tired in school and at home.\n\n【28】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【29】Hydrocephalus can be considered as a condition caused by disordered CSF homeostasis that results in expansion of the cerebral ventricles \\[ 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. It may accordingly arise from an increase in CSF secretion and/or an obstruction of flow in the ventricular–subarachnoid pathway, and/or a decrease in drainage to the venous system \\[ 2 \\]. However, although the choroid plexus with a secretory rate of 0.4 ml minute <sup>−1 </sup> g tissue <sup>−1 </sup> is among the most efficient secretory tissues in our body and only paralleled by the cells of the renal proximal tubule and pancreatic ducts, one rarely encounters hydrocephalus caused by CSF hypersecretion \\[ 2 , 4 , 5 \\]. CSF hypersecretion can be caused by secreting choroid plexus neoplasms (papilloma or carcinoma), which account for 0.4–0.6% of all intracranial neoplasms, or by choroid plexus hyperplasia, where the number of normal productive epithelial cells is increased \\[ 4 \\]. To date, hydrocephalus caused by choroid plexus hyperplasia has been described in fewer than 30 patients \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 \\]. Ten of these patients have been cytogenetically characterized, revealing five with trisomy 9p and four with tetrasomy 9p \\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 \\]. Similarly gain of 9p has been demonstrated in 45% of hypersecretive choroid plexus tumors \\[ 12 \\], indicating that genetic material on the short arm of chromosome 9 may be important for choroid plexus growth and secretion \\[ 1 , 12 \\]. However, note that, among the 200 known reported cases of 9p tri- or tetrasomy, only 10 cases of choroid plexus hyperplasia have been described \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 \\], whereas cases with corpus callosum anomalies and Dandy–Walker malformation causing obstructive hydrocephalus are seen more commonly \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【30】Treatment of congenital hydrocephalus due to choroid plexus hyperplasia in patients with tri- and tetrasomy 9p is complicated by the resulting CSF volume load, which may reach a daily volume of between 2000 and 5000 ml \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 \\]. Such volumes can rarely be absorbed by the peritoneal cavity, and traditional VP shunting in these patients will therefore result in abdominal ascites necessitating either choroid plexus plexectomy/coagulation and/or placement of a VA shunt \\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 \\]. Plexectomy or endoscopic plexus coagulation can be curative, although it is stated in the case review by Hallaert _et al._ (2012) that, among 16 treated patients, 11 remained in need of a shunt after the procedure \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【31】The recent case report by Kasper _et al._ (2020) confirms the difficulties in the treatment of trisomy 9p associated with CSF hypersecretion, and the authors advocate placement of a VA shunt in this condition \\[ 7 \\]. It is, however, estimated that 40–60% of the 9p tri- and tetrasomy cohort have coexisting heart disease \\[ 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 15 \\]. Placement of a VA shunt in these patients, as secondarily performed in our case \\[ 1 \\], may accordingly be less optimal, necessitating VA shunt removal and subsequent choroid plexus coagulation and/or pharmacological therapy with acetazolamide and furosemide to diminish daily CSF production to volumes that allow proper VP shunting \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 15 \\].\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Access to further information can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.\n\n【34】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【35】CSF:\n\n【36】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【37】EF:\n\n【38】Ejection fraction\n\n【39】ICP:\n\n【40】Intracranial pressure\n\n【41】LV:\n\n【42】Lateral ventricle\n\n【43】MRI:\n\n【44】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【45】SD:\n\n【46】Standard deviation\n\n【47】TTE:\n\n【48】Transthoracic echocardiography\n\n【49】VA:\n\n【50】Ventriculoatrial\n\n【51】VP:\n\n【52】Ventriculoperitoneal", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Favorable outcomes can be achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Cervical disc herniation is generally caused by degeneration of the cervical vertebrae. Symptomatic cervical disc herniation is a common cause of radiculopathy, and there is a clear peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades \\[ 1 \\]. Because disc degeneration advances with age, the development of a symptomatic herniated cervical disc before the age of 20 is extremely rare. All of the sporadically reported cases with cervical disc herniation before the age of 20 had underlying disease, such as Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) \\[ 2 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, symptomatic cervical disc herniation occurring in teenaged patients without underlying disease has not been previously reported in the English literature. We report herein two cases of symptomatic cervical disc herniation with no trauma or underlying disease in teenaged patients.\n\n【11】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A 19-year-old Asian man was experiencing pain in his upper left scapula. One week after the onset of the pain, he had difficulty lifting his left arm and visited our clinic. The pain radiated from the left side of his neck through the scapular region with neck extension, and was controlled with analgesic medication. He had no relevant family history, such as congenital spine abnormalities, and had no past history of trauma or birth injuries. Neurological examination showed weakness of the left deltoid and biceps brachii muscles (power, 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 5, respectively), decreased sensation of his left lateral upper arm, and a hypotonic left biceps tendon reflex. The Spurling test, which is positive if the patient produces symptoms when the patient laterally flexes and extends the neck with the examiner applying axial pressure on the spine, was positive on the left side. Cervical radiculopathy score, an assessment system proposed by Tanaka evaluating pain, disability, and neurological status on a 20-point scale, with 20 being no pain, disability, and neurological findings, was 5 out of 20 \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【14】Plain radiography was normal with no evidence of degeneration or calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a herniated intervertebral disc in the left C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (Figure 1 a, b). C5 radiculopathy by soft disc herniation at C4-C5 was diagnosed.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**Case 1.** Left parasagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the cervical spine **(a)** and axial T1-weighted MRI scan at the C4-C5 level **(b)** showing a herniated intervertebral disc in the left C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (arrows).\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Initial management consisted of pharmacologic pain control, relative rest, and a hard cervical collar worn in a position to maximize arm pain reduction. Mechanical traction was not applied. However, since there were no signs of improvement in muscle weakness despite conservative treatment for two weeks following admission, microsurgical posterior foraminotomy was performed \\[ 4 \\]. The patient’s pain and motor strength improved gradually after surgery. The patient had recovered completely eight weeks after the surgery. Cervical radiculopathy score was 19 at the final follow-up three years after surgery.\n\n【20】### Case 2\n\n【21】A 15-year-old Asian man experienced sudden neck pain on the right side and had difficulty lifting his right arm when he woke up one morning. The symptoms continued for two weeks and he presented to our clinic. His neck pain increased with neck extension. He had no relevant family or past history that included congenital abnormality or trauma. Neurological examination showed weakness of the right deltoid and biceps brachii muscles (power, 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 5, respectively), and a hypotonic right biceps tendon reflex. No obvious sensory loss was present. Cervical radiculopathy score was 13 out of 20. Plain radiography showed no abnormality. An MRI scan demonstrated a herniated intervertebral disc in the right C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (Figure 2 a, b). The herniated disc showed partial contrast enhancement after administration of Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (Figure 2 c).\n\n【22】**Figure 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Case 2.** Right parasagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the cervical spine **(a)** and axial T1-weighted MRI scan at the C4-C5 level **(b)** showing a herniated intervertebral disc in the right C4-C5 intervertebral foramen (arrows). The herniated disc is partially enhanced after contrast medium **(c)** (arrow).\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Since the muscle weakness improved within the first week after admission, the patient was treated conservatively and put under observation only. Muscle strength had recovered to 4 by the third week, and after eight weeks, the patient had completely recovered. Cervical radiculopathy score was 20 at the final follow-up of two years.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Cervical disc herniation, a well-known cause of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy, is more common in men and often occurs in those 40 to 60 years of age, with an average age of around 50 years. C5-C6 is frequently involved in the case of cervical myelopathy, whereas C6-C7 is more common in radiculopathy \\[ 5 \\]. In both cases presented, C4-C5 was the affected level, with deltoid muscle strength of 2 and difficulty in arm lifting (using the positive drop-arm sign). Since C4-C5 is the level with the greatest rotation and lateral flexion movement among the middle and lower cervical vertebrae \\[ 6 \\], and since mobility of the cervical vertebrae tends to decrease with advancing age \\[ 7 \\], it is possible that this level was affected due to the tendency for C4-C5 to be vulnerable to loading in young people with no degeneration.\n\n【29】There have been scattered reports of cervical disc herniation occurring in young people \\[ 2 , 8 , 9 \\]. However, all of the previously reported cases had underlying disease, that is, a complication of intervertebral disc calcification or KFS \\[ 2 \\]. Samartzis _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] reported a 16-year-old KFS boy with occipitalization of C1 and fusion of C2-C3, and C4-T1 showed cervical disc herniation at his hypermobile segment of C3-C4. In an extensive search of the literature, there were no reports of symptomatic cervical disc herniation occurring in teenaged patients without underlying disease. In this regard, the two cases presented here are extremely rare.\n\n【30】In general, cervical disc herniation responds well to conservative treatment. Saal _et al_ . reported that herniated cervical disc with radiculopathy was successfully managed in 93% of the patients with nonoperative management, including relative rest, cervical collar, analgesic medicine, traction, and physical training \\[ 10 \\]. The authors described that no patients had progressive neurological loss or reached a neurological catastrophe. However, the timing of the surgical intervention for the patient with motor deficit is still unclear. The patient in Case 1 underwent surgical decompression because there were no signs of improvement in motor and sensory function after two weeks of conservative treatment. Posterior decompression was selected rather than ventral decompression and fusion. The advantages of foraminotomy are to preserve the motion segment and to minimize the future risk of adjacent segment disorder for this younger age. Another advantage is to reduce the period of postoperative management in contrast with the latter procedure.\n\n【31】Cervical disc herniation is known to resolve spontaneously in the same way as lumbar disc herniation \\[ 11 \\]. In Case 2, the herniation was enhanced on an MRI scan after Gd-DTPA administration, indicating that spontaneous resolution could be anticipated, and muscle strength improved within a week after admission. Therefore, surgery was not indicated, and a favorable outcome was obtained with conservative treatment.\n\n【32】In both cases, a favorable outcome was achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation, but differences in pathology compared with the common middle-aged onset of this disorder remain a question for future investigation.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】Although extremely rare, symptomatic cervical disc herniations may occur even in the younger population under the age of 20 without any trauma or underlying disease. Favorable outcomes can be achieved by conventional treatments for cervical disc herniation.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Case 1: Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Clinicians should consider the potential for glomus tumors when patients exhibit unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy with pain.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Glomus tumors are soft tissue neoplasms comprised of glomus cells, vasculature, and smooth muscle cells. These tumors commonly occur in a single subungual area of the digits, and their main clinical features include severe paroxysmal pain, localized tenderness, and cold hypersensitivity \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Of patients with single extradigital glomus tumors, 41% were observed in the lower extremities \\[ 2 \\]. Further, 10% of patients with glomus tumors had multiple tumors, more than 50% of whom had a family history, and in most cases an extremity was involved \\[ 3 \\]. Herein, we present a sporadic patient with multiple glomus tumors showing unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 47-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital presenting with progressive excruciating pain and atrophy in his right leg. He had no family history of pain or amyotrophy. Since childhood he had noticed a sharp tingling sensation from his right ankle to the lateral thigh when he tapped his right lateral malleolus. Walking for long periods often induced languor and pain in the rear side of his right lower extremity. During his teenage years he also experienced an occasional localized sharp shooting pain in his right lower extremity when walking. Both the frequency of paroxysmal severe pain and the number of trigger points gradually increased with age. Although he consulted with various medical institutions, the cause of pain was undiagnosed. He started to take pain relievers at 41 years old. His right lower limb gradually atrophied during his clinical course, while there was no change in his skin color, swelling, or feeling of heat in the affected limb.\n\n【12】His daily medicines at hospitalization were tramadol hydrochloride (75 mg), acetaminophen (650 mg), pregabalin (150 mg), duloxetine hydrochloride (40 mg), eperisone hydrochloride (150 mg), and clonazepam (0.5 mg). He also took pilsicainide hydrochloride hydrate (50 mg) and carteolol hydrochloride (5 mg) during episodes of pathological tachycardia caused by severe leg pain. At neurological examination his pupils were dilated and were slow to light stimulation. The convergence reflex was intact. Ptosis was not observed. Examination of other cranial nerves identified no abnormalities. His cerebellar function was normal. Diffuse muscle atrophy in the right lower extremity (Fig. 1 a) and contracture of the right Achilles tendon were observed. However, the reflex of the right Achilles tendon was not examined because of unbearable pain. Other deep tendon reflexes were normal except for a slightly brisk bilateral patellar tendon reflex. Pathological reflexes were not found. His superficial and deep sensations were both normal.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Muscular atrophy of the patient’s right leg. **a** Photograph. **b** Computed tomography (CT)\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The patient had four points of highly localized tenderness and sensitivity to cold or pressure. The first was the right lateral aspect of his lower leg (7 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus), which appeared during junior high school. The second was the distal portion of his right lateral Achilles tendon, which appeared during high school. The third was the right dorsal aspect of his lower leg (11 cm distal to the right head of the peroneal bone), which appeared at 23 years old. The fourth was his right popliteal fossa, which appeared at 42 years old. He experienced continuous mild tingling at and around these tender points. During walking he maintained an ankle dorsiflex posture of his right limb, and landed with the outside of his sole.\n\n【18】His serum creatine kinase was 59 U/L (male normal range, 59−248 U/L). Nerve conduction studies (including F-wave) were normal in the bilateral tibial and peroneal nerves, while the compound muscle action potential amplitudes were lower in the right tibial and peroneal nerves compared with the left. Sensory nerve action potential amplitude and sensory conduction velocity were normal in both sural nerves. Needle electromyography showed no abnormalities in the right tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, or left rectus femoris muscles. Computed tomography of his lower extremity demonstrated right leg atrophy (Fig. 1 b). Magnetic resonance imaging of his right lower leg showed multiple gadolinium-enhanced nodules (Fig. 2 ). The patient underwent excisional biopsy for two lesions (Fig. 2 a). On pathological examination, the tumor cells were positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for desmin (Fig. 3 ), indicating glomus tumors \\[ 1 \\]. After surgical excision he could walk with his right sole touching the ground, and his bilateral mydriasis had fully recovered at discharge.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Sagittal gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient’s right lower leg. **a** Two enhanced nodules were found near the ankle joint.

Scale bars, 100 µm\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】The three main features of our case were: (i) a gradually progressive, paroxysmal, and localized shooting pain caused by glomus tumors, which was improved by surgical resection, (ii) unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy, and (iii) bilateral mydriasis. The first feature was compatible with the typical clinical course of glomus tumors \\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Several reports have also described unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy associated with glomus tumors \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\], although there are limited neurological findings. The unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy associated with glomus tumors may relate to peripheral nerve damage \\[ 4 \\]. Alternatively, the involved extremity may have a vasomotor disturbance due to long-standing pain, as observed in complex regional pain syndrome \\[ 8 \\]. Further, avoiding use of the involved extremity may cause atrophy of disuse. In our case, needle electromyography for checking the possibility of myopathy and motor neuron disease revealed no pathological neurogenic or myogenic changes despite progressive limb atrophy associated with chronic (approximately 40 years) right lower limb pain. Thus, disuse atrophy may have caused the unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy in our patient. To our knowledge, this case has the longest reported disease duration until diagnosis. This is likely related to the small tumor size and the deep tissue location, and may explain his unilateral whole leg atrophy. We propose two possibilities for the bilateral mydriasis observed at admission. First, the patient was in the prodromal stage of serotonin syndrome because of his chronic tramadol hydrochloride and duloxetine treatment. Second, the patient may have experienced sympathicotonia caused by chronic severe pain.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】Clinicians should consider the possibility of multiple cryptogenic glomus tumors when patients complain of unilateral lower limb muscular atrophy accompanied with paroxysmal lightening pain.\n\n【31】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】The datasets used in the current study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report a rare case of giant prolactinoma with a first epileptic seizure due to rapid reduction of the tumor as a complication of dopamine agonist therapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our institution with a history of visual disturbance for 1 year and general fatigue for 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor that arose from the pituitary and extended to the bilateral anterior skull base, the clivus, and the cavernous sinus, with compression of the optic chiasm and the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. On the basis of the patient’s serum concentration of prolactin, we diagnosed a prolactinoma and started dopamine agonist therapy with cabergoline. The patient had a general seizure immediately after starting dopamine agonist therapy and required general anesthetic treatment following the rapid reduction of the tumor. We speculated that the rapid reduction of the tumor resulted in the retraction of the surrounding brain structure, and the epileptic seizure was then induced by dopamine agonist therapy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We report a rare case of giant prolactinoma with a first epileptic seizure immediately after the initiation of dopamine agonist therapy. Clinicians need to be aware that the rapid reduction of a giant prolactinoma by dopamine agonist therapy may cause an epileptic seizure.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenomas (PRLomas) are the most common pituitary secreting tumors, accounting for 32–45% of all pituitary tumors \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Micro-PRLomas are more common in females, whereas macro-PRLomas are more common in males \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Although there is no consensus on the definition of giant PRLomas, some studies have defined giant PRLoma as measuring more than 4 cm \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In addition to pituitary hormone abnormalities, giant PRLomas cause several symptoms, such as visual field defects by compression of the optic chiasm, cranial nerve palsies by extension into the cavernous sinus, obstructive hydrocephalus, epilepsy by temporal lobe extension, and dementia by frontal lobe extension.\n\n【10】Dopamine agonist (DA) therapy is the standard treatment for PRLoma. In previous reports, DA therapy was the first-line medical treatment even for giant PRLomas, because normalization of PRL and significant tumor shrinkage were achieved in the majority of cases \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The most common side effects of DA therapy are headache, nausea and vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, and depression. Attention also needs to be paid to rare complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea \\[ 6 , 7 \\] and optic chiasm herniation \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. However, medical treatment for PRLomas has not been known to cause seizure attacks as a side effect of DA therapy. In this article, we present a rare case of a patient with epileptic seizures immediately after the initiation of DA therapy with cabergoline (CAB). We review the previous literature and suggest the mechanism of this complication.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 27-year-old Japanese man with mild mental developmental retardation presented with a 1-year history of bilateral visual impairment as well as a 3-month gradually progressive general fatigue. He had no history of epileptic seizures. Neurological examination revealed blindness of the left eye, half-blindness of the right eye on the ear side, and cognitive dysfunction according to the Mini Mental State Examination 21/30. Fundus examination revealed no papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 77 × 63 × 85-mm tumor that arose from the pituitary and extended bilaterally through the anterior skull base, the clivus, and the cavernous sinus, with compression of the optic chiasm and the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes (Figs. 1 and 3 a–c). The patient was administered antiepileptics, such as 1000 mg/day levetiracetam, for prevention of seizure attack. His hormone profile showed hyperprolactinemia 25,270.0 ng/ml (3.6–12.8 ng/ml) and dysfunction of the other pituitary hormones (testosterone, < 0.04 ng/ml \\[1.3–8.7 ng/ml\\]; follicle-stimulating hormone, 0.54 mIU/ml \\[2.0–8.3 mIU/ml\\]; luteinizing hormone, < 0.10 mIU/ml \\[0.79–5.7 mIU/ml\\]; thyroid-stimulating hormone, 4.94 μIU/ml \\[0.5–5.0 μIU/ml\\]; free thyroxine 4, 0.6 ng/dl \\[0.9–1.7 ng/dl\\]; growth hormone, 0.22 ng/ml \\[0.0–2.5 ng/ml\\]; and adrenocorticotropic hormone, 1.7 pg/ml \\[7.2–63.3 pg/ml\\]) (Table 1 ). The patient received a diagnosis of a giant PRLoma with hypopituitarism. We started DA therapy with CAB 0.25 mg once per week, supplemented by daily oral hydrocortisone.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images before the initiation of dopamine agonist therapy. **a** Sagittal view. **b** and **c** Axial images.

Incubation and general anesthetic therapy were required. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. An electroencephalographic examination was continuously performed; however, no findings of epileptic changes were found after general anesthesia. There was no abnormality in the laboratory analysis that may have led to status epilepticus. The patient’s blood level of PRL markedly decreased from 25,270.0 to 948.2 ng/ml. MRI revealed significant reduction of the tumor in a short period without pituitary apoplexy, including hemorrhagic or ischemic change (Figs. 2 and 3 c, e, f). According to the significant reduction of the tumor, the bilateral mesial temporal lobes returned to medial position. Further, a hyperintense area in left frontal lobe appeared on T2 -weighted images (Fig. 3 ). Because of the possibility that the epileptic seizures were induced by the rapid shrinkage of the tumor, we suspended DA therapy until the seizures were under control with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam 2000 mg/day. General anesthetic therapy was required for the control of seizures for 2 weeks. After 4 weeks, we resumed DA therapy with extremely low doses of CAB. Both the level of PRL and the tumor size were gradually reduced without further seizures. The patient was able to return to daily life with medication of antiepileptics and oral hydrocortisone and levothyroxine.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images after dopamine agonist (DA) therapy. **a** Sagittal view. **b** and **c** Axial images.

The aim of the treatment of giant PRLomas is rapid improvement of neurologic symptoms, such as visual disorders, increased intracranial pressure, and palsies of the cranial nerves. The treatment is required to reduce the size of the tumor remarkably. There are several therapeutic approaches, including DA therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and combinations of these therapies. We chose DA therapy alone in our patient’s case for two reasons: (1) According to previous reports, DA is the first-line medical treatment even for giant PRLomas, and (2) surgical resection may cause severe complications in important surrounding structures \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. CAB has emerged as a drug for DA therapy owing to its excellent efficacy and safety. Headache, nausea and vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, depression, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea are known as common side effects of DA therapy \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. However, a small proportion of patients have rare complications, including herniation of the optic chiasm, each cerebral lobe, and the brainstem \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Moles Herbera _et al_ . reported a giant PRLoma showing pons herniation into the skull base caused by tumor shrinkage after DA therapy \\[ 11 \\]. In addition, some authors reported cases of frontal lobe herniation as a rare complication of DA therapy (Table 2 ) \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 \\].\n\n【30】**Table 2 Reported cases of complication of dopamine agonist therapy for prolactinoma**\n\n【31】Full size table\n\n【32】According to the package insert of CAB, neurologic and psychiatric side effects were somnolence, aggression, and psychotic behavior. An increase in the risk of epilepsy has not been known as a side effect of CAB. Most previous reports of PRLoma described epileptic seizures as initial symptoms before treatment. Deepak _et al._ reported that epilepsy often occurred in patients with invasive macro-PRLomas and that DA therapy could reduce the frequency of seizures and the doses of antiepileptic drugs \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【33】In our patient, however, epileptic seizures occurred immediately after DA therapy for giant PRLoma without a previous history of seizures. The mechanism of the epileptic seizure in our patient is speculative and might be multifocal. On the basis of his clinical course, we concluded that the rapid reduction of the tumor by DA therapy, resulting in retraction of brain matter, especially the temporal lobe around the tumor, could have been the mechanism of the epileptic seizures. This mechanism is a known cause of brain herniation with DA therapy for giant PRLomas \\[ 8 , 9 , 11 \\]. The appearance of a hyperintense area in left frontal lobe on T2-weighted images may support our hypothesis of the pathogenic mechanisms of the epileptic seizure in our patient. Clinicians should be aware that DA therapy for PRLoma which is effective therapy, can induce epileptic seizures. Furthermore, medical therapies and chemotherapies with excellent efficacy for brain tumors, such as germinomas, may be a risk factor for epileptic seizure as a side effect following rapid reduction of the tumor, similarly to DA therapy for PRLoma.\n\n【34】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【35】We report a rare case of a patient with giant PRLoma with epileptic seizures immediately after the initiation of DA therapy with CAB. It is possible that rapid tumor reduction induces epileptic seizures by the same mechanism as brain herniation. Even if there is no history of epilepsy, clinicians need to be aware of epileptic seizures during DA therapy for giant PRLomas.\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】ACTH:\n\n【38】Adrenocorticotropic hormone\n\n【39】CAB:\n\n【40】Cabergoline\n\n【41】DA:\n\n【42】Dopamine agonist\n\n【43】FSH:\n\n【44】Follicle-stimulating hormone\n\n【45】fT4:\n\n【46】Free thyroxine\n\n【47】GH:\n\n【48】Growth hormone\n\n【49】LH:\n\n【50】Luteinizing hormone\n\n【51】MRI:\n\n【52】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【53】PRL:\n\n【54】Prolactin\n\n【55】PRLoma:\n\n【56】Prolactinoma\n\n【57】T2WI:\n\n【58】T2-weighted images", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Aside from its therapeutic benefits, cannabis exhibits many adverse effects, including impaired judgement. With heavy use, paranoia and psychosis may be expected \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Male genital self-mutilation from psychiatric disorder or substance-induced psychosis have been reported, however, the exact prevalence of these conditions is unknown. Some reports state about hundred cases within the past two decades \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. However, self-amputation of penis in cannabis-induced psychosis has rarely been reported \\[ 6 \\]. In this case report, we highlight a psychotic condition induced by recreational cannabis use, leading to penile self-amputation in a different manner.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 23-year-old Thai man, who reported cannabis use for 2 years and discontinued for 3 months, restarted smoking two bongs (2 g equivalence) of cannabis. Besides cannabis, he reported drinking five cups of coffee per day. He denied depressed mood or manic symptoms, alcohol consumption, other substance abuse, or previous self-harm. He denied any underlying disease, previous psychiatric treatment, nor a family history of psychiatric condition. Two hours later, he had a penile erection without sexual stimulation, felt a severe persistent sharp pain in his penis, and reported that his glans looked distorted. Intending to eradicate the pain, without command hallucination, he decided to trim the penile skin several times and completely amputated his penis himself using scissors. He reported awareness throughout the process. After 2 hours, the bleeding had not stopped. He was brought to a primary care hospital, where he was given intravenous cloxacillin, tetanus prophylaxis, and referred to our emergency department. On arrival, he was hemodynamically stable and cooperative. There was active bleeding at the penile base and a 5-cm lacerated wound at the scrotum. The remaining penile stump was 2 cm in length with loss of the whole penile skin. The amputated distal part of the penis was contaminated with ants and had fragile dorsal veins (Fig. 1 ). Urine immunoassay was positive for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ <sup>9 </sup> \\-THC).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**A** The remaining penile stump. **B** The amputated distal penis. _DP_ amputated distal penis, _PS_ penile stump, _PK_ penile skin, _SC_ scrotum\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】A urologist was consulted for surgical intervention. The distal penis was deemed too dirty and fragile for reconstruction. The patient was transferred to the operating theater for emergency surgery. Bleeding was controlled, the penile stump irrigated and debrided, and scrotal urethrostomy was performed. He was admitted to the surgical ward. A psychiatrist diagnosed the patient with substance-induced psychotic disorder. His mental status examinations found he had visual and auditory hallucinations, such as seeing moving shadows, hearing birds chirping or insects buzzing, depressed mood, and restricted affect. He was coherent and delusional, with no suicidal ideas. Supportive psychotherapy and 2 mg/day of risperidone were initiated. After admission and cannabis discontinuation, his delusions and hallucinations subsided. He stayed in the hospital for 14 days. The dosage of risperidone was adjusted to 6 mg/day at discharge. The brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) showed a score of 28 before treatment compared with a score of 18 after treatment. After 2 weeks, the patient was able to void in a sitting position, without wound infection. He denied visual or auditory hallucinations. Second stage penoplasty with a scrotal flap was planned, however, the patient was not available for follow-up and further management as he had relocated.\n\n【17】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【18】In this patient, the diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder could be made as his symptoms began after cannabis use, without evidence of other substance abuse, and his urine immunoassay was positive for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ <sup>9 </sup> \\-THC), as well as from the resolution of psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks after abstinence \\[ 7 \\]. To date, the 2019 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported that patients using cannabinoids and analogues account for 0.8% of fatalities among all substance-exposed fatalities \\[ 8 \\]. The Oregon/Alaska Poison Center also reported that routes of cannabis exposure were ingestion (73.9%), inhalation (22.5%), topical/parenteral/rectal (0.8%), and unknown/other (2.8%) between 2015 and 2017. Most of the patients were male, and two-thirds among the overall age group were intentional use \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【19】Cannabis use was reported to increase the risk of psychosis, loss of insight, and thought disorder leading to unexpected behavior, including in patients with no previous psychiatric disorders, as seen in our patient \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. The severity of psychosis depends on the amount of THC \\[ 13 \\]. THC, consumed by smoking cannabis, is one of the primary cannabinoids producing psychoactive effects through the dopaminergic pathway \\[ 14 \\]. Over time, the concentration of THC in illegal cannabis samples has increased from less than 4% to more than 12%, suggesting a need for stricter regulation as a higher THC concentration is associated with more adverse effects \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【20】Self-amputation of the penis due to cannabis-induced psychosis, as in our patient, is a devastating event that interferes with the quality of life, such as urination dysfunction or sexual function. Although psychosis is a manifestation in cannabis users, the method of self-amputation of the penis in cannabis-induced psychosis varies. Khan _et al._ reported a case of self-amputation of the penis in a patient with cannabis-induced psychosis whose penis was chopped off by a sharp object \\[ 6 \\]. On the other hand, in our patient, the penile skin was trimmed several times and then completely amputated using scissors. Several times of trimming rather than stopping after the first trimming indicated the calm self-harm and persistence due to psychosis. After self-amputation in our patient who denied previous personal hygiene neglect and antisocial behavior, the amputated distal part of the penis was contaminated with ants. Although self-neglect is a finding in some substances such as methamphetamine \\[ 15 \\], we could not determine if discarding of the amputated part of his penis was related to a cannabinoid effect leading to self-neglect or his intention to eradicate the origin of pain at the penis.\n\n【21】From our patient’s history of penile erection with persistent sharp pain, priapism could also be suspected in our patient. Priapism is a condition where the penis remains erect for at least 4 hours, without sexual stimulation \\[ 16 \\]. However, our patient’s condition did not fulfill priapism diagnostic criteria because the penis was cut off before the erection exceeded 4 hours. Sickle cell disease as a priapism risk factor is a rare disease in our patient population, and his blood investigations did not demonstrate anemia \\[ 17 \\]. Although there are some previous case reports about cannabis use and priapism, the reported patients used cannabis combined with other substances. Evans _et al._ reported concurrent cannabis, steroid, and cocaine use in an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patient \\[ 18 \\]. Tran _et al._ reported a patient with priapism after use cannabis and ecstasy. It could be the interaction between cannabis and ecstasy via ecstasy stimulating dopamine release in the brain. Synergistic interactions between ecstasy and cannabis might be possible \\[ 19 \\]. In an animal model, dopamine receptor agonist increases central oxytocinergic neurotransmission and facilitates penile erection \\[ 20 \\]. Therefore, cannabinoid use promoting dopaminergic pathway might play a role in penile erection \\[ 19 \\]. Moreover, cannabinoids block the thoracolumbar sympathetic pathway, which could result in the penis being unable to detumescence and increasing the risk of priapism \\[ 17 , 21 \\]. THC interacts with a cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system, and vasculature. Consequently, cannabinoids might potentiate vascular effects and lead to penile erection and priapism \\[ 17 , 19 \\]. Although SR 141716A is a CB1 receptor antagonist, it increases the glutamic acid and also activates the oxytocinergic neurons, leading to penile erection in the rat model \\[ 22 \\]. Recently, a previous case report suggested a relationship between cannabis use alone and priapism. However, the patient smoked cannabis for the previous 6 months and no self-harm or psychosis occurred \\[ 17 \\]. Although priapism is a painful event, self-amputation is rare in a patient with normal judgement. Thus, self-harm of our patient could be the effect of psychosis.\n\n【22】Acute cannabis exposure has been shown to have the following effects: CNS excitation (38.3%), CNS depression (24.4%), cardiac problems (14.6%), nausea and vomiting (9.5%), unusual/unexpected subjective sensation (strange, weird, bizarre) (3.6%), abdominal pain (2.4%), and psychosis (1.6%) \\[ 9 \\]. Our patient also felt a severe persistent sharp pain in the penis after cannabis exposure. It might be an unusual/unexpected subjective sensation from the cannabis effect. However, we could not conclude that our patient’s sharp pain was because of priapism or an unusual/unexpected subjective sensation from cannabis exposure.\n\n【23】In summary, cannabis-induced psychosis is an adverse effect of cannabis, which may lead to impaired judgement and unexpected self-harm. A multidisciplinary team approach, including a primary care physician, an emergency physician, a urologist, and a psychiatrist, is essential when dealing with a patient with cannabis-induced psychosis and a urogenital injury.\n\n【24】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\n\n【26】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【27】BPRS:\n\n【28】Brief psychiatric rating scale\n\n【29】CB1 receptor:\n\n【30】Cannabinoid type 1 receptor\n\n【31】CNS:\n\n【32】Central nervous system\n\n【33】ED:\n\n【34】Emergency department\n\n【35】THC:\n\n【36】Tetrahydrocannabinol", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Activating mutations of beta-cell adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium \\[KATP\\] channel subunits that cause opening of the channel are associated with PNDM. Some patients with PNDM respond to administration of a sulfonylurea derivative, which has long action on blood glucose even during hypoglycemia and has an apoptotic effect on beta cells. However, there have been no reports regarding treatment with meglitinide (repaglinide), which has rapid and short duration of action during the rise in blood glucose after meals that is more similar to beta cell function. It has no effects during hypoglycemia, so it does not cause neurological damage, and has no apoptotic effect on beta cells. We report herein the effects of repaglinide administration in the management and clinical outcome of two patients with PNDM during 9 and 10 years of follow-up.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Two Iranian infants were brought to our institution with poor general condition, dehydration, lethargy, and poor feeding. They had diabetic ketoacidosis at 52 days and 3.5 months of age, respectively. Their genetic analysis revealed mutations in the _KCNJ11_ gene encoding KIR6.2, so they both had PNDM. After treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin, they responded to sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) treatment, but were switched to repaglinide because of blood sugar fluctuations in terms of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Repaglinide was administered with the dosage of 0.04 mg/kg/day divided before every meal.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The patients were 10 and 9 years old at the last visit, with normal growth parameters. The values of self-monitored blood glucose were well-controlled, and the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels ranged from 3.6 to 6.4% during the follow-up period. There was no complication of diabetes, neurological disorder, or adverse effects related to repaglinide.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In every neonate or infant < 6 months of age with diabetes mellitus, PNDM should be considered. A trial of oral repaglinide can be performed and substituted for glibenclamide for prevention of hypoglycemia, neurological damage, and apoptosis of beta cells during long-term administration.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】Diabetes is generally divided into different categories, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is caused by autoimmune-mediated beta cell destruction; diabetes related to pancreatic injury; and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with insulin resistance as the main cause of the disease and with a genetic background \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Genetic defects of beta cell function cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which has 10 types and is characterized by onset before 25 years of age, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and occurrence in three consecutive generations. Mutations in various genes including _HNF4A_ and _GCK_ are responsible for different types of MODY \\[ 3 \\]. Mitochondrial gene defects cause maternally inherited diabetes and deafness—for example, Wolfram syndrome 1, which is characterized by DM, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and optic atrophy, and Wolfram syndrome 2, consisting of optic atrophy, DM, and deafness, but no diabetes insipidus \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【12】Neonatal diabetes mellitus of a transient type presents during the first week of life and persists several weeks or months, with median duration of 12 weeks and spontaneous resolution. Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) occurs in the first 12 months of life, with onset typically between birth and 6 months, and mean age of presentation of 5 weeks \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Its incidence is reported as 1/90,000 to 1/500,000 live births \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. The most common causes of PNDM are (1) activating mutations in the _KCNJ11_ gene which encodes Kir6.2, the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K-ATP channel) and (2) the _ABCC8_ gene which encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunit of the channel \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. This disorder presents with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or marked hyperglycemia due to low insulin levels and is usually treated with insulin \\[ 8 \\]. However, there are reports of successful switching of treatment from insulin to sulfonylurea in these patients \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. Some children with PNDM also have neurological problems. The combination of developmental delay, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and neonatal diabetes is called DEND syndrome. The intermediate type of this syndrome is characterized by a milder developmental delay, without epilepsy \\[ 7 \\]. The cause of this syndrome is not explained in the literature, but may be due to unnoticed hypoglycemic events during treatment with a sulfonylurea, which has a long duration of action even during fasting and hypoglycemia in an infant who cannot explain the hunger. On the other hand, sulfonylurea has an apoptotic effect on beta cells that may be due to long-acting stimulation of these cells that are not like normal physiology. So far, there has been no report of treatment with meglitinide (repaglinide), which has a rapid and short-acting function and has no effect during hypoglycemia, and its function is more similar to the physiology of normal beta cells and has no apoptotic effect on these cells. This is a report of two patients who were first treated with insulin then replied to sulfonylurea, and because of recurrent hyper- and hypoglycemia, were successfully treated with meglitinide (repaglinide) and their follow-up for 9 and 10 years. These patients have good metabolic control without hypoglycemia or neurological problems.\n\n【13】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【14】### Case 1 (N.NE)\n\n【15】A 52-day-old Iranian girl was referred to us due to lethargy, fever, and poor feeding, which had started 5 days earlier. She was the first child of unrelated healthy parents. There was no family history of diabetes before 25 years of age in three generations. She was born on March 21, 2011, full term by cesarean section (CS), with birth weight of 2.600 kg and height of 48 cm. On physical examination, she was conscious but had drowsiness, dehydration, tachycardia, tachypnea, and sighing Kussmaul respiration. Her weight was 3.700 kg, with height of 52 cm (at the third percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\[CDC\\] 2000 clinical growth chart curves), respiratory rate 40 breaths/minute, pulse rate 197/minute, body temperature 38.2 °C, and blood pressure 97/49 mmHg.\n\n【16】Laboratory data showed severe DKA (Table 1 ). Fluid therapy and low-dose insulin infusion improved DKA, after which maintenance therapy with insulin was commenced. Eleven days later, we decreased the amount of insulin so that blood glucose was maintained between 200 and 300 mg/dL, and glibenclamide was administered to test its effect. It was effective in lowering blood glucose, so it was gradually substituted for insulin. Blood glucose was monitored before and 2 hours after every meal. She received glibenclamide until 2.4 years of age, but frequent monitoring of blood glucose showed some hypoglycemia before meals (minimum = 50 mg), while postprandial glucose was normal or high. Treatment was therefore switched to repaglinide (Novonorm, Novo Nordisk, Denmark), which is short-acting and is claimed to have no effect on insulin release at low blood glucose levels. The time course of treatment and follow-up is shown in Table 2 .\n\n【17】**Table 1 Laboratory tests at entry**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】**Table 2 Age at appearance of signs and start of different treatments**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Because one tablet of repaglinide is 0.5 mg, compared to 5 mg glibenclamide, and the dosage of glibenclamide is 0.4 mg/kg/day \\[ 1 \\], repaglinide dosage was calculated according to its potency as 0.04 mg/kg/day divided into three or more doses before each meal based on the patient’s age and frequency of meals. Preparations of the medicine were made by dissolving one tablet in 10 ml of water and calculating the dosage by volume of solution in every administration and spill-out of the extra. Adjustment of the dosage with weight was done during the follow-up period, which was effective for normal glucose maintenance.\n\n【22】Genetic analysis was done in the molecular genetics laboratory of the Medical School of the University of Exeter in the UK. Sequence analysis of the _ABCC8_ , _KCNJ11_ , and _INS_ genes was performed. Analysis of coding and flanking intronic regions of the _KCNJ11_ , _INS,_ and _ABCC8_ genes (NM\\_000525.3, NM\\_000207.2, NM\\_001287174.1) was done by Sanger sequencing. A heterozygous missense mutation was identified, with details as follows: gene: _KCNJ11_ ; location: exon 1; DNA description: c.602G>A; protein description: p.Arg201His (p.R201H). Therefore, a diagnosis was PNDM was made.\n\n【23】At the last visit, she was 10 years old, with height of 143 cm (75th percentile) and weight of 50 kg (97% of the CDC 2000 curves). Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) was measured every 3 months during the follow-up period, with mean ± SD of all of the measurements calculated as 4.6 ± 0.7 (range 3.6–6.4). The blood glucose level from 59 recent self-monitored measurements was 123.36 ± 18 mg/dL (90–173). Neurodevelopmental assays were normal by both physical examination and questions of the parents. Ophthalmic examination was done and found to be normal.\n\n【24】### Case 2 (I.M.)\n\n【25】A 3.5-month-old Iranian girl was referred due to vomiting, respiratory distress, fever, and lethargy. She had some of the signs since 10 days before presentation. She was the second child of a family with two children, and the other sibling was healthy. Both parents were healthy and first cousins. There was no family history of diabetes before 25 years of age in three generations. She was born on May 12, 2012, full term by elective CS, with birth weight of 2.500 kg. At the time of admission, she was in a light coma and dehydrated. Her weight was 5 kg (10th percentile) and height 53 cm (under the fifth percentile). Respiratory rate was 50, and pulse rate 170, with normal blood pressure and temperature. She had severe DKA (Table 1 ). DKA improved after 26 hours of fluid therapy and low-dose insulin infusion. Glibenclamide was substituted for insulin after 5 days, with a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg once daily. The treatment was changed to repaglinide 1 month later because some hypoglycemia (minimum = 52 mg/dL) occurred, in an effort to keep 2-hour postprandial blood glucose at normal levels. The daily dosage was 0.04 mg/kg, and the method of preparation was the same as in the first case. It was divided into eight separate doses before each milk feeding, and when she became older, the daily dose was divided before every meal. During the last visit, she was 9 years old, with weight of 22.5 kg and height of 122 cm. The time course of treatment and follow-up is shown in Table 2 .\n\n【26】Weight and height were always in the third percentile of the CDC 2000 curves during follow-up. HbA1C was measured every 3 months, with a mean ± SD of 4.7 ± 0.5 (4.2–6.3). The blood glucose level from 93 recent self-monitored measurements was 118.7 ± 16.4 mg/dL (88–167). Genetic analysis was done in the genes mentioned above and also on the _EIF2AK3_ gene in the same center. The result was the same as in the first case. The patient showed normal neurological and ophthalmological examination results.\n\n【27】### Diabetic complications\n\n【28】Routine physical examination and laboratory tests for diabetic care were done for both patients in different periods: Measurement of HbA1C and physical examination was done every 3 months; lipid profile, biochemical profile, thyroid, liver, and renal function tests were assayed every year. There were no diabetic complications in any organ of the body in either patient, and they had normal neurodevelopment and body growth during 9 and 10 years of follow-up. Annual ophthalmic examination results were also normal, with no retinopathy. Tolerability to the medicine has been very good, with no adverse effects.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Switching to a sulfonylurea derivative (glibenclamide) in PNDM has been reported in different studies in patients with both _KCNJ11_ and _ABCC8_ genetic mutations \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 11 \\]. However, treatment with repaglinide, which is from the meglitinide group, has not been previously reported in this disorder. Here, we present two cases of patients with PNDM who were successfully treated with repaglinide. In both cases, missing a dose resulted in increased blood glucose to 200 mg/dL, proving the permanent nature of the disease and the transient effect of repaglinide. Neonatal onset of disease and its permanent nature together with the lack of anomalies such as deafness and optic atrophy ruled out other etiologies of diabetes, including autoimmunity and various types of MODY. The results of genetic analysis further confirmed the diagnosis. Long-term follow-up showed good management of the condition with repaglinide in both cases.\n\n【31】Repaglinide is a carbamoylmethyl benzoic acid derivative that inhibits opening of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and increases insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of sulfonylureas, but it has some differences and more advantages. It acts on a different binding site and has a weaker binding affinity and faster dissociation from the SUR1 subunit binding site. It does not directly promote insulin exocytosis. In contrast to a sulfonylurea, which is an insulin secretagogue with long duration, repaglinide function is rapid and short-acting and has no effect on insulin release if the glucose level is low; it has little effect on insulin levels overnight, between meals, or during hypoglycemia \\[ 12 \\], and it reduces postprandial blood glucose levels \\[ 12 \\]. Thus it has a more physiological action, with low risk of causing hypoglycemia \\[ 13 \\]. Some individuals with PNDM have DEND syndrome. In a large cohort of PNDM patients carrying _KCNJ11_ mutations in long-term follow-up (17), among 81 patients, 38 (64%) had CNS problems. Although some initial improvement in CNS features was seen in 18 (47%) of 38 patients after switching from insulin to sulfonylureas, this effect was usually incomplete and subsequently plateaued. These findings may be explained by unnoticed hypoglycemic events during treatment with sulfonylureas and insulin, especially in infants and during overnight periods.\n\n【32】Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and appears in the circulation after 15 minutes, with a peak level within 30–60 minutes that coincides with the rise in blood glucose after a meal. It is also rapidly metabolized and has an elimination half-life of approximately 1 hour. Repaglinide binds to proteins in plasma, and its absolute bioavailability is approximately 62.5% \\[ 13 \\]. While single-dose studies with glibenclamide tablets in normal subjects demonstrated significant absorption within 1 hour, peak drug levels were seen at about 4 hours, and low but detectable levels at 24 hours, with hypoglycemia representing a significant adverse event, while repaglinide has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar is not high \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. In an experimental _in vitro_ study on beta cells from donors, it was shown that repaglinide has less apoptotic effect on beta cells compared to glibenclamide \\[ 14 \\]. In our patients, repaglinide was very effective in maintaining a normal range of blood glucose without any hypoglycemia and showed no side effects during 9 and 10 years of follow-up in two patients. The patients had normal growth and development, normal HbA1C levels were maintained, and they had no diabetic complications or neurological damage during the follow-up period.\n\n【33】Patients with HNF1A and HNF4A MODY (MODY3) also show sensitivity to sulfonylurea. Clinical features similar to HNF1A/4A MODY can also be caused by mutations in the _ABCC8_ gene; however, this disorder is different from PNDM, in that MODY3 generally presents later in life \\[ 15 \\]. The early presentation of disease together with genetic analysis ruled out this type of disease in our patients.\n\n【34】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【35】Repaglinide can be administered for the treatment of patients with PNDM. We observed no complications of diabetes or any neurological damage due to hypoglycemia and no adverse effects of the medicine in our patients.\n\n【36】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】Data will be made available upon reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Chin _et al_ . first described the typical morphologic features of LVNC, which are characterized by the persistence of numerous, deep trabeculations that communicate with the ventricular cavity as well as a trabecular meshwork pattern \\[ 2 \\]. The clinical manifestations vary from the absence of symptoms to critical cardiac statuses such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic embolism. Patients with LVNC occasionally have evidence of familial disease, and significant genetic heterogeneity has been reported \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】LVNC can be recognized by multiple imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), contrast-enhanced 2DE, and angiography \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. CMR, which provides a comprehensive depiction of cardiac morphology in any imaging plane, has been used to distinguish myocardial trabeculations from global LV mass \\[ 6 \\]. LVNC is most commonly diagnosed by 2DE according to echocardiographic criteria; however, this method of diagnosis is still under much debate. Recently, transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) has become available in the clinical setting and is known to provide enhanced diagnostic capability \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【11】In this report, we present two cases of isolated LVNC that were confirmed using 3DE by the typical trabecular meshwork of the left ventricle, referred to as a ‘honeycomb appearance’.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Case 1\n\n【14】An 84-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea. Her physical examination results indicated a pulse rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/72mmHg, fine crackles in both lungs, and pre-tibial edema in her legs. Her neurological examination results did not show neuromuscular abnormalities. Her electrocardiogram results showed normal sinus rhythm and a complete left bundle block. Laboratory study results showed mild anemia (hemoglobin, 10.8g/dL). Other basic laboratory data were normal. The results of a chest X-ray revealed pleural effusion in both lungs and cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 65 percent. 2DE performed in the emergency room showed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, a normal size of left ventricle by 55mm, an enlargement of the left atrium by 47mm, and globally reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 26 percent. She received standard medical therapy for heart failure, which comprised intravenous and oral diuretics, a beta-adrenergic blocker, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Once her condition stabilized, further medical investigation of the etiology was performed, including cardiac catheterization, contrast-enhanced 2DE, real-time 3DE, and CMR. Her coronary angiogram indicated severe stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery, which was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Repeated 2DE showed marked trabeculations protruding from the left ventricular wall in the apex (Figure 1 A). Blood perfusion of the inter-trabecular recesses from the left ventricular cavity was observed via color Doppler study (Figure 1 B) and further confirmed by the use of intravenous echo contrast (Figure 1 C,D). The ratio of the thickness of the non-compacted myocardial layer divided by the compacted myocardial layer at the end systole was 2.4, which met the Jenni echocardiographic criteria for LVNC \\[ 8 \\]. Moreover, real-time 3DE demonstrated a ‘honeycomb appearance’ in the apical lateral wall (Figure 2 ). Finally, CMR was performed and showed typical left ventricular morphology of LVNC, although she refused the use of contrast agent (Figure 1 E-G). Afterwards, familial screening by 2DE was performed and it was found that her daughter, son, and granddaughter also had massive trabeculations at the left ventricular apex. Thus, we concluded that LVNC could be the main cause of heart failure, although her acquired coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease may have contributed to the development of her condition.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**(A) Two-dimensional echocardiogram showing marked trabeculations protruding from the left ventricular wall in the apex in our patient (Case 1).

His physical examination results revealed a pulse rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/80mmHg, normal respiratory sounds, and third heart sounds. His neurological examination results did not show any neuromuscular abnormalities. His electrocardiogram results showed normal sinus rhythm without conduction abnormalities, abnormal Q waves and ST-T changes. Laboratory test results were normal. The results of a chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 58 percent. Holter monitoring revealed atrial and ventricular premature contractions. 2DE imaging showed mild mitral regurgitation, an enlargement of the left ventricle by 60mm, and globally reduced left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 26 percent. Additionally, contrast-enhanced 2DE, real-time 3DE, myocardial perfusion imaging, CMR, and cardiac catheterization were performed. He was diagnosed as having LVNC on the basis of the findings derived from the above-mentioned imaging modalities. A ‘honeycomb appearance’ in the apex was observed on 3DE (Figure 3 ). He started taking oral medications including a beta-adrenergic blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and warfarin. One year later, he was hospitalized again due to congestive heart failure, and discharged with additional oral diuretics after intensive medical treatment lasting 18 days. 2DE was performed on his daughter, but no abnormalities were detected.\n\n【25】**Figure 3**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated the ‘honeycomb appearance’ in the apical lateral wall (arrowheads) in our patient (Case 2).**\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】In the early embryo stage of human development, the heart is a loose, interwoven mesh of muscle fibers that form trabeculae with deep inter-trabecular recesses \\[ 9 \\]. During the second month of embryonic life, the myocardium gradually condenses; compaction of the ventricular myocardium and transformation of the inter-trabecular spaces into capillaries occur with the development of coronary circulation \\[ 10 \\]. This process of compaction occurs from the epicardium to the endocardium and from the base of the heart toward the apex \\[ 2 \\]. In cases with LVNC, the process of compaction arrests at the early stage, and many prominent trabeculations and deep inter-trabecular recesses remain, primarily in the apex \\[ 11 \\]. These lead to a segmental, trabecular meshwork in the left ventricle, which is a typical morphological feature of LVNC.\n\n【31】Recent studies have reported that the diagnosis of LVNC is often delayed because of difficulty revealing the diagnostic findings \\[ 1 \\]. Multiple 2DE studies are required for a definite diagnosis.\n\n【32】3DE facilitates accurate diagnosis, detailed characterization, and description of the extent of the affected myocardium in LVNC. Entire trabeculations and inter-trabecular recesses are visualized and the boundary between the compact and non-compact myocardium is easily separated \\[ 12 \\]. Moreover, Bodiwala _et al_ . reported the usefulness of 3DE to visualize the trabecular meshwork, referred to as a ‘honeycomb appearance’, for the purpose of differentiating LVNC from other diseases such as right ventricular dysplasia \\[ 13 \\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of case reports have mentioned this unique feature of LVNC on 3DE \\[ 14 \\]. In both of our patients featured in the present report, we could clearly document the ‘honeycomb appearance’ in the apex, and easily make a precise diagnosis of LVNC that was supported by contrast-enhanced 2DE and CMR.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【34】3DE has the advantage of visualizing an en-face view of the trabecular meshwork, which is not possible by 2DE. We further emphasize the clinical utility of 3DE, which is not limited to the observation of the trabeculations and inter-trabecular recesses, but also the trabecular meshwork with a ‘honeycomb appearance’.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consents were obtained from the patients for publication of this manuscript and any accompanying images.

Some of them are associated with genetic syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma is one of the rarest soft tissue tumors, and clear cell renal carcinoma is the most frequent kidney cancer. The concomitant presence of these tumors is extremely rare; however, some cases have been reported, none of them presenting with liposarcoma of the limbs. We report an interesting case of a patient with synchronous multiple primary tumors presenting with a very rare liposarcoma associated with renal cell carcinoma (a very rare association). A review of the literature and a collection of similar cases published previously are also provided.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 62-year-old Hispanic man who presented to our institution with a left thigh mass compatible with dedifferentiated liposarcoma synchronous with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. Multiple treatment lines were provided with no response, with a further metastatic transformation. Genetic analysis by liquid biopsy showed some mutations that were not susceptible to targeted therapy. At the time of this report, the patient is undergoing palliative care because his nonresponsive metastatic disease persists.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We present the first reported case of clear cell renal carcinoma synchronous with dedifferentiated liposarcoma of a limb. The association between renal cell carcinoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma is unusual, and there are few reports of this presentation in the literature. More research about these tumors along with genetic tests needs to be performed to seek a better understanding of the fundamental basis of this rare association.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMN) are rarely seen in clinical oncology practice \\[ 1 \\]. Even though they are not frequent, their incidence is progressively increasing, mainly because of aging and the advancements in medical technology \\[ 2 \\]. MPMN prevalence is estimated to be between 0.7% and 11.7% \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. MPMN can be synchronous when the second tumor presents in less than 6 months since the diagnosis of the first one, and metachronous if more than 6 months passes between diagnoses \\[ 5 \\]. The most important risk factors related to MPMN are familial history of cancer, obesity, and smoking \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【10】The presence of a malignant neoplasm has been shown to increase the risk of developing a second one in 20% of cases \\[ 7 \\], and there are certain genetic conditions that might increase the risk of development of multiple tumors, such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome \\[ 8 \\] and Li-Fraumeni syndrome \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【11】Liposarcoma (LS) is the most common type of soft tissue tumor, representing approximately 20% of all sarcomas \\[ 10 \\]. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) is a rare subtype of LS that has an aggressive behavior with high-risk histology and metastatic behavior; it accounts for a small percentage of all LS and is usually the consequence of progression from a well-differentiated LS \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【12】According to the Global Cancer Observatory, during 2018, kidney cancer represented 2.2% of cancers worldwide, being the 16th most common cause of cancer and leading to approximately 1.8% of deaths related to cancer in the same year \\[ 12 \\]. Eighty-five percent of kidney cancer cases were renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and the other 15% were renal pelvic carcinoma, a form of urothelial cancer \\[ 13 \\]. Within RCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type, accounting for 75–85% of RCC cases \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【13】Chromosomal alterations are usually related with ccRCC \\[ 15 \\]. The VHL tumor suppressor gene, located in chromosome 3p25.3, is frequently inactivated by deletion, microdeletion, or epigenetic mechanisms in approximately 80% of ccRCC cases \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. VHL is infrequently altered in other types of tumors \\[ 18 \\]. Other chromosomal alterations involving translocations and deletions might also be seen in ccRCC \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【14】In this article, we report a case of a Hispanic patient presenting with a very rare association of MPMN consisting of a metastatic RCC that was synchronous with DDLS. To our knowledge, this is the second case in the literature of this association and the first one in which LS presented in a limb. A review of the literature is also presented with a collection of similar cases reported previously.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】Our patient was a 62-year-old Hispanic African American man with a family history of four first-degree relatives with prostate cancer and past intervention of meniscus surgery 19 years ago with a flexion retraction sequela, but with no other remarkable history. He had started experiencing pain and noticed a mass appearance in the left thigh in February 2017. Six months later, he was seen as an outpatient in our orthopedic surgery unit. His physical examination revealed a large increase in volume in the middle third of the anterolateral aspect of the left thigh, but no signs of inflammation were found. A left thigh open biopsy of the lesion was done on September 2017, but the results only showed hemorrhage and fibrin deposits. Because the result was not conclusive, a new left thigh open biopsy was done 1 month after the first biopsy. The conclusion after immunohistochemistry was documented on December 20, 2017 (T = 0), as a fibrous tissue infiltrated by a neoplastic lesion of mesenchymal origin mixed with hemorrhage and tumor necrosis, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells randomly arranged, anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, and mitosis compatible with DDLS (T2bN1M0, stage III). Complementary workup done through December 2017 included esophagogastroduodenoscopy with a finding of noninvasive chronic antral gastritis, _Helicobacter pylori_ \\-negative, and a colonoscopy that showed grade I internal hemorrhoids and mild diverticulosis. At the patient’s first clinical oncology appointment (T = 15 days), the physical examination evidenced good general health and weight of 95.2 kg. His vital signs were blood pressure 127/72 mmHg, pulse rate 109 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16 respirations/minute, oxygen saturation 98%, and no fever. His general physical examination was unremarkable except with regard to the left extremity, which showed a great neoplastic lesion with a circumference of 70 cm and a length of 37 cm associated with inguinal edema with the presence of peripheral pulses. That same day, the patient presented to the emergency room (ER) in order to start further workup and treatment. During his time in the ER, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1 ) was performed (T = 21 days), and the results showed a hypermetabolic neoplastic mass that compromised the proximal two-thirds of the left thigh with cortical changes and retroperitoneal and inguinal adenopathies, a nonhypermetabolic hypodense lesion in the left kidney, and a hypermetabolic node in the right thyroid lobe. Thyroid and urinary tract ultrasound scans (T = 23 days) exposed a pseudonodular image in the right thyroid lobe and a solid mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed a mass on the inferior pole of the left kidney (Fig. 2 ) with dimensions of 7 × 2.9 × 3 cm, neoproliferative, without extracapsular or ganglionic involvement. Further studies included a percutaneous biopsy of the thyroid gland (T = 26 days) and a percutaneous CT-guided renal biopsy (T = 27 days), which showed a nonmalignant goiter and ccRCC as a new synchronic primary neoplasm (cT1aN0M0, stage I).\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT). **a** and **b** Lower limb PET-CT showing injury limited to the anterior compartment of the left thigh, which presents intense peripheral hypermetabolism. **c** Lower left limb CT showing injury limited to the anterior compartment with heterogeneous density of hypodense predominance\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging.

During treatment, the patient developed ifosfamide neurotoxicity manifested as myoclonus and altered state of consciousness that resolved without sequelae. An unfavorable evolution was seen for the sarcoma; however, stable disease was seen for the renal carcinoma. After first-line treatment, renal tumor size decreased considerably; yet, the sarcoma did not improve at all.\n\n【26】The treating physicians decided to perform radical surgery. A left hemipelvectomy was performed (T = 129 days). Second-line treatment for LS was initiated with a targeted therapy based on pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T = 157 days). Despite good tolerance, a new pelvic and abdominal MRI (T = 439 days) evidenced infiltration of the iliac crest and left sacroiliac joint that infiltrated the iliopsoas muscle, left paraspinal muscle, and minor and middle left gluteal muscles. Chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT evidenced the presence of pulmonary metastases (T = 442 days); thus, a third line of treatment for LS with gemcitabine (an antineoplastic antimetabolite agent) and docetaxel (a taxane that interferes with microtubule dynamics) (first cycle = 445 days; second cycle = 467 days; third cycle = 493 days; fourth cycle = 516 days; fifth cycle = 537 days).\n\n【27】Another pelvic and abdominal MRI (T = 538 days) showed a nodular liver injury in segments VII and VIII. After chemotherapy, the patient received radiotherapy in the left thigh because of local tumor recurrence (T = 554 days). Finally, the patient was transferred to palliative care (T = 583 days) because there was no indication for more chemotherapy after three lines of treatment and persistent disease.\n\n【28】The last image obtained was a pelvic and abdominal MRI scan (T = 635 days) that visualized increased liver lesions, increased renal tumor mass, and increased pulmonary nodules; persistence of the iliac lesion; a new lesion in the right femur; and a new neoproliferative lesion in the right kidney.\n\n【29】Once the kidney neoplasm was identified, the patient was evaluated in the genetics department, where a normal 46, XY karyotype was found. A somatic multigenic panel was performed by next-generation sequencing in circulating tumor DNA (liquid biopsy) to look for treatment alternatives. Four mutations were detected in _BRCA2_ : L638FS\\*9, NF1: R1846FS\\*17, RB1: deletion exon 24, and TP53: R282W. None of these mutations has an action indicating a clinical benefit of these histological types of tumors (sarcoma and ccRCC). The instability state of microsatellites reported in the same test was indeterminate, and the result of germline genetic testing was negative. A summary timeline of all the remarkable events is provided in Fig. 3 .\n\n【30】**Fig. 3**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Timeline of clinical events\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】The incidence of RCC associated with other primary tumors varies between 12% and 30% of all RCC tumors. Second primary tumor locations, in order of frequency, are gastrointestinal, head and neck, uterine, and prostate. According to the literature, 90% of these secondary tumors are solid tumors \\[ 23 \\], as in our patient’s case.\n\n【36】Males account for approximately 61% of RCC cases and for 63% of deaths related to it \\[ 23 \\]. Patients with RCC have a threefold risk of developing a second primary tumor compared with other oncology patients in whom the first tumor is not an RCC.\n\n【37】We report a case of a patient with two synchronous primary malignant tumors (DDLS and left ccRCC). ccRCC was found as an incidentaloma with no symptoms of RCC. The patient’s karyotype was normal. Four pathogenic mutations were detected in the liquid biopsy, in the _BRCA2_ , _NF1_ , _RB1_ , and _TP53_ genes, which have not been related to a therapeutic benefit in terms of targeted therapy for these types of tumors. The patient was sent for genetic counseling for evaluation and to rule out hereditary cancer syndromes.\n\n【38】To our knowledge, this is the first report of ccRCC associated with DDLS from a limb. A total of six previous cases of RCC and LS have been reported, one of them a heart DDLS. All cases are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【39】**Table 1 Summary of previously reported cases of patients with renal cell carcinoma concomitant with liposarcoma**\n\n【40】Full size table\n\n【41】RCCs have been seen to be associated with diverse second and even third primary tumors; however, their biological mechanisms are poorly understood. Some evidence shows a relationship between gastrointestinal stromal tumor and RCC, where genes coding for tyrosine kinase receptors such as c-MET and c-KIT might be involved, establishing the consideration of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors with the same target to treat them, but no other mechanisms have been proposed to date.\n\n【42】Our case is especially rare. DDLS only behaves as a metastatic disease in about 15% of cases \\[ 32 \\]; most patients develop this tumor in the retroperitoneum, with very few cases developing in the limbs. Even though its etiology is unknown, it is related to some genetic alterations in the _MDM2_ , _HMGA2_ , and _CDK4_ genes \\[ 33 \\], which our patient did not have. Disease-specific 5-year overall survival (5yOS) is 44%; however, this is dependent on location, and some data show that patients with DDLS with limb lesions have a 5yOS > 90% \\[ 34 \\].\n\n【43】We found some limitations manifested in the impossibility of finding a causal germline mutation that could explain the development of both tumors in our patient. Because of financial limitations of the patient, genetic analyses were deferred to some months after the initial diagnosis. No cultural limitations were present.\n\n【44】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【45】Patients with RCC are at increased risk of developing a second primary solid malignancy.

It occurs due to a defect on the anterior part of the diaphragm, which allows abdominal organs to penetrate into the thoracic cavity. This condition can be detected during fetal life by routine ultrasonography or late during adult life. Late diagnosis of this condition in adults is extremely rare. According to our literature search, only a few cases of symptomatic hernia in adults have been reported so far. Surgery provides definitive treatment for patients with Morgagni hernia; it is always recommended for symptomatic and asymptomatic adult patients to avoid future complications such as volvulus, small bowel obstruction, incarceration, or strangulation. We report a case of a patient who presented with chest pain due to newly diagnosed congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 29-year-old unemployed white man with no significant past medical history or family history of coronary artery disease, who was a current smoker with a 1-pack-per-day history, presented to our hospital with a 1-month history of intermittent chest pain. His chest pain was localized to the right side with a pressure-like quality, moderate intensity 4–6/10, nonradiating, and relieved by standing up and worsened by lying flat. His pain was not associated with increase or decrease in activity level. The pain had progressively worsened, which prompted the patient to come to the emergency room. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. A chest x-ray showed a suspected loop of bowel on the right side of the chest. Subsequently, the patient underwent computed tomography of the chest, which revealed a 7-cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm with a large amount of intra-abdominal fat and a loop of the proximal transverse colon within the hernial sac. The patient was evaluated by a surgeon and eventually underwent laparoscopic repair of the diaphragmatic hernia with mesh repair. In follow-up, the patient’s symptoms resolved.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Morgagni hernia is a rare form of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It is commonly found either in the first few hours of life or in the antenatal period. It is less common in adults and is usually diagnosed accidentally in asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic adult cases are extremely rare. Respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting symptoms. The primary management for both symptomatic and incidentally discovered asymptomatic cases of Morgagni hernia is surgical correction. Various thoracic and abdominal surgical approaches have been described without a clear consensus on preference for operative repair technique.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Morgagni hernia (MH) was first described in 1769 by the Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni as an anterior diaphragmatic hernia originating from the costosternal trigones, a triangular space located between the muscle fibers originating from the xiphisternum and the costal margin of the diaphragm and protruding into the central tendon \\[ 1 \\]. The most common contents of the hernia sac include the omentum, followed by the colon, small bowel, stomach, and portions of the liver \\[ 2 \\]. MH can occur on each side of the sternum; however, it is more common on the right side. Most cases are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, the most common presenting symptoms are cough and shortness of breath. Computed tomography (CT) is the most important tool for establishing the diagnosis. There are no guidelines for surgical treatment, owing to the rarity of cases. However, surgical repair is indicated in all cases to prevent strangulation. We present a rare case of symptomatic diaphragmatic hernia in a patient who presented with an unusual clinical presentation of chest pain and improved completely after laparoscopic surgical repair.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient was a 29-year-old unemployed white man with no significant past medical history. He was a current smoker with a one-pack-per-day habit and a family history of coronary artery disease on his father’s side. He presented to the emergency room of our hospital with a 1-month history of intermittent chest pain. His chest pain was localized to the right side and was pressure-like, of moderate intensity 4–6/10, nonradiating, and relieved by standing up and worsened by lying flat, but otherwise it was not changed with increase or decrease in activity level. He had no associated palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lower extremity edema. He had been taking ibuprofen 500 mg orally as needed at home in an attempt to relieve his pain. Two days prior to this presentation, his chest pain became more constant with the same quality. On the day of admission, he developed difficulty in swallowing food. He experienced dysphagia (food stuck in the lower part of his esophagus); however, he had no associated nausea or vomiting. His physical examination revealed the following vital signs: blood pressure 144/75 mmHg and heart rate 72 beats per minute. Pulse oximetry showed his oxygenation was 99% on room air. Examination of his head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed that his condition was normocephalic and atraumatic. His extraocular movements were intact. His pharynx was clear. His neck was supple without jugular vein distention. His chest wall was nontender. His lungs had clear breath sounds bilaterally without any evidence of wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. His cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds. His neurological examination revealed that he was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His sensation was intact; he had no facial droop; and his pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation. His cranial nerves were intact. His power was 5/5 in all four extremities. His reflexes were intact. His complete blood count findings were as follows: white blood cell count 8300/μl (normal range 4500–11,000/μl), hemoglobin 14.4 mg/dl (12–16 mg/dl), hematocrit 41% (35–48%; 12–17.5 g/dl), and platelet count 273,000 (140,000–450,000/μl). His blood chemistry findings were as follows: sodium 139 mmol/ (normal range 135–145 mmol/L), potassium 4.1 mmol/dl (3.5–5.2 mmol/dl), chloride 106 mmol/L (96–110 mmol/L), CO <sub>2 </sub> 27 mmol/L (24–31 mmol/L), glucose 105 mg/dl (70–99 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen 7 mg/dl (5–25 mg/dl), creatinine 0.72 mg/dl (0.44–1.0 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase 16 IU/L (10–42 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase 21 IU/L (10–60 IU/L), calcium 9.6 mg/dl (8.5–10.5 mg/dl), bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl (0.2–1.3 mg/dl), and lactate 1.0 mmol/dl (0.5–2.0 mmol/dl). His international normalized ratio was 1.14 (normal range 2–3 with conventional anticoagulation). The finding of his electrocardiogram (ECG) was negative for any ST changes. The patient’s chest x-ray showed a suspected loop of bowel on the right side of the chest (Fig. 1 ). Subsequently, the patient underwent CT of the chest, which showed a 7-cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm anteriorly with a large amount of intra-abdominal fat and a loop of proximal transverse colon within the hernial sac (diaphragmatic hernia of Morgagni). The herniated contents were located in the right pericardial location (Figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 ). A nasogastric tube was inserted to decompress the bowel. The patient was evaluated by a surgeon. Eventually, the patient underwent laparoscopic repair of his diaphragmatic hernia (Figs. 5 , 6 , and 7 ) with a successful outcome. His chest pain and dysphagia resolved completely. When he was seen 6 months later for follow-up, he was completely asymptomatic without any complications.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Chest x-ray showing posteroanterior view of bowel loops in the right pleural cavity\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】**Fig. 2**\n\n【16】Computed tomographic scan (transverse section) showing bowel loops ( _arrows_ ) and omentum herniating through the right side of the diaphragm\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 3**\n\n【19】Computed tomographic scan (coronal section) with _arrow_ showing bowel loops herniating through the right side of the diaphragm\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 4**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Computed tomographic scan (sagittal section) with _arrow_ showing the diaphragmatic defect and herniated bowel loops in the pleural cavity\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 5**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Defect opening in the diaphragm with peritoneum bulging into the pleural cavity\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 6**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Repair of the diaphragmatic hernia with suturing\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Fig. 7**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】Placement of mesh during repair of diaphragmatic hernia\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】MH is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It is rare and comprises only about 2% of all diaphragmatic hernias \\[ 3 \\]. We present a rare case of a young patient who presented with symptomatic diaphragmatic hernia with an unusual clinical picture of chest pain that improved completely after laparoscopic surgical repair. MH occurs due to an anteromedial diaphragmatic defect. Almost always, it occurs on the right side of the sternum (91%), which is the same side as in our patient; it occurs on the left side in only 5% of patients. Only 4% of the reported cases are bilateral. The defect results from a fusion failure of the diaphragm with the costal arches \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. Sanford _et al._ reported that the average length of the diaphragmatic defect in the greatest dimension is 7.5 cm \\[ 6 \\]. Our patient had a 7-cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm on the anterior part. Patients can be asymptomatic most of the time. Only a few rare symptomatic adult cases have been described \\[ 7 \\]. Patients usually present in childhood with respiratory symptoms. In adults, MH can be misdiagnosed because it presents with nonspecific gastrointestinal and respiratory signs and symptoms. Respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting complaints, comprising about 34% of symptomatic cases \\[ 6 \\]. In some cases, symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Our patient’s main presenting complaint was chest pain without respiratory symptoms. New-onset respiratory complaints in a formerly asymptomatic individual may be an early indication of progression of MH \\[ 8 \\]. Abdominal pain can be due to incarceration or strangulation of the viscera \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Pregnancy, trauma, obesity, chronic constipation, and chronic cough are common predisposing conditions contributing to the development of MH. Exercise and other types of exertion may also result in symptoms \\[ 11 \\]. Women tend to present after the age of 50 years; men present earlier in life with complaints related to their hernia \\[ 8 \\]. Li _et al._ reported that the most common abdominal organs found in the hernia sac are the colon and omentum, and less frequently the small bowel, stomach, and liver \\[ 3 \\]. Our patient had transverse colon and omentum in his hernia sac. The presence of a hernia sac is associated with better outcomes, whereas thoracic herniation of the liver is associated with worse outcomes. In pediatric patients, comorbid conditions such as cardiac anomalies and major fetal defects, although more difficult to manage, had little effect on the outcome of the disease itself \\[ 12 \\]. Although MH can be suspected on the basis of chest x-ray for workup for unexplained respiratory symptoms, CT of the chest and abdomen remains the modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis. CT is the most sensitive diagnostic tool because it provides anatomical details of hernia contents and its complications \\[ 13 \\]. The most feared complication of MH is strangulation. On very rare occasions, gastric volvulus with small intestine diverticulosis can occur with MH \\[ 14 \\]. Even if a patient is asymptomatic, surgical repair of MH is always indicated because of the risk of strangulation of hernia contents \\[ 3 \\]. Surgical correction is the only established management for MH; however, because of the rarity of this pathology, there are currently no widely accepted guidelines on a standardized surgical technique in the literature \\[ 6 \\]. The variety of surgical techniques currently available include open abdominal approaches via laparotomy; open thoracic approaches via median sternotomy or thoracotomy; and minimally invasive techniques, including laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. There are various advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach in the repair of MH \\[ 6 \\]. The transabdominal approach is preferred for complicated cases in which bilateral hernias or those with dense intra-abdominal adhesions are suspected. In addition, if the diagnosis of MH is uncertain, this approach is beneficial because it provides the capacity for a complete inspection of the abdominal cavity \\[ 15 \\]. Laparotomy is the most common approach for MH repair and is often used in emergent cases, especially when a patient presents with respiratory insufficiency or bowel obstruction \\[ 16 \\]. The disadvantages of this approach are patient concerns regarding increased recovery time, cosmesis, and wound complications, thus requiring this technique to be considered only when other minimally invasive techniques are unavailable or inappropriate \\[ 16 \\]. A transthoracic approach is used for large right-sided MH. It enables easier dissection of the hernia sac off the pleural and mediastinal structures with good visualization of the operative field \\[ 17 \\]. This approach provides an effective repair of the hernia defect with minimal recurrence \\[ 18 \\]. Limiting factors include possible postoperative intestinal obstruction, the risk of missing a bilateral hernia when present, and suboptimal access for the removal of the hernia sac \\[ 2 \\]. This approach includes a median sternotomy and thoracotomy. Minimally invasive surgery in laparoscopy carries the shortest recovery time, offering almost immediate return to normal activities and diet by 3 days in a majority of cases and with a complication rate as low as 5%, which makes it the most favored approach in uncomplicated cases. However, this method may prove suboptimal for complicated cases, because failure to reduce contents may necessitate open surgery \\[ 2 \\]. The postsurgical recurrence rate of MH is very low, and the results are excellent.\n\n【39】Use of mesh for MH repair is controversial, and it is not indicated for all patients. According to a series of 36 patients undergoing laparotomy or thoracotomy, surgeons were able to perform successful repair in the entirety of their MH cases without the use of mesh and without recurrence \\[ 19 \\]. Mesh repair should be considered when there has been considerable tissue loss or notable thinning of the diaphragm or when primary tissue repair is not possible \\[ 20 \\]. Our patient’s defect was repaired by using mesh to reinforce the primary repair and decrease recurrence (Fig. 7 ). Complications that can arise from mesh fixation include intrathoracic adhesions to the heart, lungs, or diaphragm as well as possible diaphragmatic rupture. However, the risks of postoperative complications related to mesh repair have been reduced in the era of composite covered mesh materials.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【41】MH is the rarest form of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and is commonly found either in the first few hours of life or in the antenatal period. It is less common in adults and is mostly diagnosed accidentally in asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic adult cases are even rarer and have a wide variety of symptoms. Although rare, MH should be considered in a young adult with chest pain after other causes are excluded.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Hormonal therapies have been associated with an increased risk of prothrombotic states. This case report documents a portomesenteric venous thrombosis in a postmenopausal woman with testosterone implant for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire and discusses the importance of identifying hypercoagulable risk factors before initiating hormone replacement therapy. We want to improve the awareness of an unusual medical complication associated with hormone replacement therapy and shed light on how testosterone implants could facilitate a thrombotic event related to other risk factors such as obesity and chronic hypoxic states, as well as the importance of differential diagnosis in the evaluation of postmenopausal women on testosterone replacement therapy presenting with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 55-year-old obese postmenopausal Hispanic female with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents with intractable abdominal pain, is found to have elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, and an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan revealing portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Further evaluation excluded inherited and acquired thrombophilia but revealed elevated testosterone levels. The patient was treated with anticoagulation, which resulted in recanalization of the portal and superior mesenteric veins.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Supraphysiologic levels of testosterone caused by testosterone implants as a treatment of hypoactive sexual desire in postmenopausal women can contribute to thrombotic events in the presence of additional prothrombotic risk factors. Therefore, testosterone therapy should include a thorough risk assessment for prothrombotic states, be tailored to patients’ physiologic testosterone levels, and have close follow-up with testosterone level monitoring.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a vascular disease that result from mechanical obstruction to the portal vein by a thrombus. Occasionally, the thrombus can extend towards the mesenteric and splenic veins \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. A feared complication is intestinal infarction, which requires prompt surgical exploration \\[ 6 \\]. Although uncommon, PVT should be included in the differential diagnosis in the evaluation of postmenopausal women on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) presenting with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【10】The diagnosis is clinically supported by imaging findings. Ultrasound is the initial examination of choice, with computed tomography (CT) scan providing additional information \\[ 3 \\]. PVT most commonly presents in patients with liver disease, malignancy, and also inherited or acquired prothrombotic states \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Some medications such as those used for hormonal therapy including testosterone have been associated with increased hypercoagulability \\[ 7 \\]. TRT has been used on postmenopausal women to increase libido \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. A 2019 global consensus position statement by an international expert panel recommended against the use of testosterone formulations, including pellets that may cause supraphysiologic levels, because of the possibility of adverse effects, including increased prothrombotic state \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【11】Management of PVT consists of investigating possible causes such as liver disease, malignancy, and prothrombotic states. Additionally, treatment with anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or thrombectomy should start as soon as possible to improve outcomes \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Prompt diagnosis and treatment lead to a favorable prognosis and reduce the risk of acute and chronic complications such as intestinal infarction and portal hypertension \\[ 3 , 6 , 11 \\].\n\n【12】We report a case that describes portomesenteric venous thrombosis in a postmenopausal female on testosterone therapy to treat hypoactive sexual desire. This case demonstrates that testosterone treatment with supraphysiologic levels can facilitate a thrombotic event in the presence of additional prothrombotic risk factors and highlights the importance of its early detection and treatment.\n\n【13】Case report\n-----------\n\n【14】A 55-year-old obese postmenopausal Hispanic female, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , presented to the emergency department in January 2019 with a 2-day history of diffuse and cramp-like abdominal pain that was worsened by eating. She denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the stool, abdominal trauma, recent surgery, and traveling. Medical history revealed moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without a history of recent exacerbation. Medications included Ventolin as needed, Symbicort, Spiriva without any new adjustments, and testosterone pellets implanted 2 months prior for treatment of reduced libido. She denied smoking, alcohol, and drug use. Family history was unremarkable. On physical examination, the patient had oxygen saturation of 95% on ambient air, heart rate 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 135/80 mmHg, and temperature 97.7 °F. Moreover, she exhibited unlabored bilateral breathing with good air entry, and her lungs had bibasilar reduced breath sounds, no chest wall retractions, and no use of accessory muscles.\n\n【15】The abdomen was soft, distended, tender to palpation in the mid-abdomen and right subcostal area, reduced bowel sounds throughout, and no rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin 17.5 g/dL, hematocrit 52%, leukocytes 9600 per μL, aspartate aminotransferase 55 units per L, alanine aminotransferase 62 units per L, lactic acid 1.4 mmol/L, lipase 98 units per L, a negative fecal occult blood test and basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and PT/PTT within normal limits. Abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast revealed portal vein thrombosis extending to the mesenteric vein (Fig. 1 ). Further evaluation excluded known causes of inherited and acquired prothrombotic states. Additionally, testosterone levels were 182 ng/dL. Hematology–oncology suggested a developed prothrombotic state possibly precipitated by TRT, chronic hypoxia, and obesity. Patient treatment consisted of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, which gradually improved her abdominal pain. A follow-up abdominal CT scan on day 3 of anticoagulation showed partial portomesenteric vein recanalization (Fig. 2 ). The patient was later discharged with rivaroxaban for 6 months of anticoagulation therapy and was advised against further HRT. Three months after discharge, she had hemoglobin of 14.5 g/dL and no evidence of prior symptoms or signs of portal hypertension.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Coronal ( **a** ), sagittal ( **b** ) and cross-sectional ( **c** ) views of abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with contrast demonstrating portal vein thrombosis (white arrows) with extension to the superior mesenteric vein\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Cross-sectional views of abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with contrast comparing thrombosis of the portal vein (red arrows) before treatment and partial recanalization (white arrows) 3 days after beginning treatment\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】PVT is an uncommon medical condition with potentially devastating consequences if not recognized early. It has an annual incidence of 0.7–1:100,000 and a lifetime risk in the general population of 1%. Prevalence is higher in males between 45 and 60 years \\[ 1 \\]. PVT is defined as the partial or complete thrombotic occlusion of the portal vein, sometimes with extension towards the mesenteric and/or the splenic veins. It tends to be more frequent in patients with liver disease but is also seen in patients without liver disease and usually associated with an inherited or acquired prothrombotic state. Presentation of disease can be acute or chronic, with portal hypertension being a complication of chronic disease \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. In more than 90% of cases, acute PVT manifests with progressive abdominal pain and distention. Other commonly accompanying symptoms are fever and ascites. In extreme cases, the patient may present signs of acute abdomen and shock indicating bowel infarction \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 \\].\n\n【26】The initial diagnostic examination of choice is ultrasound of the portal vein, which can show partial or complete filling of the vein with a solid isoechoic or hypoechoic material. Ultrasound has a sensitivity and specificity range of 80–100%. CT and angiography provide additional information on clot extent and presence of intestinal infarct that helps in the diagnosis with a sensitivity close to 90% \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Radiological features of acute versus chronic PVT are high luminal density in the thrombosed vessel, lack of porto-portal collaterals, normal spleen size, no myeloproliferative disease, signs of intestinal wall edema, mesenteric vein anomaly, and filling defect \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【27】As previously mentioned, in patients without liver cirrhosis or malignancy, PVT may occur due to inherited or acquired prothrombotic states. Inherited prothrombotic states are caused by genetic mutations. These mutations include factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and deficiencies of proteins C, S, and antithrombin III. Acquired prothrombic states are caused by changes in substances that affect coagulation and may be secondary to immobilization, trauma, surgery, pregnancy, malignancy, and medications. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, and myeloproliferative diseases are additional examples \\[ 7 \\]. Medications that have been associated with prothrombotic states include hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy (estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone), and tamoxifen (a selective estrogen receptor modulator). Additionally, anabolic steroids, methotrexate, erythropoietin, corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors have also been associated with elevated hypercoagulability \\[ 1 , 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【28】Testosterone has been used for many years to improve libido in postmenopausal women \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Testosterone pellets work by releasing small amounts of testosterone in the subcutaneous tissue, presumably over the span of 3–6 months. Testosterone pellets are still not well regulated; for instance, they are very difficult to remove once inserted and can lead to levels higher than those found in premenopausal women, for which women need to be closely monitored. In 2019, a global consensus position statement for the use of testosterone therapy in women diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and sexual arousal disorder did not recommend the use of any preparation that results in supraphysiologic concentrations of testosterone, including pellets and injections \\[ 10 \\]. However, no significant association with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism has been seen with TRT. The etiology behind this increased risk is still unknown, although it is hypothesized to involve interactions with undiagnosed procoagulable factors \\[ 11 \\]. Another possibility is testosterone's known effect stimulating erythropoietin secretion, which leads to increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and possibly blood viscosity. Nevertheless, these events represent a low risk of inducing prothrombotic events by themselves unless other risks such as chronic hypoxemia as seen in sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation, COPD, or smoking coexist \\[ 1 , 12 , 13 \\]. A study conducted to investigate an association between secondary polycythemia and the risk of venous thromboembolism did not show clearly that polycythemia secondary to COPD or other chronic hypoxic conditions independently increases the risk of thrombosis. However, the authors did note that patients in the study with venous thromboembolism had significantly higher BMI \\[ 12 \\]. The dangers of venous thromboembolism by testosterone most probably depends on the patient’s age, weight, hormonal status, and additional prothrombotic risk factors.\n\n【29】Management of PVT involves investigating probable causes such as malignancy, liver cirrhosis, hereditary and acquired prothrombotic states, and treatment consisting of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin, heparin, and Coumadin, or new oral anticoagulants. Additional treatment options are intravenous thrombolysis and thrombectomy \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. Intravenous thrombolysis and thrombectomy can be considered if symptoms began within 12–18 hours before presentation. The treatment goal is to restore the portal vein circulation, thus preventing intestinal infarction and the eventual development of portal hypertension. Prompt treatment is essential because the thrombosed vessel rarely recanalizes spontaneously. Studies have shown favorable outcomes with early anticoagulation showing recanalization in the first week of diagnosis. Recanalization rates were complete in 38.3% and partial in 14% of patients \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]. The extent of the thrombosis, the presence of ascites, and prothrombotic states are negative predictors for recanalization. After treatment has begun, close monitoring for symptomatology indicating intestinal infarction is important. Improvement in abdominal pain and the presence of bowel sounds are indicators of good response to treatment. Persistent abdominal pain and bloating despite anticoagulation can indicate intestinal infarction, and prompt surgical exploration may be necessary to reduce mortality \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【30】Studies have recommended anticoagulation for no less than 6 months in patients diagnosed with PVT with no specific cause identified. Long-term or life-long anticoagulation may be recommended if the patient persists in a hypercoagulable state, has recurrent episodes, or has a personal or family history of deep venous thrombosis \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【31】The prognosis for PVT is favorable if diagnosed early, and anticoagulation started promptly. The 5-year survival rate in this scenario is more than 85% \\[ 3 , 11 \\]. Complications are mostly related to either other predisposing conditions, late presentation, or surgery. The most feared complication is intestinal infarction because of its high morbidity and mortality of 20–50% \\[ 2 , 3 , 6 \\].\n\n【32】In the present case, our patient started improving after day 2 of anticoagulation. Repeated abdominal CT revealed signs of portal vein recanalization (Fig. 2 ). The patient was later discharged on rivaroxaban for 6 months, was closely monitored with no recurrence and no evidence of portal hypertension, and was advised against any further TRT in the future.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】We can conclude that, before starting TRT in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire, it is essential to do a thorough risk assessment for medical conditions as well as inherited and acquired prothrombotic states that may further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. In addition, testosterone treatment should be tailored to the female physiologic testosterone levels and include close monitoring of pre- and post-treatment testosterone levels. Hopefully, the benefits and risks of TRT for postmenopausal females will continue to be investigated. Finally, PVT is a rare but serious life-threatening event if not recognized and treated early. Therefore, the suspicion index should be high for clinicians evaluating severe abdominal pain in women on TRT.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】PVT:\n\n【39】Portal vein thrombosis\n\n【40】HRT:\n\n【41】Hormone replacement therapy\n\n【42】CT:\n\n【43】Computed tomography\n\n【44】TRT:\n\n【45】Testosterone replacement therapy\n\n【46】BMI:\n\n【47】Body mass index\n\n【48】COPD:\n\n【49】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is usually diagnosed in infancy and childhood \\[ 1 \\], with 60% of patients presenting at ages younger than 2 years old \\[ 2 \\]. It can be cystic or tubular, communicating or non-communicating. It may result in several complications, such as obstruction, bleeding, perforation, and jaundice. It has been reported as a rare cause of recurrent acute pancreatitis \\[ 3 \\]. Hemorrhagic ascites has been reported in only one case of duodenal duplication \\[ 4 \\]. Here we report an extremely rare case of a previously healthy 11-year-old girl with recurrent acute pancreatitis and massive hemorrhagic ascites, who was subsequently diagnosed with tubular and non-communicating duodenal duplication.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with 6-months history of epigastric abdominal pain, and 4 days of hematemesis and dark stools. Her past medical history was unremarkable. On admission, physical examination showed a moderately distressed patient with a temperature of 36.8°C, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, a blood pressure of 95/65mmHg and a pulse rate of 108 beats/minute. An abdominal examination revealed a moderately distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness. There was positive shifting dullness and diminished bowel sounds, but no abdominal wall rigidity. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 10.6×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 54.1% neutrophils, a hemoglobin level of 110g/L and hematocrit of 35.8%. Examination of stool parasites showed _Ascaris_ eggs: 0 to 2/high power field. Biochemical investigations showed increased serum levels of amylase (1665U/L; normal 30U/L to 110U/L), lipase (287U/L; normal 5.6U/L to 51.3U/L) and urine amylase (6059U/L; normal 32U/L to 641U/L). Liver transaminases, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, electrolytes and renal function tests were within the normal ranges. Diagnostic paracentesis revealed dark brown-colored fluid containing a great quantity of red blood cells and white blood cells (243×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). The fluid amylase was 15,240U/L. The result of her Rivalta test was positive.\n\n【12】Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a slightly enlarged liver and heterogeneous echogenicity of her pancreas. Her main pancreatic duct was dilated. Her gallbladder, biliary duct system and spleen were normal. Severe ascites was detected. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a swollen pancreatic papilla. There was no diverticulum or polypoid lesion protruding into the lumen of the second part of her duodenum (Figure 1 A). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an enlarged and heterogeneous pancreas with poorly delineated borders. There was a cystic lesion measuring 25mm × 48mm × 28mm, located between the descending portion of her duodenum and the head of the pancreas. There were massive effusion signals in the abdominal cavity. The gallbladder and bile duct were normal (Figure 1 B). The patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis accompanied by a possible pancreatic pseudocyst. Fasting, intravenous fluid therapy, somatostatin, albendazole and antibiotics were initiated. One week later, an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan confirmed a heterogeneous pancreas with poorly delineated borders, and a cystic lesion between the second part of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, measuring 25mm × 46mm × 25mm. Again, massive effusion signals were seen in the abdominal cavity (Figure 1 C). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a normal biliary tree. The gallbladder was enlarged with smooth walls. The cystic lesion was thought to be an edematous pancreatic pseudocyst. At this point, enteral nutrition therapy via a nasojejunal tube was initiated. During the hospitalization, enteral nutrition was attempted twice and both times the patient developed acute pancreatitis with massive hemorrhagic ascites that were clinically and laboratory confirmed. The patient was treated conservatively with complete bowel rest and administration of parenteral nutrition, somatostatin and antibiotics. After the third episode of acute pancreatitis, an abdominal CT was repeated and showed a well-delineated cystic lesion located between the descending portion of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. The lesion was not enhanced by intravenous contrast. The gallbladder was enlarged with high density in the bottom portion. Massive effusion signals had disappeared in the abdominal cavity (Figure 1 D).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**(A) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: the pancreatic papilla was swollen (white arrow).** ( **B** ) Abdominal computed tomography (CT): A cystic lesion located between the descending portion of the duodenum and the head of pancreas (black arrow) and massive effusion signals in the abdominal cavity (white arrow).

( **D** ) Abdominal CT: A well-delineated cystic lesion located between the descending portion of the duodenum and the head of pancreas. This lesion was not enhanced by the administration of an intravenous contrast: gadolinium (black arrow). The gallbladder was enlarged with high density in the bottom of the gallbladder (white arrow).\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】An exploratory laparotomy was performed. A tubular cyst measuring 32mm × 52mm × 30mm was found in the second part of the duodenum, next to the head of the pancreas. Its surface was adjoined with the pancreatic surface. The cyst was non-communicating with duodenum, stomach and pancreaticobiliary system. The anterior wall of the duplication cyst was resected and anastomosis of the remaining cyst to duodenum was performed for drainage. During surgery, biopsies were obtained and the remnant cyst wall was thoroughly examined to exclude any abnormalities or ectopic tissues. The gallbladder appeared enlarged and the wall was edematous. The gallbladder and bile duct were full of sand-like stones. Histopathological examination of the excised cyst wall showed duodenal mucosa, submucosa and muscle coats, indicative of a duodenal duplication. There was no evidence of malignancy or dysplasia. The postoperative course was uneventful and 15 days later the patient was discharged home. At one year follow-up visit, she remained asymptomatic with normal serum amylase and lipase. There were no clinical signs of ascites.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】Duodenal duplication is a rare congenital disorder and accounts for only 5% to 7% of all gastrointestinal duplications \\[ 1 \\]. They are mostly limited to the first or second part of the duodenum usually adjacent to the pancreatic surface sharing a common wall and blood supply with the duodenum. The common clinical presentation in children is vomiting, abdominal pain, or abdominal mass. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in a few cases as a rare complication \\[ 3 \\] and hemorrhagic ascites in one case report \\[ 4 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of combined recurrent acute pancreatitis and hemorrhagic ascites caused by duodenal duplication in a child.\n\n【20】There are several possible mechanisms for pancreatitis to develop from a duplication cyst \\[ 5 \\]. In this case, the duodenal duplication cyst most probably caused mechanical obstruction of the pancreatic duct and subsequent acute pancreatitis, given the fact that the initial ultrasonography confirmed pancreatic duct dilatation. The non-communicating cyst may produce viscid mucous secretions and mucosal inflammation which may cause distention of the cyst and obstruction of the pancreatic duct \\[ 6 \\]. We do not think that gallstones contributed to acute pancreatitis in our case, because no gallstones were identified on multiple imaging studies. The sand-like stones found in the gallbladder were probably due to long-term fasting and somatostatin. _Ascaris_ infestation is probably an incidental finding rather than a cause for acute pancreatitis, because thorough examination during surgery did not find any adult _Ascaris_ in the pancreaticobiliary system. We speculate that hemorrhagic ascites may have been the result of mucosal inflammation, necrosis and micro-perforation of the duplication cyst. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis can cause ascites but would be an unlikely cause of the hemorrhagic ascites in our case because neither imaging studies nor exploratory laparotomy revealed a necrotic pancreas.\n\n【21】Multiple reports found that both CT imaging and MRI can adequately identify a duodenal duplication cyst \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. However, due to the rarity of duodenal duplication cyst and lack of clinical experiences, more common lesions such as pancreatic pseudocyst are often suspected. In fact, duodenal duplication cyst was reported to mimic pancreatic cyst in a patient with acute pancreatitis \\[ 7 \\]. Kawahara _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] found 25 children with duodenal duplication presenting as pancreatitis. In 10 cases, the duodenal duplications were not in continuity with the duodenum and the locations of the duplications were variable. Six were within the pancreas: four in the pancreatic head, one in the aberrant lobe connected with the main pancreatic lobe, and one in the pancreatic tail. Of interest, a pancreatic pseudocyst was associated with the duodenal duplications in eight of the 25 reported cases. Abdominal CT and abdominal ultrasound were the most frequently used diagnostic tests in the reported cases \\[ 8 \\]. In our case, both CT and MRI images showed a well-delineated cystic lesion located between the descending portion of the duodenum and the head of pancreas. However, duodenal duplication was never suspected, probably due to the severity of pancreatitis and accompanying hemorrhagic ascites. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy did not help in our case because the cyst was non-communicating with either duodenum or stomach. An abdominal ultrasonography failed to reveal any cystic lesion in our case.\n\n【22】The surgical intervention for duodenal duplication cyst includes complete or partial surgical resection of the cyst. The location of the cysts in relation to the duodenum, especially to the ampulla, is important to determine the treatment strategy \\[ 3 , 6 , 8 \\]. Alternatively, duodenum duplication can be safely and effectively treated by different endoscopic interventions \\[ 3 , 9 \\]. Antaki _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] reported that eight patients were treated with endoscopic incision and marsupialization for symptomatic intraluminal duodenal duplication cysts. All patients remained asymptomatic at a median follow-up of 7.3 years. Although a duodenal duplication cyst is considered a benign clinical entity, three cases with development of malignancy have been reported \\[ 10 \\]. Therefore, a long-term follow-up would be necessary for patients who had undergone partial resection of a duodenal duplication cyst.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【24】We described a very rare case of a child who was diagnosed with massive hemorrhagic ascites secondary to a non-communicating duodenal duplication cyst, which may mimic pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with acute pancreatitis. Both CT imaging and MRI can adequately identify a duodenal duplication cyst. Our patient underwent a successful partial surgical resection. It is important to be aware of duodenal duplication when evaluating a patient with recurrent acute pancreatitis accompanied by massive hemorrhagic ascites.\n\n【25】Consent\n-------\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

It can be categorized in numerous ways, such as unicentric versus multicentric, histopathological variants (hyaline-vascular, plasma cell, and mixed), or subtypes based on causative viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus-8, or Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus). Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to symptoms involving multiple organs. Even though the exact mechanism of pathogenesis is unknown, treatment is directed toward possible etiologies such as interleukin-6, cluster of differentiation 20, and viral agents.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 36-year-old Sri Lankan woman presented with generalized body swelling and foamy urine of 2 weeks’ duration. Examination revealed pallor; generalized edema; axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy; hypertension; and hepatomegaly. Investigations showed bicytopenia, nephrotic range proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and features of hyaline-vascular type Castleman disease in a lymph node biopsy. She was managed with rituximab and had good clinical improvement.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Castleman disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, disease pathogeneses, and associations and/or complications. Medical professionals need to be familiar with this spectrum because timely diagnosis and aggressive targeted therapy are the cornerstones of managing these patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Castleman disease (CD), also referred to as _angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia_ or _giant lymph node hyperplasia_ , is a nonclonal lymphoproliferative disorder affecting single or generalized lymph node stations \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. However, it has the potential to affect any organ and thus presents with diverse systemic manifestations. CD has three major histopathological variants, namely hyaline-vascular type, plasma cell type, and the mixed type \\[ 3 \\]. According to the disease dissemination, CD is additionally categorized into unicentric or localized form and multicentric or disseminated systemic form \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. The hyaline-vascular variant, which accounts for 90% of cases, is characterized by capillary proliferation with small hyaline-vascular follicles and has a benign clinical course. The unicentric form is common in this variant, and though it is usually asymptomatic, presentation with a mass lesion is possible. In contrast, the plasma cell variant accounts for less than 10% of cases, and the multicentric form is the most common presentation. It is frequently associated with systemic manifestations such as constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, and malaise), hepatosplenomegaly, marked lymphadenopathy, and hematological (commonly anemia or thrombocytopenia) and/or immunological abnormalities \\[ 2 , 3 , 5 \\]. We report a case of a Sri Lankan patient with the multicentric hyaline-vascular variant of CD who presented with unusual systemic manifestations, namely nephrotic range proteinuria, marked lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and hematological abnormalities.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 36-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan woman presented to our tertiary care hospital with generalized body swelling and foamy urine of 2 weeks’ duration. Her physical examination revealed that she was pale and edematous. She had bilateral axillary lymph node enlargement that was nontender (right 3 × 2 cm, left 1 × 2 cm), as well as multiple cervical and inguinal lymph nodes measuring less than 1 cm. Her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg. She had nontender hepatomegaly 7 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dl, a platelet count of 52 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and a white blood cell count 12.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> . Her reticulocyte count was 1.2%. Blood examination revealed normochromic normocytic red cells, absolute neutrophil leukocytosis, and large platelets with moderate thrombocytopenia.\n\n【12】The appearance of her bone marrow biopsy was compatible with granulocytic proliferation with normal megakaryopoiesis, indicating an inflammatory process. Initially, her serum creatinine level was 1.08 mg/dl, but it rose within 1 week to 3.2 mg/dl. Her serum electrolytes were normal. Her aspartate aminotransferase level was 15 U/L, and her alanine aminotransferase level was 29.7 U/L. Her total protein was 5.8 g/dl with albumin 2.7 g/dl. Her international normalized ratio was 1.09. Her alkaline phosphatase level was 467.8 IU/L. A urine full report showed pus cells 8–10 and red cells 0–1 in high power field, and a highly positive result for albumin. Her urine protein excretion was high at 3.17 g (normal range 0–0.15 g) for 24 hours. Her urine protein creatinine ratio was 3868 mg/g of creatinine (normal range <150 mg/g of creatinine).\n\n【13】An ultrasound scan of the patient’s abdomen showed hepatomegaly of 16.8 cm in size without focal lesions, moderate ascites, and normal-sized kidneys. She had no splenomegaly. A chest x-ray showed bilateral mild pleural effusion. The results of two-dimensional echocardiography were normal. Her lipid profile was normal. Her C-reactive protein level was 49 mg/dl. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 34 mm in the first hour. Results of blood and urine cultures were negative. Her human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies, antibody to _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ , hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody test results were negative. Antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and direct Coombs test results were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed features of an acute-phase reaction with hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\n【14】An axillary lymph node biopsy (Fig. 1 ) revealed numerous small follicular structures. The centers of these follicles were small and consisted of follicular dendritic type cells resembling burnt-out follicles. Blood vessels, some with hyaline walls, were seen in the centers of the follicles. Concentric layers of lymphocytes were seen around the follicles corresponding to the mantle zone. The parafollicular tissue also showed extensive proliferation of the postcapillary venules. Small lymphocytes were seen among the venules. Occasional reactive follicles were seen. The appearance was highly suggestive of CD of hyaline vascular type with lymphoid subtype.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Lymph node biopsy showing features of Castleman disease of hyaline-vascular type. Numerous small follicular structures, follicular dendritic type cells, and blood vessels, some with hyaline walls in the centers of the follicles, can be seen. Concentric layers of lymphocytes around the follicles corresponding to the mantle zone, as well as small lymphocytes among the venules with occasional reactive follicles, are also shown\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】A diagnosis of multicentric CD of hyaline-vascular variant was made. The patient was started on diuretics and antihypertensives and commenced on rituximab 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly for 4 weeks. She experienced dramatic clinical, biochemical, and hematological improvement. After a 7-week hospital stay, she was discharged. One month after discharge, her laboratory parameters had normalized, and she was clinically well. She was followed at the nephrology clinic, and no complications were encountered.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】CD first appeared in the medical literature in 1956 with 13 cases of localized mediastinal lymph node hyperplasia described by Dr. Benjamin Castleman. He originally described the classical histopathological features of the hyaline-vascular variant and unicentric distribution of the disease \\[ 6 \\]. However, CD can affect multiple regions of the body, mainly lymphatic tissue (70% in the chest, 15% in the neck, 15% in the abdomen and pelvis) and extralymphatic sites such as the lungs, liver, spleen, larynx, kidneys, parotid glands, pancreas, meninges, and muscles \\[ 1 , 7 \\]. Thus, the clinical presentation has a wide variation and may well mimic multiple disease entities. Our patient was initially investigated for hematological malignancies with a main focus on lymphomas because she had marked lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and hematological abnormalities.\n\n【22】Hyaline-vascular CD usually occurs in young adults with no gender predilection, and about 90% of cases are unicentric \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Rarely, the multicentric form may occur as in our patient with axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymph node involvement. In the multicentric form, there is aggressive disease progression, and it may be associated with conditions such as POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, multiple myeloma, and skin changes), amyloidosis, Kaposi sarcoma, renal insufficiency, and HIV and human herpesvirus-8 infections (Table 1 ) \\[ 1 , 2 , 5 \\].\n\n【23】**Table 1 Comparison of Castleman disease subtypes**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Renal manifestations of CD are uncommon, and pathologies include amyloidosis, minimal change disease, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis. Patients with renal involvement can develop albuminuria, proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and chronic renal failure \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Renal biopsy, which would have provided more information on our patient’s renal pathology, was not done because she had low platelets. Suggested potential etiological factors for CD are lymphoid-hamartomatous hyperplasia, autoimmune phenomena, immunodeficiency, chronic low-grade inflammation, and excess production of interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the hyaline-vascular variant, follicular dendritic cell abnormalities and vascular endothelial growth factor have been demonstrated as the causative agents \\[ 5 , 10 \\].\n\n【26】Treatment of CD is directed at the suggested disease pathogenesis. Surgical excision is used for unicentric disease of either of the hyaline-vascular or plasma cell variant, but it is rarely used for the multicentric form. Cytoreductive therapy (chemotherapy) can be used for multicentric CD. The most common chemotherapeutic regimens used are cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and either prednisone (“CHOP” therapy) or dexamethasone (“CVAD” therapy) \\[ 2 \\]. Some studies show benefits in radiation therapy and in immune modulators such as steroids, interferon-α, all- _trans_ retinoic acid, and thalidomide in the management of CD \\[ 2 , 11 , 12 \\]. Other treatment options are monoclonal antibodies, which include anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (altizumab) and cluster of differentiation-20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In our patient, rituximab proved to be a successful treatment modality. Several antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, and valganciclovir, are used in the management of viremia-associated CD \\[ 2 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】Although hyaline-vascular CD usually has a benign clinical course, our patient presented with multicentric distribution and multisystemic involvement. CD needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with generalized lymphadenopathy and systemic manifestations.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】CD:\n\n【31】Castleman disease\n\n【32】HHV:\n\n【33】Human herpesvirus\n\n【34】IL:\n\n【35】Interleukin\n\n【36】POEMS:\n\n【37】Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, multiple myeloma, and skin changes", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In approximately 50% of patients, however, a cure is not possible with surgery and alternatives are needed. Somatostatin analog therapy is the recommended first-line treatment in patients with such cases. Here we provide the first report of a high-dose lanreotide primary therapy in patients with acromegaly.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Six patients who were not suitable for surgery were given 60 mg of lanreotide (Autogel <sup>® </sup> ) every four weeks. All patients were German nationals and Caucasian.\n\n【5】When the response of our patients was unsatisfactory, the dose was increased sequentially to 90 mg every four weeks, 120 mg every four weeks, 120 mg every three weeks and 180 mg every three weeks. Treatment duration was 12 to 24 months. In all cases, the lanreotide dose was 120 mg every 4 weeks or higher. In five of our patients, growth hormone (GH) levels were successfully reduced (in three patients GH <2.5 ng/ml was achieved). Insulin-like growth factor 1 levels were normalized in three patients and decreased in two patients. One patient failed to show a biochemical response to lanreotide therapy or pegvisomant therapy.\n\n【6】Tumor shrinkage or degeneration was observed in the five responding patients. No drug-related adverse events were noted.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】These results suggest that lanreotide at high doses of 120 mg every four weeks or more is an effective first-line therapy for patients with acromegaly that surgery alone cannot treat.\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Acromegaly, characterized by elevated growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, is associated with a range of cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic and compression symptoms, and with an increased cancer risk \\[ 1 – 3 \\]. Some symptoms can be serious and life-threatening. If untreated, acromegaly reduces life expectancy \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【11】Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for acromegaly. However, surgery may be impractical. In approximately 50% of patients, surgery alone is unlikely to control the disease. In cases where there is a low probability of surgical cure, primary treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analog is recommended \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【12】Two somatostatin analogs are available, such as octreotide (Sandostatin <sup>® </sup> , Novartis) and lanreotide (Autogel <sup>® </sup> , Ipsen). There are considerable clinical data on the first-line use of octreotide (for example, Colao _et al._ \\[ 8 \\]). Lanreotide, on the other hand, has been shown to be effective as secondary treatment at starting doses of 30 mg to 120 mg every four weeks \\[ 9 \\], but only recently have data been published on the use of lanreotide 90 mg or 120 mg every four weeks as primary therapy \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【13】We present six patients with acromegaly who received primary treatment with lanreotide at doses higher than those presented in the literature.\n\n【14】GH, IGF-1 and prolactin levels were measured using chemiluminescent immunometric assays with Immulite 2000 (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, formerly DPC, Los Angeles, USA). Normal GH levels were defined as 0.5 to 5.0 ng/ml and normal age-adjusted IGF-1 levels were between 81 and 483 ng/ml.\n\n【15】Magnetic resonance tomography was conducted with a 1.5 Tesla-System (Siemens, Erlangen) Type AVANTO, and 1.5 T. MR (Avanto, Siemens). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were produced using a head matrix array. For pituitary imaging, T2w-TSE sag, T1w-SE sag and coronar before and after contrast medium gadolinium (Gadovist, Bayer Healthcare) were used dynamically. The slice size was 2.2 mm.\n\n【16】The six patients with acromegaly presented in this case series were ineligible for surgery because three of them had macroadenoma that were too large and had parasellar and suprasellar extensions (Patients 1, 5 and 6), while one had an adenoma that was too close to the internal carotid artery (Patient 2). One had cardiac insufficiency stage New York Heart Association (NYHA) III and severe insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was thus considered high risk for systemic anesthesia (Patient 3), while one had McCune-Albright syndrome and fibrous dysplasia involving the base of the skull which made transsphenoidal surgery impossible (Patient 4).\n\n【17】All patients were German nationals and Caucasian.\n\n【18】All patients initially received lanreotide by deep subcutaneous injection (Autogel <sup>® </sup> , Ipsen, Paris, France). Each patient was given a single starting dose of 60 mg. After four weeks, their IGF-1 and GH levels were measured. If the IGF-1 levels remained high and the response of our patient to the medication was unsatisfactory, the next dose of lanreotide was increased to 90 mg or 120 mg. If a patient who was receiving treatment with 120 mg, had an unsatisfactory IGF-1 response, the injection interval was reduced to every three weeks. If GH and IGF-1 levels were still elevated in patients receiving lanreotide 120 mg every three weeks, the dose was increased to 180 mg, or 90 mg in each gluteal muscle, every three weeks. For each patient, the dose adjustments were usually made after three injections of lanreotide. In single cases with very high IGF-1-levels, the decision to increase the dose was made earlier based on our previous experience with this treatment.\n\n【19】Case report 1\n-------------\n\n【20】A 19-year-old Caucasian woman of German nationality presented to our hospital in October 2006 with persistent visual disorders. A large pituitary tumor was diagnosed by MRI, but was deemed unsuitable for surgical resection due to its parasellar and suprasellar extension.\n\n【21】Acromegaly was confirmed by standard endocrinological examinations. Her GH level was >40 ng/ml and was not suppressed by a standard oral glucose load. Her IGF-1 levels were 631 ng/ml. However, the only clinical sign of acromegaly was hyperhidrosis and there was no evidence of hypopituitarism.\n\n【22】Our patient did not respond to the initial dose of lanreotide 60 mg, so the dose was increased to 120 mg every four weeks. Her IGF-1 levels decreased to within the normal range one month after this increase in dosage. She remained relatively stable for 17 months. After 10 months, the dose of lanreotide was increased to 180 mg every three weeks (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). Hyperhidrosis improved after the normalization of her IGF-1 levels. Her GH levels were substantially reduced after initiating the treatment, but they did not drop to the target of <2.5 ng/ml at any time during the 17 months of treatment (Table 1 ).\n\n【23】**Figure 1**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**Insulin-like growth factor 1 values in Case 1 during lanreotide treatment for one year** . Baseline value is pre-treatment value. Lanreotide dose increased from 60 mg to 120 mg every four weeks after one month and to 180 mg every three weeks after 10 months. Upper limit of normal is 483 ng/ml.\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】**Table 1 Growth hormone levels and IGF-1 levels after initiating primary lanreotide treatment in six patients with acromegaly**\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】The size of her tumor was reduced by approximately 50% (from 4.5 × 4.0 cm to 2.4 × 1.9 cm), 10 months after initiating treatment (Figure 2 ), but was still not completely resectable by surgery and so no surgical intervention was attempted. Lanreotide treatment continued.\n\n【30】**Figure 2**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**(A) Magnetic resonance imaging scan showing the tumor size before lanreotide treatment** .

Our patient tolerated the treatment well, and she had no complaints of gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n【35】Case report 2\n-------------\n\n【36】A 52-year-old Caucasian woman of German nationality presented to our hospital in January 2007. She was diagnosed with acromegaly when an MRI scan showed a large pituitary tumor that was not suitable for surgical removal because it was too close to the internal carotid artery. Our patient had previously received surgery for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and for goitre, had sleep apnoea syndrome, and was experiencing essential tremor. In addition, our patient suffered from a typical enlargement of the nose, ears and lips. Her skin was seborrhoic and she complained of acne. She had depression and was receiving antidepressants.\n\n【37】Her GH levels were 12 ng/ml and were not suppressed by a standard oral glucose load. Her IGF-1 levels were 676 ng/ml. No evidence of hypopituitarism could be found on our patient.\n\n【38】She was given a treatment with lanreotide 60 mg every four weeks and her IGF-1 levels decreased (Table 1 ). After eight months, however, her IGF-1 levels were still above the upper limit of normal (ULN), and the dose of lanreotide was increased to 120 mg every four weeks. Increases in her IGF-1 levels at 12 months led to a further dose increase to 180 mg every three weeks. In April 2008, (approximately 14 months after initiating treatment), her IGF-1 and GH levels had decreased to within, or close to, the normal range (Table 1 ), which was at 332 ng/ml for IGF-1 and <2.5 ng/ml for GH.\n\n【39】On publication, MRI images show tumor degeneration with cystic decay within the tumor, and lanreotide treatment continues at 180 mg every four weeks.\n\n【40】Liver enzyme activities of this patient remained normal throughout, but liver ultrasonography was not performed. She tolerated the treatment well and reported no gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n【41】Case report 3\n-------------\n\n【42】A 63-year-old Caucasian woman of German nationality and with a 40-year history of type 1 diabetes and poor glycaemic control with insulin therapy presented to our hospital with a pituitary tumor in April 2006. She had elevated IGF-1 levels of 621 ng/ml, and high to normal GH levels of 3.93 ng/ml. There was no evidence of hypopituitarism. Although she had no overt symptoms of acromegaly, her cardiac function was improved when her GH and IGF-1 levels were reduced as she had less dyspnoea. The management of her diabetes was also more effective (with fewer episodes of severe hypoglycaemia) when her GH and IGF-1 levels were controlled.\n\n【43】In June 2006, she was started on lanreotide 60 mg every four weeks. There was no significant reduction in her IGF-1 levels and the dose of lanreotide was then increased to 120 mg every four weeks. After 11 months of treatment with lanreotide, her IGF-1 and GH levels were largely unchanged from their levels before the treatment (Table 1 ).\n\n【44】Since she appeared to be insensitive to somatostatin analog treatment and did not consent to a dose increase, the dose was not increased any further. Instead, she was initiated on the GH antagonist pegvisomant (Somavert <sup>® </sup> , Pfizer, UK) at a dosage of 120 mg/day and her lanreotide treatment was stopped. After a further 12 months of this treatment, her GH levels remained high to normal, and her IGF-1 levels remained well above the ULN (Table 1 ).\n\n【45】No tumor shrinkage was seen in any of her MRI scans.\n\n【46】Case report 4\n-------------\n\n【47】Diagnosed with acromegaly and with a suspicion of fibrous dysplasia in November 2004, a 61-year-old Caucasian man of German nationality was noted to have McCune-Albright syndrome (with a G→A mutation in exon 8, codon 201 of the _GNAS-1_ gene) and clinical symptoms that included café au lait marks.\n\n【48】His IGF-1 values were 616 ng/ml (ULN was 212 ng/ml for age-matched controls) at the time of diagnosis, and his GH levels were 8.48 ng/ml and not suppressed by a standard oral glucose load.\n\n【49】Our patient was initially treated with 10 mg of octreotide every four weeks for 27 months. During this time his IGF-1 levels ranged from 329 to 509 ng/ml, and his GH levels ranged from 4.54 to 7.69 ng/ml. Disease control with octreotide was therefore inadequate and our patient was switched to 120 mg of lanreotide every four weeks. After 10 months of treatment with lanreotide, his IGF-1 levels were 320 ng/ml and GH levels were 3.6 ng/ml (Table 1 ), indicating some improvement in his status. MRI scans showed a tumor size reduction from 8 × 5 mm to 6 × 3 mm.\n\n【50】Case report 5\n-------------\n\n【51】In April 2004, a 45-year-old Caucasian man of German nationality presented with a pituitary tumor that measured 3.4 × 3.8 × 3.8 cm, prolactin levels of 530 ng/ml (ULN: 20 ng/ml) and IGF-1 levels of 315 ng/ml (ULN was 212 ng/ml for age-matched controls).\n\n【52】A dopamine agonist, cabergoline 1 mg, was administered to our patient three times per week. The prolactin and IGF-1 levels of our patient was thus normalized (IGF-1 was 188 ng/ml) within four weeks. After one year, an MRI assessment showed that the diameter of the tumor of our patient was reduced to 2.7 × 3.0 × 3.7 cm. By January 2007, and with a continuation of cabergoline doses that suppressed prolactin increases, the IGF-1 levels of our patient had increased to 338 ng/ml. Basal GH levels were 0.56 ng/ml. Therefore, our patient was initiated on a treatment with lanreotide 60 mg every four weeks. Despite reductions in IGF-1 levels to as low as 239 ng/ml after seven months, the lanreotide dose was increased initially to 90 mg every four weeks, and then to 120 mg every four weeks one month later. After 10 months of treatment with lanreotide, our patient's IGF-1 levels had normalized to 212 ng/ml. GH levels remained well below 2.5 ng/ml during the lanreotide therapy. Tumor size was reduced to 2.4 × 2.8 × 3.3 cm.\n\n【53】Case report 6\n-------------\n\n【54】A 53-year-old Caucasian man of German nationality presented to our hospital in February 2004 with a pituitary tumor measuring 3.1 × 3.6 cm. Our patient had elevated prolactin values (2940 ng/ml) but normal GH values (0.27 ng/ml) and IGF-1 values (127 ng/ml).\n\n【55】He was initiated on a 1 mg cabergoline treatment three times per week. But it had to be increased after three months to 1 mg/day to normalize his prolactin levels. His IGF-1 levels subsequently increased; reaching 312 ng/ml eight months after presentation and 413 ng/ml 25 months after presentation (ULN was 267 ng/ml for age-matched controls). Similarly, his GH levels increased over time to basal levels of 4.23 ng/ml after 22 months, and were not suppressed by standard oral glucose load. However, 12 months after presentation, the tumor mass had reduced to 2 cm in diameter. In March 2006, he was started on treatment with lanreotide 60 mg every four weeks, and four months later his IGF-1 levels normalized to 285 ng/ml and GH levels was reduced to <2.5 ng/ml (Table 1 ). Subsequent dose increases of lanreotide to 90 mg every four weeks and then to 120 mg every four weeks maintained his IGF-1 and GH at normal levels. As of publication, the most recent MRI finding shows signs of tumor regression. Cabergoline treatment was continued and unchanged during this time.\n\n【56】No adverse events related to lanreotide treatment were recorded in any of the six patients we described.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【58】This series of six patients with acromegaly is one of the first specific reports of primary treatment with lanreotide, and the first to report the use of high doses. The six patients were not eligible for surgical removal of their pituitary tumors, and five patients showed a biochemical response to lanreotide treatment, which was given for one to two years. The response of our patients to lanreotide treatment occurred within one to two months, but required dose increases to 120 mg every four weeks, while two patients subsequently required 180 mg every three weeks to achieve or maintain their initial response. Furthermore, the five patients that responded also had evidence of tumor shrinkage or degeneration while receiving lanreotide.\n\n【59】The goals of treatment for acromegaly are to reduce GH levels to <2.5 ng/ml, normalize IGF-1 levels, and/or control tumor mass \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Based on these goals, lanreotide was proven to be a successful first-line therapy in five of these six patients, with the exception of Case 3, as this patient did not respond to high-dose lanreotide or to pegvisomant.\n\n【60】The other unique aspect of this case series is the high dose of lanreotide (180 mg every three weeks) that was given to two of our patients. This high dose of lanreotide has now been given to one patient for approximately six months and to another for approximately three months with no unexpected adverse events. The use of such high doses of lanreotide has not been previously published, and our experience suggests that this dose is well-tolerated, at least in the short-term, and may be useful for patients showing an attenuation of response to lanreotide doses of 120 mg every four weeks.\n\n【61】This report confirms the efficacy and tolerability of lanreotide in the primary treatment of acromegaly. Further data are required regarding the use of lanreotide in this setting, as well as to identify the potential clinical risks and benefits of high-dose lanreotide.\n\n【62】Consent\n-------\n\n【63】Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for publication of this case report and accompanying image.

Recently, we have seen an increase in cases of collapsing glomerulonephritis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, also known as coronavirus disease 2019-associated nephropathy. It has been noted to be seen with a higher incidence in African American patients who are carriers of the _APOL1_ variant allele.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 47-year-old African American male with a past medical history of asthma presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and worsening confusion. On admission, he was found to be hemodynamically stable, but labs were significant for elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, signifying acute kidney injury. He was admitted and taken for emergent dialysis. During his hospitalization, he was found to be positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Renal biopsy was done, which showed collapsing glomerulopathy, and the patient continues to require outpatient dialysis after discharge.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Collapsing glomerulonephritis has emerged as a complication in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. This condition should be particularly suspected in African American patients who present with acute kidney injury, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and who are positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Current treatment options are limited to supportive treatment and renal replacement therapy. More clinical cases and trials are needed to better understand and improve therapeutic outcomes in these patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now recognized as a common complication of the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), affecting up to 46% \\[ 1 \\] of patients with acute tubular injury as the most common injury. In recent years we have seen an increase in cases of collapsing glomerulonephritis, also known as COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), with a higher incidence in the African American population, specifically those carrying the _APOL1_ allele \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. It is theorized that COVID-19 triggers an inflammatory cascade that may affect the _APOL1_ variant gene, causing glomerular impairment. The disease may range from mild progressive kidney disease to acute renal failure. Currently, the mainstay of treatment involves supportive measures and renal replacement therapy. The authors present a case in which COVAN occurred in an African American male who continues to require long-term renal replacement therapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 47-year-old African American male with a past medical history of asthma presented to the emergency department with complaints of intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and worsening confusion. The patient was afebrile. In the emergency department, vitals showed an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. On physical examination, the patient appeared ill and drowsy. While able to answer questions, he required repeated arousing as he was somnolent. Lungs were clear on auscultation, and no murmur was appreciated. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. He denied any history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug abuse. There was no family history of confusion, dementia, or kidney disease. However, he reported exposure to COVID-19 in the past week.\n\n【12】While hemodynamically stable on admission, labs were remarkable for acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine of 31 mg/dL (normal 0.7–1.3 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 210 mg/dL (normal 6–24 mg/dL), potassium level of 7.6 mmol/L (normal 3.6–5.2 mmol/L), and a calcium level of 21.5 mg/dL (normal 8.6–10.3 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed significant proteinuria with levels equal to or greater than 500 mg/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 21–50/hpf, and red blood cells of 6–10/hpf. Urine studies were done, which showed a urine protein level of 8700 mg/dL. Urine protein electrophoresis was interpreted as a glomerular pattern with no monoclonal bands seen, often seen in nephrotic and nephritic syndromes. A serology panel was sent, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis panel were negative. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm with peaked T waves.\n\n【13】Further workup showed patient positive for COVID-19 by antigen test. As a result of the patient’s labs and condition, he was admitted and taken for emergent dialysis. A renal biopsy was performed, and light microscopy showed collapse of basement membranes in some glomeruli, along with severe tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and dilated tubules filled with hyaline and protein casts. Direct immunofluorescence did not show evidence of immune complex disease. Electron microscopy showed widespread effacement of foot processes, which correlated with proteinuria. These findings correlated with collapsing glomerulopathy (Figs. 1 , 2 ). Computed tomography (CT) of the head and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were done, which did not show any acute findings. After dialysis, his encephalopathy showed significant improvement. He was more awake, more alert, and able to have extended conversations. Unfortunately, his kidney function did not improve, and he continues to require outpatient hemodialysis after discharge. Understandably, this has frustrated him, however, he has been compliant with follow-ups and dialysis appointments.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Allochrome: glomerulus with collapsing features; including collapse of basement membranes with segmental accentuation and overlying hyaline droplet filled epithelial cells. Active cellular crescents, however, are not seen. Mesangial matrix is mildly expanded.

Glomerular basement membranes are uniformly contoured except for a few segments with mild corrugation (mean glomerular basement membranes thickness, 303 ± 48 nm). Electron dense deposits were not seen\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】While cases of COVID-19 initially presented with severe respiratory distress syndrome, after vaccinations and the introduction of variants, the number of patients that are developing severe pulmonary disease has decreased, however, we have seen other complications such as renal impairment \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【24】Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a major cause of end-stage renal disease. It can present with several variants, including collapsing, tip, cellular, perihilar, and not otherwise specified \\[ 4 \\]. The collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is described as segmental and global collapse of the glomerular capillaries, marked hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of the podocytes. It is a severe form with high risk of progression to irreversible kidney failure \\[ 5 \\]. It was first described in patients with HIV infection \\[ 4 \\], known as HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). However, since the use and introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of HIVAN has decreased significantly. Collapsing glomerulopathy has also been associated with other viral infections, drugs, and ischemia \\[ 2 , 5 \\]. While other viral infections such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus have been associated with collapsing glomerulopathy, in recent years we have noticed an increased incidence of COVID-19-associated glomerulopathy, also known as COVAN. This pathology has been reported by several authors, and interestingly, all the affected patients are of African American descent with the _APOL1_ high-risk genotype \\[ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【25】Currently, the pathology is not well understood. As high-risk patients with the _APOL1_ genotype appear to be more affected, some authors believe COVAN parallels the development of HIVAN in patients with HIV. In HIVAN, it is believed that HIV causes a “second-hit” in patients with the _APOL1_ genotype \\[ 2 \\]. The infection, or inciting event, triggers an inflammatory response that activates the interferon–chemokine pathway. This in turn affects the _APOL1_ variant gene, causing glomerular impairment. It is believed that COVID-19 triggers a similar inflammatory response and this is why patients with the _APOL1_ genotype are more prone to developing COVAN. The theory is supported by immunostaining of COVAN biopsies increasing the expression of phosphor-STAT3, which is activated by interleukin-6 \\[ 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【26】Another mechanism of injury that has been proposed is direct viral deposition in the glomerular membrane. This theory is controversial, given that viral particles are not present in some of the COVAN kidney biopsies \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【27】Clinically, the patient presented with renal dysfunction and nephrotic range proteinuria with minimal respiratory symptoms. In several COVAN case reports, the outcome involves renal replacement therapy. The treatment for COVID-19 has been mainly directed toward acute respiratory failure, with medications such as dexamethasone, remdesivir, baricitnib, and toclizumab often indicated on the basis of oxygenation levels \\[ 16 \\]. When patients present with COVAN but without hypoxemia, treatment is mainly supportive. Our case report and others raise the question of whether initiating these therapies in patients with COVAN will change the course of kidney failure and possibly prevent the need for long-term renal replacement therapies.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】COVAN has emerged as a complication in patients with COVID-19. This condition should be particularly suspected in patients of African American descent who present with COVID-19, acute kidney injury, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. _APOL1_ variant carriers are at a higher risk of developing COVAN. More clinical trials are needed, especially in carriers of _APOL1_ , to better understand the pathophysiology behind this disease and improve therapeutic options for these patients.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】The datasets during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The common metastatic sites are the liver, bones, brain, adrenal glands and central nervous system. However, gastrointestinal metastases, particularly esophageal metastases, from lung cancer are rare. There are no cases of esophageal metastases from lung cancer which refer to its particular treatment.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of esophageal metastases from lung cancer. The patient was a 55-year-old Han Chinese man who first attended our hospital due to dry cough and was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. Three months later, the patient complained of dysphagia. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and pathological examination of the biopsy specimen was performed to confirm the lesion was metastases from lung cancer. Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) and napsin A were positive by immunohistochemistry examination. These results reconfirmed the diagnosis of esophageal metastases from lung cancer.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Esophageal metastasis from lung cancer is very rare. It may be alleviated with personalized chemotherapy. In addition, molecular targeted therapy for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations may be reasonable.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide \\[ 1 \\]. When diagnosed, approximately 50% of patients present with metastases. The most common metastatic sites are the liver, bones, brain, adrenal glands and central nervous system \\[ 2 \\]. However, gastrointestinal metastases, particularly esophageal metastases, from lung cancer are rare \\[ 3 \\]. Furthermore, most cases of esophageal metastases are asymptomatic, and are finally discovered at autopsy \\[ 4 \\] rather than in clinics.\n\n【10】Here we report a case of primary lung cancer metastasized to the esophagus and discuss diagnostic and treatment strategies, in order to give other doctors some supplemental information and references when treating such uncommon patients.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 55-year-old Han Chinese man with a long-term history (30 years) of heavy smoking was referred to our hospital in March 2015 due to dry cough. His past medical history and family history were unremarkable. On a routine health checkup, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value of 182.6 g/L (normal value, 0–9.8 g/L; Fig. 1 ) was found. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 48 × 42 mm tumor in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2 a). A positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan revealed multiple metastases in the left lower lung, bilateral supraclavicular fossa, hilus pulmonis, mediastinal lymph nodes and bone (Fig. 2 d). The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the lung lesion. The biopsy tissue was identified as adenocarcinoma by pathological examination (Fig. 3 a). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) (Fig. 3 b, c). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene of the primary lung cancer harbored a mutation of the 19th exon. Clinically, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, with the primary lesion in the left lower lobe. After communicating with the patient and his family, gefitinib (250 mg once a day) was initially commenced in April 2015. The primary tumor shrank about one-fifth after 2 months of treatment, and the patient did not experience obvious adverse effects.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Alteration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and treatment at different time points. The patient first presented with an increased CEA level. The carcinoembryonic antigen level gradually decreased to 6.7g/L (normal value, 0–9.8 g/L) following 5 months of gefitinib and chemotherapy treatment\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Imaging study of a patient with esophageal metastases from lung cancer. **a** Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a 48 × 42 mm defined tumor at the ascending left lung (arrow), with a scallop-shaped contour and focal enhancement. **b** Gastroscopy images showed a 17.7 mm wall thickening at the distal esophagus 38 cm from the upper incisors (arrow), with the mucous epithelium being mildly hemorrhagic but without a distinct break. **c** Barium esophagography.

The patient could only eat fluids. Laboratory examinations indicated a an elevated CEA level of 112.3 g/L. Barium esophagography showed irregular thickening of the wall and narrowing of the lumen of the lower thoracic esophagus (Fig. 2 c). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 17.7 mm wall thickening at the distal esophagus 38 cm from the upper incisors, with mucous epithelium being mildly hemorrhagic but without a distinct break (Fig. 2 b). There was also no evidence of active bleeding. The patient underwent biopsy of the esophageal lesion tissue under endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Pathological examination of the esophageal lesion tissue showed similar results as those of the primary lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 4 a). TTF-1 and CK-7 were positive by IHC (Fig. 4 a, b). Napsin A staining was positive (Fig. 4 d). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple metastases. The patient then received additional chemotherapy with docetaxel (60 mg day 1, day 8) and cisplatin (20 mg days 1–5), with gefitinib terminated. After one cycle of chemotherapy, the patient complained of chest tightness after activity. A CT scan showed pleural effusion and progression of the primary tumor. Closed thoracic drainage and injections of lentinan and cisplatin (two cycles) into the chest were conducted to alleviate the patient’s symptoms. The chemotherapy was then adjusted to pemetrexed (0.8 g day 1) and cisplatin (20 mg days 1–5). After six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient gradually returned to a normal diet. Follow-up CT scans showed complete response in the esophageal lesion, and the CEA level decreased to 6.7 g/L in September 2015. The primary lung tumor had partially shrunk. The patient then continued to take gefitinib (250 mg once daily), and the primary tumor was stable. In June, 2016, the patient began having headaches. Brain MRI revealed that the metastases had progressed. The CEA level rebounded to 21.3 g/L. The patient then received AZD9291 orally (80 mg once daily) without T790m mutation testing. His headache symptoms were alleviated, and there was no further follow-up of the patient.

Napsin A is specific for tumors of lung origin\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】This case reported a patient who was diagnosed with primary lung cancer with multiple metastases at the first visit, and the tumor metastasized to the esophagus during treatment. We recorded this case not only because it is a rare case in clinics, but also because of the many clinical characteristics during the whole course of treatment.\n\n【31】Lung cancer typically spreads to the liver, bones, brain, adrenal glands and central nervous system \\[ 4 \\]. However, according to autopsy studies, the overall incidence of esophageal metastasis in patients dying of any type of cancer is approximately 3–6%, among which breast and lung represent the most common sites of the primary tumor \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【32】There are several possible routes by which lung cancer can metastasize to the esophagus: bloodstream and lymphatic metastases, implantation metastases and direct invasion from nearby organs, namely the larynx, hypopharynx, trachea, bronchus, stomach and mediastinal lymph nodes \\[ 5 \\]. According to the almost normal overlying mucosa observed by endoscopy in our patient’s esophagus, we consider that the metastases came from the bloodstream or lymphatic route, as this mechanism leads mainly to submucosal lesions.\n\n【33】Most patients with metastases to the esophagus have no specific symptoms. Even when symptoms are present, they are usually nonspecific. Only a small number of patients complain of dysphagia, hoarseness and weight loss \\[ 6 \\]. Our patient showed dysphagia due to stricture as a result of lymphatic or bloodstream metastases. Esophagography and endoscopy are useful diagnostic tools. Esophagram demonstration is characterized by regular stenosis of the esophagus. However, endoscopy often shows a normal mucosal surface when there is no serious growth of the esophageal metastasis. With the help of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), more accurate information will be provided about the submucosal lesion \\[ 7 \\]. Biopsies guided by EUS will reveal pathological findings. Histological and immunohistochemical staining can provide crucial information to distinguish whether the esophageal lesion comes from the lung adenocarcinoma. TTF-1 is specific for tumors of lung origin. TTF-1 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the thyroid gland and lung, while adenocarcinomas are malignant transformations evolved from these cells \\[ 8 \\]. TTF-1 has been shown to be a sensitive and highly specific marker of adenocarcinomas of pulmonary origin, in tissue biopsies and cytological preparations. TTF-1 is expressed mainly in 68–80% of primary lung adenocarcinomas, but expressed in less than 1% of adenocarcinomas of non-pulmonary origin \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Napsin A is also specific for tumors originating from the lung. Napsin A is expressed in 84.5% of primary lung adenocarcinomas, but not expressed in adenocarcinomas of other sites. Double staining of TTF-1 and napsin A has been proposed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of pulmonary-originated adenocarcinomas. \\[ 11 \\]. Moreover, CK-7 can identify primary lung cancer. However, some studies found that primary adenocarcinomas of the rectum and small intestine may also express CK-7 in a small number of cases \\[ 12 \\]. In our case, due to the marker’s high specificity, positive results for TTF-1 and napsin A provided strong evidence of the pulmonary origin of the esophageal lesions, with addition of the clinical and morphological findings.\n\n【34】Accurate distinction between esophageal metastasis and the primary cancer is of key importance, as it determines the treatment and prognosis of patients \\[ 4 \\]. Once the patient was diagnosed with esophageal metastasis originating from the pulmonary tumor, we administered chemotherapy, which achieved good results in the esophageal metastasis. However, the primary lung adenocarcinoma did not response sensitively. This phenomenon may be explained by the molecular diversity of tumors in different locations \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【35】The prognosis for lung cancer with metastasis to the esophagus is poor \\[ 14 \\]. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy should be comprehensive and personalized. Our patient had an EGFR gene mutation in exon 19 and was treated with gefitinib. In June 2016, the patient’s brain metastases progressed. He took the original drug AZD9291 (osimertinib) on his own. It may be effective, as his headache symptoms subsided, although with a lack of clinical imaging evidence. Mounting evidence has now demonstrated that AZD9291 treatment is independently associated with longer overall survival in patients with a T790M mutation \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. In general, surgery is contraindicated in patients with organ metastases originating from lung cancer. However, some authors have reported prolonged survival in cases following management of oligometastasis of the bone, brain and small bowel \\[ 17 \\] from lung cancer. There are no cases to date of patients who received local treatment for esophageal metastases from lung cancer. However, surgical intervention is often adopted when gastrointestinal metastases lead to continuous bleeding, obstruction or perforation \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】Esophageal metastases from lung cancer are extremely rare. However, clinicians should be aware of their occurrence. The diagnosis of esophageal metastasis is specific and is important to guide follow-up therapy. Comprehensive and personalized treatment may be beneficial in these patients. Molecular targeted therapy may be a reasonable choice in patients with EGFR mutations.\n\n【38】Article highlights\n------------------\n\n【39】Case characteristics\n\n【40】The patient was a 55-year-old man who presented to our hospital due to stimulated cough.\n\n【41】Clinical diagnosis\n\n【42】The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n【43】Differential diagnosis\n\n【44】Mucosal biopsy from endoscopy was useful for differential diagnosis, and histological analysis revealed lung cancer.\n\n【45】Laboratory diagnosis\n\n【46】Laboratory findings revealed elevated tumor markers (CEA).\n\n【47】Imaging diagnosis\n\n【48】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a 48×42 mm defined tumor at the ascending left lung.\n\n【49】Pathological diagnosis\n\n【50】Pathological report of the tissue biopsy.

Angiosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm characterized by rapidly proliferating and extensively infiltrating anaplastic cells derived from vessels and lining irregular blood-filled spaces\\[ 1 \\]. Skeletal angiosarcoma generally affects young adults and elderly individuals, and age distribution shows a wide range with a nearly equal distribution from the second to the eighth decade of life\\[ 2 \\]. Angiosarcomas tend to affect long tubular bones of the extremities and the axial skeleton, mainly the spine. The bones of the lower limb, particularly the femur and the tibia, are most commonly involved, followed by the pelvis, vertebral column, and the bones of the upper limbs\\[ 3 , 4 \\]. We describe an extremely rare case of a woman with angiosarcoma of the humerus who underwent chemotherapy and wide resection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 65-year-old Japanese woman fell as she was getting out of bed and injured her left shoulder. Plain radiograph and computed tomography (CT) revealed an osteolytic lesion in her proximal humerus with a wide zone of transition between the tumor and uninvolved bone (Figures 1 and 2 ). The cortex of her proximal humerus was thinned, and a pathological fracture was also seen, but cortical expansion was absent in that lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion with low intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate intensity on T2-weighted images (Figure 3 ). Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images showed heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated no distant metastases. Open biopsy revealed a tumor composed of anastomosing vascular channels and cystic spaces lined by malignant cells (Figure 4 ). Immunohistochemical analysis showed CD31, CD34, and factor VIII RA positivity, confirming the vascular origin of the tumor, and a diagnosis of primary angiosarcoma of bone was made (Figure 5 ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Anteroposterior radiograph of the left shoulder shows a pathological fracture with an osteolytic lesion.**\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Computed tomography scan shows cortical destruction of the proximal humerus and a pathological fracture.** ( **A** ) Transverse view.

During the three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy, the size of the mass did not change, but her spontaneous pain decreased.\n\n【33】After pre-operative chemotherapy, en bloc resection of the tumor was performed by extra-articular humeral and glenoid resection (Figures 6 and 7 ). The clavicula pro humero method was initially planned for reconstruction, but the acromioclavicular joint was collapsed, and the distal clavicular end detached from surrounding soft tissue during osteotomy of the lower aspect of acromion. Therefore, reconstruction with this method failed, resulting in a flail shoulder. After surgery, our patient did not wish to receive additional reconstruction surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Two months after surgery, she had moderate function according to a Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and International Symposium on Limb Salvage\\[ 5 \\] evaluation; she had scores of five for pain, one for function, three for emotional acceptance, one for positioning of the hand, five for manual dexterity, and zero for lifting ability. The total score was 15 points (50%). Our patient did not complain of any pain. Impairment of activity of daily living was slight when a sling was used.\n\n【34】**Figure 6**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】**Immediate post-operative radiograph of the left shoulder after wide resection.**\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Figure 7**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】**Excised specimen of the proximal humerus.** ( **A** ) Macroscopic appearance of resected specimen.

After surgery, our patient's upper limb was immobilized with a stockinette-Gilchrist bandage. Four weeks after surgery, CT scans of her abdomen revealed distant metastases in her liver and spleen (Figure 8 ). One cycle of post-operative chemotherapy using the MAID protocol was performed, but she discontinued additional post-operative chemotherapy. We did not see local recurrence until the final follow-up. Five months after surgery, she transferred to another hospital because she had changed residence.\n\n【43】**Figure 8**\n\n【44】 \n\n【45】**Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan shows metastatic tumors in the liver and spleen (arrows).**\n\n【46】Full size image\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Angiosarcoma of bone is a rare malignant neoplasm and represents the most malignant end of the spectrum of vascular tumors. Approximately 6% of all angiosarcomas are found in bone\\[ 2 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, angiosarcoma of the humerus is extremely rare; only five cases have been reported in the literature in English since 1953\\[ 6 – 10 \\] (Table 1 ). This is an aggressive malignancy characterized by frequent local recurrence and distant metastases. These lesions occur during the second to the seventh decades of life, although the peak is during the third to fifth decades\\[ 11 \\]. Men are affected with twice the frequency of women. The most common osseous lesions are the long bones (approximately 60% of cases), particularly the tibia (23%), femur (18%), and humerus (13%), as well as the pelvis (7%)\\[ 12 \\]. The two most common symptoms are local pain and swelling.\n\n【49】**Table 1 **Reported cases of angiosarcoma of the humerus****\n\n【50】Full size table\n\n【51】Radiographically, there is no specific finding associated with angiosarcoma of bone as opposed to other malignant bone tumors. Lesions are usually highly destructive and may grow too fast to invoke a periosteal reaction. They may be eccentric and may have a purely lytic or mixed lytic sclerotic pattern\\[ 13 \\]. More aggressive features include osseous expansion, cortical permeation, and an associated soft tissue mass\\[ 14 \\]. CT and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of angiosarcoma may also be non-specific\\[ 14 \\]. In general, pathological fractures of high-grade primary bone sarcomas occur either spontaneously or after minimal trauma. The incidence of pathological fracture at diagnosis in patients with angiosarcoma of bone is unknown.\n\n【52】Pathologically, these tumors may contain either hemangiomatous or lymphangiomatous cellular elements, which are often difficult or impossible to distinguish histologically, particularly with higher degrees of anaplasia. Identification of vascular channels allows diagnosis; thus, the term angiosarcoma is preferable to hemangiosarcoma or lymphangiosarcoma for these malignant vascular neoplasms\\[ 15 \\]. Verbeke _et al_ .\\[ 16 \\] recently reported that primary angiosarcoma of bone exhibiting more than three mitoses per 10 high-powered fields (HPFs), a prominent nucleolus, and fewer than five eosinophilic granulocytes per 10 HPFs has a more aggressive course and worse outcome, indicating that these histological criteria have prognostic value.\n\n【53】In angiosarcoma, local recurrence is frequent, prognosis is notoriously poor, and early metastases develop. Metastases to the lungs and other parenchymal organs are found in about 66% of cases\\[ 15 \\]. It is reported that the majority of patients die within one year of diagnosis, and this shows that angiosarcoma of bone is an aggressive high-grade tumor\\[ 17 \\]. In our case, one month after surgery, multiple distant metastases were observed, despite three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy (MAID).\n\n【54】The treatment of angiosarcoma is often quite challenging. The cornerstone of treatment is en bloc resection followed by as much adjuvant radiation therapy as possible\\[ 18 \\]. Surgery combined with immediate post-operative radiation therapy could be an optimal treatment method, even if complete resection is possible\\[ 19 \\]. In our patient, adjuvant radiotherapy was not performed, because she refused.\n\n【55】The role of chemotherapy remains undefined\\[ 19 \\]. Several anticancer drug combinations, including cisplatin with doxorubicin, cisplatin plus paclitaxel, and cisplatin plus doxorubicin plus paclitaxel, have been investigated\\[ 20 \\]. Abraham _et al_ .\\[ 13 \\] reported that doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimens, which are commonly used for other sarcoma subtypes, have also been used for angiosarcomas. Patients were generally treated with doxorubicin-based regimens or vinorelbine, and 64% of patients had at least a partial response to at least one regimen. Given these data, a combination of mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine – that is, the MAID protocol – was administered to our patient before and after surgery. However, post-operative CT scans revealed distant metastases in her liver and spleen. Prolonged responses were uncommon, and better systemic agents are clearly needed.\n\n【56】Recently, a novel t (1; 14) (p21; q24) translocation was described in angiosarcoma of bone\\[ 21 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cytogenic aberration reported in angiosarcoma of bone. However, small series have shown the involvement of tumor-suppressor genes such as _p53_ and _p16_ , mainly in angiosarcoma of soft tissue, suggesting a possible role in tumorigenesis in a subset of angiosarcomas. It is still unclear whether primary angiosarcoma of bone is a true separate entity or is similar to primary angiosarcoma of deep soft tissues. Further molecular studies might be required in order to investigate the different therapeutic targets.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【58】We present an extremely rare case of angiosarcoma of bone with a pathological fracture. Our case adds to the limited literature on angiosarcoma of the humerus. The cornerstone of treatment is en bloc resection followed by as much adjuvant radiation therapy as possible. However, the role of chemotherapy remains undefined, and better systemic agents are clearly needed.\n\n【59】Consent\n-------\n\n【60】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and the accompanying images.

Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are highly aggressive tumors, and when they develop in utero, the prognosis is even worse, with almost no reports of survival beyond the neonatal period. Herein, we report a case of a primary cervical MRT and describe our treatment using EXIT for securing the airway, wherein the infant’s life was saved.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 40-year-old Japanese woman with no relevant medical or surgical history was diagnosed with a fetal left cervical mass and polyhydramnios during the third trimester. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging indicated the possibility of postnatal airway obstruction, and delivery using EXIT was planned. The infant was delivered by a planned cesarean section at 39 weeks and 5 days gestation, and tracheostomy was performed using EXIT. Postnatal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed suspected metastatic lesions in the subcutaneous tissue, lungs, and thymus, in addition to the mass in the left cervical region. MRT was diagnosed by biopsy of a subcutaneous mass in the left thigh, and chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide was initiated. The tumors regressed, and the infant was successfully weaned from artificial ventilation. After discharge from the hospital, she had a recurrent cervical mass and intracranial metastasis, and radiotherapy was initiated.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In our case, fetal diagnosis enabled advance planning of delivery using EXIT, thus saving the infant’s life. The use of chemotherapy for MRT, which has a poor prognosis, allowed tumor regression and enabled the infant to survive beyond the neonatal period.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The widespread use of fetal diagnosis is enabling therapeutic interventions not only immediately postnatally but also prenatally. Fetal-onset cervical masses may cause postnatal airway obstruction, and ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) that maintains the fetal-placental circulation and secures the airway can be life-saving for infants \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】Reaching a definitive diagnosis of the mass immediately after delivery and selecting appropriate treatment methods are also important. Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), the malignancy present in our patient, are highly aggressive tumors with strong resistance to treatment and a high mortality rate \\[ 2 \\], and the correct choice of treatment will improve the quality of life (QOL) of both the infant and their family.\n\n【11】Fetal-onset MRT has an even worse prognosis. The only reported case of survival beyond the neonatal period was that of a single patient with an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) \\[ 3 \\]; however, to the best of our knowledge, no such cases of extracranial MRTs have been reported.\n\n【12】Herein, we report a case of an infant with airway obstruction by a fetal cervical mass that was diagnosed prenatally, wherein delivery using EXIT was planned, and describe the successful treatment that was life-saving. The appropriate therapeutic intervention resulted in contraction of the mass, enabling the infant to survive beyond the neonatal period, despite the poor prognosis of MRT.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 40-year-old Japanese primigravida nullipara underwent fetal ultrasound at 39 weeks and 3 days gestation that revealed a left cervical mass and polyhydramnios. This had not been noted in fetal screening during the first or second trimesters and was only identified in the third trimester. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning was performed the same day (Fig. 1 ), and the mass was found to consist of a massive solid component located at the base of the tongue adjacent to the airway. Given that postnatal airway obstruction or stenosis was a concern, the patient was transferred to a high-level children’s general hospital, which also included a department of obstetrics, to perform EXIT.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Nodule formation. Two nodules measuring 41 × 44 mm and 53 × 47 mm formed a continuous mass from the base of the tongue to the left buccal region\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The infant was delivered by a planned cesarean section, and a simple tracheostomy was conducted using EXIT. The infant was a girl born at 39 weeks and 5 days gestation, with Apgar scores of 2, 3, and 4 (1, 5, 10 minutes, respectively). After the airway had been secured using EXIT, she was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, sedated, and placed on artificial ventilation. On physical examination, her birth weight was 2870 g \\[– 0.3 standard deviation (SD)\\], head circumference was 33.5 cm (+ 0.1 SD), and body length was 51 cm (+ 1.0 SD). In addition to the left cervical mass and the mass at the base of the tongue diagnosed on fetal MRI, multiple subcutaneous lesions were also noted on the limbs and trunk. Blood tests showed that lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 2470 IU/L, alpha fetoprotein level was 42,580 ng/mL, human chorionic gonadotropin level was 19.3 mIU/L, and vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid test results were negative.\n\n【20】Cervical and surface ultrasound scanning conducted on postnatal day 0 revealed that the left cervical mass was an internally heterogeneous solid mass measuring 40 × 32 × 49 mm, with an abundant blood flow signal. A hyperechoic region was evident and considered to represent calcification. The multiple subcutaneous lesions included some with abundant blood flow and some with little blood flow containing hypoechoic regions.\n\n【21】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography conducted on postnatal day 5 (Fig. 2 ) revealed that the interior of the mass was severely necrotic. Masses were also present in the lower lobe of the right lung and the thymus and were considered to be metastases. There was no invasion of the cerebral parenchyma. A tumor biopsy was performed from a subcutaneous mass in the inner left thigh on postnatal Day 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 3 ) revealed a dense proliferation of undifferentiated tumor cells with round nuclei. Sites of hemorrhage and necrosis were present, and numerous mitotic figures and karyorrhexis were apparent. On immunostaining, the tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, CD99, desmin, myogenin, Nkx2.2, PHOX2B, tyrosine hydroxylase. Intranuclear expression of SMARCB1(INI1) was also absent (Fig. 4 ). From these results, MRT was diagnosed.\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Contrast enhancement is evident at the margins of the mass but is lacking at its center, which was necrotic\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the subcutaneous mass in the left thigh\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Fig. 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1/integrase interactor 1 (SMARCB1/INI1) intranuclear expression is lost\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide was initiated for the MRT on postnatal day 12. Mild myelosuppression occurred, but this was not sufficiently severe to warrant treatment discontinuation. Renal impairment and tumor lysis syndrome did not occur as chemotherapy side effects, and it was possible to continue treatment. At 2 months of age, the left cervical mass had clearly regressed (Fig. 5 ), and the infant was successfully weaned from artificial ventilation. She was discharged home at 6 months of age. Neonatal follow-up was performed, and at 9 months of age the patient had a recurrent cervical mass and intracranial metastasis, and radiotherapy was initiated.\n\n【35】**Fig. 5**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】Before and after treatment\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】Discussion and Conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【40】This study presents the findings of our case, wherein a fetal patient was diagnosed in utero with a cervical mass with the potential to cause postnatal fatal airway obstruction, and the infant’s life was saved by performing a tracheostomy using EXIT. Postnatal immunohistological testing led to an immediate diagnosis of fetal-onset MRT, and chemotherapy caused the tumor to regress, thus enabling the discharge of the infant and avoiding neonatal death.\n\n【41】In our case of a fetal-onset cervical mass, we successfully secured the airway by EXIT. The indications for EXIT are (1) expanding tumors of the head and neck or the oral region to congenital airway stenosis and (2) congenital pulmonary airway malformation \\[ 4 \\]. Moreover, reports of its use to secure the airway have been increasing in recent years, and its safety and efficacy have become well established \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. However, EXIT is not indicated in all cases of tumors of the head and neck, and the decision must be made based on the nature and location of the tumor. The presence of polyhydramnios, which reflects impaired passage through the esophagus as a result of pressure from the mass, is an important sign \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, because fetal MRI revealed a solid mass and polyhydramnios, postnatal airway obstruction was anticipated, and delivery by EXIT was planned. This case re-affirms the importance of fetal diagnosis, which enabled us to conduct a planned delivery and resuscitate the infant using EXIT to secure the airway.\n\n【42】In our study, immunohistological investigations were useful for the definitive diagnosis of MRT. Congenital cervical masses include branchial cleft cysts, vascular malformations, teratomas, thyroid goiters, and neuroblastomas \\[ 8 \\]. When proceeding with the differential diagnosis, the onset timing, anatomical location, internal structure, and properties were taken into consideration. In our case, necrotic tumorous lesions and multiple metastatic lesions were evident, and malignancies, including neuroblastoma and MRT, were therefore considered. MRTs have characteristic pathological findings, with rhabdoid cells having eosinophilic cytoplasm containing inclusion bodies and with eccentric nuclei \\[ 9 \\]. Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene SMARCB1(INI1) in the 22q region are characteristic, and a negative result for SMARCB1 on immunohistological staining is a specific finding \\[ 10 \\]. An accurate diagnosis is essential for the treatment of malignant tumors, and immunohistological staining is an important technique when proceeding with diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【43】In our case of fetal-onset MRT, the prognosis was anticipated to be extremely poor \\[ 3 \\]. However, neonatal death was avoided, and the patient was discharged home. MRTs are highly aggressive and generally fatal. Although standardized epidemiological data are lacking in the literature, a study from the UK has reported a 1-year survival rate of 31% in 106 patients with extracranial MRT \\[ 11 \\]. Reports from the European Paediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group and a single Chinese center also provided similar findings \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Reportedly, young age at onset is a poor prognostic factor \\[ 13 \\]. According to a systematic review, the neonatal survival rate of 72 patients with MRT that appeared in utero or during the neonatal period was 9.7% \\[ 3 \\]. In previous studies, metastatic lesions were already present at birth in all 14 patients diagnosed with MRT in utero, wherein 13 patients died within a few days of birth, and although the remaining one patient with an AT/RT survived for 13 months, severe mental retardation and residual brain tumor lesions were evident \\[ 3 , 14 , 15 \\]. In the case reported by Tergestina _et al._ in which the fetus was also delivered by EXIT, the infant survived birth but died of tumor lysis syndrome after 4 days \\[ 15 \\]. This case suggests that MRT is even more fatal when it arises in utero, as noted in our patient.\n\n【44】In our case of fetal-onset MRT, metastases were already present at birth. Based on findings from previous reports \\[ 13 , 14 \\], the prognosis was expected to be poor. After a definitive diagnosis of MRT, we immediately initiated chemotherapy, with the objectives of improving the infant’s QOL and giving her more time with her family. The infant responded well to treatment, the tumor shrank successfully, and she was discharged home at 6 months of age. Compared with previous reports, our study indicates that long-term survival is possible and that continued follow-up is desirable.\n\n【45】In conclusion, we planned delivery by EXIT in advance as a result of the fetal diagnosis, thereby avoiding postnatal airway obstruction. We initiated chemotherapy for fetal-onset MRT, which has an extremely poor prognosis, and succeeded in shrinking the tumor and avoiding neonatal death, while improving the infant’s QOL and giving her time with her family.\n\n【46】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【47】Not applicable.\n\n【48】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【49】AT/RT:\n\n【50】Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor\n\n【51】EXIT:\n\n【52】Ex-utero intrapartum treatment\n\n【53】MRI:\n\n【54】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【55】MRT:\n\n【56】Malignant rhabdoid tumor\n\n【57】QOL:\n\n【58】Quality of life", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion. Studies report recent infections or certain drugs as precipitating factors of a lymphocytic oculorenal immune response. The prognosis is usually favorable with topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a literature review and the case of a 14-year-old white girl, who presented to the ophthalmology department with features of one-sided uveitis. Upon transfer of patient to nephrological care, diagnostic work-up revealed renal involvement. Renal biopsy showed a mixed-cell and granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis with some noncaseating granulomas, leading to a diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome. With topical ocular and systemic corticosteroid therapy, the patients’ condition improved over several weeks.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of this syndrome, where cross-specialty care typically leads to a favorable outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare multisystem autoimmune disorder, presenting mainly with oculorenal pathology. Since its first recognition by Dobrin _et al_ . \\[ 1 \\], more than 300 cases have been reported worldwide \\[ 2 \\]. Here we present the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented to our department with unilateral anterior uveitis and concomitant signs of acute interstitial nephritis. Upon extensive work-up, the diagnosis of TINU syndrome was confirmed.\n\n【10】The case is worth to be presented as it showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate with only mild urine and biochemical abnormalities, but important histological changes on renal biopsy. Also, a review of published case series is provided.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 14-year-old white girl with unilateral anterior uveitis and abnormal urinalysis was referred from the ophthalmological care to our nephrology unit in November 2018. She had been seen at our out-patient clinic at the age of 12 years in 2016. Her family history was positive for elevated blood pressure. She was the first child of an uneventful pregnancy, born at 40 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3990 g and birth length of 53 cm.\n\n【13】Upon visit, she was seen due to elevated blood pressure with occasional tension-type headaches, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperlipidemia, which were a result of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. She reported no first-degree family members with metabolic syndrome or its complications. Ambulatory blood pressure monitor values were within reference ranges (average 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure 117 and 66 mmHg, respectively), so we implemented nonpharmacological lifestyle approaches. During follow-up, she received extensive evaluation, including endocrinological and dietary assessment, and was continued to be seen by our pediatric nephrologist twice per year.\n\n【14】In October 2018, aged 14 years, she presented to the Department of Ophthalmology with 1 week of redness, pain, epiphora, and loss of visual acuity of the right eye. She denied any recent drug exposure, allergy, infection, or symptoms of systemic illness. A diagnosis of acute anterior uveitis was made, followed by topical corticosteroid and cycloplegic treatment, which led to symptom alleviation.\n\n【15】### Investigations\n\n【16】A broad diagnostic work-up was performed. Renal ultrasound was normal. Also, chest radiography was also normal (Fig. 1 ), which in conjunction with a normal serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level and absence of cough excluded sarcoidosis, a known oculorenal offender. However, upon laboratory evaluation, marked elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 98 mm/hour), mild elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 13 mg/L), mild normocytic anemia (Hb, 113 g/L), elevated serum creatinine (80 µmol/L), mild proteinuria (0.38 g/day), microalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 58 mg/g), elevated values of alpha-1 microglobulin (urine alpha-1-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio, 3.24 mg/g), and normoglycemic glycosuria (1+) were observed. Immunological screening revealed elevated C3 complement fraction (C3, 2.01 g/L), with negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies (anti-DNA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) antibodies. These values indicated mild renal involvement and prompted a referral to our nephrology unit.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Chest radiograph in posteroanterior view. The radiological appearance of lung parenchyma was normal, which aided in ruling out sarcoidosis, a possible differential diagnosis\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Upon admission, she had no history of unexplained fevers, weight-loss, or other systemic symptoms. She had a pulse of 100 beats/minute, blood pressure of 126/81 mmHg, and body temperature of 36.5 °C. Her review of systems was negative, with a gradual improvement of symptoms and vision of the right eye. She continued both-sided topical cycloplegic and topical corticosteroid therapy. Borderline blood pressure values with repeated and persistent abnormal values of ESR, serum urea and creatinine, proteinuria, and glucosuria, indicating kidney injury, prompted a kidney biopsy.\n\n【22】Histopathology revealed focal tubulointerstitial nephritis. Interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate was composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, fewer neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells and rare noncaseating granulomata, with foci of invasion of lymphocytes into the tubules (tubulitis). Tubules in the affected areas showed signs of acute tubular injury—flattened, irregular, and vacuolated tubular epithelium. Glomeruli and vessels were unremarkable (Figs. 2 , 3 ). Immunofluorescence was negative. Electron microscopy showed no specific pathological findings. On the day of renal biopsy, 1 month after first symptom presentation, she also developed contralateral, left-sided anterior uveitis. A diagnosis of TINU syndrome was confirmed, based upon histopathological findings.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Renal biopsy sample A.

Next-generation sequencing did not demonstrate any disease-related variants.\n\n【32】### Treatment\n\n【33】The patient was started on methylprednisolone 60 mg daily, which improved the laboratory markers of kidney injury and allowed us to continue an alternate-day corticosteroid therapy regimen. She also received pantoprazole 40 mg daily, trimetoprim–sulfametoxazole 480 mg twice daily every other day for _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia prevention, and vitamin D supplementation 2000 units daily, together with topical ocular therapy (scopolamine, nepafenac, dexamethasone). Because of elevated blood-pressure readings, she began therapy with ramipril 2.5 mg and later 5 mg daily and received regular follow-up.\n\n【34】### Outcome and follow-up\n\n【35】After 3 months, upon evaluation at our out-patient clinic, her ocular symptoms improved, although she started having pain in her lumbar spine. Clinical examination showed a Cushingoid appearance with a 4 kg increase in body weight since discharge. Blood pressure values with antihypertensive therapy were normal. Lumbosacral spine X-ray imaging was normal, without signs of osteopenia (Fig. 4 ). This allowed a slow reduction in corticosteroid therapy upon following weeks and motivated her for implementation of healthy lifestyle measures.\n\n【36】**Fig. 4**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Lumbosacral radiograph—anteroposterior and lateral views. The radiograph of the lumbosacral spine did not show any fractures, which might occur with the patients’ prolonged corticosteroid therapy\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】At the most recent ambulatory office visit, two and a half years after onset of TINU, the patient denied any further ocular exacerbations, but she gained weight and had a body mass index of almost 35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Her 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure values were normal, as well as renal ultrasound examination, without presence of renal scarring. She was receiving ramipril 2.5 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily each, together with education on necessary lifestyle changes.\n\n【41】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【42】Our article presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first Slovene case of TINU syndrome in a 14-year-old girl in published literature. The diagnosis was suspected by the presence of renal and ocular findings, combining acute interstitial nephritis and anterior uveitis, and confirmed by renal biopsy. Current literature suggests that approximately 300 cases have been published \\[ 2 \\]. We present a literature review of 580 described cases. Table 1 presents the case series published in the last 10 years. Countries with published case series are presented in Fig. 5 and in greater detail in Table 2 .\n\n【43】**Table 1 List of published case series with two or more patients, published after the year 2010**\n\n【44】Full size table\n\n【45】**Fig. 5**\n\n【46】 \n\n【47】World map of published case series of TINU syndrome. Countries with published case series of TINU syndrome are presented, with a sum of 580 cases worldwide\n\n【48】Full size image\n\n【49】**Table 2 Reported case series of tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis, sorted by country and year of publication**\n\n【50】Full size table\n\n【51】### Pathophysiology\n\n【52】In 2001, Mandeville _et al._ \\[ 3 \\] proposed diagnostic criteria for TINU syndrome, comprising clinical and histopathologic features. Since then, studies have tried to elucidate the underlying mechanism of disease. Limited data suggest that modified C-reactive protein (mCRP), a uveal and renal tubular autoantigen, might play a role in eliciting an IgG-mediated oculorenal immune response \\[ 4 \\]. A novel human glycoprotein, Krebs von den Lungen-6, was also observed to be significantly increased in sera and distal renal tubules of TINU patients \\[ 5 \\]. Furthermore, certain interleukin-10 polymorphisms have been found to be more prevalent in TIN/TINU patients, broadening our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【53】### Differential diagnosis and epidemiology\n\n【54】TINU syndrome was shown to represent 15–65% of cases of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in pediatric renal care centers \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. It is essential to distinguish it from other causes of AIN, either drug-induced, autoimmune, metabolic, malignant, or consequential to a variety of infectious causes \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\].\n\n【55】A large case series \\[ 3 \\] suggests TINU shows a 3:1 female-to-male predominance, with a median age of 15 years. A UK-based study estimated the incidence as 1 per 10 million population per year \\[ 12 \\]. Several recent reviews confirmed peak incidence in adolescence and a female-to-male predominance \\[ 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\]. Genetic studies indicate a strong association with certain HLA haplotypes, especially variants DQA1, DQB1, DRB1, and DR14 \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\]. No disease-associated HLA variants were confirmed in our patient.\n\n【56】### Clinical presentation\n\n【57】TINU patients typically present with a viral-like illness, after which renal dysfunction is discovered. Alternatively, in about 20% of cases (including this case), the patient presents with symptoms of burning eyes and/or visual blurring \\[ 9 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\] and is subsequently discovered to have renal manifestations. This asynchrony prompts a high degree of clinical suspicion in treating young, female patients with AIN or acute uveitis. In a Finnish study \\[ 2 \\], which prospectively evaluated the presence of acute uveitis in biopsy-proven AIN at onset, at 3 and at 6 months afterwards, 16/19 (84%) of pediatric patients had uveitis within the observation period, half (8/16) without ocular symptoms. However, there are no guidelines or recommendations regarding ocular screening in patients with AIN.\n\n【58】Acute kidney injury is nearly universal in the setting of TINU and is usually in the mild-to-moderate range. It may be complicated with hypertension, which was also the case in our patient. In literature, cases of Fanconi syndrome and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in association with TINU have been described \\[ 23 , 24 \\], as well as progression to chronic kidney disease in adult and pediatric patients \\[ 25 \\]. Table 3 presents TINU characteristics in comparison with disease manifestations, seen in our patient.\n\n【59】**Table 3 Comparison of clinical characteristics of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis with our patient**\n\n【60】Full size table\n\n【61】### Pathohistological findings\n\n【62】Upon light microscopy, features of a predominantly CD3-positive lymphocytic infiltrate with fewer plasma cells and macrophages are present. A prominent eosinophilic infiltrate may be seen initially, as well as interstitial granulomas that can become confluent. Upon disease progression, the inflammation subdues, while variable amounts of interstitial fibrosis appear. The CD4-to-CD8 ratio varies. However, studies indicate a reciprocal T-cell profile in the kidney as compared with what is seen in peripheral blood, indicating that cellular immunity is active at the tissue level and decreased systemically \\[ 9 \\]. Tubular atrophy or tubulitis is also characteristic for TINU and is in accordance with clinical evidence of tubular dysfunction, reported in our patient and many cases of TINU \\[ 9 , 26 \\].\n\n【63】### Treatment\n\n【64】As in other uncommon disorders, there are no evidence-based treatment protocols, so the decision whether to initiate systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy depends on renal and ocular involvement. If nephritis is mild or in remission, topical steroids may be used to treat uveitis, though not efficient in posterior intraocular segment involvement \\[ 9 \\]. Systemic corticosteroids are generally reserved for cases of progressive renal involvement \\[ 3 \\] and are needed in about 80% of patients \\[ 27 \\]. Oral prednisone or prednisolone with a dosage of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day is usually used. The duration and schedule for tapering of steroid dose depends mainly on patient response \\[ 9 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 27 \\]. Because of frequent relapses and recurrences of disease, some authors suggest at least 12 months of oral corticosteroid therapy \\[ 28 \\], while others advocate an early and short course \\[ 29 \\], which was the case in our patient. We believe that, in the absence of evidence-based treatment protocols, a case-by-case management may be adopted \\[ 27 \\].\n\n【65】In a pediatric case series \\[ 2 \\], all 16 patients with TINU received topical ocular steroids. Mydriatic therapy was necessitated in 9/16 patients and antiglaucoma therapy in 6/16 cases. Surprisingly, oral prednisone did not influence occurrence of uveitis. In steroid-resistant cases or in exacerbation of disease after weaning from corticosteroid therapy, immunosuppressive medications such as cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil may be used \\[ 9 , 13 , 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【66】### Prognosis\n\n【67】Ocular and renal outcomes are usually good with appropriate treatment, as most respond to initial topical or systemic therapy. The disease may remit altogether or run a chronic or recurrent course, usually appropriately controlled through judicious use of immunosuppressive agents \\[ 9 , 20 , 30 \\]. Though early TINU literature held that renal disease often resolved spontaneously, repeat renal biopsy studies reported cases of continued nephritis after pulse corticosteroids \\[ 31 , 32 \\], mandating close follow-up of patients for several years after disease onset. Prompt corticosteroid therapy initiation also seems to play a role as demonstrated in a small case series, where a patient with delayed treatment demonstrated persistent elevations of beta-2-microglobulin and renal inflammation with subsequent renal damage \\[ 33 \\]. Additionally, severe TINU can lead to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis and kidney transplant \\[ 16 \\].\n\n【68】Most patients will maintain or improve eyesight from presentation. However, ocular disease recurs in up to 50% of patients after corticosteroid withdrawal \\[ 16 \\]. Younger age was identified as a risk factor for chronic uveitis, though few studies have evaluated the impact of systemic therapy on reducing that risk \\[ 16 \\]. Vision is seldom severely impaired, as demonstrated in a case series of 133 patients \\[ 3 \\], where vision outcome was rarely worse that 20/40. Therefore, optimal care incorporates joint nephrological and ophthalmic input, which was done in our patient.\n\n【69】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【70】This case highlights the need to maintain a high degree of suspicion and close follow-up in young, female patients who present with features of tubulointerstitial nephritis or uveitis. As there are no evidence-based protocols for treating TINU, management relies on case reports and case-series. The recommended treatment for uveitis is topical steroids. However, most cases necessitate systemic therapy with corticosteroids owing to renal involvement or in cases of posterior ocular involvement.\n\n【71】Immunomodulatory drugs may be used in resistant cases. With prompt therapy, prognosis of both renal and ocular involvement is usually favorable, though relapses might occur. Therefore, combined nephrological and ophthalmological care is warranted. Furthermore, there is a need for a multicenter study and registry formation to obtain important clinical data regarding follow-up and treatment of these patients, and a frameshift for implementation of multinational guidelines of treatment and prognosis.\n\n【72】### Learning points\n\n【73】*   •In patients presenting with uveitis and/or acute interstitial nephritis, a suspicion of TINU syndrome should be made, especially if young and/or female.\n    \n*   •Even when histological features of important tubulointerstitial nephritis and noncaseating granulomata can be found, as in our case, the urinalysis can show only mild urine changes with proteinuria and glucosuria, with no hematuria. In our patient with bilateral uveitis and marked elevation of ESR, a renal biopsy proved useful in guiding therapy.\n    \n*   •With prompt ocular and systemic corticosteroid therapy, prognosis of TINU is favorable, despite occasional relapses.\n    \n\n【74】### Patient’s perspective\n\n【75】I have to say that the overall care from both the Nephrology and Ophthalmology department was very professional. At first, I was quite shocked after I developed an inflammation of my eye, which did not allow me to see properly. Also, I was surprised that I had additional problems with my kidneys that I did not even notice. After several weeks of staying in the hospital, my nephrologist told me that I would have to undergo a kidney biopsy, the thought of which was quite scary. However, as I had already known the department staff for years, I trusted them fully and was not too worried after the diagnosis of TINU came. The therapy which was offered to me was quite tolerable, though I did not like gaining even more weight after being put on corticosteroids, which the doctors told me could happen. Coming home after more than a month, I am very happy to again attend school, and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as recommended.\n\n【76】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【77】Not applicable.\n\n【78】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【79】TINU:\n\n【80】Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis\n\n【81】ESR:\n\n【82】Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【83】CRP:\n\n【84】C-reactive protein\n\n【85】ANA:\n\n【86】Antinuclear antibodies\n\n【87】anti-ENA:\n\n【88】Anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies\n\n【89】anti-DNA:\n\n【90】Anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies\n\n【91】ANCA:\n\n【92】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\n\n【93】HLA:\n\n【94】Human leukocyte antigen\n\n【95】mCRP:\n\n【96】Modified C-reactive protein\n\n【97】AIN:\n\n【98】Acute interstitial nephritis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

If the foods they eat may interfere with the production of thyroid hormone, which can lead to development of serious hypothyroidism. The danger of health drinks should always be noted.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 72-year-old Japanese woman was previously diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis caused by a goiter and had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level (6.56 μIU/ml), a high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody level (>600 IU/ml), and a high antithyroglobulin level (> 4000 IU/ml) but normal levels of free triiodothyronine (3.08 pg/ml) and thyroxine (1.18 ng/ml). She presented to our hospital with sudden-onset general malaise, edema, and hoarseness with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (373.3 μIU/ml) level and very low triiodothyronine (< 0.26 pg/ml) and thyroxine (0.10 ng/ml) levels. It was determined that for 6 months she had been consuming a processed, solved health drink (“barley young leaf”) in amounts of 9 g/day, which included soybean and kale powder extract. Hypothyroidism might be affected by ingredients of health drinks. She discontinued consumption of the health drink immediately and began taking 12.5 μg of levothyroxine. The amount of levothyroxine was gradually increased every 3 days up to 100 μg. At day 61, her thyroid-stimulating hormone level had decreased (6.12 μIU/ml), her free triiodothyronine (2.69 pg/ml) and thyroxine (1.56 ng/ml) levels had increased, and her general condition was improved. Among risky foods lowering thyroid function, some experimental studies have revealed that isoflavones reduce thyroid function. Therefore, we measured the presence of isoflavones in the patient’s frozen serum with thin-layer chromatography. After she discontinued consumption of the health drink, two components quickly disappeared, and the other three components gradually decreased. On the basis of developing solvent composition and a positive ferric chloride reaction in thin-layer chromatography experiment, the five ingredients that disappeared or decreased were highly suspected to be soy isoflavones.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case emphasizes that consuming health drinks that include soy isoflavone powder extracts can lead to severe hypothyroidism.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Many people have thyroid conditions that make them susceptible to hypothyroidism. For example, 10% of a disease-free population was reported to have positive results for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) or antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) \\[ 1 \\], indicating that many patients have potentially chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. However, there are many exogenous foods influencing the thyroid. If the foods interfere with the production of thyroid hormone, they can cause serious hypothyroidism.\n\n【10】We report a case of a patient with severe hypothyroidism induced by consuming a health drink. To the best of our knowledge, there are almost no other reports of patients with severe hypothyroidism induced by isoflavone. The components of the substances suspected to be isoflavones disappeared or decreased along with the clinical impairment of our patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of isoflavone in the serum of a patient with severe hypothyroidism.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 72-year-old Japanese woman had been followed because of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis caused by a goiter. She had an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (6.56 μIU/ml), a high TPOAb level (> 600 IU/ml), and a high anti-Tg level (> 4000 IU/ml) but normal levels of free triiodothyronine (T3; 3.08 pg/ml) and thyroxine (T4; 1.18 ng/ml). Her past medical history included only hypertension. She did not have any fever or neck pain suggestive of subacute or painless thyroiditis during recent months, and she had not taken any medication that would reduce thyroid function. Her social, family, and environmental histories were also unrevealing.\n\n【13】The patient had been taking a processed, solved health drink (“barley young leaf”) in amounts of 9 g/day, which included soybean and kale powder extract, for 6 months. She had gradually developed general malaise, edema, and hoarseness. She presented to our hospital with sudden-onset elevated TSH (373.3 μIU/ml) level and very low T3 (< 0.26 pg/ml) and T4 (0.10 ng/ml) levels. Her levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, and immunoglobulin G were increased. These laboratory findings are shown in Table 1 . Her goiter was swollen with mild hardness; her blood pressure at admission was 123/77 mmHg; her body temperature was 36.0 °C; and her pulse rate was 55 beats/minute. Computed tomography (Fig. 1 ) and thyroid ultrasound revealed bilateral thyroid enlargement. In addition, her uptake rate of <sup>99m </sup> Tc-pertechnetate was reduced. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed severe hypothyroidism affected by ingredients of the health drink. She discontinued consumption of the health drink immediately and began taking 12.5 μg of levothyroxine. The amount of levothyroxine was gradually increased every 3 days up to 100 μg. After oral administration of levothyroxine, her high TSH levels decreased gradually, and her low free T3 and T4 levels increased. Her swelling and hoarseness disappeared, and her general condition improved. Her free T3 and T4 levels did not decrease in the follow-up period of the subsequent 6 months. The time line of this patient’s clinical course is shown in Fig. 2 .

Therefore, we measured the presence of isoflavone in the patient’s frozen serum at 5 points from before admission to day 102 for further investigation. A blood sample was pretreated as described previously \\[ 4 \\]. The sample was analyzed with thin-layer chromatography on precoated silica gel 60 F <sub>254 </sub> or RP-18 WF <sub>254 </sub> plates (Merck Millipore Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany), with detection achieved by spraying with iron(III) chloride solution. After she discontinued consuming the health drink, two components quickly disappeared, and the other three components gradually decreased (Fig. 3 ). On the basis of developing solvent composition and a positive ferric chloride reaction in thin-layer chromatography experiment, the five ingredients that disappeared or decreased were highly suspected to be soy isoflavones.\n\n【27】**Fig. 3**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Results of the thin-layer chromatography. After discontinuing health drink, two components (arrow heads) quickly disappeared and the other three components (arrows) gradually decreased. From the composition of the developing solvent and the positive findings of ferric chloride, these ingredients were speculated highly likely for soy isoflavone\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】Isoflavone, one of the isoflavonoids, is associated with breast cancer, prostate cancer, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Moreover, some researchers have reported that soy isoflavone might reduce thyroid function by suppressing thyroid peroxidase \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. In our patient, the components of the substances suspected to be isoflavones had disappeared or decreased along with her clinical impairment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in which the presence of isoflavone has been examined in the serum of a patient with severe hypothyroidism. This point is unique; to the best of our knowledge, there have been almost no other reports in which the presence of isoflavone has been examined in patient serum. The other following two mechanisms of hypothyroidism by soybean are considered: (1) An alcohol-soluble component in soybean inhibits iodide uptake \\[ 8 \\], and (2) phytic acid salt in soybean chelates the essential minerals, especially zinc, for thyroid hormone production \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. Our patient presented with severe hypothyroidism after 6 months of regular consumption of a health drink. Because the thyroid contains several months’ storage of thyroid hormone \\[ 11 \\], overt hypothyroidism might present late. It is necessary to investigate further the detailed mechanisms of hypothyroidism caused by soy isoflavones.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【34】This case emphasizes that consuming health drinks that include soy isoflavone powder extract can lead to severe hypothyroidism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease overlap with many other abdominal disorders, such as tuberculosis, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and others. Several publications in the literature describe that it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of this disease, despite the fact that many diagnostic armamentaria are available to suggest its presence. Most of the patients with Crohn’s disease are treated conservatively, and a few may require surgical intervention, especially those presenting with complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforations, and abscess as well as fistula formations, as seen in this index patient. Crohn’s disease is considered by many to be a very rare disease in Africa. It is interesting to know that Crohn’s disease, which affects mainly young adults, may debut at any age. The rarity and clinical curiosity of this entity suggested reporting of my patient’s case. Evidence-based up-to-date information on Crohn’s disease is also documented.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Crohn’s disease (CD), also referred to as regional enteritis, granulomatous enterocolitis, and terminal ileitis, is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of unknown cause that is often multifocal and can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) \\[ 1 \\]. It is generally accepted that the Scottish surgeon Dalziel gave the first account of the disease in 1913 \\[ 2 \\]. In the 1960s, Lockhart-Mummery and Morson described the involvement of the large intestine by CD \\[ 3 \\], and it was in the 1950s that anal and anorectal CD were described \\[ 4 \\]. In time, it became clear that CD can involve any part of the digestive tract and that extraintestinal manifestations can be present, especially in the skin, eyes, and joints \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【10】Epidemiological studies showed that CD has an incidence of 3 to 20 cases per 100,000 \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. CD is more common in the industrialized world, particularly in North America and Western Europe, though the incidence is rising in Asia and South America \\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]. There may be a slightly higher predominance of CD in women, and it is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish origin than in non-Jews. The exact pathogenesis of CD is unknown, although there are a number of genetic and environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of the disease and lead to the aberrant gut immune response characteristic of the disease \\[ 10 , 12 \\].\n\n【11】In a related development, other literature suggested a “north to south gradient” with respect to the incidence of CD. North America (7 to 10.3/100,000 per year), the United Kingdom (8.3 to 9.1/100,000 per year), and Northern Europe (5.8–6.3/100,000 per year) have the highest incidence of CD \\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]. The prevalence of CD also demonstrated a similar pattern, which is reported to be 207/100,000 per year in North America, 156/100,000 per year in the United Kingdom, and 90/100,000 per year in Northern Europe \\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. However, owing to limited information on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in southern countries, this “gradient” is not widely accepted.\n\n【12】Furthermore, there are only a few studies on the incidence and prevalence of CD in Latin America \\[ 14 , 21 \\]. Although the incidence of CD in South America has been surveyed to be lower than in North America, in the last 50 years, occidental countries have reported a rise in both incidence and prevalence of IBD \\[ 14 , 21 \\]. Another study mentioned that Puerto Rico has the lowest incidence of IBD within the southern American subregion \\[ 14 , 22 \\]. Yamamoto-Furusho, in his study of a Mexican population, reported an increasing incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) from 1987 to 2006, with a 2.6-fold increase from 1997 to 2006, compared with the previous decade. This increasing incidence of UC has been linked to environmental factors and the unique genetic mosaic of the Mexican population, but there is no information regarding CD incidence in Mexico to date \\[ 14 , 23 \\].\n\n【13】The rarity of CD and the prevalence of tuberculous enterocolitis in Africa and Asia in general tend to unnecessarily make clinicians hesitant to diagnose a CD both clinically and histologically \\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]. Its differentiation from UC is always a problem, but the distinction from tuberculosis is rather more difficult in developing countries if the lesion is granulomatous \\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]. Surgically resected bowel segments again require a close examination using various diagnostic criteria to diagnose or exclude a CD \\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]. This case of histopathologically confirmed CD is presented because of the rarity and clinical curiosity of this entity. Evidence-based, up-to-date information on CD is also presented.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 70-year-old man of Kumbo origin from the Northwest region of Cameroon was admitted to a rural mission hospital in Cameroon with a history of crampy right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, nonbloody, nonmucoid diarrhea alternating with constipation for the last 5 days. Anorexia and low-grade fever were observed, but no weight loss. Abdominal examination revealed the features of acute intestinal obstruction with an ill-defined mass in the right iliac fossa (RIF) and visible peristalsis. A chest radiograph was essentially normal. An abdominopelvic ultrasound scan showed dilated bowel loops and an RIF mass. An abdominal plain radiograph showed multiple air-fluid levels and dilated bowel loops. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan and barium enema study confirmed a complex ascending colonic and cecal tumor. The patient had a markedly raised white blood cell count of 40,300 cells/ml. The C-reactive protein was significantly elevated, and results of the tuberculin test and Genexpert test for tuberculosis were both negative. The patient’s blood pressure was 129/78 mmHg, and his pulse rate was 60 beats/min. He also had pyrexia (− 37.9 °C). In view of acute intestinal obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was performed after routine investigations. The intraoperative finding was a huge complex inflammatory mass involving the cecum, terminal ileum, and sigmoid colon. The patient subsequently had a sigmoidectomy with end-to-end sigmoidorectal anastomosis and a cecal resection, and the proximal ascending colon was exteriorized because end mucoid fistula and terminal ileostomy were performed. Figure 1 is a postoperative photograph showing the ileostomy and disposable stoma bag. Figure 2 is the immediate postoperative photograph of the resected complex mass involving the cecum, terminal ileum, and sigmoid colon. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed macroscopic appearance of a complex large mass (Fig. 3 ) involving the cecum, sigmoid colon, and terminal ileum, with congested swollen mucosa interspersed with diffused, irregular ulcerations with a cobblestone appearance (noncaseating granulomas in all layers of bowel wall from serosa to mucosa). Also, multiple fissures were present, as well as perforation and fistula seen between adjourning bowel loops, but no significant IBD was observed in nonulcerated mucosa. Microscopically, prominent and enlarged lymphatic follicles, proliferation of muscularis mucosa, and formation of fissures extending from mucosa to serosa along with gross edema. Marked infiltrates of inflammatory cells involved all the bowel layers; the details are depicted in Fig. 4 . Therefore, histopathological diagnosis of CD was made. The postoperative period was uneventful. Thereafter, the patient received five courses of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of azathioprine (AZA), methotrexate (MTX), mesalamine, and methylprednisolone. He had complete disease remission and subsequently underwent closure of the ileostomy with satisfactory postoperative status. The most recent follow-up abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy revealed disease-free status. The patient is also currently receiving a maintenance dose of rectal mesalamine and oral omeprazole treatment. He has been followed every 2 months in the surgical outpatient clinic over the last 16 months with a satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】The index patient\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Post op bowel specimen\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Colonic Crohn’s disease\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】The histopathology slide\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】CD causes inflammation of the digestive tract. It can affect any area of the GIT from mouth to anus; however, it most commonly affects the ileum \\[ 28 \\]. In CD, all layers of the intestine may be involved, and normal healthy bowel can be found between sections of diseased bowel. CD affects men and women equally in all age groups, with a predilection in the second and third decades and familial preponderance in a few \\[ 29 \\]. IBD was once considered rare in the developing world; its epidemiology is changing, and the incidence of both CD and UC is increasing in the Asia-Pacific region, India, Eastern Europe, and South Africa \\[ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 \\]. There have been very few reported cases of CD in black African patients in Kenya and South Africa \\[ 34 \\]. The symptoms, anatomical distribution, signs, and pathology in black patients in Africa and America are similar to those described in white individuals. The disease is probably underdiagnosed in Africa because of difficulties in distinguishing schistosomiasis and tuberculosis of the bowel \\[ 24 , 35 , 36 , 37 \\]. The etiology of CD remains incompletely known, although several theories have been issued, such as the involvement of genetic factors, environmental factors (including diet), and infective agents \\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\]. CD is directly correlated with a triad of predisposing factors, including genetic problems, immune system malfunctions, and environmental factors \\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\].\n\n【34】CD usually presents with abdominal pain especially due to involvement of ileum, blood-stained diarrhea, and anemia. Some patients with CD may have low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. Fissures or cracks may be evident, and fistulas and abscesses may form in anal involvement \\[ 38 \\]. CD may also present with extraintestinal manifestations such as skin or mouth lesions, pain in the joints, eye irritation, kidney stones, gallstones, and other diseases of the hepatobiliary system \\[ 39 \\]. Affected children may have delayed milestones. Patients with severe cases of CD may have most common complications such as intestinal blockage with thickening and fibrosis of the affected segment \\[ 40 \\].\n\n【35】The diagnosis of CD is a clinical one and can be quite difficult, given that the presenting symptoms can be insidious and nonspecific \\[ 41 \\]. Red flag symptoms that require further evaluation include weight loss, bloody diarrhea, iron deficiency, and nighttime awakenings.\n\n【36】Similarly, significant family history of IBD, unexplained elevations in the C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or other acute-phase reactants (for example, ferritin and platelets), or low vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> should prompt further investigation for possible CD. Laboratory findings that are useful in CD are hypoalbuminemia, elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, anemia, or leukocytosis \\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\]. The serologic markers of clinical importance are the anti- _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ antibodies, which are commonly positive in CD, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, which is negative for CD \\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\]. These tests are suggestive of CD but are not meant to be interpreted as diagnostic tests, because positive results could be present in a healthy population The main utility of these antibodies is for differential diagnosis in patients with characteristics of CD and other diseases, including UC \\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\].\n\n【37】In spite of the widely used diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, barium x-rays, CT scans, and colonoscopy, a clear diagnosis of CD may remain obscure. Although no single “gold standard” indicator of this disease has been established, it is indeed possible to make an ideal diagnosis based on the patient’s clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and pathologic data; meanwhile, colonoscopy, capsular endoscopy, and laparoscopy significantly assist clinicians worldwide in elucidating the diagnosis \\[ 42 \\]. Both computed tomography enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) allow visualization of the bowel wall, mucosa, and extraluminal complications. CTE and MRE have supplanted small-bowel barium studies as the criterion standard for the diagnosis and assessment of CD \\[ 14 , 43 \\].\n\n【38】Treatment and prognosis of the disease depend on several factors. The Montreal classification considers age of onset, location, and behavior of the disease, as well as presence of perianal disease, for categorization; many decisions regarding diagnostic approach, treatment, follow-up, and prediction of several outcomes, ranging from response to therapy to long-term prognosis, depend on this classification (Table 1 ) \\[ 44 \\].\n\n【39】**Table 1 Montreal classification \\[ 10 \\]**\n\n【40】Full size table\n\n【41】Furthermore, for severity scoring, there is an extensive number of validated scores such as the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), mainly used in clinical trials because of its complexity, and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index used in the clinical setting owing to its simplicity (Table 2 ) \\[ 45 , 46 , 47 \\].\n\n【42】**Table 2 Crohn’s Disease Activity Index \\[ 14 \\]**\n\n【43】Full size table\n\n【44】There is a global resolve among clinicians that the treatment of CD should depend on disease severity, location of disease, and subtype of disease (that is, inflammatory, stricturing, or penetrating). Attempts are also being made to determine individuals who are at risk for aggressive CD and who may require earlier and more aggressive therapies. Risk factors for aggressive disease activity include age of diagnosis less than 30 years, extensive anatomic involvement, perianal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgery, and stricturing and/or penetrating disease \\[ 10 , 48 \\]. One of the biggest challenges associated with CD is that after 20 years of disease activity, 80% of patients will require surgery, and approximately 30% will require surgery within 5 years of diagnosis \\[ 10 , 41 , 48 \\]. Although the goal of medical therapy is to maintain remission without the need for surgery, once strictures and/or fistula complications occur, surgery may be required. Unfortunately, because surgery is not curative for CD, many patients will require multiple surgeries over their lifetime \\[ 10 , 49 \\].\n\n【45】There are a number of different drugs used to treat CD, as highlighted in Table 3 . Mesalamine has been evaluated in a number of studies but has not been shown to effectively induce or maintain remission in CD. The perceived benefit of mesalamine is likely related to its safety profile \\[ 10 , 41 \\]. Antibiotics are also used in CD, but the evidence supporting their use is also limited \\[ 50 \\]. The main role of antibiotics is to treat the suppurative or perianal complications of CD \\[ 51 \\].\n\n【46】**Table 3 Medications, monitoring, and adverse events <sup>a </sup> \\[ 10 \\]**\n\n【47】Full size table\n\n【48】Immunosuppressants, including AZA, mecaptopurine (MP), and MTX, have been used for many years to treat CD. These drugs are typically used to maintain remission because of their slow onset of action. However, more recent studies question the overall efficacy of AZA/MP as monotherapy and their use in early CD \\[ 10 , 52 , 53 , 54 \\]. Newer reports have suggested that these drugs can be used in combination with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs to decrease their immunogenicity and also to increase anti-TNF drug concentrations. The mainstay of therapy for CD has been anti-TNF agents.\n\n【49】More recently approved drugs are monoclonal antibodies directed against certain integrins (α4 or α4β7) or interleukins (IL-12/IL-23). The first anti-integrin approved for CD was natalizumab, but this is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal brain infection \\[ 10 , 55 , 56 \\]. Vedolizumab is a gut-selective anti-integrin that has not been associated with PML and is used mostly to maintain remission in moderate to severe CD with only modest effectiveness at induction of remission \\[ 10 , 57 \\]. In contrast, the most recently approved agent, ustekinumab, an IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor, has been shown to be as effective as anti-TNF therapy at inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe CD \\[ 10 , 58 \\].\n\n【50】Ultimately, the goal of medical therapy is to induce and maintain a steroid-free clinical remission, prevent complications and surgery, and improve the patient’s quality of life \\[ 10 , 59 \\]. For typical medication, complications, and monitoring recommendations, _see_ Table 3 .\n\n【51】A significant number of patients with CD can be managed by adopting a conservative approach that includes adequate rest, a nutritious diet, multivitamins, iron, folic acid, antioxidants, and sulfasalazine. Surgical therapy is useful in refractory disease and when complications such as occlusion, abscess, and fistulas develop. Though surgery is required to relieve obstruction, to repair a perforation, to treat an abscess, or to close a fistula, a judicious approach to treating the patient is of utmost importance regarding the decision whether to intervene or to continue with conservative management to avoid life-threatening complications \\[ 2 \\]. This evidence confirmed the role of surgical intervention as reported in the index patient.\n\n【52】The outcome of CD has improved with good medical care. It is serious, but it is not a terminal illness. Mortality in these patients is due to risks of surgery or associated diseases \\[ 60 \\]. These patients require very regular follow-up even if they are well, and any new symptom should be given due consideration. The index patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of AZA, MTX, mesalamine, and methylprednisolone. He had complete disease remission.\n\n【53】With respect to prognosis, the literature suggests that almost all patients with CD have complications; perianal disease is present in approximately 50%. Approximately 40% will develop active disease within the first 3 years, and disease remains inactive over time in only a small percentage \\[ 14 , 61 \\]. The majority will require bowel resections and several surgeries. A review showed that 10 years after diagnosis, 85% had the same disease location; however, the initial pattern will change after 25 years \\[ 14 , 61 \\]. Stenosis or penetrating complications will be found in 60% of patients in the first 5 years, which will require intensive medical treatment (immunomodulatory and/or biological therapy) \\[ 14 , 61 \\].\n\n【54】The most recent postoperative abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy revealed disease-free status in the index patient. The index patient is currently receiving a maintenance dose of rectal mesalamine and oral omeprazole treatment. He has been followed every 2 months in the surgical outpatient clinic over the last 16 months with a satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【55】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【56】CD is considered by many as a very rare disease in Africa. It is interesting to know that CD, which affects mainly young adults, may debut at any age. The symptoms of CD may mimic many other abdominal conditions for which medical attention is required. However, it should be kept in mind as one of the causes of acute abdomen, especially in those patients who have a long history of intestinal pathologies whose treatments greatly differ. Establishing an appropriate treatment in order to avoid short- and long-term complications, which may be life-threatening, depends mainly on distinguishing between other inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract and CD. A histopathologically confirmed diagnosis becomes very necessary also because of the emerging evidence that there is an increased risk of adenocarcinoma in patients with CD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Recently, small round cell tumors caused by chromosomal translocations have been collectively termed Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) \\[ 2 \\]. We report herein a patient with ESFT arising in the left adrenal gland who achieved complete remission and long-term survival after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 22-year-old nulligravid Asian woman consulted a local clinic with a chief complaint of left thoraco-abdominal pain for 2 months. She was introduced to our hospital after diagnostic imaging revealed a large retroperitoneal tumor with tumor thrombus of the inferior vena cava. She did not have any complications or relevant past or family history. Results from blood testing, including tumor markers and hormonal examinations, and urine testing were all within normal ranges. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed irregular contrast enhancement of a left retroperitoneal tumor measuring 19 cm in diameter, along with tumor thrombus in the left adrenal and renal veins and inferior vena cava (Fig. 1 a). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an encapsulated multilocular tumor with a partially solid component, showing hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging, irregular hyperintensity with septa on T2-weighted imaging, and strong signals on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. 1 b–d). Strong accumulation was seen on <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.2 and no distant metastases (Fig. 1 e). Preoperative transthoraco-abdominal and intraoperative transesophageal ultrasonography revealed tumor thrombus in the vena cava extending into the right atrium (data not shown). The patient underwent en bloc tumorectomy with left adrenalectomy and nephrectomy, and thrombectomy by open-heart and open-abdominal surgery. The right atrial tumor thrombus was excised from the distal side via both vena caval and right atrial approaches under complete circulatory arrest as a deep hypothermic procedure without distal clamping of the vena cava. On day 4 after surgery, a tumor embolism that might have migrated intraoperatively was found in the left pulmonary artery. The tumor was urgently resected by left thoracotomy (Fig. 1 f).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Preoperative CT, MRI, and FDG-PET. **a** Contrast-enhanced CT reveals irregular contrast in a left retroperitoneal tumor 19 cm in diameter, showing tumor thrombus in the left renal vein, adrenal vein, and vena cava.

The cross-sectional surface was grayish white in color with internal necrosis (Fig. 2 a). Microscopic findings for the tumor using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining included uniform small, round cells with round nuclei, intense chromatin staining, and a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio proliferating solidly and showing a partially rosette-like structure. Frequent mitosis was evident, with a count of 32 per 10 high-power fields. Small cells resembling the existing adrenal cortex were occasionally observed in the region just below the capsule, so the tumor was considered to have been primarily derived from the adrenal gland (Fig. 2 b). Immunohistochemical examination of the tumor with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)99 and Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI-1) antibodies yielded strongly positive results (Fig. 2 c, d), but results for CD34, leukocyte common antigen, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, chromogranin A, and desmin were negative (data not shown). We performed a dual-color, break-apart fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) assay to identify the chromosomal break point of Ewing’s sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) in paraffin-embedded tissue (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). EWSR1 in this case showed gene splitting in 87% of cells. Typical EWSR1 break-apart signals are shown in Fig. 2 e. These findings led to a final diagnosis of ESFT.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Macro- and microscopic findings of the tumor, and FISH assay of tumor cells. **a** The tumor cross-section is grayish-white in color with internal necrosis. **b** Microscopic examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining reveals uniform small round cells with round nuclei, intense chromatin staining, and a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio proliferating solidly and partially showing a rosette-like structure.

Before commencing chemotherapy, oocytes were conserved. Grade 4 neutropenia resolved with administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and chemotherapy was tolerated. The patient has shown no signs of recurrence or organ dysfunction, including the kidneys as of 26 months postoperatively. At present, childbearing is not desired by the patient, and they have no plan to use conserved oocytes.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Previously reported cases of adrenal ESFT with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava are summarized in Table 1 \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. Primary adrenal ESFT most commonly occurs in young adults, with a median age of 26 years (range 20–34 years). No sex difference has been noted. The most typical presenting complaint for patients with ESFT of the adrenal gland is abdominal pain. Median tumor diameter is 14.9 cm (range 11.3–22 cm), including the present case. Recently, ESFT including ES, extraskeletal ES, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin tumor has been recognized as originating from the primitive neural tube, with a common translocation of the _EWSR1_ gene at chromosome 22q12. Approximately 85% of ESFT show translocation with _FLI-1_ , and the _EWSR1_ / _FLI-1_ chimeric fusion gene resulting from t(11:22)(q24:q12) may lead to tumorigenesis. Ten percent of cases involve translocations with ETS-related gene ( _ERG_ ) by t(16;21)(p11;q22), and translocations with ETS variant transcription factor 1 ( _ETV1_ ), _ETV4_ and fifth Ewing’s variant ( _FEV_ ) have been reported rarely, each with frequencies less than 0.1% \\[ 9 \\]. Immunostaining with anti-CD99 and FLI-1 antibody, and FISH assay to confirm fusion genes, are useful investigations to reach the final diagnosis of ESFT.\n\n【24】**Table 1 Nine cases of Ewing’s sarcoma originating from the adrenal gland with inferior vena cava thrombosis**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】Radiological imaging, including CT, MRI, and FDG-PET, contributes to the initial detection and determination of the extent of tumors and distant metastases \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, CT and MRI also contributed to diagnosis of the origin, detailed surgical planning, and detection of tumor emboli in the pulmonary artery after the initial surgery.\n\n【27】The standard therapy for adrenal ESFT is complete resection and combination chemotherapy, as in this case using VDC-IE \\[ 10 \\]. The 5- and 10-year survival rates of patients with ESFT are 69% and 62%, respectively, in patients with completely resected tumors for localized ESFT \\[ 11 \\]. In our review of the literature, complete resection resulted in good prognosis for patients with adrenal ESFT, even with direct infiltration to the kidney, spleen, inferior vena cava, and right atrium, or even pulmonary tumor emboli from surgical maneuvers, as in the present case. Incomplete resection might be a factor associated with poor prognosis (Table 1 ). The standard chemotherapy for patients with adrenal ESFT is according to the traditional therapy for ES. No consensus has been reached regarding the priority of surgery or chemotherapy for primary localized adrenal ESFT. In our case, surgery was prioritized because of the symptomatic disease and tumor thrombus reaching the right atrium. Complete wide excision is necessary for patients with localized ESFT. Subsequent external irradiation therapy is recommended if complete tumor excision is not achieved, or if the patient did not show good response to prior chemotherapy \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】We encountered a rare case of primary adrenal EES with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava. The combination of complete tumor excision and combination chemotherapy may provide good prognosis for patients with localized ESFT.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】Not applicable.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】ES:\n\n【34】Ewing’s sarcoma\n\n【35】EES:\n\n【36】Extraskeletal Ewing’s sarcoma\n\n【37】ESFT:\n\n【38】Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors\n\n【39】CT:\n\n【40】Computed tomography\n\n【41】MRI:\n\n【42】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【43】DWI:\n\n【44】Diffusion-weighted imaging\n\n【45】FDG-PET:\n\n【46】Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography\n\n【47】SUV:\n\n【48】Standardized uptake value\n\n【49】HE:\n\n【50】Hematoxylin and eosin\n\n【51】CD:\n\n【52】Cluster of differentiation\n\n【53】FLI-1:\n\n【54】Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor\n\n【55】LCA:\n\n【56】Leukocyte common antigen\n\n【57】FISH:\n\n【58】Fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization\n\n【59】EWSR1:\n\n【60】Ewing’s sarcoma breakpoint region 1\n\n【61】VDC-IE:\n\n【62】Vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide, etoposide\n\n【63】ERG:\n\n【64】ETS-related gene\n\n【65】ETV1:\n\n【66】ETS variant transcription factor 1\n\n【67】FEV:\n\n【68】Fifth Ewing’s variant", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "07bb739d-504b-41f7-8bc2-a83dba56c2ad", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Insulinomas are rare clinical entities, but concurrent diabetes mellitus is even more uncommon, and the combination is easily missed. Recurrent hypoglycemia could be misconstrued as improved glycemic control. We present an unusual patient with type 2 diabetes and neuroglycopenia, with apparent improved glycemic control due to an insulinoma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 54-year-old mixed ancestry man with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension 8 years prior to admission. He presented with episodes of abnormal behavior and hypoglycemia. Inappropriately high insulin and C-peptide concentrations were identified at the time of hypoglycemia. Despite poor adherence to his diabetic treatment, he had no target organ damage relating to diabetes, and his hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 5.3%. A diagnosis of insulinoma was made, and he was started on diazoxide, with endoscopic ultrasound revealing a possible lesion in the pancreatic tail measuring 12 mm × 12 mm. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy could not be performed due to overlying splenic arteries and the risk of vascular perforation. An intraoperative ultrasound confirmed a 15 mm × 10 mm tumor in the pancreatic tail, necessitating a partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy, which were curative. A well-differentiated intermediate grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor producing insulin was confirmed on histopathology.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Recurrent, progressive hypoglycemia and improved glycemic control in a diabetic, without an alternative explanation, may suggest an insulinoma. Insulinomas that exist with type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly malignant insulinomas, must have escaped autoimmune attack through lack of autoantigen expression. Computed tomography on its own may be insufficiently sensitive for diagnosis of insulinomas, whereas endoscopic and intraoperative ultrasonography may improve the identification of the culprit lesion.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Hypoglycemia accounts for significantly increased mortality rates in diabetes. The coexistence of insulinoma and diabetes is so rare that there are only a few published case reports. In addition, there has been a case of insulinoma in which, despite stopping sulfonylureas, hypoglycemic episodes persisted \\[ 1 \\]. We report a rare case of insulinoma in a 54-year-old man with pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus and a significant family history of diabetes. Despite poor adherence to therapy, he had unexplained well-controlled diabetes, hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) of 5.3 %, and recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, predominantly in the fasting state. As the diagnosis remains challenging, especially among diabetics, insulinoma is frequently diagnosed postmortem, due to the apparent optimal glucose control \\[ 2 \\]. When hypoglycemic unawareness is present, it may be life-threatening, since it can induce irreversible brain damage, subsequent cardiac arrhythmias, and death.\n\n【10】Hypoglycemia is common, with potentially fatal consequences. The estimated rate of severe hypoglycemia events (needing emergency services) per patient per year ranges from 0.90 to 1.50 in patients with type 1 diabetes, but much lower in type 2 diabetes (from 0.30 to 0.63 per year) \\[ 3 \\], where it is associated with an advanced clinical course and endogenous insulin deficiency. Hypoglycemia is associated with poorer quality of life and has significant financial implications. Complications of diabetes, malabsorption, associated endocrinopathies (for example, primary hypoadrenalism), factitious use of insulin, and psychological factors can predispose to hypoglycemia. The treating physician should always consider overly tight glycemic control, renal insufficiency, and pregnancy, and that previous hypoglycemia begets a future of hypoglycemia.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 54-year-old married mixed ancestry man and father of four children, working in the construction industry, was diagnosed simultaneously with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension 8 years prior to admission. He also had a significant family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with his father and two of his brothers affected, all of whom are deceased, having suffered complications of ischemic cardiac failure and renal failure, respectively. However, none of the siblings had a history of admission for recurrent hypoglycemia. The father of the index subject died at 70 years of age, having had ischemic cardiomyopathy, which necessitated coronary artery bypass graft surgery prior to this event, whereas his two brothers died from diabetic nephropathy at age 48 and 50 years. In addition, there was no family history suggestive of pituitary disease or hyperparathyroidism. Between 2010 and 2017, our patient presented several times to his primary care physician with blood glucose measurements greater than 26 mmol/L. At each of these visits, he received short-acting human insulin and intravenous fluid. His final presentation to the primary health care facility with hyperglycemia occurred 12 months prior to admission.\n\n【13】His current presentation on June 27, 2018, involved a referral to his secondary care hospital, having been asymptomatic for a year, with no episodes of hyperglycemia except for weight gain of 14 kg in the preceding 3 months. According to his family, he suffered from confusion and sleepwalking, particularly in the early hours of the morning between 03:00 and 08:00. These symptoms occurred almost every day, associated with generalized body weakness and sweating, which were noticeable after each episode. His family reported physical and verbal aggression and confusion. During additional episodes in hospital, he was noted to be combative with the nursing staff and fellow patients and was found to be hypoglycemic on several occasions. Our patient appeared to develop symptoms indicative of hypoglycemic unawareness, as he manifested with no sympathetic symptoms, despite glucose concentrations below 1.8 mmol/L (3.8–5.5 mmol/L). During this admission, he exhibited recurrent episodes of fasting and post-prandial hypoglycemia, which measured between 1.2 and 3.0 mmol/L.\n\n【14】The possibility of nonconvulsive seizures was entertained; thus a computed tomography (CT) brain scan was ordered and found to be normal, whereas an electroencephalogram was not available at the secondary care facility. He was transferred to a tertiary hospital for evaluation by the endocrine service.\n\n【15】At admission, his chronic medications were metformin, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and simvastatin **.** Aside from metformin, he was not taking any oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin and denied using any other agents. Pharmacy records failed to identify that he had received either a sulfonylurea or insulin. The two-hourly ward glucose measurements showed recurrent hypoglycemic episodes ranging from 1.2 to 3.4 mmol/L, occurring between 03:00 and 08:00.\n\n【16】Clinical examination failed to identify insulin injection sites or evidence of target organ damage relating to diabetes, hypertension, or any other chronic disease. In particular, he had no indication of melanoderma.\n\n【17】Investigations\n--------------\n\n【18】In view of the fasting hypoglycemia, the results of the investigations are shown in Table 1 . In summary, the biochemical tests showed episodes of hypoglycemia with inappropriately high insulin and C-peptide levels, suggesting that the cause may be endogenous insulin secretion. The sulfonylurea screening was negative.\n\n【19】**Table 1 Results of appropriate investigations directed at determining the cause of hypoglycemia**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】His HbA1c was 5.3%; the renal and hepatic function, serum calcium and phosphate levels, serum cortisol level (8:00 am), parathyroid hormone (PTH), pituitary function tests, and metanephrines were normal. His cortisol rose from 109 to 556 nmol/l within 30 minutes of a 250-microgram Synacthen <sup>® </sup> test, excluding primary hypoadrenalism. The serum potassium and sodium were 3.2 and 138 mmol/L, respectively Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was 215.1 mU/L (55–248 mU/L). Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry of plasma and urine were negative for the following sulfonylureas: glimepiride, gliclazide, glyburide, glipizide, and gliquidone.\n\n【22】Given the prior history of type 2 diabetes, recent onset of symptomatic fasting hypoglycemia, and the inappropriately elevated serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations, a diagnosis of insulinoma was considered. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a lesion measuring 12 mm × 10 mm in the tail of the pancreas (see Fig. 1 A). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a lesion measuring 10 mm × 12 mm which suggested an accessory spleen in the pancreatic tail (see Fig. 1 B).\n\n【23】**Fig. 1**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of our patient. **A** CT of the abdomen showing a 12 × 10 mm mass lesion of the tail of the pancreas. **B** MRCP showing 10 × 12 mm mass in the pancreatic tail in keeping with an accessory spleen (arrow is indicating the lesion)\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】In view of the discordant reports on abdominal CT and MRCP, an endoscopic ultrasound was performed, which suggested a 12 mm × 12 mm lesion in the pancreatic tail (see Fig. 2 A). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was not performed due to overlying splenic arteries and the risk of vascular perforation (see Fig. 2 B).\n\n【28】**Fig. 2**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】**A** Endoscopic ultrasound of our patient showing a 12 × 12 mm mass lesion of the pancreatic tail; **B** endoscopic ultrasound showing a mass lesion of the pancreatic tail with overlying splenic arteries (risk of perforation on fine-needle biopsy)\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】In view of the increasing number of hypoglycemic episodes and unawareness, diazoxide 75 mg was initiated and titrated up to 100 mg every 8 hours. An intraoperative ultrasound confirmed a 15 mm × 10 mm tumor in the pancreatic tail, necessitating a partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy (see Fig. 3 ). The histopathologic findings were in keeping with a well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, grade 2, producing insulin (see Fig. 4 ). The well-circumscribed, 12-mm-diameter tumor was composed of nests and ribbons of cuboidal epithelial cells with small round central nuclei, speckled chromatin, and moderate amounts of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, in a fibrous stromal background. There was no necrosis. The tumor was confined to the pancreas, with no lymphovascular or perineural invasion seen. There were zero mitotic figures per 10 high power fields, but the Ki67 proliferation index was 3%, corresponding to grade 2 of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 classification. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positive staining for synaptophysin, and weak positive staining for chromogranin A and insulin.\n\n【33】**Fig. 3**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】Intraoperative ultrasonography, searching for the tumor in our patient.

A pneumococcal vaccine was administered as prophylaxis for overwhelming postoperative streptococcal infection (OPSI).\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】We present our patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, significant family history of type 2 diabetes, and recent onset of recurrent symptomatic hypoglycemia due to an insulinoma. The insulinoma most certainly modified his diabetic control, such that he did not need either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin.\n\n【44】The association between diabetes and insulinoma is rare. In a retrospective study from the Mayo Clinic comprising 313 cases of confirmed insulinoma between 1927 and 1992, there was only one patient with pre-existing diabetes \\[ 4 \\]. A Japanese review of 443 cases of insulinoma between 1976 and 1990 identified only one patient who had concurrent diabetes and insulinoma \\[ 5 \\]. In a review from Taiwan of 23 cases of insulinoma spanning 22 years, only one patient had type 2 diabetes \\[ 5 \\]. There are a few case reports of insulinoma in patients with type 1 diabetes. Insulinoma may mask the existence of type 1 diabetes or cause recurrent hypoglycemia and decreased insulin requirement in a type 1 diabetic patient \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【45】In 1962, a report suggested an association between insulinoma and a family history of diabetes \\[ 7 \\], and about 30% of patients with insulinoma had a family history of diabetes in a series of the Mayo Clinic \\[ 8 \\]. A possible explanation for a positive family history of diabetes may be insulin resistance and, consequently, exuberant elaboration of insulin. The increase in insulin secretion can theoretically result in hyperplasia of islet of Langerhans cells, which maintains a relative normoglycemic state. However, it is conceivable that without appropriate control mechanisms and a degree of autonomy, an insulin-secreting beta cell tumor could develop \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【46】An insulinoma may also mask diabetes. In some case reports of insulinoma with concurrent diabetes mellitus, the diabetes was only diagnosed after the tumor was resected \\[ 5 , 9 \\]. There are also case reports where insulinomas were only diagnosed on postmortem examination of diabetes patients \\[ 3 \\]. Overall, the coexistence of diabetes mellitus and insulinoma is rare, and there are no reported cases in South Africa. We recommend examining patients for primary or secondary hypoadrenalism, IGF-1, C-peptide, ketones, sulfonylurea concentrations, and in some instances insulin in cases of unprovoked hypoglycemia in a diabetic.\n\n【47】The occurrence of persistent hyperglycemia following surgical removal of the insulinoma suggests underlying diabetes, bearing in mind the possibility of damage to the pancreas during the surgical procedure and giving rise to diabetes, rather than a prior diagnosis of diabetes. In cases of coexistent type 1 diabetes mellitus, the blood tests reveal low levels of serum C-peptide and high titers of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody; histological examination of the resected specimen may reveal insulitis in non-tumorous pancreatic tissue in which beta cells had already disappeared \\[ 6 \\]. In addition, there was infiltration of the insulinoma by inflammatory cells, as if it were insulitis of type 1 diabetes, suggesting the existence of anti-islet autoimmunity \\[ 6 \\]. The absence of both proven autoimmunity and inflammatory infiltration together with adequate glycemic control on oral hypoglycemic agents suggests type 2 diabetes mellitus. A prolonged supervised fast is a gold standard test to evoke hypoglycemic episodes and is also useful in patients with diabetes mellitus \\[ 10 \\]. This was not performed in our patient, as he manifested with unprovoked hypoglycemia. Considering their relative accuracy, continuous glucose monitoring devices may replace the prolonged fast in the near future. As expected in benign insulinoma, we did not encounter local tumor effects (local, regional organ or vascular compression), as these are described very rarely.\n\n【48】The majority of insulinomas are benign, whereas between 5 and 12% are malignant \\[ 9 \\]. Only 22 cases have been published demonstrating the association between malignant insulinoma and diabetes \\[ 11 \\]. There is no difference in the pattern of recurrence of hypoglycemia at presentation of patients with benign versus malignant insulinoma. However, we expect hypoglycemia to be more frequent and severe in the presence of malignant insulinoma depending on the size of the tumor and presence of metastases. A case report demonstrated paradoxical weight gain in a subject who had both type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignant insulinoma, and the explanation for the weight gain lies in recurrent eating to avoid hypoglycemia \\[ 10 \\]. Distinction between malignant and benign tumors can only be made by the presence of metastasis, as there are no specific morphologic, biochemical, or genetic features distinguishing them. Histologically, insulinomas are epithelial neoplasms associated with strong and diffuse immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. Most patients with malignant insulinoma have lymph node or liver metastases and, rarely, bone involvement \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【49】It has been proposed that the insulin-producing cells in a malignant insulinoma and type 1 diabetes suggest that the insulin-producing malignant cells must have escaped autoimmune attack that otherwise had completely destroyed the beta cells of the patient \\[ 6 \\]. No evidence of an inflammatory response in the resected tumor or normal pancreatic tissue could be identified \\[ 6 \\]. It is speculated that a lack of auto-antigen expression in the insulinoma cells or their ability to escape immune surveillance in other ways accounts for an absence of inflammatory response, particularly in coexisting type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【50】In our case and most of the available case reports of associated insulinoma and diabetes, hypoglycemia was successfully treated on diazoxide, and the surgical resection of the tumor was curative \\[ 9 \\]. In instances where malignant insulinomas did not respond to surgical resection, alternative therapies such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), after failure of everolimus and chemotherapy (streptozocin and capecitabine), have been used to achieve remission. On the other hand, there are reported cases of malignant insulinoma refractory to diazoxide and long-acting somatostatin analog using lanreotide \\[ 12 \\]. By contrast, pasireotide, a multi-receptor-targeted somatostatin analog, exhibits a strong inhibitory effect of insulin secretion, and this has been documented to be effective in medical management of insulinoma \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【51】Malignant insulinomas confer a truncated life expectancy after diagnosis, and substantially shorter if there are metastases. The major sites of metastasis or recurrence are the liver and regional lymph nodes \\[ 10 \\]. The coexistence of diabetes mellitus and malignant insulinoma may result in a delay in diagnosis, but there is no evidence to suggest that it worsens the prognosis.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【53】We report an unusual association of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulinoma. The apparent improvement in glycemic control and development of hypoglycemia, despite not using any hypoglycemic therapy, indicated a sinister underlying cause. Insulinomas are rare, especially among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and there is a heavy reliance on CT scans of the abdomen to aid in diagnosis. It is acknowledged that intraoperative ultrasound may not always be available and may be impractical for smaller lesions. In cases when these lesions are suspected, they should be referred to a tertiary center for evaluation. Successful resection of the benign insulinoma eliminated further hypoglycemic episodes and was curative, whereas malignant insulinomas confer a poor prognosis.\n\n【54】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【55】The authors grant permission for the use and dissemination of all enclosed data and material.

We report on our experience with a facial onset sensory and motor neuropathy case in our outpatient pain clinic.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 71-year-old Japanese man with a previous diagnosis of trigeminal nerve palsy complained of facial paresthesia, cervical pain, and arm numbness. Cervical facet arthropathy was diagnosed initially, but neither pharmacotherapy nor nerve blocking alleviated his symptoms. We suspected bulbar palsy based on the presence of tongue fasciculation, which prompted referral to a neurologist. Based on a series of neurological examinations, facial onset sensory and motor neuropathy was ultimately diagnosed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Pain clinicians must be mindful of rare diseases such as facial onset sensory and motor neuropathy; if they are unable to make a diagnosis, they should consult with other competent specialists.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Facial onset sensory and motor neuropathy (FOSMN) is characterized by facial-onset sensory disturbance that can later spread to the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities; this stage is followed by motor neuron loss \\[ 1 \\]. FOSMN is a very rare neurological disease, with about 100 cases reported worldwide as of 2020 \\[ 1 \\]. Despite the diagnostic criteria that might be formulated based on known cases, the diagnosis of FOSMN is considered difficult even for veteran neurologists. In this report, we present a case of FOSMN to emphasize to pain specialists that knowledge regarding uncommon disease such as FOSMN is essential for differential diagnosis, and that they should refer these cases to relevant specialists if they are unable to make a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 71-year-old Japanese man (height: 170.2 cm; weight: 54.5 kg) was referred to our outpatient clinic with the chief complaints of right facial numbness and itching, cervical pain, and right arm numbness with spasms in 2020. The patient’s history indicated that had been taking a calcium channel antagonist for hypertension (amlodipine, 5 mg/day) for the past 10 years. In 2016, he developed numbness and hypoesthesia in the right side of all branches of trigeminal nerve distribution and was diagnosed with idiopathic trigeminal nerve palsy. He has been taking gabapentin, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and clonazepam; however, these drugs did not improve his symptoms. In 2019, the patient developed cervical pain and right arm numbness; he was diagnosed with no evidence of a neurological abnormality.\n\n【12】At his first visit in 2020, he had complained of right facial numbness and itching, cervical pain, and right arm numbness. His medical records indicated a right facial palsy with mild numbness localized to the right cheek that might be gradually expanding. However, the sensory disturbance had not spread beyond the face at the time of the first visit.\n\n【13】A seemingly involuntary spasmodic twitching was noted at the right labial commissure. In addition, his speech was slightly slurred, and the right side of his mouth would fatigue with continued mastication, suggesting oral dyskinesia or a similar neurological disease. Right-dominant bilateral trapezius muscle tenderness and pain of 62 mm in visual analog scale were observed. The sites of the right arm numbness (rated 9/10) and triceps spasm were consistent with C6 involvement. Manual muscle testing was not performed at this time. Blood biochemistry results were within normal limits. On plain cervical radiographs, cervical straightening from C2 to C7 was observed in the lateral view, while signs suggesting stenosis of the right C6 intervertebral foramen were observed in the oblique view. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence of disc protrusion at C5/6 and at C6/7, with no apparent spinal compression or right C6 neuroforaminal stenosis.\n\n【14】These findings suggested a diagnosis of cervical discogenic pain or facet arthritis, and his facial symptoms suggested oral dyskinesia or another neurological disease, but not trigeminal nerve palsy. We prescribed mirogabalin (5 mg/day), extended-release paroxetine (12.5 mg/day), and clonazepam (0.5 mg/day) to be taken at bedtime, as well as biperiden (2 mg/day). However, this did not improve his symptoms after 1 week. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, we performed a stellate ganglion block at the second visit; however, this sympathetic nerve block also failed to improve his symptoms.\n\n【15】Because we observed tongue fasciculation while examining his complaints of dysphagia at his third visit, we diagnosed bulbar palsy as the cause of his dysphagia. We referred him to the neurology department, where an examination revealed evidence of hypoesthesia and muscle weakness in the right C6 distribution, tongue fasciculation, muscle weakness during neck extension, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes. At the first visit to the outpatient service of neurology, the neurologist noted a progressive weight loss. Consequently, the neurological findings were as follows: sensory disturbance in the left trigeminal area and motor weakness on the left face, dysphagia, dysarthria, perioral fasciculation, tongue atrophy, and fasciculation. Attenuation of the corneal and blink reflexes as well as bulbar palsy were confirmed in a series of neurological tests. In the manual muscle strength test, weakness was observed in the trapezius, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscle, but the muscle strength of the lower limbs was normal. The patient also had a positive Trömner reflex but showed no abnormalities in the Romberg test, suggesting upper motor neuron disease with pyramidal tract involvement. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed atrophy of the tongue, trigeminal nerve, and masseter and temporalis muscles. Based on these collective findings, FOSMN was diagnosed, and a neurologist assumed responsibility for the patient’s treatment. The patient’s muscle weakness, weight loss, conversational difficulties, and dysphagia rapidly progressed following our encounters, necessitating a tracheotomy and gastrostomy.\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】First reported as a “syringomyelia-like” condition by Vucic _et al._ in 2006 \\[ 2 \\], FOSMN is an exceedingly rare sensorimotor disorder characterized by the onset of facial sensory abnormalities and gradual progression. FOSMN occurs twice as often in men as in women, and has a mean age of onset of 54 years and a mean duration of 8.9 years \\[ 2 \\]. Although the etiology of FOSMN has not yet been clarified, an association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is suggested based on the pathological study of transactivation response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) \\[ 3 \\]. It has been reported that progressive facial paresthesia is the first indication of the disease in approximately 91% of cases, and bulbar palsy occurs in 97% of cases \\[ 4 \\]. Grudzińska _et al._ \\[ 5 \\] reported that the bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria and dysphagia, emerge in the second half of the disease’s course, along with attenuation/extinction of the corneal and blink reflexes.\n\n【18】We initiated treatment based on a suspected diagnosis of idiopathic trigeminal nerve palsy with cervical spondylotic changes at his first visit. However, tongue fasciculations combined with unresponsiveness to stellate ganglion blocking and pharmacotherapy suggested bulbar symptoms, which prompted us to refer him to the neurology department. According to a retrospective review of his medical history, facial paresthesia 5 years prior might have been the first manifestation of FOSMN; this evolved to muscle weakness in his head and neck, resulting in pain from facet arthropathy as he struggled to maintain head posture. He also suffered from C6 radiculopathy based on hypoesthesia in the right C6 dermatome and cervical instability, which was exacerbated by the same muscle weakness. Therefore, in the diagnosis of a rare disease such as FOSMN, these important points of a patient’s medical history might be reconsidered. The diagnosis was made because his physical and laboratory findings matched most of the clinical features of FOSMN described in the manuscript by Zheng _et al._ \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【19】In addition, de Carvalho _et al._ described that a patient diagnosed with cramp-fasciculation syndrome presented with muscle spasms and fasciculation throughout the body in later stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \\[ 6 \\]. Therefore, his right arm spasms might have been a manifestation of cramp-fasciculation syndrome, according the evidence linking FOSMN with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \\[ 5 \\]. This question requires further detailed testing to resolve. Although we were able to diagnose FOSMN in the present case, we emphasize that an accurate assessment of a patient’s neurological findings at a pain clinic is very important to recognize rare diseases such as FOSMN. Moreover, it is important that we must be informed of the existence of such rare diseases and promptly consult with other specialists.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】We treated a patient in our outpatient service whose chief complaints were facial numbness and itching, cervical pain, and right arm numbness with spasms. Based on the results of a series of examinations for neuromuscular disorders, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with FOSMN, a very rare sensorimotor disorder. Pain medicine specialists must be cognizant of rare diseases such as FOSMN, and should refer such patients to other competent specialists if they are unable to make a definitive diagnose.\n\n【22】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【24】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【25】ALS:\n\n【26】Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n\n【27】CFS:\n\n【28】Cramp-fasciculation syndrome\n\n【29】FOSMN:\n\n【30】Facial onset sensory and motor neuropathy\n\n【31】TDP-43:\n\n【32】Transactivation response DNA binding protein 43", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is the first case of this association without widespread disease.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Primary breast carcinoma is the most common neoplasm in women. Whereas metastases to the breast from extramammary malignancies are extremely rare, a frequency of 0.5% to 6.6% has been reported in clinical and autopsy studies. The common primary sites in order of decreasing frequency are malignant melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and cancer of the lung, stomach, prostate and ovary \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The cervical origin is rarely reported, and often occurs in widespread disease with multiple other metastatic sites, notably lung.\n\n【11】Splenic metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is exceptional; to the best of our knowledge, only three cases of isolated splenic metastasis have been reported in the literature \\[ 3 – 5 \\]. Here, we present the first case of the association of breast and splenic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】We report the case of a 55-year-old North African woman, with no relevant antecedents, who presented with squamous cell uterine cervical carcinoma stage IIb according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria. She had no distant metastasis, and was treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy with 46 grays on the pelvis with cisplatin (40mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. The patient was cured on clinical and radiological evaluation and was on regular follow-up. She remained in a stable condition for eight months until she presented with a painful nodule in her left breast, and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. A physical examination found a hard nodule of 2cm in major axis without inflammatory signs or lymph nodes. A mammography was performed and showed a bifocal malignancy in the upper-internal quadrant of her left breast classified as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category IV (BI-RADS IV). An excisional biopsy with histological study demonstrated a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor 1% status (Figure 1 , Figure 2 ). A pelvic examination under general anesthesia showed no suspicious lesion. The thoracoabdominal pelvic and brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large splenic isolated hypodense lesion sized 100mm at the largest diameter (Figure 3 ). There was no lymphadenopathy or other visceral involvement on the CT scan.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**Microphotography showing neoplastic cell proliferation organized in nests of tumor cells, within the mammary tissue.** Stain: hematoxylin and eosin; magnification: 100×.\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Microphotography showing neoplastic cell proliferation organized in nests of tumor cells with rare union bridges.** Stain: hematoxylin and eosin; magnification: 400×.\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Computed tomography image showing a large hypodense splenic lesion.**\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Based on previous history of tumor, the imaging and the histopathology findings, our patient was considered in splenic and intramammary metastatic relapse from the squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.\n\n【27】She undertook a chemotherapy regimen based on paclitaxel 175mg/m <sup>2 </sup> and cisplatin 50mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every three weeks, with poor tolerance after three cycles and poor general condition, with a performance status of three according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria. For that reason, we stopped chemotherapy and our patient died three months later.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases in women worldwide. The pattern of metastatic diffusion initially involves pelvic lymph nodes, followed by para-aortic nodes and then distant sites. The most frequent sites of distant recurrence are lungs, extrapelvic nodes, liver, and bones \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【30】The breast is an exceptional site of metastasis from cervical carcinoma and generally occurs in widespread disease, with multiple other metastatic sites, notably lung metastases \\[ 7 \\]. Our patient had breast and splenic metastasis, another unusual site, without other localizations.\n\n【31】The splenic isolated metastasis is exceptional in solid tumors, occurring approximately in 1% of the autopsy studies \\[ 8 \\]. And squamous cervical carcinoma origin has been reported in only three cases in the literature \\[ 3 – 5 \\].\n\n【32】The physiopathology of breast and splenic metastasis in cervical cancer is unknown; extending mechanisms through blood and lymph nodes have been suggested \\[ 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【33】The breast metastases pose a major differential diagnosis with primary breast cancers whose management and prognosis are different. A comparison of clinical and pathological data is needed for a correct diagnosis. An immunohistochemical study if of interest, especially if the breast tumor is revealed \\[ 11 \\]. In our patient, the history of cervical cancer was very helpful and clinically suggestive of mammary metastasis.\n\n【34】The management of cervical carcinoma with metastasis to the breast or spleen is not clear as it is a rare clinical entity. The majority of the reports used palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【35】The prognosis of breast metastasis is poor as it implies widespread tumor dissemination. Most patients die within the year following the diagnosis \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】We report the first case of the association of two uncommon metastatic sites from uterine cervix carcinoma. The clinical history of our patient helped us to establish the diagnosis, but once the metastasis is revealed, we have to be careful to distinguish the primary site of the metastasis, because treatment modality and prognosis are very different.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next-of-kin for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Only a few case reports have described lung cancers that secrete beta-human chorionic gonadotropin.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 68-year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for the past two months. On examination, he was found to have generalized lymphadenopathy, and radiologic workup revealed numerous metastases in the lungs, liver and kidneys. Biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node revealed metastatic large cell lung cancer with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hormone positivity. The serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 11,286 mIU/ml (upper limit of normal, 0.5 mIU/ml in non-pregnant females). He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung non-small cell lung cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy. He was discharged home with hospice care.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The markedly elevated serum values of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin initially prompted the medical team to investigate germinal tumors. In the presence of a negative testicular ultrasound, workup was performed to find an extratesticular source of the tumor. Finally, the diagnosis was made with a tissue biopsy. This case illustrates that atypical markers can be seen in many cancers, emphasizing the role of immunohistochemistry and tissue biopsy in establishing the diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is commonly produced by germ cell tumors and seldom produced by other tumors. In the literature, a few case reports discuss the ectopic production of β-hCG in small cell and non-small cell lung cancers. We present an unusual case of lung cancer with ectopic production of β-hCG.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 68-year-old Caucasian male patient with medical history significant for depression, emphysema, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to his primary care physician for a routine office visit. Medications at home included paroxetine, tiotropium, and omeprazole. Blood work revealed a hemoglobin level of 7.4 mg/dl with a hematocrit of 20 mg/dl, and then he was sent to the Emergency Department for transfusion. He reported that he had experienced decreased appetite and significant weight loss for the past two months. He had never seen a primary doctor until recently, when he was diagnosed with depression, emphysema, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Family history was significant for a sister with colon cancer and his mother with multiple myeloma. He was a long-term smoker with an 80-pack-year history of smoking. On physical examination, vital signs were BP, 112/68 mm Hg; RR, 16/minute; PR, 88/minute; and temperature, 97.9°F. Chest auscultation revealed diffusely scattered coarse rhonchi. The abdomen was soft with no organomegaly. The testes were soft and were not enlarged. No lymphadenopathy was noted.\n\n【12】In the context of the anemia and the recent weight loss, a workup for malignancy was initiated. The patient underwent colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). No polyps or ulcerated lesions were noted on the colonoscopy. The EGD revealed esophageal candidiasis and chronic gastritis. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive generalized lymphadenopathy. The left supraclavicular, paraesophageal, paratracheal, and subcarinal lymph nodes were enlarged and a 2.3 cm right hilar mass was seen. Multiple nodules were found in the lungs bilaterally, the largest one measuring 2.7 cm in diameter. A 2.5 cm mass was noted in the periphery of the left upper lobe (Figure 1 ). Several hypodensities were noted in the kidneys, liver, and spleen (Figure 2 ). An ill-defined necrotic retroperitoneal mass measuring 14.4 cm, encasing the abdominal vasculature, was seen in the periaortic and aortocaval areas (Figure 3 ). At that point, the working diagnosis was metastasis with an unknown primary tumor. Differential diagnoses included lung cancer and germ cell tumors. Further blood work revealed a β-hCG level of 11,286 mIU/ml. α-Fetoprotein and prostate-specific antigen were negative. Ultrasound of the testes revealed neither testicular enlargement nor lesions. At that point, the possibility of primary testicular germ cell tumor was excluded. On day 4, the patient underwent a left supraclavicular lymph node excision. The histopathology revealed metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal positivity for β-hCG (Figures 4 and 5 ). Immunohistochemistry revealed CK, 7; AE1/AE3, β-hCG, CAM 5.2, and P63 positivity (Figure 6 ). CK 20, CEA, CA 19-9 AFP, and TTF were negative (Figure 7 ). These markers were consistent with a poorly differentiated or undifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma (squamous type) with β-hCG positivity. He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer with ectopic secretion of β-HCG. The patient and the family opted for palliative treatment.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Right hilar mass noted with multiple pulmonary nodules scattered throughout the lung parenchyma.**\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Multiple hypodensities noted in the liver, and an isolated lesion noted in the head of the spleen.**\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**A massive conglomerate of periaortic, aortocaval lymph nodes and retroperitoneal necrotic mass measuring up to 14.4 cm, which encases the abdominal vasculature.**\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Figure 4**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**Biopsy of supraclavicular lymph node showing undifferentiated giant cells.**\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Figure 5**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】**Immunohistochemistry showing focal positivity for β-hCG.**\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Figure 6**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】**Immunohistochemistry showing cells that stain positive for P63, highly suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.**\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】**Figure 7**\n\n【38】 \n\n【39】**Immunohistochemistry showing positivity for CK 7 on the cell membrane, suggestive of a carcinoma, most likely lung.**\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【42】Lung cancer is the most common cause of worldwide cancer mortality in men and women, causing approximately 1.2 million deaths per year \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【43】Ectopic beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) expression by non-gestational tumors was noted in the early 1900s, and β-hCG secretion has been noted in gastric, ovarian, liver, and lung cancers \\[ 2 \\]. Despite this, lung cancer with β-hCG production is rare, and only a few case reports have been published in the literature \\[ 3 – 5 \\].\n\n【44】We do not know why non-gestational cells produce β-hCG. Several studies have tried to look into β-hCG production. In a study published from Japan, mRNA transcripts of the beta gene were detected in lung cancer tissues, and the result of the study was that β-hCG production was noted in malignantly transformed lung cells \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【45】How β-hCG acts also is not clear. Some studies have indicated that it acts as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor or both by inhibiting apoptosis \\[ 7 \\]. _In vitro_ studies suggest that β-hCG may inhibit transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) receptor complex by binding to a component of the receptor complex, thus blocking its binding sites. This prevents further interactions with other receptor components, eventually leading to apoptosis \\[ 7 \\]. This may explain why β-hCG-producing tumors appear to be more aggressive and have a worse prognosis.\n\n【46】Similarly, other studies have shown that small cell lung cancer with β-hCG production results in a more-resistant tumor and worse prognosis, in chemoresistance, and that elevated β-hCG values are more commonly seen in patients with metastatic disease \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【47】Although ectopic expression of β-hCG is now a recognized phenomenon, and studies have shown that its production by non-gestational tumors indicates a poorer prognosis, it is not clear whether it should be widely used as a prognostic marker and routinely measured in the patient's serum.\n\n【48】The mechanism of β-hCG production by the tumor cells is not well understood, and the action is at best speculative. Only a few studies have been done in this field, and more is required before it can be stated definitely that lung cancer with ectopic β-hCG production is indeed associated with a worse prognosis, worse stage, and chemoresistance.\n\n【49】Consent\n-------\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

It has been reported that many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presented neurological symptoms that involve the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, there have been several reports of patients who presented Guillain–Barré syndrome related to  COVID-19 , with sensory and motor compromise in the extremities.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In this report, we describe a rare case of Guillain–Barré syndrome in a 50-year-old Hispanic male with bilateral facial palsy as the only neurological manifestation, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A complete neurophysiological study showed severe axonal neuropathy of the right and left facial nerves.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Regardless of severity, clinicians must to be aware of any neurological manifestation generated by COVID-19 and start performing more neurophysiological tests to determine if the infection induces an axonal, myelin, or mixed involvement of the peripheral nervous system.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) owing to its similarity to the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is a highly pathogenic and rapidly spreading virus \\[ 1 \\]. Around 36% of patients in a Wuhan hospital presented neurological symptoms related to the virus, compromising the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and skeletal muscle \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】There have been several reports of patients who presented Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) related to COVID-19 with neurological affectation days or weeks after respiratory symptoms \\[ 3 \\]. The prevalence is unclear and the total number of patients with concurrent GBS and COVID-19 remains unknown as more cases are published every day. Moreover, despite most of the patients having the typical motor/sensory syndrome, there are also case reports of other variants \\[ 4 \\]. To our knowledge, 73 cases of adult patients suffering from GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\] have been reported, most of them presenting motor and sensory syndrome.\n\n【11】To date, there are 17 reported cases in the literature of patients with GBS and facial nerve palsy associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of them with limb compromise (that is ascending weakness, areflexia in the lower extremities, unsteady gait) and sensory symptoms (that is, ascending paresthesias, reduced sensation to pinprick) \\[ 6 , 10 , 11 \\]. Only one case reports bilateral facial palsy without other neurological findings \\[ 10 \\]. In the present case report, we describe a patient previously diagnosed with COVID-19 who attended our hospital (Fundación CardioInfantil—FCI) with bilateral facial nerve palsy, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome known as facial diplegia. Given that previous reports of COVID-19-associated GBS have greater sensory and motor compromise in extremities, the present case has the particularity of having only bilateral facial nerve compromise. In contrast to previous reports of facial diplegia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we included a complete neurophysiological test to characterize the type of nerve injury.\n\n【12】Case report\n-----------\n\n【13】### Clinical history\n\n【14】On 1 May 2020, a previously healthy 50-year-old Hispanic male presented with a 2-day history of slurred speech, with particular difficulty in the pronunciation of some consonants and closed vowels, trouble closing eyes, and bilateral facial droop. He reported no numbness, extremity weakness, inability to swallow, or blurry vision, among other neurological manifestations. He had had contact with his father, who died of SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 month prior to the admission. Around the time of this contact, he presented asthenia, ageusia, and hyporexia with two positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the first one 19 days prior to the onset of neurological symptoms and the second one 6 days before arriving at the emergency department. He received management with hydration and paracetamol for symptoms such as asthenia, adynamia, and nasal congestion. He was not taking any medication prior to diagnosis, and he did not smoke or consume alcohol. He denied exposure to environmental toxins or chemicals and was unemployed.\n\n【15】On admission, his vital signs were normal (pulse 78 beats per minute, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, temperature 36 °C), as was the general physical examination. Because the patient had not signs of respiratory distress (saturation ≥ 90%), thoracic X-rays were not taken. Neurological examination revealed mild dysarthria and bilateral facial palsy (House–Brackmann grade III). No other cranial nerve abnormalities were found. There were no meningeal signs. He had normal gait without limb weakness or areflexia. Blood cell count showed lymphopenia (199 cells/µL) without any other relevant findings. Non-contrasted and contrasted brain MRIs were performed without pathological findings. A lumbar puncture was done at day 6, with the presence of albuminocytologic dissociation (0 cells, proteins 210 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stains and culture were negative. No antiganglioside antibodies were available at our institution. The same day, neurophysiological studies (electromyography and nerve conduction) reported severe acute axonal neuropathy of both right and left facial nerves, with prolongation of latency and severe amplitude reduction in all the motor potentials recorded bilaterally. Also, a drastic reduction was recorded in recruitment patterns in facial muscles, with interference patterns less than 30%. All those changes suggest denervation (see Tables 1 , 2 , Figure 1 for details). Motor and sensory conduction studies in the upper and lower extremities were normal (see Additional file 1 for details-supplementary material).\n\n【16】**Table 1 Electromyography study showing significant reduction in recruitment patterns in the orbic oris, orbic oculi, and nasalis muscles bilaterally.

However, the patient declined the procedure for personal reasons. The patient was monitored in hospital for 8 days without developing motor symptoms or additional neurological deterioration and without receiving immunomodulatory treatment. He was discharged with a physical rehabilitation program. At a follow-up performed 30 days after discharge, the patient presented complete recovery.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】We presented the case of a previously healthy 50-year-old Hispanic male recently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, who was admitted to the hospital without neurological manifestations except for symptoms and signs of bilateral facial nerve palsy. According to the history and physical examination, he was diagnosed with bilateral facial diplegia, an uncommon variant of GBS. Albuminocytologic dissociation was found on CSF study. Brain images were assessed with no pathological findings. Interestingly, the GBS-related symptoms he presented were only facial, but in contrast with previous reports, we included a neurophysiology study that reported severe acute axonal neuropathy of the right and left facial nerves with prolongation of latency and severe reduction of the amplitude in all the motor potentials recorded bilaterally.\n\n【27】Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral nervous system. Its manifestations typically involve weakness and sensory symptoms that begin in the lower extremities and progressively ascend until the arms and face are compromised \\[ 14 \\]. It has been proposed that a previous infection generates an immune response, which in turns cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of its molecular mimicry, resulting in acute polyneuropathy with axonal and/or myelin involvement \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. Diagnosis is made taking into account the patient’s clinical history and neurological examination, and is associated with changes in the CSF such as albuminocytologic dissociation (CSF protein > 0.55 g/L with no increase in white blood cell count) or electrophysiology studies, including F-wave and H-reflex suggesting peripheral nerve compromise. These features are important for the differentiation of different subtypes of GBS \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【28】In addition to the typical clinical presentation described previously, other less frequent GBS variants have been described, including bilateral facial nerve palsy \\[ 16 \\], as in the case of the above-mentioned patient. Up to 10% of GBS patients present facial weakness as the main clinical manifestation of this disease \\[ 17 \\], and 20–60% of the cases with motor symptoms have reported bilateral facial involvement \\[ 18 \\]. Other manifestations documented in patients with GBS and bilateral facial palsy were sensory symptoms including paresthesias and reduced perception of pinprick, and motor involvement with areflexia and weakness \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Less common symptoms were positive Romberg sign and hypogeusia \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【29】As mentioned previously, around 73 cases of GBS related to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\], mostly with respiratory symptoms prior to neurological impairment. Other variants included Miller Fisher, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and bilateral facial nerve palsy, as in the case of our diagnosed patient. Seventeen cases of facial involvement variants have been reported in the literature. Of these, one presented bifacial weakness as the only neurological manifestation \\[ 10 \\] while others were described as motor or sensory symptoms followed by facial diplegia \\[ 6 \\]. In one case, facial palsy preceded motor symptoms \\[ 19 \\], and in the others, the facial palsy and weakness or paresthesias developed at the same time \\[ 6 , 11 \\]. Recently, a case of Bell’s palsy on the left side of a 65-year-old woman in China associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported, though without preceding fever, cough, or any other respiratory symptoms. The patient recovered after antiviral treatment; however, no neurophysiological or CSF test was performed \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【30】It is already known that GBS could be triggered by prior bacteria or virus infections, such as _Campylobacter jejuni_ , influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein–Barr virus \\[ 14 \\]. Taking into account the revised literature and the temporal relationship between the infection and the onset of symptoms described in our case, it is possible that the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 causing GBS via inflammatory reaction through immune mimicry is similar to that proposed for other pathogens \\[ 21 , 22 \\]. However, this should be further characterized with the continuing and growing evidence on the implications of COVID-19 in this pathology.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as a potential trigger of GBS and all its variants. Clinicians should be aware of this possible risk when treating a COVID-19-positive patient, independently of the severity of their respiratory condition.\n\n【33】Considering the large number of neurological disorders induced directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2, a neurological physical examination should be performed routinely in these types of patients, especially in those with severe symptoms. It is important to start performing more clinical neurophysiology tests to record these neurological alterations and determine if the virus generates an axonal, myelin, or mixed involvement of the PNS.\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】AMAN:\n\n【38】Acute motor axonal neuropathy\n\n【39】CNS:\n\n【40】Central nervous system\n\n【41】CSF:\n\n【42】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【43】GBS:\n\n【44】Guillain–Barré syndrome\n\n【45】PNS:\n\n【46】Peripheral nervous system\n\n【47】MRI:\n\n【48】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【49】SARS:\n\n【50】Severe acute respiratory syndrome", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Clinically, it occurs in men in their fifth to seventh decades who typically smoke cigarettes. WTs have been reported with different head and neck neoplasms and other salivary gland tumors within the same or another salivary gland. Kimura disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disease with unknown etiology affecting young to middle-aged Asian men. KD presents as an asymptomatic nodule in the head and neck area, with regional lymphadenopathy and salivary gland involvement.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 64-year-old Arabic man presented with a 10-year history of an asymptomatic swelling of the left face. Computed tomography showed a well-defined, multicystic mass with heterogeneous enhancement. The resected mass was composed of two distinct components. There was a well-demarcated proliferation of papillary and cystic oncocytic epithelium with lymphoid stroma, consistent with WT. Some areas exhibited sclerotic fibrosis, with multiple lymphoid follicles showing folliculolysis, follicular hyperplasia, and eosinophilic infiltrate. The patient’s immunoglobulin E level serum was elevated, confirming a coexisting KD. The patient underwent a left superficial parotidectomy, with no recurrence at a 30-month follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This report describes the first concurrent case of WT and KD in the parotid gland.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Warthin tumor (WT) is the second most common benign salivary gland tumor, accounting for 12–37% of parotid gland neoplasms \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. WT is believed to arise from salivary gland remnants that reside within the intra-parotid lymph nodes \\[ 3 \\]. Typically, it presents in the fifth to seventh decades of life, with historically strong male predilection; currently, there is an increase in the incidence of WT in females. There is a positive association between WT and cigarette smoking, where almost 90% of patients with WT have a history of smoking \\[ 4 \\]. Most cases occur in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland, with bilateral or multifocal presentation seen in 10% and 12%, respectively \\[ 5 \\]. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the primary diagnostic procedure for WT, where it demonstrates sheets of lymphocytes admixed with oncocytic epithelial cells \\[ 6 \\]. WT has pathognomonic histological features; it consists of papillary cystic spaces lined by a double layer of oncocytic cells and lymphoid tissue within the stroma \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】Kimura disease (KD) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder that occurs predominantly in young Asian males, with sporadic cases reported in other regions \\[ 7 \\]. It presents as a painless subcutaneous soft nodule, most commonly in the head and neck area, with regional lymphadenopathy and occasional salivary gland involvement \\[ 7 \\]. Patients with KD show peripheral eosinophilia and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Although KD mimics neoplasm clinically, it is a reactive process, and the pathogenesis remains unclear. Histologically, KD has three main components: densely collagenous stroma, florid germinal center hyperplasia with abundant eosinophils, and postcapillary venule proliferation \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【11】Coexistence of two different entities in a patient is an uncommon phenomenon. However, the presence of other non-salivary gland neoplasms with the very common WT has been reported to be as high as 37%, with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma being the most common neoplasm \\[ 9 \\]. Synchronous salivary gland neoplasms are seen most commonly with WT and usually occur bilaterally \\[ 10 \\]. Only one rare case of parotid WT coexisting with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) was reported in the same gland \\[ 11 \\]. In this report, we describe a case of concurrent WT and KD in the parotid gland, the first that we are aware of in the English literature, and describe the clinicopathological features of the case.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 64-year-old Arabic man presented with a left painless swelling of the face of a 10-year duration. The patient reported a recent increase in the size of the swelling. His medical history was significant for hypertension and cigarette smoking. Head and neck examination revealed a firm, non-tender parotid mass, measuring 10 cm in the greatest dimension. There was limited mobility of the mass, and the overlying skin exhibited no changes. There were no lymph nodes or facial nerve abnormalities. The computed tomography scan showed a 7.1 × 6.2 × 5.5 cm well-defined mass in the left parotid with heterogeneous enhancement and multiple cystic spaces. The mass displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly and medically but showed no infiltration (Fig. 1 ). FNA was performed at an outside facility and was reported as WT; the slides were not available for an in-house evaluation. The patient underwent a left superficial parotidectomy at our facility. Interestingly, the surgeon commented on the tumor consistency being firmer than a typical WT.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Computed tomography scan, coronal view: well-defined nodule with heterogeneous enhancement and multiple cystic spaces in the left parotid gland\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Gross examination of the resected parotid tissue showed an 8 cm firm tumor with a yellow to tan cut surface, exhibiting solid and cystic areas (Fig. 2 ). Histological examination revealed that the nodule had two different components (Fig. 3 A). One area consisted of multiple cystic spaces with papillary architecture lined by a double layer of oncocytic cells and surrounded by lymphocytes forming lymphoid follicles with germinal centers. Cellular debris and thick secretion within the cystic lumina were observed (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the previous FNA site, there were foci of fibrosis, squamous metaplasia, necrosis, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. In other areas of the tumor, there was a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate admixed with lymphocytes and histiocytes in a densely fibrotic stroma. There were lymphoid follicles scattered in the fibrotic stroma exhibiting folliculolysis, follicular hyperplasia, eosinophilic deposits, and perivascular sclerosis (Fig. 3 C–E).\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】The gross specimen consisted of a tan-brown solid mass with a well-circumscribed border and cystic spaces\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**A** The mass consisted of two main components: multiple papillary growths and cystic spaces with bright eosinophilic cells within lymphoid tissues (left) and extensively fibrotic tissue with multiple vaguely formed lymphoid follicles (right). (H&E, original magnification ×20). **B** The first component consisted of multiple papillary cystic spaces lined by oncocytic epithelium with diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicle in the stroma. (H&E, original magnification ×40) (Inset: the cystic lining is bilayer of luminal columnar cells and abluminal cuboidal cells; both cells have granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. (H&E, original magnification ×200). **C** The second component of the mass showed diffuse sclerotic fibrosis with scattered lymphoid follicles exhibiting folliculolysis, and inflammatory infiltrate. (H&E, original magnification ×40). **D** A prominent eosinophilic infiltrate was present within the sclerotic stroma and between the lymphoid follicles, which were admixed with lymphocytes and histiocytes. (H&E, original magnification ×100). **E** The lymphoid follicles showed follicular hyperplasia with mantle zone preservation with proteinaceous deposits and perivascular fibrosis. (H&E, original magnification ×200)\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】The follicular dendritic cell meshwork in the background of the lymphoid follicles was highlighted with CD21 and CD23. To exclude histiocytic neoplasms, CD1a and S100 were done and showed no positivity within the tumor cells (data not shown). A complete blood count with differential and serum IgE level were performed and showed a normal absolute eosinophil count of 0.41 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and elevated serum IgE level at 2691 KU/L. Based on the histological features and laboratory test results, a diagnosis of KD coexisting with WT was rendered. There was no evidence of recurrence at a thirty-month follow-up.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Benign salivary gland tumors account for 73–86% of all parotid neoplasms, and WT is the second most common tumor (3–35%) after pleomorphic adenoma (73–80%) \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. WT, also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, is an oncocytic epithelial neoplasm originally reported by Hildebrand in 1895 and first reported in the English literature by Warthin in 1929 \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Clinically, WT presents as a slowly growing mass of the parotid gland in patients mainly in their fifth to seventh decades of life. There is a slight male predilection, with a ratio of 1.6:1 \\[ 4 , 17 \\]; the gender ratio is less than initially reported (5:1 or 10:1) \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. The shift in WT incidence in females is likely due to the increase in smoking habits among females, since the majority (90%) of patients with WT have a history of cigarette smoking \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. WT most commonly occurs in the parotid. Extraparotid WT is infrequently seen in the submandibular gland (1–6.9%) and extremely rarely in the minor salivary glands (0.1–1.2%) \\[ 17 , 20 \\]. Bilateral or multifocal presentations are not unusual and occur in 10% and 12% of patients, respectively \\[ 5 \\]. The exact pathogenesis has been debated, with multiple proposed theories, hence the different terminology used in the literature \\[ 21 \\]. It was first thought to be a variant of lateral neck cyst when Hildebrand reported it \\[ 15 \\]. However, the most plausible pathogenesis is that WT arises from salivary gland tissue entrapped within the intra-parotid lymph nodes during development. Recently, it was elegantly demonstrated with CAM5.2 reactivity of the extrafollicular reticulum cells within the lymphoid tissue of WTs, confirming that these tumors arise within the lymph nodes \\[ 3 \\]. Histological features of WT are straightforward and readily recognizable. It consists of a variable degree of cystic spaces lined by oncocytic epithelium with papillary configuration within lymphoid tissue with occasional germinal centers. A closer examination of the oncocytic lining shows a double layer of luminal columnar cells and abluminal round to cuboidal cells; both cells have granular eosinophilic cytoplasm \\[ 1 \\]. WT is treated by superficial or total parotidectomy, with a low recurrence rate of 0.8–4.2% \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【30】Synchronous salivary gland neoplasms in the parotid gland are uncommon and account for only 3.6% of all parotid gland neoplasms \\[ 10 , 22 \\]. The very common WT is reported with almost every benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasm, including pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma, oncocytoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma \\[ 10 , 23 , 24 , 25 \\]. Nonetheless, coexisting non-salivary gland neoplasms with WT are not reported in the literature within the same parotid gland except for one case of WT with LCH. Tan _et al._ \\[ 11 \\] reported a synchronous WT and LCH in a 50-year-old man, which presented as painless right parotid swelling with a sudden increase in size and a recent inguinal lump. His blood count showed leukocytosis and eosinophilia. Typical histological features of WT were present. In addition, there were abundant eosinophils with scattered mononuclear cells with convoluted nuclei and distinct nuclear grooves within the intra-parotid lymph nodes; these cells were positive for CD1a and S100, confirming LCH diagnosis. Interestingly, the patient’s tumor also exhibited necrosis, eosinophilic abscesses, and granulomatous reaction within the intra-parotid lymph nodes, which raised KD as a differential diagnosis. However, there was no significant fibrosis, follicular hyperplasia, or other characteristic features of KD \\[ 11 \\]. The patient underwent parotidectomy, with no evidence of recurrence after 4 months of follow-up \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【31】KD is a rare immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder with unclear etiology. It was initially reported in the Chinese population in 1937 by Kimm _et al._ \\[ 26 \\] and in a Japanese population in 1948 by Kimura _et al._ \\[ 27 \\]. It presents as a subcutaneous nodule with head and neck predilection in young Asian males in their second to third decades of life \\[ 7 \\]. Patients with KD usually have regional lymphadenopathy and/or salivary gland involvement. The majority of KD patients are of Asian descent with sporadic cases in Caucasians, Hispanics, Blacks, and Arabs with a very low incidence of salivary gland involvement \\[ 7 \\]. Laboratory test shows peripheral eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels, which may have prognostic implications \\[ 28 \\]. The main histological features of KD consist of sclerotic fibrosis, prominent eosinophilic microabscesses, follicular hyperplasia, foliculolysis, and postcapillary venule proliferation of the germinal centers. Other features seen in KD include germinal center necrosis, proteinaceous deposits or eosinophilic infiltrates in the germinal centers, polykaryocytes within the germinal center or interfollicular areas, reticular IgE deposition within the germinal center, and perivenular sclerosis \\[ 7 \\]. Treatment of KD includes regional or systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, or radiation; however, surgical removal is preferred \\[ 29 \\].\n\n【32】LCH, Hodgkin lymphoma, and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHA) were considered in the differential diagnosis in the present case. Immunohistochemical staining of CD1a and S100 failed to detect Langerhans cells. The clinical presentation and the diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate histologically raised the possibility of Hodgkin lymphoma; however, no typical Reed–Sternberg cells were present in the sections examined. Lastly, ALHA was previously confused with KD and used interchangeably in the old literature. ALHA is currently considered a vascular neoplasm with known FOS and FOSB gene rearrangements \\[ 30 \\]. Histologically, it shares many features with KD but shows prominent solid growth of endothelial proliferation, with epithelioid appearance and central dilated blood vessels. Additionally, patients with ALHA rarely show peripheral eosinophilia or high serum IgE \\[ 31 \\]. The precise pathogenesis of this hybrid WT and KD is unknown. Many hypotheses can be proposed to explain their coexistence, including the possibility of collision tumors from the synchronous occurrence of WT and KD at the same location. Another possibility is that WT produced specific cytokines that induced the inflammatory or reactive processes mimicking KD or vice versa.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】This is a report of concurrent WT and KD, a rare and novel presentation of parotid tumors that occurred as a single nodule with a recent increase in size. Interestingly, the surgeon noted a firmer consistency than a typical WT during parotidectomy. Although the management is similar for both entities, it is necessary to identify both components, since KD may require additional treatment and follow-up. In addition, the relationship between WT and KD is unclear and warrants further investigation.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is recognized to be difficult to treat, despite various methods of treatment, including physiotherapy, calcitonin, corticosteroids, sympathetic blockade, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Pathophysiologically, complex regional pain syndrome reveals enhanced regional bone resorption and high bone turnover, and so bisphosphonates, which have a potent inhibitory effect on bone resorption, were proposed for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 48-year-old Japanese man with complex regional pain syndrome type I had severe right ankle pain with a visual analog scale score of 59 out of 100 regardless of treatment with physiotherapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for five months. Radiographs showed marked regional osteoporotic changes and bone scintigraphy revealed a marked increase in radioactivity in his ankle. One month after the start of oral administration of risedronate (2.5 mg per day), his bone pain had fallen from a VAS score of 59 out of 100 to 18 out of 100. Bone scintigraphy at 12 months showed a marked reduction in radioactivity to a level comparable to that in his normal, left ankle. On the basis of these results, the treatment was discontinued at 15 months. At 32 months, our patient had almost no pain and radiographic findings revealed that the regional osteoporotic change had returned to normal.\n\n【5】A second 48-year-old Japanese man with complex regional pain syndrome type I had severe right foot pain with a visual analog scale score of 83 out of 100 regardless of treatment with physiotherapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for nine months. Radiographs showed regional osteoporotic change in his phalanges, metatarsals, and tarsals, and bone scintigraphy revealed a marked increase in radioactivity in his foot. One month after the start of oral administration of alendronate (35 mg per week), his bone pain had fallen from a visual analog scale score of 83 out of 100 to 30 out of 100 and, at nine months, was further reduced to 3 out of 100. The treatment was discontinued at 15 months because of successful pain reduction. At 30 months, our patient had no pain and the radiographic findings revealed marked improvement in regional osteoporotic changes.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】We believe low-dose oral administration of bisphosphonate is worth considering for the treatment of idiopathic complex regional pain syndrome type I accompanied by regional osteoporotic change.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, edema, signs of vasomotor instability, movement disorders, joint stiffness, and regional osteopenia \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Various methods of treatment - including physiotherapy, calcitonin, corticosteroids, sympathetic blockade, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - have been tried \\[ 3 – 5 \\]. However, in many cases, pain and the ensuing loss of function are permanent despite treatment \\[ 2 , 6 \\]. On the other hand, previous studies reported that accelerated and enhanced bone resorption and turnover play a central pathophysiological role in CRPS \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Accordingly, bisphosphonates, which have a potent inhibitory effect on bone resorption, were proposed for the treatment of CRPS. In fact, several studies indicated that the intravenous or high-dose oral administration of bisphosphonate improved pain and reduced bone turnover in CRPS cases \\[ 8 – 11 \\]. In this report, we present two cases of CRPS in which a low dose of oral risedronate (2.5 mg per day) or alendronate (35 mg per week) markedly decreased pain and regional osteoporotic findings in the foot or ankle. Also, since the discontinuation of the bisphosphonate treatment, our patients have not complained of bone pain, and normal bone turnover has been observed for more than one year of follow-up without additional treatment.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 48-year-old Japanese man with CRPS was referred to our institute for the treatment of severe right ankle pain with a visual analog scale (VAS) \\[ 12 \\] score of 59 out of 100. About five months earlier, he began to feel severe right ankle pain without any trigger events. Although treatment, including physiotherapy and NSAID administration, was initiated in another clinic, the pain in his ankle progressively worsened and he demonstrated gait disturbance. A physical examination revealed redness, swelling, and remarkable tenderness around his ankle. Severe pain and hyperalgesia also resulted in the disturbance of ankle motion and weight-bearing. Radiographs showed marked regional osteoporotic changes in the distal tibia and fibula at his right ankle compared with his left ankle (Figure 1A ). Bone scintigraphy with <sup>99 m </sup> Tc-methylene diphosphonate revealed a marked increase in radioactivity in the bones around his ankle (Figure 1B ). These clinical findings were consistent with CRPS type I (CRPS I) according to criteria of the International Association for the Study of Pain \\[ 2 \\]. His lumbar bone mineral density was 0.904 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> , which is more than 80% of the Japanese young adult mean (YAM). Laboratory tests showed urinary crosslinked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), a bone resorption marker, to be 37.6 nmol bone collagen equivalent/mmol·Cr (nMBCE/mM·CR) (normal range, 9.3 to 54.3) and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 215 U/L (normal range, 110 to 370). Serum calcium (9.1 mg/dL; normal range 8.4 to 10.4), serum phosphate (2.9 mg/dL; normal range, 2.5 to 4.5), white blood cell count (5600/μL; normal range, 3900 to 9800), and C-reactive protein (< 0.1 mg/dL; normal range, < 0.3) were all at normal levels.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Radiographs (A) and scintigraphs (B) of the both ankles before treatment** . The radiograph of the right ankle showed regional osteoporotic findings at the distal tibia and fibula (white arrow) (A). Bone scintigraphy with <sup>99 m </sup> Tc-methylene diphosphonate showed a marked increase in radioactivity around the ankle (black arrow) (B).\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】In accordance with the diagnosis of CRPS I accompanied by marked regional osteoporotic changes, oral administration of risedronate at 2.5 mg per day, the same dose used for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan, was initiated to reduce the high bone turnover and ankle pain (VAS score of 59 out of 100). One month after the start of risedronate treatment, bone pain had fallen from a VAS score of 59 out of 100 to 18 out of 100, and we temporarily discontinued treatment at five months because of successful ankle pain reduction and the presence of epigastric pain. After nine months (four months after the discontinuation of treatment), we resumed bisphosphonate treatment with oral alendronate at 35 mg per week and the ankle pain decreased from a VAS score of 18 out of 100 to 10 out of 100 at 15 months (Figure 2 ). Bone scintigraphy at 12 months showed a marked reduction in radioactivity to a level comparable to that in the normal, left ankle (Figure 3 ). In addition, the effect of bisphosphonate on bone pain relief correlated with a reduction in NTX level, from 37.6 to 12.9 at eight months. On the basis of these results, treatment was discontinued at 15 months, and ankle pain relief lasted for 32 months (Figure 2 ). At the latest examination at 32 months, our patient had almost no pain (VAS score of 9 out of 100) and radiographic findings revealed that the regional osteoporotic change in his ankle had returned to normal, and findings were equivalent to those for his left ankle (Figure 4 ).\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Change in bone pain (visual analog scale, or VAS)** .

About nine months earlier, he began to feel severe right foot pain without any trigger events. Although treatment, including physiotherapy and NSAID administration, was initiated in another clinic, the pain and swelling of his right foot progressively worsened, and he demonstrated gait disturbance. A physical examination revealed redness, swelling, and remarkable tenderness of his foot. Severe pain and hyperalgesia also resulted in the disturbance of weight-bearing. Radiographs showed regional osteoporotic changes in the phalanges, metatarsals, and tarsals of his right foot compared with his normal, left foot (Figure 5A ). Reconstitution computed tomography also exhibited the extensive osteoporotic changes in his foot and ankle (Figure 5B ). Bone scintigraphy with <sup>99 m </sup> Tc-methylene diphosphonate revealed a marked increase in radioactivity in the bones of his foot (Figure 5C ). These clinical findings were consistent with CRPS I according to the criteria \\[ 2 \\] described for our first patient. Lumbar bone mineral density was 0.838 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> , which is more than 80% of the YAM. Laboratory tests showed an NTX of 48.6 nMBCE/mM·CR and normal values of ALP (242 U/L), serum calcium (9.6 mg/dL), serum phosphate (3.1 mg/dL), white blood cell count (7100/μL), and C-reactive protein (< 0.1 mg/dL).\n\n【31】**Figure 5**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】**Radiograph (A), reconstitution computed tomography (CT) image (B), and scintigraph (C) of the both feet before treatment** .

One month after the start of alendronate treatment, bone pain had fallen from a VAS score of 83 out of 100 to 30 out of 100 and was further reduced to 18 out of 100 at three months and 3 out of 100 at nine months. The treatment was discontinued at 15 months because of successful pain reduction, and the pain relief lasted for 30 months without further alendoronate administration (Figure 6 ). The bone pain relief correlated with a decrease in NTX values: 12.0 at 15 months and 14.0 at 24 months. Our patient rejected follow-up bone scintigraphy because he experienced no symptoms. At the latest examination at 30 months, he had no pain (VAS score of 0 out of 100) and the radiographic findings revealed marked improvement in regional osteoporotic changes (Figure 7 ).\n\n【36】**Figure 6**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】**Changes in bone pain (visual analog scale, or VAS)** .

Pathophysiologically, CRPS reveals enhanced regional bone resorption and high bone turnover, and so several reports have indicated that administration of bisphosphonate results in a significant reduction in pain \\[ 8 – 11 , 13 , 14 \\]. However, in these studies, the method of administration was intravenous or in high oral doses (alendronate, 40 mg per day). Recent studies have shown that intravenous or high-dose bisphosphonate therapy increases the incidence of severe side effects, such as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw \\[ 15 \\] or severely suppressed bone turnover \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. It was, therefore, considered ideal if low-dose bisphosphonate treatment could result in similar improvements in CRPS symptoms. In this report, we presented two patients who had CRPS I and who demonstrated marked pain relief and improvements in regional osteoporotic change in the foot or ankle as a result of the low-dose oral administration of bisphosphonate (risedronate at 2.5 mg per day or alendronate at 35 mg per week) at doses equivalent to those used for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan. Also, in both cases, the ameliorative effects have lasted more than one year, even after the administration of bisphosphonate was discontinued. We administered the bisphosphonate as a daily risedronate or weekly alendronate dose, depending on epigastric symptoms and patient preference. To the best of our knowledge, few reports have indicated that a low dose of oral bisphosphonate has any efficacy in the treatment of CRPS I, particularly if the follow-up period after the discontinuation of treatment was more than one year.\n\n【46】The etiology of CRPS I varies, and several studies have indicated that most cases of CRPS I are caused by secondary etiologies such as trauma and diabetes \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Manicourt and colleagues \\[ 11 \\] showed that traumatic events triggered CRPS I in most of their cases and that the pain associated with the disease was due not only to enhanced bone turnover but also to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and various neuropeptides from sustained peripheral nerve injury as a post-traumatic event \\[ 11 , 18 , 19 \\]. The value of bisphosphonates in the treatment of CRPS I disease did not, therefore, seem great. However, in regard to the idiopathic cases of CRPS I presented here, bisphosphonate treatment markedly and rapidly improved the severe bone pain and afforded a concomitant reduction in bone turnover in the foot and ankle. It was previously recognized that bone disorders with increased osteoclastic bone resorption, such as Paget disease, are associated with bone pain \\[ 20 \\], and the osteoclastic bone resorption was suggested to be critical to the pain, and the inflammation occurred adjacent to bone through an activation of the acid-sensing receptors through creation of acidosis by the osteoclasts \\[ 21 \\]. In these cases, bisphosphonates, inhibitors of osteoclast activity, were shown to reduce bone pain. Thus, in our idiopathic cases, accelerated and enhanced bone resorption and turnover in the foot or ankle might have played a dominant pathophysiological role in the development of CRPS I rather than peripheral nerve disorder as a post-traumatic injury.\n\n【47】This report has a limitation. We cannot deny the possibility that the observed improvement of pain and osteoporotic changes was a consequence of spontaneous amelioration of the disease. However, in regard to the immediate improvement of pain and regional osteoporosis change after the initiation of bisphosphonate treatment and the ineffectiveness of the previous treatment (including physiotherapy and NSAID administration for about six months), the improvement could be considered the effect of bisphosphonate. Thus, we believe that low-dose oral administration of bisphosphonate is worth considering for the treatment of idiopathic CRPS I accompanied by high regional bone turnover.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【49】In two patients with CRPS I, the oral administration of low-dose bisphosphonate resulted in an improvement in severe pain and regional osteoporotic findings in the foot or ankle. We speculate that a low dose of oral bisphosphonate might also be effective for the reduction in pain in cases of idiopathic CRPS I, particularly when accompanied by regional osteoporotic changes.\n\n【50】Consent\n-------\n\n【51】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The occurrence of synovial sarcoma in the hand-wrist area is rare (4 to 8.5% of all synovial sarcomas in different studies).\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This report documents an uncommon case of synovial sarcoma occurring in the hand-wrist of a 69-year-old Caucasian woman. She was subsequently treated with surgical excision and radiotherapy without recurrence after follow up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This paper aims to characterize the demographic, pathologic, and clinical features with a literature review. The present literature review confirms that hand-wrist synovial sarcomas are more frequent among males and subjects 10 to 40 years old. Most cases in this location are usually not larger than 5 cm in size. The five-year survival rate is higher than that reported in a previous review on hand synovial sarcomas, and this suggests an improved survival in recent decades.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Synovial sarcomas are malignant neoplasms with mesenchymal and variable epithelial differentiation. They are infrequent, accounting for 5-10% of all soft tissue sarcomas \\[ 1 \\]. For every one million people in the United States, one to two are diagnosed with synovial sarcoma each year \\[ 2 \\]. This tumor is most common in adolescents and young adults; with the majority of cases occurring between 10 and 40 years of age \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. It is rarely encountered in those over 50 years old. There is a slight male preponderance \\[ 3 \\], and similar incidences in all ethnic groups have been described \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. This neoplasm can occur in almost any location in the body. In the vast majority of cases, it involves deep soft tissue of the lower extremities, frequently in the vicinity of large joints, like the knee and ankle \\[ 6 \\]. It can also occur in viscera (heart, lung, pleura, kidney), oral cavity, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, central nervous system, and peripheral nerves. Typically, it has a slow growth pattern and benign radiologic appearance. Clinically, synovial sarcomas can be associated with pain depending on their location in relation to nerves. Some authors have observed that long-lasting pain at the tumor site before the development of swelling is more common with synovial sarcomas than with other sarcomas \\[ 7 \\]. Most cases, however, are diagnosed only when their size is larger than 5 cm \\[ 8 \\]. Similar to other soft tissue sarcomas, synovial sarcomas in the hand-wrist area are infrequent \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【10】This paper documents an unusual case of hand-wrist synovial sarcoma in a 69-year-old Caucasian woman, and characterizes this condition’s demographic, pathologic, and clinical features with a literature review.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of low back pain, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with a chief complaint of a dorsal ulnar-sided left hand-wrist mass that had been growing slowly over the previous 10 years. The patient stated that the mass had become progressively more painful over time, being particularly tender when she wore a watch. There had been no history of preceding trauma nor constitutional symptoms. On physical exam, the skin on the hands and wrist was intact with normal musculature. In the left dorsal ulnar wrist, near the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon, there was a small palpable mass that was semi-firm and not mobile; quite tender to palpation. A hand-wrist X-ray showed marked osteoarthritic changes. An initial clinical diagnosis of a probable ganglion cyst was made, and the patient underwent surgical excision of the mass.\n\n【13】The pathology of the soft tissue fragments revealed a biphasic neoplasm composed of spindle cells admixed with neoplastic glands (Fig. 1 ). No necrosis or active mitotic activity was seen. The tumor cells were positive for TLE1, focally positive for CK19, CK7, and S100, and negative for CDX2, SMA, CK20, and TTF-1 (Fig. 2 ). Due to tissue fragmentation, surgical margins could not be assessed; although they appeared to be involved by the neoplasm. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) for SS18 (SYT) gene break-apart rearrangement on chromosome 18q11.2 was performed (Fig. 3 ), and the SYT gene rearrangement was detected in 71% of cells; thus confirming the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**a** Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, magnification ×10: low-power view of the neoplasm. **b** H&E stain, magnification ×40: high-power view of the epithelial component surrounded by fascicles of spindle cells. **c** H&E stain, magnification ×40: high-power view of bundles of spindle cells. **d** H&E stain, magnification ×40: thickened bundles of wiry collagen (arrows)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**a** – **c** CK7 ( **a** ), CK19 ( **b** ), and TLE1 ( **c** ) stains, magnification ×20: strong expression of CK7 and CK19 in the epithelial component, with focal/patchy expression in the spindled cells.

In normal cells that lack _SS18_ (SYT) gene rearrangement, two pairs of orange and green fusion signals will be observed. In abnormal or tumor cells with _SS18_ (SYT) gene break-apart, one fusion, one green and one orange signal pattern are seen, as in the cells showed\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】CT (computed tomography) of the thorax/abdomen and pelvis were without evidence of metastatic sarcoma. The tumor was classified as AJCC (American Joint Commission on Cancer) Stage IIA. A wide re-excision of the tumor was performed with en-bloc resection of the distal ulna. The resected tissue showed an ill-defined 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm firm mass involving the soft tissue without involving the bone. The histopathologic exam confirmed the prior diagnosis. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy and had regular follow-ups for 5.5 years with no evidence of any local recurrence of the tumor or distant metastases. The timeline of the episode of care is summarized in Fig. 4 .\n\n【27】**Fig. 4**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Timeline of the episode of care\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【32】Synovial sarcomas are rarely encountered in routine clinical practice. Nevertheless, they are a highly malignant type of soft tissue sarcoma. Therefore, clinicians and pathologists should always maintain a high level of suspicion to ensure these cases are not unrecognized.\n\n【33】Synovial sarcomas in the hand-wrist area are an uncommon occurrence. Their frequency is 4-8.5% of all synovial sarcomas in different studies \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. When a synovial sarcoma arises in the hand-wrist, the incidence of finger involvement is less common than that of the carpus \\[ 4 , 13 \\]. Clinically, many of these tumors, particularly when small in size, are initially misinterpreted as benign lesions such as ganglion cysts or glomus tumors.\n\n【34】The synovial sarcoma case herein described is particularly unusual considering the patient’s age and sex (a woman in her late sixties), and the infrequent location (the hand-wrist region). Despite its name, synovial sarcomas do not arise from synovium and rarely occur in the joints. A microscopic similarity to the primitive synovium was observed early in the literature, but its histogenesis is still unclear \\[ 6 , 14 \\]. Nevertheless, the term synovial sarcoma continues to be used. A 2010 study suggested that a human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell may be the cell of origin \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【35】Histologically, there are three variants of synovial sarcoma \\[ 16 \\]: monophasic, biphasic, and poorly differentiated. The _monophasic_ variant is characterized by fascicles of atypical spindled cells with scant cytoplasm and monotonous vesicular nuclei, often overlapping. There is a variable mitotic rate. Collagenous stroma can be more or less abundant, and thickened bundles of “wiry collagen” can be seen. Vasculature can be prominent, and hyalinization or myxoid changes are rarely seen. Mast cells are frequently observed, and necrosis is uncommon. _Biphasic_ synovial sarcoma contains the aforementioned spindle cells, and in addition there is an epithelial component showing glandular or nested growth. The epithelial cells have amphophilic cytoplasm and round to ovoid nuclei. The glandular lumina may contain eosinophilic amorphous material or mucin. Rarely, squamous metaplasia can be seen. _Poorly differentiated_ synovial sarcoma is characterized by hypercellularity, hyperchromatic nuclei, polymorphism, and increased mitoses. Necrosis is common. Poorly differentiated areas may be present adjacent to more typical monophasic or biphasic areas. In some cases, the entire tumor is poorly differentiated.\n\n【36】A characteristic cytogenetic translocation t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2) is present in almost all synovial sarcomas; helping provide diagnostic confirmation. This translocation fuses _SS18_ (SYT) in chromosome 18 and _SSX1_ , SSX2, or _SSX4_ in chromosome X \\[ 17 \\]. Immunohistochemistry shows that synovial sarcomas are strongly positive for TLE1, although other sarcomas and carcinomas can rarely express TLE-1 \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Keratins and EMA are diffusely positive in the epithelial components, and focally positive in the spindled cells \\[ 20 \\]. Focal S100 protein or SOX10 positivity can also be seen in a percentage of cases. CD56 and CD99 are usually positive, while CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, PAX3, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and NKX2 are negative \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【37】In 1986, Dreyfuss _et al._ \\[ 11 \\] performed a literature review of hand synovial sarcoma cases occurring between 1934 and 1984. An English literature search in PubMed using the terms “synovial sarcoma”, “hand” and “wrist” from 1983 to 2020 was performed to provide a review of cases not included in the aforementioned review. Our literature search started from 1983 in order to include a paper from 1983 (Kinsella _et al._ \\[ 22 \\]), which was not reported in Dreyfuss’s review. One hundred and eighty-nine cases of synovial sarcoma of the hand-wrist have been recorded \\[ 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 \\] during the past 37 years (Table 1 ). Among these, 57 cases in the hand-wrist where demographic, pathologic, and clinical information was available were analyzed (Table 2 ).\n\n【38】**Table 1 Summary of the Pub-Med English literature on 189 cases of synovial sarcoma of hand-wrist (1983–2020)**\n\n【39】Full size table\n\n【40】**Table 2 57 cases of synovial sarcoma of the hand-wrist in the Pub-Med English literature (1983–2020): demographic, pathologic, clinical, and therapeutic features are reported for each case**\n\n【41】Full size table\n\n【42】The demographic features of the cases reported in the literature are summarized in Table 3 . The male-to-female ratio was 1.23:1, which is slightly diminished compared to Dreyfuss’s ratio (1.68:1). The mean age of the present literature review (33.6 years) is similar to that from Dreyfuss’s study (33 years). Thirty-seven subjects (65%) were between 10 and 40 years old, and only 5 (8.7%) were above 69 years old. These results are in accordance with the findings of Dreyfuss _et al._ and in keeping with the literature \\[ 16 \\]. Therefore, these findings corroborate that the case report presented herein is a rare occurrence.\n\n【43】**Table 3 Summary of demographic, histologic and clinical parameters for the 57 subjects analyzed. For each parameter, N highlights the number of subjects for whom the parameter was provided**\n\n【44】Full size table\n\n【45】The _hand_ was the most commonly involved location (45 cases, 78%). Nearly all cases involved the soft tissue with the palmar surface of the hand reported in 18 cases, the dorsal surface in four, the area between metacarpals in five, the fingers in eight, the anatomical snuffbox in one. A digital nerve was involved in one case, while an unspecified hand area was reported in eight cases. The _wrist_ was involved in 14 cases (24.5%), and two cases concomitantly involved the hand. Among these, in 13 cases affected the soft tissue, while only one case involved the median nerve. These findings confirm that the incidence of finger involvement by this type of sarcoma is less common than that of the carpus \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【46】In 20 cases collected, the duration of symptoms before diagnosis was clearly stated in the studies and is reported in Table 3 . In six cases, the tumors were initially considered benign conditions, like abscesses, fibromas, arthritis, and so forth. According to most authors, a delay in diagnosing this kind of tumor is very frequent due to the insidious growth pattern and non-specific radiological appearance. These tumors can be present for extended periods (2–20 years). In the case report herein described, the patient presented with a slowly growing hand-wrist mass, which became progressively more painful over a 10-year period.\n\n【47】The greatest dimensions of the tumors at diagnosis were clearly reported in only 34 cases. Size ranged between 0.5 and 10 cm, with an average of 2.8 cm. In eight additional cases, the size reported was “5 cm or less”, while in two it was “more than 5 cm”. In total, 37 cases out of 44 were diagnosed when the tumor size was 5 cm or less. Therefore, this review and the presented case report show that in a majority of cases, this tumor is 5 cm or less in greatest dimension. This is in disagreement with few articles stating that larger tumor sizes are usually present at diagnosis \\[ 13 \\]. The rates of different histologic subtypes are reported in Table 3 .\n\n【48】Radical surgical excision was the treatment of choice (57 cases, 100%). Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed in 29 cases (51%), while chemotherapy was used in 12 cases (21%), either before or after surgery. These percentages are higher than those observed by Dreyfuss _et al._ , who found that 30% of patients had radiotherapy and 5% chemotherapy. This demonstrates more widespread use of therapies like radiation and chemotherapy in recent decades to treat synovial sarcomas.\n\n【49】The follow-up period is summarized in Table 3 . The recurrence rate was 32.6% (16 out of 49 followed-up cases): in 4 cases local recurrences were seen, in 9 cases lung metastases, in one case lymph node metastasis, and in 4 the site of recurrence was not specified. According to the literature, the rate of recurrence of these tumors is around 80% \\[ 60 \\]. In Dreyfuss at al. review, the rate of recurrence was 54%. Several factors have been associated with a higher recurrence risk: advanced age, larger tumor size (> 5 cm), central location, male sex, neurovascular or bone invasion, p53 overexpression, high proliferative index, specific SYT-SSX fusion types, and incomplete excision \\[ 68 , 69 \\]. Regarding the excision of hand-wrist tumors, it has to be considered that these body areas present particular challenges due to their specific anatomic features: there is limited soft tissue, and each compartment is small. Therefore, it can be difficult to obtain wide surgical margins \\[ 70 \\]. In the present literature review, chi-square analysis was used to compare the rate of recurrence and metastasis in different subgroups of patients. The rate of recurrence and metastasis was not significantly different ( _p_ \\> 0.05) when comparing tumor size (less than or equal to 5 cm versus those greater than 5 cm), histology subtype (biphasic versus monophasic), and age (those less than or equal to 40 versus those older than 40). It is uncertain why the recurrence rate in the present literature review is relatively lower compared to the review by Dreyfuss _et al._ and also considering that Dreyfuss did not provide the tumors’ size at diagnosis in their analysis.\n\n【50】In the literature analyzed, the mortality rate was 10.2% (5 out of the 49 followed-up subjects). Sixteen patients (28%) survived at least 5 years after beginning treatment. Twelve (21%) survived at least 10 years, with one surviving more than 32 years. The overall five-year survival rate for synovial sarcomas of any location is 27–85% in the literature \\[ 13 , 16 \\]. Dreyfuss _et al._ in their review focused on hand synovial sarcomas found that 18% of the patients survived five years after beginning treatment and 9% survived ten years. Therefore, the present literature review showed an improved 5-year and 10-year survival in hand-wrist sarcomas in the recent decades. Various factors seem to have a poor survival prognostic value in subjects affected by synovial sarcomas \\[ 71 \\]: advanced age at diagnosis, tumors larger than 4 or 5 cm, central location, poorly differentiated histology. Recent data suggest that fusion type does not have survival prognostic value. The synovial sarcoma in the case report herein described had several favorable prognostic factors that could justify the uneventful five-years follow-up: peripheral location, small size, lack of poorly differentiated histology, negative resection margins at the re-excision.\n\n【51】In conclusion, this literature review confirms that synovial sarcomas of hand-wrist are more frequent among males and subjects 10 to 40 years old. These findings corroborate that the case report presented is a rare occurrence. In the literature analyzed, the incidence of finger involvement by this type of sarcoma was less common than that of the remaining areas of the hand and wrist. A delay in diagnosis was not common, probably because a high level of suspicion for this tumor has been achieved. Moreover, in most cases, this tumor was diagnosed when 5 cm or less in greatest dimension. The five-year survival rate in the cases analyzed was higher than that reported in the previous literature review on hand synovial sarcomas; suggesting an improved survival in the recent decades.\n\n【52】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【53】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【54】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【55】FISH:\n\n【56】Fluorescence in situ hybridization.\n\n【57】CT:\n\n【58】Computed tomography.\n\n【59】AJCC:\n\n【60】American Joint Commission on Cancer", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Fixation of the tibial fragment, and therefore its osteointegration, is complicated after total knee arthroplasty, causing tibial tubercle dislocation.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 61-year-old German patient presented to our clinic with Felix IV C fracture, persistent knee pain, and reduced knee extension strength. In this special case, mobilization and reattachment of the tibial tubercle was not possible because of necrosis and underlying tibial component. Therefore, we covered the defect with cement and used an polyethylene terephthalate tube for knee extension system augmentation. Follow-up after 10 months demonstrated a good clinical result.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The management of Felix IV C fractures is complicated by the underlying prosthesis resulting in redislocation of the fragment and persistent symptoms of pain and reduced functionality. We here present a new surgical technique to treat periprosthetic fracture complicated by tibial tubercle dislocation. Good clinical and radiologic results on follow-up after 10 months indicate the use of attachment tubes as a suitable surgical technique to restore knee joint extension and to reduce knee pain after dislocated Felix IV C fracture.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Periprosthetic fractures of the tibia have a low prevalence of 0.4–1.7% \\[ 1 \\], but since there the number of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) is increasing, it has become a significant complication in orthopedic surgery \\[ 2 \\]. Therapy consists of osteosynthesis with plates or screws, but since the tibial stems limit the options of fragment refixation, periprosthetic tibial fractures are difficult to treat, having a high risk of nonunion and dislocation \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Herein, we report the reconstruction of the knee joint’s extension system with a polyethylene terephthalate tube after nonunion of tibial Felix IV C fracture \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 61-year-old German woman presented to our orthopedic clinic after Felix IV fracture in revision total knee arthroplasty. Two years ago, the patient had undergone revision TKA with a rotating hinge prosthesis complicated by an intraoperative fracture of the tibial tubercle. Screw fixation had been performed, but 3 months later nonunion of the fragment had persisted, resulting in plate osteosynthesis with a one-third tubular plate. After another dislocation of the tibial tubercle, the patient presented to our clinic with anterior knee pain, loss of extension strength, and a feeling of rotational instability. On clinical examination, pressure pain of the proximal tibia, decreased extension strength to Janda 3/5, and inability to raise the extended knee were noticed. This maintained extensor function is the result of an intact medial and lateral retinaculum. The knee’s range of motion was 0–110° of flexion with preserved mediolateral and anterior/posterior stability. X-ray showed the rotation hinge prosthesis without loosening signs, the one-third tubular plate, and the dislocated tibial tubercle fragment indicating persistent Felix IV C fracture (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Preoperative x-ray shows dislocated tibial tubercle, one-third plate, rotation hinge prosthesis without loosening signs and regular patella tracking. **a** Frontal view. **b** Sagittal view shows dislocated tibial tubercle. **c** Axial view shows regular patella tracking\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Reconstruction of the knee joint’s extension system was planned. After preparation of the subcutaneous tissue, the dislocated tibial tubercle appeared surrounded by extensive metallosis (Fig. 2 a) presumably induced by the contact between the one-third tubular plate and the tibial prosthesis. Following the removal of the plate, the fragment proved to be necrotic requiring a total extirpation instead of mobilization and refixation. Subsequently, the ventral surface of the tibial prosthesis was exposed (Fig. 2 b). Reconstruction of the extension system should be performed by the implantation of MUTARS attachment tube made of polyethylene terephthalate. Since the tibial prosthesis did not offer any connecting points for the synthetic graft, cement was used as an extender to simultaneously serve as fixing point and to preserve the prosthesis from loosening. Afterwards, the tube was doubled into a laminar sheet and fixed with two cancellous bone screws in the ventral tibia (Fig. 2 c, d). ORTHOCORD sutures were used to attach the tube to the articular capsule still beyond the patella (Fig. 2 d,e). Extensive jet lavage was performed before wound closure. Check of patellar tracking was promising; likewise, postoperative X-ray showed regular patella position (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Intraoperative procedures: **a** After preparation of subcutaneous tissue, the one-third plate appeared completely surrounded with metallosis. **b** The necrotic tibial tubercle was removed so that the tibial prosthesis was exposed. **c** , **d** The polyethylene terephthalate tube was doubled to form a planar sheet and fixed with two cancellous bone screws in the proximal tibia. **e** Joint capsule was sutured so that the attachment-tube is arranged above. **f** The attachment-tube was fixed with non absorbable ORTHOCORD® at the joint capsule and the M. quadriceps femoris\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Postoperative x-ray shows cement augmentation of resected tibial tubercle and regular patella position. **a** Frontal view. **b** Sagittal view shows cement augmentation and correct patella position without cranial dislocation\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】To support the integration of the tube in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue, knee flexion was at first limited to 30° and then escalated to 60° and 90° every 2 weeks with full weight-bearing.\n\n【27】Follow-up was performed after 3 and 10 months. On clinical examination (Fig. 4 ), the patient showed irritant-free skin and soft tissue conditions; no redness or overheating; extension/flexion 0–0–110°; straight-leg raise completely possible; and force level 4/5 on side comparison of the knee stretchers. Active knee stretching with a flexed knee joint was possible without any problems. There was a centered patella run and no subluxation of the patella. Peripheral circulation, motor skills, and sensitivity were intact. X-ray confirmed correct implant position and central patella tracking (Fig. 5 ). The patient was highly pleased by the restored extension function and significantly reduced knee pain.\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Clinical follow up after ten month: In the clinical examination the patient showed a range of motion with extension/flexion 0-0-110°, straight-leg-raise was completely possible. **a** Full knee extension of 0°. **b** Straight-leg-raise. **c** Knee flexion until 110°\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】**Fig. 5**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】Radiologic follow up after ten month: X-ray shows correct implant position without periprosthetic bone lesions and centered patella tracking. **a** Frontal view. **b** Sagittal view shows still correct position of cement augmentation. **c** Axial view shows regular patella tracking\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】Periprosthetic tibial fractures are difficult to treat since the tibial segment hinders the fixation of osteosynthesis implants. A minimum of eight screws or the use of locking plates is recommended, but nevertheless, there are high rates of nonunion and dislocation of tibial fragments \\[ 5 \\]. In the present case, we presented a surgical method to preserve extension functionality after Felix IV fracture and failed osteosynthesis of tibial tubercle fragment.\n\n【38】Multiple operation techniques exist to restore the knee joint’s extension system \\[ 6 \\]. While primary repair was not possible since the necrotic tibial tubercle and concomitant patellar tendon insertion had to be removed, augmentation techniques were required. Not only autologous but also allograft reconstructions have been described resulting in unsatisfying long-term results with progressive extensor lag due to poor tissue quality \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. Therefore, Browne _et al_ . developed a synthetic augmentation technique to restore patellar tendon function providing long-term tensile strength and extensor functionality \\[ 10 \\]. So, overall, in the case of patellar tendon or quadriceps tendon rupture, synthetic augmentation techniques are recommended \\[ 6 \\]. Attachment tubes are commonly used in tumor surgery to restore function and stability after joint removal. Among them, reconstruction of the extension system of the knee joint in combination with a megaprosthesis is an approved method with promising outcomes concerning knee extension and knee flexion. On the one hand, in the case of megaprostheses, the attachment tube is fixed to the retention strings or a specific ventral anchorage block of the prosthetic device \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. On the other hand, in the case of TKA with surrounding tibial bone, Browne _et al_ . fixed the mesh graft intramedullary by bone cement instead of superficial anchorage to avoid proximal tibial fracture or tibial tubercle nonunion \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【39】The present case required a different fixation technique since the tibial prosthesis was not designed to serve as a fixing point for the polyethylene terephthalate tube and the overlaying tibial tubercle as intramedullary anchorage had to be removed. Due to the extension strength acting on the tube and concomitantly on the attachment point, a direct fixation only on the ventral surface of the prosthesis would lead to ventral breakaway of the prosthesis aggravated by the missing frontal stability. Therefore, we compensated for the tibial defect by cement augmentation and attached the tube to the proximal tibia with two cancellous bone screws. As approved in tumor surgery \\[ 12 \\], nonabsorbable sutures were used to fix the tube to the joint capsule and the extension system. Since the attachment tube in combination with endoprosthetic material is known to exhibit high infection rates \\[ 15 \\], extensive jet lavage was performed before wound closure.\n\n【40】Within 6 months, the polyethylene terephthalate tube is known to be completely interspersed with fibroblasts resulting in a scarred tear-resistant tissue plate ( 16 ). So, when the tube stability reduces over time, its function will be replaced by autologous tissue to maintain tensile strength.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【42】In cases of Felix IV fractures, the use of plates and screws is recommended. Nevertheless, the management is often complicated by the underlying prosthesis components. We presented a reasonable surgical method using an attachment tube to treat dislocated Felix IV fractures with loss of tibial tubercle reducing knee pain and preserving extension functionality.\n\n【43】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report a rare case of a patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to hydroxychloroquine. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is characterized by acute onset of a generalized rash that is pustular and erosive in nature, affecting limbs; trunk; face; and, less often, mucosal membranes.

Its morphologic features included erythema multiforme–like lesions with extensive skin sloughing in various regions of the head, neck, and trunk and mucosal involvement. Her Nikolsky sign was negative, and she had no evidence of lesions on areas of skin trauma. Four weeks prior, she had been initiated on hydroxychloroquine for a presumed diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three punch biopsies of the head and neck area revealed subcorneal pustules consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare side effect of hydroxychloroquine, and even fewer cases demonstrate histologic evidence of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis while clinically presenting with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients who develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis require best supportive care with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevention of further breakdown of the skin barrier. With the potential of widespread hydroxychloroquine use, it is important that providers be aware of its potential severe adverse drug reactions.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Since the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been targeted efforts to establish management modalities. Aminoquinolines, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have been suggested as possible agents \\[ 1 \\]. These medications are traditionally used in the management of malaria and for dermatologic and rheumatologic conditions \\[ 2 \\]. It is thought that aminoquinolines are positioned to treat viral infections due to mechanisms that mitigate viral activity \\[ 3 \\]. Moreover, hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as a more appropriate choice than chloroquine \\[ 4 \\]. Although the pharmacology may seem promising, this enticement should be coupled with caution because hydroxychloroquine is associated with multiple adverse reactions, including significant cardiotoxicity with prolongation of QTc and ventricular arrhythmias \\[ 5 \\]. It is also known to cause vision-threatening toxic retinopathy \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【10】We present a rare case of a patient with an adverse cutaneous reaction to hydroxychloroquine presenting with diffuse skin sloughing compatible with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Histologic findings showed acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Although rare, it is important to be mindful of the AGEP–SJS overlap presentation due to its often-delayed diagnosis and the potential to be life-threatening. AGEP is characterized by an acute onset of a generalized rash that is pustular and erosive in nature, affecting limbs; trunk; face; and less often, mucosal membranes. Noncutaneous features include fever, neutrophilia, and liver involvement with other features described in a few cases. The clinical course can vary \\[ 4 \\] from self-limiting to requiring hospitalization. One prolonged case was reported that lasted up to 68 days \\[ 7 \\]. In rare instances, AGEP pustules can convalesce, leading to bullae and skin sloughing akin to SJS.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 68-year-old American woman with a medical history significant for asthma, migraines, and proximal muscle weakness presented to our hospital as a direct admission for management of a painful rash that was rapidly spreading diffusely. Morphologic features included erythema multiforme–like lesions with extensive skin sloughing in various regions of the head, neck, trunk, and extremities. Her Nikolsky sign was negative, and she had no evidence of lesions occurring on areas of skin trauma. Her ophthalmologic examination showed conjunctival injection without photophobia. Her visual fields were intact. She reported no eye pain, blurry vision, or visual disturbances; thus, no slit-lamp examination was performed, and she had no indication of anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis. She had mucosal involvement with findings on the vulvovaginal mucosa, posterior oropharynx, and anal verge.\n\n【13】Four weeks prior to presentation, she had been started on hydroxychloroquine for a presumed diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. She was taking inhaled albuterol as needed and had no known drug allergies or other AGEP risk factors. She had a cutaneous lesion in the periocular area that was biopsied, revealing a diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis, which was subsequently diagnosed as granulomatous rosacea.\n\n【14】Due to concern about her condition, three punch biopsies of the head and neck were performed. Biopsy results revealed subcorneal pustules consistent with AGEP (Figs. 1 and 2 ).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Characteristic mucosal involvement of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis–Stevens-Johnson syndrome overlap with coalescing targetoid erythematous plaques visualized on surrounding face\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Coalescing targetoid erythematous plaques on chest and neck\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Treatment began with high doses of methylprednisolone twice daily over the course of 5 days, leading to only minimal improvement of existing areas and ongoing spread to new areas. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated at 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days, at which point disease stability was achieved, and she was safely transitioned to intravenous methylprednisolone once daily, which led to a prolonged taper with oral prednisone. The patient’s rash ultimately resolved, as did her cutaneous pain and pruritus.\n\n【24】Her hospital course was complicated by the direct impact of her cutaneous adverse event, including severe pruritus, generalized pain, extensive skin sloughing, dysuria, and painful defecation, as well as the indirect adverse complication of the reactivation of a latent varicella (zoster) infection. This was successfully managed with intravenous acyclovir. The patient was continuously concerned about permanent skin damage and recurrence despite discontinuing the offending agent. The management of pruritus and pain caused a great deal of anxiety and emotional distress. To better understand the skin involvement on a daily basis, the patient asked family and staff to capture photographs. The patient was later discharged to follow-up with the dermatology department as an outpatient.\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Among many potential adverse reactions involving hydroxychloroquine, cutaneous side effects are varied and can lead to significant morbidity or even death. The drug is currently being investigated in a multitude of trials for COVID-19 treatment \\[ 8 \\], prevention \\[ 9 \\], and prophylaxis after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \\[ 10 \\]. AGEP is a rare side effect of hydroxychloroquine, and even fewer cases demonstrate histologic evidence of AGEP while clinically presenting as SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The typical presentation of AGEP is with a diffuse, “exanthematous” pustular rash. AGEP associated with SJS/TEN (of all causes) has a mortality similar to SJS \\[ 11 \\], whereas more classic AGEP associated with hydroxychloroquine typically resolves quickly after stopping the medication \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【27】Patients who develop SJS/TEN require best supportive care with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevention of further breakdown of the skin barrier \\[ 13 \\]. There is no known genetic predisposition for the development of AGEP, and the only identified risk factors are medication use or antecedent viral infection \\[ 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【28】We report a rare case of a patient with AGEP–SJS overlap that failed to respond to only supportive care, ultimately requiring both intravascular steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. Herein lies the necessity for caution when hastily using hydroxychloroquine to manage the current global pandemic. The executive group of the World Health Organization Solidarity Trial recently decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the trial as a precaution while the safety data of the drug are being reviewed \\[ 16 \\]. This arm has since been resumed \\[ 17 \\]. With the possibility of widespread hydroxychloroquine use, it is important that providers be aware of the possibility of severe adverse drug reactions to hydroxychloroquine, especially those who need aggressive intervention to avoid potentially irreversible consequences.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】AGEP:\n\n【31】Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis\n\n【32】SJS:\n\n【33】Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n\n【34】TEN:\n\n【35】Toxic epidermal necrolysis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Intra-abdominal hemorrhage has reportedly decreased with the use of fibrin glue or polyglycolic acid felt and wrapping of the skeletonized vessels by omentum or falciform ligament. However, there are no extremely effective methods for the prevention of hemorrhage. Here, we report our novel and simple method for the prevention of intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to pancreatic fistula.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy in pancreatico-duodenectomy is displaced from the superior to inferior side of the transverse mesocolon through a small window created on the left side of the middle colic artery of the transverse mesocolon. This procedure is expected to prevent exposure of the skeletonized vessels to activated pancreatic juice from a pancreatic fistula after lymph node dissection, decreasing the incidence of hemorrhage. Two drains are placed on the superior and inferior sides of the transverse mesocolon. We performed this procedure in seven patients and compared the amylase level in the drainage fluid from the superior and inferior sides.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There was no difference in the fluid amylase level from the drains between the superior and inferior sides, because a pancreatic fistula was not present in all our patients. Therefore, we could not evaluate the efficacy of this method in the current study.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】Our procedure is theoretically expected to prevent intra-abdominal hemorrhage and will be an option in pancreatico-duodenectomy, especially for patients with a soft pancreas. However, it is necessary to evaluate the performance and results of this procedure in many more patients.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The post-operative morbidity and mortality rates of pancreatico-duodenectomy are higher than those of other procedures. In particular, pancreatic fistula following anastomotic leakage after pancreato-jejunostomy is a severe complication with high mortality. The skeletonized vessels following lymph node dissection are exposed to activated pancreatic juice from anastomotic leakage after pancreato-jejunostomy, resulting in pseudoaneurysm formation and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The mortality rate is reported to range from 1 percent to 5 percent \\[ 1 – 6 \\]. However, because of advances in interventional techniques, mortality due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage has decreased. Moreover, the use of fibrin glue or polyglycolic acid felt and wrapping of the skeletonized vessels by omentum or falciform ligament reportedly decreases intra-abdominal hemorrhage \\[ 7 – 15 \\]. However, intra-abdominal hemorrhage remains a frequent complication, and many surgeons are concerned by this complication. Here we present a novel and simple technique for prevention of intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to pancreatic fistula after pancreatico-duodenectomy.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Our procedure first involves reconstruction with a duct-to-mucosa pancreato-jejunostomy, continual end-to-side hepato-jejunostomy, and end-to-side gastro-jejunostomy. After all reconstructions have been performed, a small window is created on the left side of the middle colic artery of the transverse mesocolon (Figure 1 ). The anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy is then displaced from the superior to the inferior side of the mesocolon through this window. Finally, this window is closed with a few sutures. The anastomotic site is relatively displaced to the inferior side of the transverse mesocolon (Figure 2 ). Two closed drains are placed, one on the superior side of the mesocolon and the other on the inferior side near the anastomotic site. The schema of this procedure is illustrated in Figure 3 .\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**A small window is created on the left side of the middle colic artery of the transverse mesocolon.**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**The anastomotic site of pancreato-jejunostomy is relatively displaced to the inferior side of the transverse mesocolon.**\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**The schema of reconstructions. (a)** Conventional reconstruction. **(b)** Our method.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】We used this method in seven patients with a mean age of 70 years; six of our patients were men, with one woman. The primary diseases were intra-ductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (three patients), ampullary carcinoma (two patients) and tumor-forming pancreatitis (two patients). Fibrin glue was not used in any of our patients, and they were followed up for more than one year after the operation.\n\n【27】We examined the fluid amylase from the two drains three days after the operation for all our patients and compared the levels between the superior and inferior sides. Pancreatic fistula was classified in accordance with the International Study Group Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) definition \\[ 6 \\]. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted using the Student’s t-test. _P_ values of <0.05 were judged to be statistically significant.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】The mortality and morbidity rates were 0 percent and 14 percent, respectively. One patient developed a grade A pancreatic fistula, and none of the remaining patients developed grade B or C pancreatic fistulas. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage did not appear in any of our patients. The average fluid amylase level of the superior and inferior sides was 109IU/L (range 4 to 310IU/L) and 343IU/L (range 19 to 1433IU/L), respectively. There was no significant difference in the fluid amylase levels between the superior and inferior sides. The average post-operative hospital stay of our seven patients was 16.5 days (range 10 to 38 days).\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Pancreatico-duodenectomy is one of the most difficult procedures for gastroenterological surgeons, and has high morbidity and mortality rates. Pancreatic fistula is a common and severe complication after pancreatico-duodenectomy and often causes pseudoaneurysm formation and intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Hemorrhage can occur not only in the peri-operative period, but also a long time after the operation.\n\n【32】It is reported that the mortality rate of intra-abdominal hemorrhage formerly ranged from 30 percent to 58 percent, however it has recently decreased to less than 5 percent because the trans-arterial embolization technique has progressed \\[ 1 – 6 , 16 – 19 \\]. Furthermore, it was reported that the combination of polyglycolic acid felt and fibrin glue prevents pancreatic fistula after pancreatico-duodenectomy and that wrapping the major vessels using the falciform ligament or omentum decreases the incidence of pancreatic fistula and intra-abdominal hemorrhage \\[ 11 – 19 \\]. However, the mortality rate after pancreatico-duodenectomy is still higher than that after other procedures. For patients with pancreatic head carcinoma, a part of the transverse mesocolon is resected for lymph node and nerve plexus dissection, while the transverse mesocolon is left in place in patients with ampullary carcinoma, intra-ductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, or tumor-forming pancreatitis because these diseases do not require extensive dissection of the lymph nodes or para-superior mesenteric artery. Because the physical quality of most pancreata with pancreatic carcinoma is hard, the risk of pancreatic fistula in patients with pancreatic carcinoma is lower than that in patients with a soft pancreas. Therefore, pancreatic carcinoma is excluded from the indications for our procedure. It has been reported in the Japanese literature that displacing the stump of the remnant pancreas from the superior to inferior side of the transverse mesocolon after total gastrectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy prevented intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to pancreatic fistula. This report demonstrated that the fluid amylase level of the superior side was less than that of the inferior side, and as a result, intra-abdominal hemorrhage deceased. By applying this technique and theory to pancreatico-duodenectomy, we developed a method involving relative displacement of the anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy. The anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy is originally located on the superior side of the transverse mesocolon, therefore the skeletonized vessels, such as the common hepatic artery, proper hepatic artery, and stump of the gastro-duodenal artery, are exposed to pancreatic juice when a pancreatic fistula is present. By displacing the anastomotic site from the superior to inferior side, these arteries are not exposed to the pancreatic juice, preventing intra-abdominal hemorrhage. We did not examine whether pancreatic juice seeped through the mesentery, but our procedure was developed on the condition that pancreatic juice does not seep.\n\n【33】Because most of our patients did not develop a pancreatic fistula, their post-operative outcomes were not improved by performing our procedure.\n\n【34】This relative displacement of the anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy in pancreatico-duodenectomy may prevent intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to pancreatic fistula formation after pancreatico-duodenectomy. Notably, this procedure should be performed in patients with a soft pancreas. However, we only used this procedure with a few of our patients; moreover, there were no incidents of severe pancreatic fistula or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Many more patients with severe pancreatic fistula are needed to confirm the efficacy of our procedure.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】Relative displacement of the anastomotic site of the pancreato-jejunostomy may be expected to prevent intra-abdominal hemorrhage and will be an option in pancreatico-duodenectomy.\n\n【37】Consent\n-------\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this manuscript and any accompanying images.

We report a case of dramatic radiotherapy response of a patient with a giant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp with extensive skull destruction and suspected infiltration of the dura mater and superior sagittal sinus. This case is the first report of this kind in the literature that shows that large bone defects can heal with the resolution of tumor and inflammation by secondary intention without surgical reconstruction. We want to put an end to concerns about radiocurability of tumors with extensive bone involvement, and show sustained complete response after definitive radiotherapy and programmed cell death protein-1 inhibiting antibody therapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 74-year-old White man presented with a 7.2 × 6.8 × 5.5 cm painless tumor on the right parietal region of the scalp. Medical imaging revealed widespread destruction of the skull and suspected infiltration of the dura mater and superior sagittal sinus. Biopsies showed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cT4a cN0 cM0, stage IVA). The patient was treated with a total dose of 60 Gy, at 2 Gy per daily fraction with volumetric modulated arc therapy using 6 megavoltage photons. The biologically effective dose (alpha/beta 10 Gy) was 72 Gy. The tumor response correlated with dose received. The patient had a massive tumor necrosis secondary to tumor shrinkage after 18 fractions (36 Gy, biologically effective dose 43.2 Gy). Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid did not occur. Radiotherapy did not hamper the patient’s quality of life. The patient had a clear regression of the initial tumor on the final day of radiotherapy. The bone defect healed by secondary intention without surgical interventions. The patient achieved a complete response with a good cosmetic result after 82 days follow-up. He started a programmed cell death protein-1 inhibiting antibody therapy with cemiplimab 2 months after radiotherapy, and is now at 10 months follow-up without evidence of recurrence.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Definitive radiotherapy is a safe and highly effective therapy for giant tumors of the scalp with extensive bone destruction. We report a sustained complete response with a good cosmetic result after secondary wound healing.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Giant T4 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the scalp with extensive bone infiltration are a treatment challenge. The subgaleal plane offers little resistance to tumors and cSCC can spread for long distances with invasion of the dura mater, vessels, and brain \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In many cases, the size of the T4 cSCC impedes sufficient surgical margins or requires resections with unreasonable cosmetic results \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. International guidelines consider definitive radiotherapy (RT) as a curative alternative to surgery for patients with cSCC in sensitive anatomical areas of the head and neck where surgery compromises function or cosmesis, and for patients who cannot undergo an operation (for example due to presence of comorbidities). Furthermore, some patients prefer a noninvasive treatment. Definitive RT plays a major role in these patients, with encouraging results \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Better understanding of tolerance doses, advances in treatment planning, and better nursing management for patients receiving RT contributes to a low risk of severe late complications after RT, which range from 5% to 9% \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]. Unfortunately, there is a misbelief that tumors with extensive bone involvement have worse local control by RT \\[ 8 \\]. The literature shows sufficient data to the contrary \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\]. Mapping the RT literature of RT demonstrates that cSCC with bone involvement has a 5-year local control of 40% and a 5-year cause-specific survival of 52% after definitive RT \\[ 5 \\]. It is time to emphasize the sufficient rates of local control and cause-specific survival after definitive RT. This case must be reported to show that patients with large cSCC of the scalp and massive bone destruction can have a sustained complete response after definitive RT and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibiting antibody therapy. We show the largely unknown fact that even large bone defects can heal with the resolution of tumor and inflammation by secondary intention with good cosmetic results. Given the increase in unresectable tumors, we believe this case has clinical impact across more than one clinical specialty.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 74-year-old White man presented to the emergency department of our institution with a 7 × 6 × 4 cm tumor on the right parietal region of the scalp. Figure 1 shows the patient at the time of presentation. The patient was conscious and painless. He suffered from psoriasis vulgaris and advanced psoriasis arthropathy, with contracture of the shoulders and gibbus of the thoracic spine. He gave a history of immunosuppression and intense ultraviolet exposure without a family history of cancer. The patient reported that the tumor had begun as a small lesion approximately 5 months prior, and continued to expand to its measured size at presentation. The patient record showed that the patient had a cSCC in the middle of the scalp 6 years ago, which was resected with a narrow resection margin of 6.8 mm and covered with a split skin graft of the right thigh (pT2 cN0 cM0, stage II). A new histological confirmation of the recurrent cSCC was obtained. The patient had a clinically negative neck without evidence of metastatic spread. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 7.2 × 6.8 × 5.5 cm tumor with widespread destruction of the skull and suspected infiltration of the dura mater and superior sagittal sinus (Fig. 2 ). Fluorine‐18‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18 F-FDG-PET-CT) revealed the known tumor of the skull. The TNM stage was cT4a cN0 cM0, stage IVA using the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system (8th edition). There was no useful operative option. Definitive RT was recommended. The patient underwent planning computed tomography (SOMATOM Sensation open of Siemens AG Medical Solutions). He was simulated for RT in a reproducible position with lifted upper body. A thermoplastic head mask was used for immobilization and fixation. A bolus material was placed over the tumor to ensure sufficient surface dose. Monaco external beam-planning software (Version 5.11, Elekta) was used for contouring and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning. Figure 3 shows CT planning sagittal slices through the tumor with isodoses from the original RT treatment plan. The planning target volume (PTV) covered the gross tumor volume plus an appropriate margin, and he was treated with a total dose of 60 Gy at 2 Gy per daily fraction over 6 weeks (biologically effective dose; BED <sub>10 </sub> 72 Gy). We performed VMAT at Elekta Synergy Agility Linear Accelerator with a 160 multileaf collimator by 6 megavoltage (MV) photons and a dose rate of daily 478.77 monitor units. The physical treatment plan consisted of two arcs.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Clinical presentation before definitive radiotherapy. A 74-year-old White man presented to our emergency department with a 7 × 6 × 4 cm tumor on the right parietal region of the scalp. The patient was conscious and painless.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】T1 MP-RAGE 3D weighted sagittal contrast-enhanced MRI sequence before definitive radiotherapy. MRI showed a 7.2 × 6.8 × 5.5 cm tumor with destruction of the skull and suspected infiltration of the dura mater and superior sagittal sinus. Biopsies showed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The TNM stage was cT4a cN0 cM0, stage IVA using the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging system (8th edition).\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Sagittal view of planning computed tomography images in fusion with MRI. The planning target volume (thick red line) covered the gross tumor volume plus an appropriate margin and was treated with a total dose of 60 Gy at 2 Gy per daily fraction over 6 weeks (BED <sub>10 </sub> 72 Gy). Radiation dose distribution represented by radiation isodose lines: The thick red line represents the planning target volume and the thick green line represents the 57 Gy isodose line (that is 95% isodose, encompassing planning target volume). One cm thick bolus material was used to ensure sufficient surface dose.\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】The tumor response correlated with the dose received. The patient had a massive tumor necrosis secondary to rapid tumor shrinkage after 18 fractions (36 Gy, BED <sub>10 </sub> 43.2 Gy). We found visible dura mater on the base of the ulcer. There was no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (Fig. 4 ). Acute side effects included radiation-induced dermatitis CTC grade 3 using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.0) and spotty bleeding. Daily visits and nursing care were provided to prevent infection. The patient had a clear regression of the initial tumor on the final day of RT (60 Gy, BED <sub>10 </sub> 72 Gy). The base of the necrosis appeared mainly to comprise granulation tissue (Fig. 5 ). The patient was painless at any point in time. He did not require treatment breaks for complications. Granulation and reepithelialization proceeded from the wound edges within 10 days after RT. The large wound healed rapidly with the resolution of the tumor and inflammation by secondary intention without infection or new tissue breakdown. We found no late complications. The patient did not need surgical or reconstructive interventions. RT permitted a clinical complete remission at 82 days follow-up (Fig. 6 ). MR images obtained 3 months after irradiation showed residual inflammatory tissue on the base of the initial ulcer (Fig. 7 ). The patient started a PD-1 inhibiting antibody therapy with cemiplimab 350 mg every 3 weeks, administered as an infusion 2 months after the last RT. The treatment with cemiplimab was well tolerated without adverse events. The patient is now at 10 months follow-up without clinical evidence of tumor recurrence and continues therapy with cemiplimab (Fig. 8 ).\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Clinical appearance after 36 Gy (BED <sub>10 </sub> 43.2 Gy).

Treatment with cemiplimab was well tolerated without adverse events.\n\n【44】Full size image\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】This case is important to medicine because it shows a dramatic response to definitive RT. Extensive tumor shrinkage led to clearly visible dura mater and spotty bleeding without bigger hemorrhage. Massive tumor shrinkage can damage cerebral blood vessels and result in a breakdown of the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, our patient had no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid or wound infections. Intense nursing care contributed to favorable safety and tolerability of definitive RT. No further surgical interventions were required. This report raises the possibility that tumors with extensive soft tissue and bone involvement can successfully be treated with definitive RT. RT did not hamper the patient’s quality of life. The defect of the scalp healed by secondary intention. The literature shows that wound healing by secondary intention can successfully be used for defects of the scalp in patients who are poor candidates for surgical reconstruction \\[ 9 \\]. The illustrated patient was highly satisfied with the treatment and the excellent outcome of definitive RT. It will be interesting to document patients’ perspective and quality of life with the patient-reported outcome measures at specific time points during and after treatment of advanced skin tumors. Disease-free survival and overall survival are reasonable metrics but do not analyze the experience of patients during and after treatment \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【47】Our patient was treated with conventional fractionation (2 Gy/fx with BED <sub>10 </sub> 72 Gy) in accordance with international recommendations \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The American Society for Radiation Oncology published an upgraded guideline for definitive RT for cSCC in 2020 \\[ 3 \\]. Definitive RT is recommended as a curative treatment in patients with cSCC who cannot undergo or decline surgical resection (strong strength of recommendation and moderate quality of evidence) \\[ 3 \\]. Definitive RT is conditionally recommended as a curative treatment modality in patients with cSCC in anatomical areas where surgery can compromise function or cosmesis (conditional strength of recommendation with moderate quality of evidence) \\[ 3 \\]. The reason for this weak level of evidence is the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of definitive RT in patient survival and local tumor control to other local therapies \\[ 3 \\]. Pending prospective data, retrospective studies show durable local tumor control and functional and cosmetic preservation by definitive RT \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 11 \\].\n\n【48】Our patient had an unsuccessful surgical treatment 6 years ago. This is associated with a high level of risk because recurrent tumors show poor local tumor control by RT \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 12 \\]. Lee _et al._ \\[ 5 \\] conducted a multivariate analysis of definitive RT for 68 stage T4 tumors of the skin of the head and neck, and analyzed local control and cause-specific survival rates of definitive RT as a function of previous treatment. The 5-year initial local control rate of previously untreated tumors was 67% and of recurrent tumors 41% ( _p_ \\= 0.07) after RT. The cause-specific 5-year survival differed significantly between previously untreated and recurrent tumors after RT (93% versus 58%, _p_ \\= 0.003) \\[ 5 \\]. This stresses the importance of sufficient initial treatment of cSCC for optimal local control and survival by RT.\n\n【49】The definitive RT of advanced T4 cSCC of the head and neck shows 5-year local control rates of 50–60% \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 12 \\]. It is a popular misbelief that definitive RT cannot lead to local control and cure when tumors infiltrate bone \\[ 8 \\]. The literature shows enough data to the contrary, although cSCC with bone involvement show a lower probability of cure by RT \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 \\]. Lee _et al._ \\[ 5 \\] showed results of definitive RT of tumors invading bone. The involvement of bone decreased the probability of initial local control (62% versus 40%, _p_ \\= 0.08) and cause-specific survival by RT at 5 years (92% versus 52%, _p_ \\= 0.001) \\[ 5 \\]. In summary, we must note, that definitive RT leads to a relatively high rate of local control and cause-specific survival for this unfavorable group of tumors with infiltration of bone.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【51】We report a remarkable sustained response to definitive RT in an elderly patient with a giant tumor of the scalp. Modern treatment planning and intense nursing care contributed to a good cosmetic result after secondary wound healing. Definitive RT achieves high local control rates without severe acute or late side effects. The currently available literature lacks prospective randomized trials for the use of definitive RT of tumors with extensive bone infiltration, but the presented case report shows both favorable safety and tolerability and a high effectiveness of definitive RT.\n\n【52】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【53】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.\n\n【54】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【55】cSCC:\n\n【56】Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\n\n【57】RT:\n\n【58】Radiotherapy\n\n【59】MRI:\n\n【60】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【61】18 F-FDG-PET-CT:\n\n【62】Fluorine‐18‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography\n\n【63】UICC:\n\n【64】Union for International Cancer Control\n\n【65】VMAT:\n\n【66】Volumetric modulated arc therapy\n\n【67】PTV:\n\n【68】Planning target volume\n\n【69】MV:\n\n【70】Megavoltage\n\n【71】BED:\n\n【72】Biologically effective dose\n\n【73】CTCAE:\n\n【74】Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The first report of hemoglobin Q-Iran and the nomenclature of this hemoglobinopathy dates back to 1970. Iran is known as a country with a high prevalence of α- and β-thalassemia and different types of hemoglobinopathy. Many of these variants are yet to be identified as the practice of molecular laboratory techniques is limited in this part of the world. Applying such molecular methods, we report the first hemoglobin Q-Iran cases in Northern Iran.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An unusual band was detected in an isoelectric focusing test and cellulose acetate electrophoresis of a sample from a 22-year-old Iranian man from Mazandaran Province. Capillary zone electrophoresis analysis identified this band as hemoglobin Q. A similar band was also detected in his mother's electrophoresis (38 years, Iranian ethnicity). The cases underwent molecular investigation and the presence of a hemoglobin Q-Iran mutation was confirmed by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method. Direct conventional sequencing revealed a single guanine to cytosine missense mutation (c.226G > C; _G_ AC > _C_ AC) at codon 75 in the α-globin gene in both cases.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The wide spectrum and high frequency of nondeletional α-globin mutations in Mazandaran Province is remarkable and seem to differ considerably from what has been found in Mediterranean populations. This short communication reports the first cases of patients with hemoglobin Q found in that region.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Hemoglobin (Hb) Q is a single nucleotide polymorphism occurring in the Hb α-2 chain. Hb Q variants are recognized by a slow-moving band migrating at a similar position to Hb S on alkaline pH electrophoresis. This Hb Q variant has normal solubility \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】A number of important members of the Hb Q family share a certain molecular feature-the replacement of aspartic acid (Asp) by histidine (His) at different positions in the amino acid chain. These include Hb Q-Thailand (α74 Asp→His), Q-India (α64 Asp→His) and Q-Iran (α75 Asp→His). The association of Hb Q-Thailand with α-thalassemia is frequently reported and the majority of patients show moderate red cell microcytosis \\[ 2 \\]. In contrast, there are few reports of any affiliation of Hb Q-India and Hb Q-Iran with other Hb disorders and deletions \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【11】Computerized simulation of secondary and tertiary protein structures of these Hb molecules by standard bioinformatic methods suggest that Hb Q-Iran and Hb Q-Thailand have one and two extra helices respectively, whilst Hb Q-India has a protein structure similar to the normal Hb molecule \\[ 4 \\]. In the heterozygous state, patients with Hb Q-India or Hb Q-Iran do not have the thalassemia phenotype or any distinctive clinical manifestation. Furthermore, these Hb abnormalities do not affect hematologic features. The replacement of aspartic acid with histidine is on the surface of the protein structure and does not affect the protein interchain contacts and electrical charges of the molecule, and therefore does not cause any changes in hematologic parameters and indices \\[ 5 \\]. Interestingly, in a unique report of a homozygous patient with Hb Q-Iran, no clinical symptom was observed \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【12】The first report of Hb Q-Iran and the nomenclature of this hemoglobinopathy dates back to 1970 and the work of Lorkin _et al_ ., introducing the substitution of aspartic acid by histidine at position α75 (EF4) as the responsible defect for this hemoglobinopathy \\[ 5 \\]. In 2007, Rahimi and colleagues reported the first incidence of such a hemoglobinopathy in an Iranian individual \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【13】Iran is known as a country with a high prevalence of α- and β-thalassemia and different types of hemoglobinopathy. Many of these variants are yet to be identified as the practice of molecular laboratory techniques is limited in this part of the world. Applying molecular methods, we here report the first cases of patients with Hb Q-Iran in Northern Iran.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 22-year-old Iranian man originally from the northern province of Mazandaran, was admitted to Fajr Laboratory Center (Sari, Iran) for premarital thalassemia screening. All evaluated hematologic indices were in the normal range (Table 1 ); however, both isoelectric focusing and cellulose acetate electrophoresis techniques revealed an unusual slow moving electrophoretic band in the location of Hb Q. A hematological investigation was then performed for the whole family. His father's blood tableau and Hb electrophoretic pattern were completely normal. His mother was a 38-year-old of Iranian ethnicity with normal hematologic indices. Her Hb electrophoretic pattern contained a band suspected to be Hb Q. Further evaluation by automatic capillary zone electrophoresis (Minicap system, Sebia, France) revealed an extra peak in the graphs of our two patients, identified as Hb Q (Table 1 ). Previous reports of the quantity of Hb Q-Iran are stated to be 17% to 19% of the total Hb content. In our study, we found the amount of Hb Q-Iran to be 19.2% in these heterozygous individuals.\n\n【16】**Table 1 Hematologic indices and Hb electrophoresis of our patients.**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】The family was then referred to the Kariminejad-Najmabadi Pathology and Genetics Center for molecular analysis. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples were obtained from all members of the family and analyzed for α-globin mutations. The samples were examined by DNA analysis for the presence of the Hb Q-Iran mutation using the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method. Automated direct nucleotide sequencing (ABII377, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) of the amplified α2- and α1-globin genes was performed to characterize other nondeletional α-thalassemia determinants. Direct conventional sequencing revealed a single guanine to cytosine missense mutation (c.226G > C; _G_ AC > _C_ AC) at codon 75 in the α-globin gene in all samples except from the father (Figure 1 ). No other α-globin mutation could be detected by direct nucleotide sequencing.\n\n【19】**Figure 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】**Deoxyribonucleic acid sequence analysis of the α2-globin gene** . The coding exon deoxyribonucleic acid from our patient was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. A segment of the nucleotide sequences containing the mutation is shown. The position of the single guanine to cytosine missense mutation (codon 75 G > C) is indicated by the colored box.\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Despite the normal clinical features of our patients, laboratory findings led to the identification of a rare Hb variant, Hb Q-Iran. Hereby, we report a family in the north of Iran whose members are carriers of the Hb Q-Iran gene.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Iran is a multiethnic country with a vast variation of thalassemia-causing mutations and there are reports of hemoglobinopathies from different regions of that country \\[ 8 \\]. The northern (Mazandaran and Gilan) and southern (Khuzestan) provinces of Iran are the areas most prone to different Hb abnormalities and there have been several studies for identification of these variants in these regions \\[ 9 \\]. Mazandaran is a province in the north of Iran, by the Caspian Sea. The wide spectrum and high frequency of nondeletional α-globin mutations in Mazandaran Province is remarkable and seems to differ considerably from what has been found in Mediterranean populations \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【26】We have previously reported of less common Hb α-chain mutations in that region, namely initiation codon mutation (ATG > AGG, α2), J-Paris-I (GCC > GAC, α1), codon 14 mutation (TGG > TAG, α1), codon 22 mutation (GGC > GGT, α2), Caserta (GCG > ACG, α2), intervening sequence (IVS)-I-116 (A > G, α2), IVS-II-55 (T > G, α2), Bleuland (ACC > AAC, α2), Sun Prairie (GCT > CCT, α2), 3'UTR nt 46 (C > A, α2) \\[ 9 \\], J-Toronto (GCC > GAC, α1) and Setif (GAC > TAC, α2) \\[ 10 \\]. This short communication reports the first Hb Q cases found in that region.\n\n【27】Besides Iran, there have been several reports of Hb-Q from Turkey \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. This is not the first hemoglobinopathy in common between Iranian and Turkish populations. There are several findings of different abnormal Hb molecules such as Hb J-Iran, Hb D-Iran, Hb Hamadan and Hb D-Punjab in people of both ethnicities \\[ 11 \\]. These findings, along with further haplotype studies, may suggest a common ancestral origin for the people in that region and help to propose immigration patterns at the time of colonization by Aryans on the Iranian Plateau and in Middle Asia, circa 4,000 BC .\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】Different hemoglobinopathies are frequently reported from Northern Iran, but this is the first report of an Hb Q-Iran mutation in members of a family from that region. This report provides a substantial piece of evidence in completing the list of discovered Hb abnormalities on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea.\n\n【30】Consent\n-------\n\n【31】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and his mother for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

{"seq_id": "6390541f-71aa-4766-adb2-fa4a6185e783", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Pituitary apoplexy is acute infarction with or without hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. It is a rare but potentially life-threatening emergency that most commonly occurs in the setting of pituitary adenoma. The mechanisms underlying pituitary apoplexy are not well understood, but are proposed to include factors of both hemodynamic supply and adenoma demand. In the case of patients with known pituitary macroadenomas undergoing major surgery for other indications, there is a theoretically increased risk of apoplexy in the setting of “surgical stress.” However, risk stratification of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas prior to major surgery is challenging because the precipitating factors for pituitary apoplexy are not completely understood. Here we present a case in which intraoperative hypovolemia is a possible mechanistic precipitating factor for pituitary apoplexy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 76-year-old patient with a known hypofunctioning pituitary macroadenoma underwent nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, during which there was significant intraoperative blood loss. He became symptomatic with ophthalmoplegia on the second postoperative day, and was diagnosed with pituitary apoplexy. He was managed conservatively with cortisol replacement therapy, and underwent therapeutic anticoagulation 2 months after pituitary apoplexy for deep vein thrombosis. His ophthalmoplegia slowly resolved over months of follow-up. Pituitary apoplexy did not recur with therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】When considering the risk of surgery in patients with a known pituitary macroadenoma, an operation with possible high-volume intraoperative blood loss may have increased risk of pituitary apoplexy because intraoperative hypovolemia may precipitate ischemia, infarction, and subsequent hemorrhage. This may be particularly relevant in the cases of elective surgery. Additionally, we found that we were able to therapeutically anticoagulate a patient 2 months after pituitary apoplexy for the management of deep vein thrombosis without recurrence of pituitary apoplexy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Pituitary apoplexy is acute infarction with or without hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. It is a rare and potentially life-threatening emergency that most commonly occurs in the setting of pituitary adenoma. Postoperative pituitary apoplexy has been described after lobectomy \\[ 14 \\], lumbar fusion \\[ 1 , 8 \\], coronary artery bypass grafting \\[ 7 \\], thyroidectomy \\[ 9 \\], and arthroplasty \\[ 10 \\]. Perioperative factors contributing to apoplexy are not known, with theories ranging from characteristics of the adenoma such as abnormal vasculature, large size, and growth velocity, to changes in hemodynamics in the setting of surgery resulting in adenoma ischemia or predisposing to hemorrhage. Here, we report a case of pituitary apoplexy in a patient with a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma following nephrectomy with high-volume blood loss. Significant intraoperative blood loss may have precipitated pituitary apoplexy in this patient via pituitary hypoperfusion. Subsequent conservative management was hemodynamically complicated by deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was anticoagulated without recurrence of pituitary hemorrhage.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】### Initial presentation\n\n【12】A 76-year-old man with a history of renal cell carcinoma with prior left nephrectomy and chronic kidney disease presented with low libido and erectile dysfunction ongoing for several years. Laboratory evaluation revealed low testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone levels, consistent with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Table 1 ). This prompted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which demonstrated a large sellar mass (up to 2.7 cm in diameter) with suprasellar extension, optic chiasmal contact, and extension into the right sphenoid and cavernous sinuses (Fig. 1 A, B ). The patient was diagnosed with a nonfunctioning pituitary macroademona with partial hypopituitarism (Table 1 ). At this time, despite radiological evidence of optic chiasm compression and cavernous sinus extension, the patient had no clinical evidence of a sellar mass effect, including intact visual fields, normal funduscopic appearance of the optic nerves, and absence of ophthalmoplegia bilaterally. He had no symptoms of hypopituitarism other than sexual dysfunction.\n\n【13】**Table 1 Laboratory evaluation**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Preoperative MRI shows pituitary macroadenoma (2.7 cm) with suprasellar extension and compression of optic chiasm, parasellar extension into right cavernous sinus, and extension into right sphenoid sinus on coronal T1 with contrast ( **a** ) and sagittal T2 FLAIR ( **b** ). Postoperative day 7 MRI demonstrates hemorrhage on coronal T2 ( **c** ) and sagittal T2 FLAIR ( **d** ). Postoperative week 10 MRI demonstrating resolution of hemorrhagic changes within pituitary gland, decrease in size of adenoma now limited to sella, and no mass effect on optic chiasm on coronal T1 without contrast ( **e** ) and sagittal T2 FLAIR ( **f** )\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Concurrently, abdominal MRI identified a right kidney mass (1.4 × 3.4 × 5.6 cm) concerning for recurrent malignancy. Given high suspicion for malignancy in the solitary kidney in the setting of chronic kidney disease, a partial right nephrectomy was planned. Transphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma was deferred at this time.\n\n【20】### Nephrectomy and postoperative course\n\n【21】The patient underwent partial right nephrectomy with pathological confirmation of clear cell renal carcinoma. Given the patient’s low preoperative morning cortisol level (Table 1 ), the patient was treated with 2 days of intravenous corticosteroid supplementation beginning the day of surgery. The intraoperative course was complicated by bleeding at the surgical site with significant blood loss (estimated 3 L) requiring 3 units packed red blood cells and 4 L fluid replacement intraoperatively, as well as brief vasopressors postoperatively. The period of hypovolemia was likely significant, as the patient had postoperative anuria ultimately requiring ureteric stenting on postoperative day 5.\n\n【22】On postoperative day 2, the patient reported new-onset moderate headache and near-complete right-sided ptosis was observed. When the right eyelid was lifted, he experienced binocular diplopia. Examination showed severe right-eye ophthalmoplegia (80–90% limitations in adduction, elevation, and depression, and complete limitation of abduction), mild right pupillary mydriasis with normal reactivity, and no relative afferent pupillary defect. Visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye (reduced from 20/20), though color vision was intact, visual fields were full by confrontation field testing, and the structural eye examination was normal. He was diagnosed with right-sided pupil-involving partial third nerve palsy, complete sixth nerve palsy, and possible early compressive optic neuropathy.\n\n【23】Postoperative laboratory evaluation revealed panhypopituitarism (Table 1 ) and intravenous corticosteroid supplementation was resumed. Repeat brain MRI on postoperative day 7 was performed without contrast (in the setting of acute-on-chronic kidney injury with solitary partial kidney) and demonstrated increased heterogeneity of the sellar and suprasellar mass with areas of predominantly right-sided hemorrhage, consistent with expected radiographic changes observed in the days following pituitary apoplexy \\[ 4 \\]. Extension to the optic chiasm, right sphenoid sinus, and right cavernous sinus (Fig. 1 C, D ) was unchanged. The patient was transitioned to oral corticosteroid replacement therapy with close monitoring of visual parameters.\n\n【24】### Follow-up care and monitoring\n\n【25】By postoperative day 10 (after 48 hours of oral corticosteroid therapy), visual acuity improved to baseline and ophthalmoplegia improved with reduced extent of cranial nerve 3 palsy, though cranial nerve 6 palsy remained complete. On postoperative day 11, the patient was discharged with continued corticosteroid replacement therapy. At 6 weeks post nephrectomy, the patient’s visual acuity remained normal and visual fields remained full by formal automated testing (Humphrey 24-2). His third nerve palsy fully resolved by postoperative week 6 while the sixth nerve palsy did not fully resolve until postoperative month 5. Throughout his course he showed no evidence of optic neuropathy by funduscopic examination nor by ophthalmic imaging with optical coherence tomography.\n\n【26】### Anticoagulation without recurrence of apoplexy\n\n【27】On a subsequent admission 2 months after nephrectomy, the patient was found to have left lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVT) without evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Repeat brain MRI showed resolution of pituitary adenoma hemorrhage with partial involution (Fig. 1 E, F ), and the patient was administered therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient did not develop further clinically evident DVT, and his pituitary apoplexy did not recur.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Although pituitary apoplexy most commonly occurs in the setting of a known pituitary adenoma, it remains a rare condition with a risk of 0.2–0.6 events per 100 person-years among patients with known nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas \\[ 6 \\]. Surgical intervention for nonfunctioning adenomas is generally reserved for patients who become symptomatic, most commonly through mass effect rather than via hypoandrogenism, and transsphenoidal resection is first-line treatment in these cases. However, the selection of patients for conservative management remains an area of investigation as the precipitating factors for pituitary apoplexy are not completely understood \\[ 3 \\]. In particular, there are no guidelines that enable risk stratification of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas for postoperative pituitary apoplexy.\n\n【30】It is thought that pituitary apoplexy can result from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that ultimately cause ischemia. These include factors that contribute to outgrowth of blood supply (the small arteries from the medial wall of the cavernous carotid), such as the presence of a pituitary tumor or pituitary hyperplastic states such as pregnancy or exogenous estrogen intake. Factors that contribute to reduced blood flow may also contribute, such as acute hypotension or thromboembolic events in perturbed hemostasis. Additionally, pituitary adenomas themselves may have abnormal vasculature that renders them intrinsically susceptible to infarction. In the case presented here, it is plausible that a combination of increased hemodynamic demand by the macroadenoma, adenoma-intrinsic susceptibility, and coagulopathy of chronic kidney disease played combined predisposing roles, while intraoperative blood loss resulted in decreased vascular flux and ultimately precipitated pituitary ischemia followed by infarction, necrosis, and subsequent hemorrhage. This case suggests that the risk of pituitary apoplexy may be higher in patients with known adenomas undergoing a procedure with a high risk of intraoperative blood loss.\n\n【31】Pituitary apoplexy most commonly presents with a sudden-onset, severe headache; visual defects; and ophthalmoplegia \\[ 6 \\]. Ophthalmic signs are not always present initially \\[ 10 \\] and their absence should not preclude evaluation for hypopituitarism. Although deficiency in any pituitary hormone can occur, adrenocorticotropin deficiency is critical to identify because it can lead to cardiovascular collapse, which is preventable through administration of corticosteroids. Our patient received perioperative intravenous corticosteroid supplementation and 3 weeks of oral corticosteroid supplementation. Our patient’s presentation with ophthalmoplegia on the second postoperative day fits the time course that would occur with necrosis and secondary hemorrhage.\n\n【32】Our case was further complicated by the question of whether prior pituitary apoplexy without resection is a contraindication for anticoagulation in the management of deep vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation itself can precipitate pituitary apoplexy \\[ 5 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\], but it is not known whether anticoagulation after pituitary apoplexy increases the risk of recurrent hemorrhage. Here, given radiographic evidence of pituitary adenoma hemorrhage resorption and involution, and the high risk of further deep vein thrombosis development, the patient was given therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent further thrombosis. The patient showed no signs of recurrent pituitary apoplexy, and continued to recover extraocular movement at frequent follow-ups with optometry. The patient will continue to be monitored with serial eye exams and neuroimaging.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【34】When considering the risk of surgery in patients with a known pituitary macroadenoma, an operation with possible high-volume intraoperative blood loss may have increased risk of pituitary apoplexy because intraoperative hypovolemia may precipitate ischemia, infarction, and subsequent hemorrhage. This may be particularly relevant in the cases of elective surgery. Additionally, we found that we were able to therapeutically anticoagulate a patient 2 months after pituitary apoplexy for the management of DVT without recurrence of pituitary apoplexy.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】DVT:\n\n【39】Deep vein thrombosis\n\n【40】MRI:\n\n【41】Magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Arthritis or arthralgia occurs in 80 % of patients. We believe this to be the first case report to describe the finding of polyarthritis in a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan in a patient with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis without clinical signs of arthritis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 4.5-year-old Caucasian boy presented with fever of 4 days’ duration followed by debilitating migratory arthralgia and inflammation. He underwent a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan to exclude a possible malignant cause or to detect any infectious or autoimmune focus of his symptoms. Fludeoxyglucose uptake was observed in multiple large joints and in multiple tendons. These findings suggested active polyarthritis and polytendinitis. However, physical and ultrasound evaluations did not show any signs of arthritis in our patient, despite his evident arthralgia.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography might be able to detect inflammatory activity in painful joints that cannot yet be detected clinically or with ultrasound evaluation in a patient with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. Therefore, fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography can be of additional value in the diagnostic workup of patients with an unresolved diagnosis of suspected autoimmune disease, especially in patients with unresolved arthralgia and fever of unknown cause.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common systemic vasculitis in children. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a type of small vessel vasculitis. Validated classification criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura have been proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES). A patient’s disease is classified as Henoch-Schönlein purpura in the presence of purpura or petechiae (mandatory) with lower limb predominance plus one of four criteria: (1) abdominal pain; (2) histopathology (IgA); (3) arthritis or arthralgia; or (4) renal involvement \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】The incidence of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is reported to be 10–20 per 100,000 children \\[ 2 – 6 \\]. Henoch-Schönlein purpura can be diagnosed at any age, but is most common in children between 2 and 6 years of age. The rash of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is considered a classical symptom; however, in 30–40 % of cases it is not the presenting symptom, and the purpura is preceded by abdominal pain or arthralgia. Although only 15–25 % of patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura present with arthritis or arthralgia, over the course of the disease approximately 80 % of patients have joint involvement \\[ 7 \\]. The reported prevalence of arthritis as a symptom of Henoch-Schönlein purpura in pediatric patients varies in the literature from 61 to 92 % \\[ 8 – 13 \\]. Usually the large joints of the lower limbs are affected. Symptoms of joint involvement include pain, swelling, and decreased range of movement \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【11】In this report, we present the case of a 4.5-year-old boy with a final diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura who did not have clinical signs of arthritis. A fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scan, however, showed FDG uptake in multiple large joints and in multiple tendons. <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG is a glucose analog that reflects the energy demand of inflammatory and/or malignant cells. Therefore, an increased uptake of <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG results from the increased metabolism of either inflammatory or malignant cells. In our case, the findings suggested active polyarthritis and polytendinitis, suggesting that an FDG-PET/CT scan can show inflammatory activity in painful joints that cannot yet be detected clinically or with ultrasound evaluation.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 4.5-year-old Caucasian boy without a previous medical history presented to the pediatric outpatient clinic of a local hospital with a fever of 40.1 °C without clear focal symptoms. He was reported as being less active. He refused to walk and reported mild myalgia, but did not complain about joint pain. His parents reported that he had had a painful throat 2–3 weeks prior to presentation. At that time, no doctor was consulted. Two weeks prior to presentation his parents noticed peeling of the skin on his fingers, which recurred 1 day prior to presentation. A timeline of this case is shown in Table 1 . Our patient was vaccinated according to the Dutch National Immunization Program.\n\n【14】**Table 1 A timeline of events for a 4.5-year-old boy with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】A physical examination at presentation revealed a left-sided torticollis and edema of both hands and feet. Our patient was irritable, without clinical sings of meningitis. The rest of his physical examination, including an inspection of his ears, nose, and throat, was normal. His vital signs were normal. An ultrasound evaluation demonstrated bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes, not noted on palpation during the physical examination. Because lymphadenopathy of a bacterial origin was suspected, treatment was started with an intravenous course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and diclofenac. A blood test revealed an anti-streptolysin O titer of 7590 U/ml, suggestive of a prior streptococcal infection. Despite this treatment, his fever persisted. Owing to the combination of fever, edema of hands and feet, mild conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and irritable behavior, Kawasaki disease was considered and he was referred to our university hospital for further evaluation 3 days after presentation.\n\n【17】On cardiac ultrasound evaluation, no involvement of his coronary arteries was observed. A biochemical evaluation showed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (127 mm/h) and low CRP (9 mg/l). Although our patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease, given that his fever had only persisted for up to 4 days, he was treated twice with 2 g/kg bodyweight of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for possible incomplete Kawasaki disease. Treatment with IVIG, however, did not result in clinical improvement. The enlargement of his cervical lymph nodes decreased over time as evaluated by ultrasonography.\n\n【18】Our patient then developed migrating joint pains in his neck, arms, and legs 8 days after presentation. Diclofenac, but not acetaminophen, was effective in treating these arthralgias. Diclofenac treatment (12.5 mg thrice daily) was started 9 days after presentation and his arthralgia resolved within 2 days of treatment. He also developed finger contractures: both active and passive straightening were affected. Furthermore, an antalgic gait was observed. He did not have any clinical signs of arthritis. During his hospital stay, our patient developed hypertension (highest blood pressure 130/93 mmHg; above the _p90_ for sex and age). Because he did not improve clinically over time and no infectious cause could be identified, an autoimmune disease or a malignancy with paraneoplastic arthralgias was considered. Results of laboratory investigations are shown in Table 2 . To exclude a possible malignant cause or to detect any infectious or autoimmune focus, an FDG-PET/CT scan was performed.\n\n【19】**Table 2 Results of laboratory tests**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Increased FDG uptake was observed in multiple large joints, without profuse effusions on the low-dose CT (Fig. 1 ), and in multiple tendons, such as the tendons of the distal tibialis anterior and the ischiopubic ramus (Fig. 2 ). These findings suggested active polyarthritis and polytendinitis. Furthermore, the FDG-PET/CT showed multiple bilateral metabolically active cervical lymph nodes, probably due to a previous upper respiratory tract infection (Fig. 3 ). A diffuse, slightly increased FDG uptake in his spleen was observed, possibly in the context of an inflammatory response. A long, stretched FDG uptake in the medial part of his right lower leg was due to FDG stasis after intravenous injection at that site.\n\n【22】**Fig. 1**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Maximum intensity projection of the patient. The projection shows increased fludeoxyglucose uptake in multiple joints and at the site of injection in the right lower leg\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 2**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Detailed image of fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan showing increased fludeoxyglucose uptake in the left ischiopubic tendon attachments ( _arrow_ )\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Fig. 3**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Detailed images of fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan showing metabolically active cervical lymph nodes and increased fludeoxyglucose uptake in the left shoulder joint ( _arrows_ )\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Subsequently, our patient was referred for ultrasound evaluation of all joints because of the discrepancy between the findings in the physical examination (no arthritis) and on the FDG-PET/CT (polyarthritis). This ultrasound examination (with power Doppler), however, did not show hydropses, synovitis, or other signs of arthritis in any joint. The dermatologist was involved during admission because our patient showed minimal petechiae in the popliteal area. No skin biopsy was performed at that time.\n\n【35】Treatment with diclofenac led to clinical improvement. Without establishing a diagnosis, our patient was discharged on diclofenac treatment thrice daily. Evaluation at our outpatient clinic the next week revealed the presence of multiple purpura on his lower limbs and buttocks. These skin lesions had been present for 1 day. A skin biopsy, taken from an area with active lesions on his lower leg, showed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with positive IgA depositions, which confirmed the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis.\n\n【36】The day after his visit to the outpatient clinic, our patient presented with bloody stools and abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound did not show any signs of invagination or thickened intestinal walls. His arthralgia and antalgic gait were still present. Owing to the severity of his clinical symptoms (pain and bloody stools), treatment with prednisolone was started and diclofenac was discontinued. Results of a urine evaluation at that time were normal. Our patient improved rapidly after starting prednisolone treatment; the dosage was therefore lowered 10 days later. After 15 days of treatment, our patient was free of symptoms. One month later a relapse in joint pain and abdominal pain occurred and he developed renal manifestations (hematuria and proteinuria). The dosage of the prednisolone was increased again. Finally, prednisolone treatment was stopped 2.5 months after starting, when our patient was completely free of symptoms.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】The presented case demonstrates that FDG-PET/CT can show signs of inflammation in joints and tendons without signs of arthritis on physical and ultrasound evaluation in a pediatric patient with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. Approximately 80 % of patients with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis develop arthritis or arthralgia. The exact etiology of arthritis in Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis is unknown. A study on synovial histology in Behçet’s disease, another systemic vasculitis, showed inflammation and infiltration with lymphocytes and neutrophils and no local signs of vasculitis \\[ 14 \\]. The hypothesis of infiltration with lymphocytes could explain the increased FDG uptake in FDG-PET/CT in the presented case, because these activated lymphocytes consume FDG. In some cases, patients present with arthritis or arthralgia in the absence of the typical skin lesions \\[ 2 , 7 \\]. The absence of skin lesions can impede establishment of the diagnosis, as was illustrated in our case. Hypothetically, the treatment with IVIG in our patient may have delayed the inflammatory cascade, consequently leading to the delayed presentation of skin lesions \\[ 15 \\]. It is well known that systemic symptoms may precede purpura in patients with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. The only case published on FDG-PET/CT in an adult patient with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis describes the presence of a lung abscess \\[ 16 \\]. However, as far as we know, the finding that FDG-PET/CT can reveal metabolically active, otherwise undetectable arthritis in patients with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis has not previously been published. We suggest that FDG-PET/CT can detect increased inflammatory activity in patients with arthralgia before the clinical signs of arthritis are present.\n\n【39】This case illustrates that FDG-PET/CT can provide clues in a challenging diagnostic workup of a patient with unresolved arthralgia and fever of unknown origin. The finding of multiple bilateral active cervical lymph nodes suggests a preceding upper respiratory tract infection, a known trigger for Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. It is well known that FDG-PET/CT is a very sensitive diagnostic tool to detect inflammation, especially in patients with fever of unknown origin and in patients with active rheumatic diseases \\[ 17 , 18 \\]. Available data suggest that FDG-PET/CT is favorable to MRI and CT as a diagnostic tool in patients with fever of unknown origin \\[ 17 \\]. Furthermore, FDG-PET/CT appears to be superior to ultrasound and MRI in the diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis \\[ 18 \\]. Studies on the role of FDG-PET/CT in small vessel vasculitis, like Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis, are lacking \\[ 19 – 21 \\]. A recent study in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, another small vessel vasculitis, showed that FDG-PET/CT can detect occult sites of disease activity \\[ 22 \\]. The presented case suggests that FDG-PET/CT is also capable of detecting synovitis as a systemic manifestation of Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. More studies are needed to evaluate the clinical use of FDG-PET/CT in Henoch-Schönlein and other small vessel vasculitides.\n\n【40】A disadvantage of FDG-PET/CT in children is the use of ionizing radiation. Because children are more susceptible to ionizing radiation than adults, there is a preference to use imaging techniques that do not use ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound or MRI. In specific cases, however, these techniques are not able to point to the diagnosis. In such cases the use of FDG-PET/CT in children is justified and can be very helpful and necessary to visualize inflammatory processes or other diseases showing a high metabolism, such as neoplasms. It must be emphasized that the most recent PET scanners with novel detector technology are capable of detecting ultra-low tracer doses, making reductions in injected dose possible. The recent introduction of hybrid PET-MRI systems can further reduce radiation burden.\n\n【41】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【42】FDG-PET/CT might be able to detect subclinical synovitis in a patient with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis. More research is needed to evaluate the clinical use of FDG-PET/CT in the diagnostic workup of patients with Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The management of these patients remains a challenge. Studies focusing on xeroderma pigmentosum patients developing hematological malignancies are necessary to better understand the most appropriate strategies and precautions for this specific case.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare inherited disease described initially by Kaposi in 1870. This disease is characterized by extreme hypersensitivity to ultraviolet rays predisposing to cutaneous malignancies that can appear in childhood. These manifestations are often associated with ocular lesions that can lead to blindness and sometimes with neurological disorders \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n【10】Different genetic groups correspond to clinical sites of varying severity. Despite a high pathogenic understanding, the evolution is often fatal in the absence of adequate preventive measures.\n\n【11】XP is inherited as an autosomal recessive mode. It has been described in all populations \\[ 3 \\], with an estimated prevalence of 1/300,000 in the USA and Europe. It is less rare in Japan, where the prevalence is estimated at 1/100,000. In India, the incidence has not been studied so far but is believed to be less than in Western countries \\[ 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【12】However, it is still relatively frequent in certain regions with high levels of consanguinity and relatively large families, such as in the Middle East and the Maghreb. The incidence is estimated at 1/10,000 in Tunisia \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【13】The geographical distribution of the different genetic groups is heterogeneous, with, however, a predominance of certain forms depending on the region: group C is the most frequently reported in the Mediterranean countries and groups A and F in Japan.\n\n【14】In Morocco, studies of molecular epidemiology have shown that two mutations predominate in our population. These are the recurrent mutations c.1643\\_1644delTG of the XPC gene, followed by the c.682C> T mutation of the XPA gene \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【15】There is no sex predilection. Pathophysiology of this disorder is a defect in genes within the nucleotide excision repair system for the first seven genetic groups (A–G), and an abnormality in transcription groups for the eighth group (xeroderma pigmentosum variant, XPV).\n\n【16】Normal individuals harboring XP polymorphisms are at increased risk for developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【17】AML in XP is very rare. We present here an interesting case of XP associated with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【18】Case report\n-----------\n\n【19】A 26-year-old Moroccan woman was born of a consanguineous marriage (first degree). One of four siblings, she was diagnosed with XP at the age of 3 months.\n\n【20】The diagnosis of XP was made based on the family history, because the patient had a brother who died at the age of 4 years and a sister who died at the age of 27 years, by metastases of melanomas secondary to XP.\n\n【21】Since childhood, she presented dermatological symptoms, photosensitivity, itching over the face, and hyperpigmentation that progressed with age.\n\n【22】Therefore, erythematous scaly plaques with pigmented macules were seen over the areas exposed to the sun. She never developed neurological manifestations.\n\n【23】The patient was admitted to our service because of bone marrow failure syndrome with anemic symptoms including paleness, vertigo, tachycardia, and exercise dyspnea, as well as hemorrhagic symptoms including gingivorrhages of low abundance and fever for a 1 month.\n\n【24】Physical examination showed that the patient had bad general condition, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) at 1, stable hemodynamically and in terms of respiration, tachycardia at 120  beats/minute, afebrile with ectropion of the right eye and skin lesions including multiple lentigines and papular/ulcerated lesions suggestive of cutaneous malignancies (Fig. 1 ), poor oral condition without gingival hypertrophy, and no adenopathy or organomegaly. Cardiac auscultation and neurological examination were normal.\n\n【25】**Fig. 1**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Dyschromia characteristic of xeroderma pigmentosum in photoexposed zones\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Complete blood count showed pancytopenia (white blood cell count 2.26 g/L, hemoglobin 4.2 g/dL, and platelets 10 g/L).\n\n【30】Peripheral smear revealed the presence of 70% blast cells.\n\n【31】On bone marrow aspiration, infiltration by 25–30% morphologically undifferentiated blasts was seen with positive myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Fig. 2 ), without any dysplastic features.\n\n【32】**Fig. 2**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】Bone marrow aspiration showing infiltration by morphologically undifferentiated blasts with positive MPO (arrows show blast cells positive for MPO)\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】Flow cytometry revealed expression of a low CD45 blast population (34%) HLA DR+ CD33+, CD117+, CD13+, CD34+, and lymphoid markers were negative, compatible with the diagnosis of acute myeloblastic leukemia.\n\n【37】Chromosome banding analysis showed a complex karyotype with numerous numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations (Fig. 3 ): initial clone with derivative of chromosome 10, a derivative of chromosome 13, a deletion of (3) (p13?); a first subclone with a trisomy 2 and monosomy 21; a second subclone with monosomy 7; a third hyperdiploid subclone with a deletion of (3) (p13) in double and a clone without abnormalities. Due to lack of resources, fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were not performed.\n\n【38】**Fig. 3**\n\n【39】Results of chromosome banding analysis: 46, XX,del(3)(p13?), der 10 t(10,?)

On clinical examination, the patient was dyspneic with auscultation of crepitant rales at the level of both lung fields. During the previous 24 hours, she had only received one platelet transfusion since the request for red blood cells was still being processed by the transfusion center of Casablanca.\n\n【44】Chest X-ray revealed diffuse confluent opacity, electrocardiogram indicated supraventricular tachycardia, and echocardiography showed pericardial effusion of low abundance. The patient was placed under water restriction and diuretic bolus; the evolution was marked by the persistence of the dyspnea. A second echocardiography was realized objectifying the exaggeration of the pericardial effusion; an evacuating puncture was indicated, but the situation was aggravated by the occurrence of desaturation when wearing high-concentration mask, hypotension, and cardiorespiratory arrest. The patient died following acute pulmonary edema of cardiogenic pace complicated by tamponade.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】XP is a rare form of general dermatosis caused by defects in the normal repair of DNA damaged by exposure to sunlight. It has been reported to be common with consanguineous marriages \\[ 10 \\] because it is transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode. This explains its higher frequency in Maghreb countries, including Morocco, marked by a high rate of consanguinity (15.25%) and nuclear family structure \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【47】The incidence and age at presentation vary, ranging from early infancy to adulthood.\n\n【48】There are eight complementation groups of XP (XP-A to G) caused by defective nucleotide excision repair, corresponding to mutations in the genes encoding XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG, and XP dominant. This genetic heterogeneity is responsible for the diversity of clinical situations \\[ 12 , 13 \\].\n\n【49】The severe form is characterized by an early onset, before the age of 1 year, by a cutaneous erythema associated with intense photophobia. Malignant skin tumors appear in early childhood. Survival is uncommon, with patients usually dying before the age of 15 years. This form corresponds to Maghrebian XPC whose mutation is “V548A fs XR72” \\[ 14 \\]. The mild form is characterized by having more severe onset (age > 3 years), erythema and photophobia being rare, dyschromia being late onset, and not being evident until the age of 5 years; malignant skin tumors appear relatively late, around the age of 20 years or older. Neurological manifestations are absent. It corresponds to XPF and XPV \\[ 15 , 16 \\].\n\n【50】The association of XP with internal neoplasms such as acute myeloblastic leukemia is not reported frequently, confirming both their infrequency and their incidence, which remains 10–20 times higher than in the general population \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【51】In the present article, we report the case of a patient suffering from XP type C who developed an acute myeloblastic leukemia with a complex karyotype and monosomy 7. The XPC gene is located in the 3p25.1 chromosomal region \\[ 1 \\]. This gene plays an important role in the early steps of global genome nucleotide excision repair (NER), especially in damage recognition, open complex formation, and repair protein complex formation. The link between XPC and cancers of various kinds has been investigated in many studies \\[ 17 , 18 \\], but there is still no evident association between the different malignancies and XPC. It was even demonstrated in an interesting study in the Romanian population that XPC polymorphisms are not associated with AML \\[ 19 \\]. Thus, it is not surprising that there are no further cases in the literature describing the development of leukemia in XPC patients. AML in XPC is very rare.\n\n【52】An American study \\[ 20 \\] found no significant association between XPC polymorphisms and disease-free survival of patients with AML in the USA. Despite that, in the Chinese population \\[ 21 \\], XPC polymorphisms are important markers for the outcome of patients with AML.\n\n【53】A Tunisian study \\[ 22 \\] on the analysis of the link between the NER DNA repair genes polymorphisms and susceptibility to leukemia in the Tunisian population found that XPC polymorphism may be involved in the susceptibility to AML.\n\n【54】The difficulty in our case resides not only in the association of XP and leukemia, but also in the complexity of karyotype with monosomy 7, which constitute poor prognostic factors and can explain the bad tolerance of chemotherapy by our patient.\n\n【55】On the other hand, the role of the XPC DNA repair gene polymorphisms in increased chemotherapy toxicity has been discussed controversially in the literature, but none of the studies included XPC in their analysis \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【56】To the best of our knowledge, only a single case of XP type D in association with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia has been reported \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【57】It remains unclear whether a mutation in the XPC DNA repair gene in this patient led to the development of acute myeloblastic leukemia or a change of tolerance to chemotherapy. Finally, could our patient not be treated with full doses of AML chemotherapy without encountering unusual toxicity? The management of these patients remains a challenge.\n\n【58】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【59】This is the second reported case of the association of XP and acute myeloblastic leukemia.

The incidences of intraoperative and delayed perforation are about 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively \\[ 1 \\]. Delayed perforation is rare but can cause peritonitis, requiring an emergency operation. Some reports, however, have concluded that, if peritonitis does not occur, conservative treatment with endoscopic closure of the perforation site is feasible \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【10】Although rare, delayed perforation after ESD can lead to a perigastric abscess. In some previous cases without peritonitis, abscesses were treated successfully in a conservative manner, but a long hospital stay was typically required \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【11】In principle, delayed perforation after ESD is treated surgically \\[ 7 \\]. Herein, we report a case of a perigastric abscess caused by delayed perforation after gastric ESD, which was treated conservatively without perforation closure, and in which the patient was discharged from hospital in a short period.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A-74-year-old Asian man with a history of ESD for early gastric cancer (EGC) was found to have a second EGC during a follow-up endoscopy examination, and was admitted to our hospital for endoscopic resection. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination revealed an 18 mm faded, superficial flat lesion on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum (Fig. 1 a, b). A biopsy performed by a previous doctor resulted in the diagnosis of a signet ring cell carcinoma; therefore, we performed a negative biopsy to determine the excision range. ESD was performed using an insulated-tip (IT) knife 2 (KD-611 L; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The procedure took 1 hour and 40 minutes. The resected specimen measured 86 × 48 mm, which was histopathologically confirmed to be a signet ring cell carcinoma (28 × 25) limited to the lamina propria with no lymphovascular invasion. No intraoperative complications occurred (Fig. 1 c), and the patient was asymptomatic during the operation. The patient developed a fever on postoperative day (POD) 1, but his general condition was stable. On POD2, the patient complained of a slight abdominal pain localized to the epigastric region and a small amount of melena. A computed tomography (CT) examination revealed the presence of free air in the peritoneal cavity, and a little fluid collection abutting the dorsal area of the stomach (Fig. 2 ). Since upper gastrointestinal bleeding was suspected, an endoscopy was performed on the same day, but no source of bleeding was found. Instead, a 5-mm, deep ulcer with the accumulation of pus was observed, suggesting a perforation of the post-ESD ulcer (Fig. 3 b, c). We could detect the purulent pus flow from the abscess cavity to the stomach during endoscopy; therefore, we were convinced that the abscess communicated with the inside of the stomach. As the perforation site was lined with peritoneum, it was considered to be a gastric penetration. We diagnosed a perigastric abscess caused by delayed perforation after ESD. Blood tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (5.24 mg/dl, normal value < 0.3 mg/dl), but other than the patient’s body temperature (BT), his vital signs were stable (BT, 38.4 °C; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; blood pressure, 129/81 mmHg; heart rate, 81 beats per minute), and there were no signs of peritonitis. After consultation with the surgical team, we opted for conservative treatment, which included fasting with intravenous fluid therapy, the administration of a proton pump inhibitor, and empirical antibiotics. We intentionally did not close the perforation and instead left it open to allow spontaneous drainage from the abscess into the stomach. Thereafter, the patient’s fever and abdominal pain improved gradually. CRP levels were elevated up to 12.38 mg/dl on POD5, but decreased to 5.34 mg/dl on POD7 and 1.67 mg/dl on POD14. A follow-up CT examination revealed an encapsuled and localized perigastric abscess on POD5 (Fig. 4 b), and the disappearance of the free air and the regression of the perigastric abscess on POD7 (Fig. 4 c). A follow-up endoscopy examination on POD7 showed the closure of the perforation. Oral feeding was resumed at this time. Finally, surgery was avoided, and the patient was discharged on POD14 after a relatively short hospital stay. Oral antibiotic treatment was continued for 2 weeks after hospital discharge, and a CT examination on POD34 showed no recurrence of the perigastric abscess (Fig. 4 d).\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**a** , **b** An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an 18-mm faded, superficial flat lesion on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. **c** No muscle injury, muscle layer exposure, and microperforation observed during endoscopic submucosal dissection\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】A computed tomography examination revealed the presence of free air in the peritoneal cavity, and a little fluid collection abutting the dorsal area of the stomach.

If peritonitis does not occur, however, this complication can be treated conservatively. Ikezawa _et al._ reported a case that was treated conservatively with closure of a delayed perforation site using endoclips \\[ 2 \\]. If the perforation site is small and can be closed promptly after perforation, the leakage of digestive juices into the peritoneal cavity can be minimized, allowing conservative treatment.\n\n【32】A few reports have described the formation of a perigastric abscess caused by delayed perforation after gastric ESD \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 \\]. We previously reported a case of intraabdominal abscess caused by delayed perforation after ESD that was treated conservatively, with perforation closure and the EUS-guided insertion of a nasocavitary catheter drainage into the abscess \\[ 6 \\]. Although the attachment of a polyglycolic acid sheet successfully closed the perforation, the patient’s clinical symptoms did not improve. Therefore, we inserted an additional drainage catheter into the abscess. Though this strategy allowed conservative treatment, the patient was not discharged from hospital until 40 days after ESD. The closure of the perforation site was thought to have enclosed the abscess cavity, delaying its spontaneous drainage and resulting in the prolonged hospital stay.\n\n【33】In this reported case, the perforation was not closed, and instead was left open to allow spontaneous drainage from the abscess into the stomach. This strategy might have contributed to the shorter hospital stay. Effective spontaneous drainage and the early resumption of oral feeding might promote the healing of the perforation and abscess.\n\n【34】We assumed that the following characteristics of perforations might determine the suitability of conservative treatment without perforation closure.\n\n【35】### Size\n\n【36】Large perforations have the potential to become chronic fistulas and are likely to be difficult to treat without closure of the fistula. Although a cutoff for perforation size is difficult to specify, the perforation in this reported case was small enough to close spontaneously without endoscopic closure.\n\n【37】### Encapsuled\n\n【38】If the abscess was not encapsuled, it would spread to other areas despite effective spontaneous drainage from the abscess into the stomach. In this reported case, we could detect that the abscess was encapsuled on POD5. Therefore, the abscess was localized and had regressed with conservative treatment.\n\n【39】Several previous reports have opted to close perforations during conservative treatment for delayed perforation after ESD \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. If an abscess has formed, however, leaving the perforation site open instead of closing it might be a better treatment option, and additional treatments (such as surgery or transgastric drainage) could be performed if the patient’s condition worsens.\n\n【40】Regarding the treatment of perigastric abscess caused by delayed perforation after ESD, leaving the perforation site open to allow spontaneous drainage may shorten the conservative treatment period.\n\n【41】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

A few of the most well known are eosinophilic pneumonia \\[ 1 \\], eosinophilic bronchitis \\[ 2 \\], and non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome nares and related disorders \\[ 3 \\], but new entities such as eosinophilic esophagitis \\[ 4 \\] and others are being added to this list. Very recently, a case of eosinophilic sialodochitis, that is, an inflammation of the parotid salivary duct was reported \\[ 5 \\]. In this report, we describe the first case of eosinophilic parotitis in the literature. Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid salivary gland that can be acute or chronic with acute exacerbations. Concerning the etiology, viral parotitis is more common than bacterial parotitis, and mumps is the most common viral cause of parotitis \\[ 6 \\]. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of firm, erythematous swelling in the pre- and post-auricular areas, intense local pain and tenderness, and high fever and chills. Later, massive swelling of the neck and respiratory obstruction may occur. Microbiological data may be obtained by collecting specimens by aspiration from the parotid duct orifice or, when this is not feasible, by obtaining a tissue swab from the papilla of the parotid gland, which is located opposite the second upper molar teeth. In addition, ultrasound imaging or sialography can be used to detect altered morphology, especially in patients with chronic diseases.\n\n【10】### Case presentation\n\n【11】Our patient was an eight-year-old Caucasian boy with no family history of atopy who had been in good health until the age of six years, when he started to have recurring episodes of acute parotitis with no fever, amounting to a total of five episodes, and no response to antibiotics, but remission was achieved with oral corticosteroid therapy. We performed allergy tests, including skin prick tests with a standard panel of allergen extracts (Stallergenes, Milan, Italy), patch tests for allergens and haptens, and a radioallergosorbent test for inhalant and food allergens, all of which produced negative results, and echography ruled out sialodochitis. His blood examination, which included tests for anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies for the assessment of autoimmunity, revealed only a high level of amylase, but a tissue swab taken from the parotid duct allowed us to detect a high number of eosinophils (Figure 1 ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Microscopic scan showing the material obtained from a swab of the parotid duct** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【17】This report describes the first case of eosinophilic parotitis in the published literature, and we suggest that a cytological assessment, which is quite simple though rarely used by physicians, be performed when evaluating patients with parotitis of uncertain origin.

PHPT is characterized by autonomous hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), regardless of serum calcium levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare, benign syndrome only affecting the regulation of calcium metabolism. FHH is an autosomal-dominant genetic disease with high penetrance, caused by an inactivating variant in the _CASR_ gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). We present a unique case of concomitant PHPT and FHH without clinically actionable variants in _MEN1_ .\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 47-year-old Caucasian man with severe hypercalcemia, genetic FHH, and initially normal parathyroid scintigraphy was referred for endocrine evaluation due to nonspecific symptoms. Biochemical evaluation showed elevated serum ionized calcium and PTH. The calcium–creatinine clearance ratio was low. All other biochemical measures were normal, including kidney function. Genetic evaluation was redone and confirmed FHH. A new parathyroid scintigraphy showed a significant single adenoma corresponding to the lower left gland. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy, and a parathyroid adenoma was removed. A reduced level of hypercalcemia persisted due to FHH.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The correct diagnosis of the underlying cause of hypercalcemia is important to ensure the right treatment. Patients with FHH should avoid operative treatment, and PHPT should be differentiated from MEN1 to determine whether surgery should include parathyroidectomy with removal of one adenoma or 3.5 hyperplastic parathyroid glands.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder and is the most frequent benign cause of hypercalcemia. It is characterized by autonomous hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), independently of serum calcium levels. Parathyroid adenoma(s) and parathyroid hyperplasia are the main causes of PHPT \\[ 1 \\]. Familiar forms of PHPT (FPHPT) represent less than 5% of the total PHPT cases and include, among others, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A (MEN1 and MEN2A) \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】FHH is a rare, benign syndrome only affecting the regulation of calcium metabolism, as first reported in 1972 by Foley _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\]. The familiar form FHH is an autosomal-dominant genetic disease with high penetrance, caused by an inactivating variant in the _CASR_ gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), first reported by Pollack _et al_ . in 1993 \\[ 4 \\]. Since then, other pathogenic variants in _GNA11_ and _AP2S1_ have been introduced in clinical practice. The pathogenic variants lead to lifelong hypercalcemia, with no other organ involvement. Other FPHPTs are frequently associated with other endocrine, proliferative, and/or functional disorders, such as non-endocrine tumors associated with MEN1, MEN2A, MEN4, and hereditary hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT) \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【11】A small number of cases have reported parathyroid adenoma in patients with FHH \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]. In this case report we present a 47-year-old man with severe hypercalcemia, genetic FHH, and a significant parathyroid adenoma at the lower left gland, without clinically actionable variants in _MEN1_ .\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】In May 2017 the Caucasian patient was admitted to an endocrine clinic due to 6 months of nonspecific symptoms. The patient suffered from general malaise, nonspecific abdominal pain, and paresthesia in his fingers. He had a known history of FHH type 1 which was genetically confirmed in 2008, identifying the pathogenic (class 5) heterozygous _CASR_ variant (NM\\_000388, c.644A>G, p.Asp215Gly in exon 4). The patient owned a medium-sized service company. He lived in the countryside with his wife and children. He had never smoked. At first admission, the patient had no signs of kidney stones and received no treatment. Biochemical evaluation showed elevated plasma ionized calcium (iCa) of 1.87 mmol/L and PTH 17.0 pmol/L with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) of 21 nmol/L and phosphate 0.60 mmol/L. The kidney function was normal, and the initial parathyroid scintigraphy revealed no focus (Table 1 ). The results of clinical evaluation were normal, with height of 182 cm, weight 83 kg, blood pressure 130/82, heart rate 48 beats per minute, and normal electrocardiography (ECG.) No signs of musculoskeletal symptoms and no neurological symptoms were observed.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Paraclinical results**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】After 5 months of treatment with 50 µg vitamin D daily, 25OHD had normalized to 88 nmol/L and PTH had decreased to 12.5 pmol/L. However, the symptoms of tiredness, abdominal pain, and hypercalcemia of iCa 1.88 mmol/L remained unchanged. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed chronic pancreatitis but no renal calcification. The patient was observed (watchful waiting) until June 2018, with no change in clinical symptoms during this period.\n\n【17】In June 2018, reevaluation of the patient showed iCa 1.77 mmol/L, PTH 22.2 pmol/L with 25OHD of 46 nmol/L, and phosphate 0.64 mmol/L. The calcium–creatinine clearance ratio was low, 0.006. All other biochemical measures were normal, including the kidney function.\n\n【18】Three months later, cinacalcet treatment of 60 mg per day was initiated due to persisting high iCa and PTH levels. However, the iCa and PTH levels did not change, and cinacalcet was terminated. In January 2019, cinacalcet was reintroduced due to persistent high levels of iCa of 1.89 mmol/L and PTH of 18.5 pmol/L. A new parathyroid scintigraphy (subtractions-single-photon emission computed tomography/CT) revealed a single adenoma equivalent to the lower left gland corresponding to finding a 1.5-cm adenoma on CT evaluation (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Parathyroid scintigraphy from February 2019 showing a single adenoma at the lower left gland\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】After a month, the cinacalcet dosage was increased to 60 mg twice daily, as the initial dosage of 60 mg once daily only resulted in a decrease in iCa to 1.71 mmol/L. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan confirmed normal bone mineral density.\n\n【24】After the diagnosis of PHPT was confirmed, parathyroid surgery was completed in September 2019. A single 0.828-g parathyroid adenoma was removed in toto from beneath the left thyroid lobe. PTH decreased 52% perioperatively. The day after surgery, iCa was 1.45 mmol/L. Two weeks post-surgery, iCa was 1.51 mmol/L, and PTH normalized at 3.8 pmol/L. Since surgery, the patient has had no symptoms apart from his chronic pancreatitis. Clinically, the patient showed no hypercalcemic symptoms: blood pressure 121/69, heart rate 50 beats per minute. Respiratory findings were normal, with a rate of 12 breaths per minute and 99% saturation.\n\n【25】Genetic evaluation was redone, adding sequencing of other genes associated with hyperparathyroidism ( _AP2S1_ , _CASR_ , _CDC73_ , _CDKN1B_ , _GNA11_ , _MEN1_ and _RET_ ) including screening for mosaicism. Apart from a likely benign (class 2) _MEN1_ variant (c.762 G>A, p.Leu254Leu), no clinically actionable variants were added. The patient was clinically reevaluated 12 month postoperatively with no sign of hypercalcemic symptoms: weight stable at 83.9 kg; height 182 cm; BMI 24.7. Blood pressure was normal at 130/82. ECG was clinically normal with a heart rate of 48 beats per minute; no respiratory pathological findings; no sign of musculoskeletal symptoms; and no neurological symptoms.\n\n【26】In order to confirm that the remaining hypercalcemia was due to FHH, we found that his cousin carried the same _CASR_ , c.644A>G, p.Asp215Gly (Fig. 2 ), and had iCa of 1.44 mmol/L and PTH of 2.1 pmol/L without any other symptoms of disease. The elevated iCa and corresponding normal PTH of this family member confirmed the pathogenicity of the _CASR_ variant leading to elevated iCa without hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【27】**Fig. 2**\n\n【28】 \n\n【29】Pedigree of the two related individuals diagnosed with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). The half-filled symbols indicate the individuals with FHH\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【32】The present case is an example of severe hypercalcemia in a middle-aged man with known FHH due to the development of a parathyroid adenoma. Treatment with high-dose cinacalcet was necessary to lower iCa and improve the patient’s well-being during the diagnostic period. Parathyroidectomy normalized PTH levels and reduced hypercalcemia, and the patient’s hypercalcemic symptoms resolved. PHPT is a common disease in adults. The high parathyroid state in PHPT causes increased renal absorption of calcium, increased bone turnover, and increased activated vitamin D, which in turn enhances calcium absorption from the intestine. PHPT is often asymptomatic and randomly discovered, and only in rare cases can lead to severe life-threatening hypercalcemia. In contrast to PHPT, FHH is a rare, genetic disorder which predominantly results in asymptomatic hypercalcemia with no significant clinical consequences. Our patient had a known pathogenic (class 5) heterozygous _CASR_ variant (NM\\_000388 _,_ c.644A>G, p.Asp215Gly in exon 4). The variant had previously been identified in another family with FHH, and a functional study had confirmed that the variant leads to inactivation of the protein \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. The two diseases may share clinical manifestations and biochemical findings as presented in this and other cases. Previous cases of simultaneously diagnosed PHPT and FHH in patients presenting with hypercalcemic symptoms have been described \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 \\]. Distinguishing between the two entities can be complicated and must be carefully taken into consideration in the evaluation of hypercalcemia \\[ 16 \\]. Reevaluation is necessary if the patient presents residual hypercalcemia after parathyroidectomy. In this case, as in a few others, PHPT develops in a patient with known FHH, which may lead to diagnostic delay, as the clinicians may be more likely to attribute the hypercalcemia to the known disease \\[ 10 , 13 \\]. Later presentation of hypercalcemic symptoms or organ manifestations, as in our patient developing general malaise and chronic pancreatitis with no obvious cause, should lead to diagnostic reevaluation. Pancreatitis secondary to both PHPT and FHH has been described \\[ 17 , 18 \\]. The mechanisms, however, are not fully understood. Our patient had persistent nonspecific abdominal symptoms even after parathyroid surgery had restored the calcium levels to FHH baseline levels, probably due to his chronic pancreatitis. These examples of coexisting hypercalcemic disease highlight the importance of following standard diagnostic measures for hypercalcemia as recommended in international guidelines, and reevaluating the patient if changes in clinical or biochemical presentation occur \\[ 2 , 19 \\]. The consensus of a standard biochemical measure to differentiate between FHH and PHPT is the calcium–creatinine clearance ratio. This measure is not useful for diagnosing concomitant FHH and PHPT, as in the present case. In addition, a recent study showed limitations of the calcium–creatinine clearance ratio in general in differentiating between FHH and PHPT \\[ 20 \\]. Thus, a combination of clinical symptoms, family history, biochemical testing, parathyroid scintigraphy, and genetic testing is required to distinguish FHH from PHPT and also to exclude MEN1. In our case, there was a known variant of unknown significance in _MEN1_ at the first genetic analysis. As the patient developed PHPT years later, the _MEN1_ variant was reevaluated and classified as likely benign. The variant was classified in accordance with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines \\[ 21 \\]. In conclusion, correct diagnosis of the underlying cause of hypercalcemia is important to ensure the right treatment, as highlighted by the present case of a patient with known FHH developing PHPT. Patients with FHH should avoid operative treatment, and PHPT should be differentiated from MEN1 to determine whether parathyroidectomy should include the removal of one adenoma or 3.5 hyperplastic parathyroid glands.\n\n【33】### Patient perspective\n\n【34】The patient was afraid of malignant parathyroid disease and treatment thereof as he since childhood had been aware of the FHH diagnosis and reassured of the benign genesis.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】All relevant patient data are included in the case report, and further supporting data may be obtained on request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The present study reports two patients with clear-cell carcinoma arising from an abdominal wall scar 20 and 23 years after their last cesarean section.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Both Iranian patients had prior cesarean sections nearly 20 years earlier. Patients 1 and 2 had transverse and vertical abdominal incisions, respectively. The initial clinical presentation was a huge lower abdominal mass at the site of the previous cesarean section scar. Both patients underwent abdominal wall mass biopsy. The histological analysis revealed the presence of malignancy. Both patients underwent full-thickness resection of the abdominal wall mass. All surgical margins were tumor-free; however, patient 1 had a very narrow tumor-free margin near the pubic symphysis. As the imaging report of patient 2 revealed the presence of a pelvic mass, the exploration of the intraperitoneal space, simple total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and the excision of enlarged pelvic lymph nodes were performed during the surgery. Six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks as adjuvant chemotherapy was administered for both patients after the surgery. One of the patients had disease recurrence 5 months after the termination of chemotherapy, and the other is still disease-free. These two patients had similar pathology and received a similar initial adjuvant treatment; however, they were different in terms of the direction of tumor spread, tumor distance from the pubic symphysis, status of tumor margins, and surgical procedures.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We encountered distinct prognoses in the clear-cell carcinoma of cesarean section scars presented herein. The researchers can recommend complete surgical excision of the abdominal wall mass with wide tumor-free margins, exploration of the abdominopelvic space, TAH, and BSO during the first surgery.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Endometriosis is one of the most frequent conditions in reproductive-aged women, with a prevalence rate of at least 10–15% \\[ 1 \\]. Endometriosis has been defined as the abnormal growth of endometrial tissues outside the uterus. Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) has typically been observed in patients undergoing gynecological surgeries such as caesarian section and hysterectomy \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Malignant transformation of extra-ovarian endometriosis is infrequent \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The risk of the transformation of endometriosis to a malignant disease is currently estimated to be 0.3–1.0% \\[ 6 \\]. Clear-cell carcinoma is the second most frequent histological variant, and endometrioid carcinoma \\[ 7 \\]. Abdominal wall clear-cell carcinoma is an extremely rare event. Following the documentation of the first case in 1986 \\[ 8 \\], only a few cases have been reported to date. Based on the published studies in the literature, the time lag from the first surgery to the diagnosis of malignancy is 6–20 years \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The management of abdominal wall clear-cell carcinoma has not been well attended to because this tumor is extremely rare and the published literature is not rich in this regard. We report two patients with clear-cell carcinoma in the lower abdominal wall at the site of their previous cesarean section scar. Patient 1 had a history of abdominal cesarean scar endometriosis before menopause; however, we did not have any records for the endometriosis of patient 2. Standard written informed consent was obtained from both patients to use data and images for research and publication purposes.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Patient 1\n\n【12】A 53-year-old postmenopausal Iranian woman presented to the hospital for a progressively growing painful cesarean scar mass. Her personal history included three previous Pfannenstiel cesarean sections without any medical diseases. The last cesarean section was performed 23 years earlier. Pfannenstiel scars were adjacent to her pubic symphysis. She had no family history of gynecological malignancy. She previously had bloody discharge during her menstrual cycle from a very small orifice inside the abdominal cesarean scar for 16 years. The monthly bloody discharge was stopped after her menopause. She detected a mass that was approximately 3 cm in diameter during her self-examination of her cesarean scar 3 years after menopause. The mass was converted to a huge one over 3 months (Fig. 1 ). On physical examination, a significant large, firm, and fixed mass was observed in her suprapubic Pfannenstiel cesarean scar and extended upward to the anterior abdominal wall. An abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 9.1 × 5.6 × 4.7 cm heterogeneous solid mass with a cystic component in the lower part of the rectus muscle. The observed mass expanded to the subcutaneous tissue, with close contact with the pubic symphysis, and extended to the retropubic space. Other pelvic and abdominal organs were observed to be normal in the first imaging (Fig. 2 ). Needle biopsy of the mass was performed under ultrasound guidance. Histology revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma. Thorax CT scan, colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, mammography, and transvaginal ultrasound were all normal. The patient was scheduled for complete excision of the abdominal wall mass as determined by the cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT). A complete excision of the mass and its surrounding tissues was performed. The permanent histology revealed clear-cell carcinoma arising from the Pfannenstiel cesarean scar (Fig. 3 ). Permanent pathological reports indicated negative excision margins; however, the tumor was very close to the surgical margin in the lower part of the mass adjacent to the pubic symphysis (1 mm).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】A huge mass originating from the horizontal cesarean scar in patient.

To follow up, an abdominopelvic ultrasound was performed 3 months after the last chemotherapy treatment. Ultrasound was normal. The patient was asymptomatic nearly 5 months after the termination of chemotherapy. However, she had abdominal discomfort later on. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed 5 months after the last chemotherapy treatment (Fig. 4 ) and demonstrated ascites and recurrences in the abdominal wall, retropubic space, and pelvic peritoneum space. Therefore, she received second-line chemotherapy with four cycles of bevacizumab, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. She was resistant to the second-line chemotherapy, and the tumor progressed diffusely in the abdominopelvic space during the second-line chemotherapy course. She had severe abdominal pain and mainly presented gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea. It was determined by the MDT that the patient was a candidate for palliative therapy. However, she refused the MDT decision and insisted on a second surgery. She had the surgery in another hospital. Her second surgery consisted of total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), pelvic washing, excision of the abdominal wall mass, segmental resection of a narrow lumen of the large bowel, and end-to-end anastomosis and selective large pelvic lymph node dissection. All specimens showed clear-cell carcinoma involvement. The patient received third-line chemotherapy with three cycles of gemcitabine and vinorelbine. She did not return to our center after the second surgery; however, she sent us her treatment records. Unfortunately, she died 20 months after diagnosis.\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Positron emission tomography–computed tomography 5 months after the first-line chemotherapy.

She had a history of three cesarean sections with a midline abdominal incision. Her last cesarean section was performed 20 years earlier. Physical examination demonstrated a partially mobile and large mass in the anterior abdominal wall in the midline cesarean scar, extending bilaterally to the midclavicular line. The upper margin of the mass was adjacent to her umbilicus, where there was a large umbilical hernia above the mass (Fig. 5 ). Pelvic ultrasound showed an irregular 12 × 8 × 8 cm mass in the abdominal wall anterior to the rectus muscle involving subcutaneous tissue, a large umbilical hernia containing omentum, and a well-defined left solid adnexal mass (4.1 × 3.7 × 5.1 cm in diameter). An abdominopelvic CT scan confirmed the ultrasound findings (Fig. 6 ). The peritoneal surface of the anterior abdominal wall was intact, and other abdominal and pelvic organs were normal. The chest X-ray was normal.\n\n【32】**Fig. 5**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】A huge mass originating from the vertical cesarean scar in patient 2. **a** Borders of the abdominal wall mass are marked by white arrows.

The histology implied clear-cell carcinoma\n\n【41】The patient was scheduled for surgery as determined by the MDT. Midline laparotomy was performed. The abdominal wall mass invaded the lower half of the rectus muscles. The mass reported in the left adnexa was indeed a large pelvic lymph node adjacent to the left external iliac artery. Uterus and ovaries had a normal appearance. The patient underwent a complete excision of the abdominal wall mass including the rectus muscles and fascia, peritoneal washing, resection of the enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, TAH, and BSO. Due to the large abdominal wall defect following the excision of the abdominal wall mass, reconstructive surgery was performed to repair the abdominal wall. The defect was covered with a synthetic mesh. The results of the permanent histology of the abdominal wall mass and the enlarged pelvic lymph node were similar, indicating clear-cell carcinoma (Fig. 7 ) without any marginal involvement. The pathology results of ascites and surgical specimens were negative. Twenty days after the reconstructive surgery, the patient initiated chemotherapy with six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks. An abdominopelvic CT scan was performed 6 months after the completion of the treatment and revealed normal findings. At present, the patient is alive without any recurrence (26 months after diagnosis). The basic characteristics of the patients, imaging results, surgical procedure, and adjuvant treatment are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【42】**Fig. 7**\n\n【43】 \n\n【44】Clear-cell carcinoma of the abdominal scar. Malignant glands are lined by anaplastic hobnail cells with clear cytoplasm\n\n【45】Full size image\n\n【46】**Table 1 Clinicopathological characteristics of two patients with clear-cell carcinoma of abdominal wall cesarean section scars**\n\n【47】Full size table\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】Clear-cell carcinoma of the abdominal wall that develops in cesarean section scars is an extremely rare condition. Endometriosis of a cesarean section scar or close contact of the abdominal wall with the endometrium of cesarean incision may be a risk factor for the development of abdominal wall clear-cell carcinomas. The incidence of scar endometriosis that is usually the result of a normal endometrial tissue implantation following gynecological or obstetric surgery has been reported to be 0.03–0.4% \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. The combination of oxidative stress due to inflammation, chronic hemorrhage, and estrogen excess seems to play a role in the tumorigenesis of endometriosis-related neoplasms \\[ 9 \\]. Transformation of abdominal wall endometriosis to malignancy is very rare. The malignant transformation of endometriosis within surgical scars is uncommon \\[ 10 \\], and the rate of surgical scar endometriosis in the abdominal wall has been estimated to be up to 1% \\[ 6 , 9 \\].\n\n【50】In the present study, our patients had a history of cesarean section nearly 20 years earlier. The first and second patients had transverse and vertical incisions, respectively. The spreading pattern of tumors was along the direction of the incisions. Transverse spread of tumor along the Pfannenstiel incision scar was observed in the first patient, whereas longitudinal tumor spread along the midline scar was observed in the second patient. These findings are in accordance with the fact that scar endometriosis is an iatrogenic transplantation of endometrial tissues during delivery or gynecological surgery and is not a metaplastic phenomenon \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【51】Due to the rarity of abdominal wall endometriosis and transformation of endometriosis to clear-cell carcinoma, the optimal treatment still remains unclear. To date, about 30 abdominal wall clear-cell carcinomas originating from endometriosis cases have been reported in the world literature. Taburiaux _et al_ . reviewed 27 cases of cancer arising from abdominal wall endometriosis and reported 18 patients with clear-cell carcinomas \\[ 7 \\]. In a retrospective review, Lai _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\], thoroughly described six cases of pathologically confirmed clear-cell carcinoma originating from the abdominal wall that were encountered at their institution over a 15-year period. They concluded that complete resection of the abdominal wall tumor and suspected intra-abdominal lesions, as well as hysterectomy and bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection, may be suggested as the first step toward its treatment. They recommended adjuvant chemotherapy because of its potential benefits. To achieve complete resection, a surgical procedure such as advanced ovarian cancer surgery may be considered. The surgical planning may include optimal cytoreduction (no residue) and repair of the abdominal wall defect \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【52】In our study, only the complete excision of the abdominal wall mass was performed for the first patient at primary surgery, while the second patient underwent TAH, BSO, pelvic washing, and complete excision of the abdominal wall mass and enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. As the first patient had cancer recurrence, perhaps it can be claimed that the difference in surgical treatment was one of the main factors in the recurrence of the clear-cell carcinoma. Hence, it seems that wide local excision of the abdominal wall tumor with TAH and BSO and the exploration of the abdominopelvic space should be preferred during the first surgery. Any imaging is not 100% accurate. Pelvic dissection is also recommended to predict distant metastasis and poor outcome if any positive node is present \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【53】Tumor resection with a wide tumor-free margin may be essential for the treatment of an abdominal wall mass. Surgical margins were different in our two patients, as follows: completely negative and wide (more than 1.5 cm) in the second patient and very narrow in the first patient (1 mm). Therefore, we recommend a wide tumor-free surgical margin if possible. It may be that the resection of pubic symphysis during the first surgery of patient 1 resulted in a better prognosis. Moreover, the excision of the lesion adjacent to bone is difficult even in endometriosis of abdominal wall cesarean scars.\n\n【54】These two patients had similar pathology and adjuvant treatments; however, they were different in terms of the direction of tumor spread, proximity to the pubic symphysis, state of margins, exploration of the intraperitoneal space, and performance of TAH and BSO during the first surgery. These differences may have resulted in distinct prognoses for these two patients.\n\n【55】The role of postoperative chemotherapy is not yet well established. Platinum-based chemotherapy has most often been used \\[ 6 , 9 \\].\n\n【56】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【57】Distinct prognoses were experienced with respect to the clear-cell carcinoma of cesarean section scars presented herein. Based on the findings, complete surgical excision of the abdominal wall mass with wide tumor-free margins, exploration of the abdominopelvic space, TAH, and BSO during the first surgery can be recommended.\n\n【58】To summarize, additional studies are needed to establish a standard treatment in the management of clear-cell carcinoma of cesarean section scars and to benefit from adjuvant treatments.\n\n【59】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【60】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the article.\n\n【61】Change history\n--------------\n\n【62】*   ### 10 August 2021\n    \n    A Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03035-6\n    \n\n【63】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【64】TAH:\n\n【65】Total abdominal hysterectomy\n\n【66】BSO:\n\n【67】Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n\n【68】BPLND:\n\n【69】Bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection\n\n【70】CT:\n\n【71】Computed tomography\n\n【72】PET-CT:\n\n【73】Positron emission tomography–computed tomography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We performed a left lower lobectomy and an upper lung partial resection in order to make a definitive diagnosis and to enable us to determine a further therapeutic strategy. The ground-glass opacity in her left S10 was a primary lung adenocarcinoma, while the small nodule in her left S4 was diagnosed as a benign metastasizing leiomyoma.

In most cases there is a previous history of hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma; however, the pathogenesis of the disease has not been as yet elucidated. The comorbid association of primary lung cancer and BML is even more uncommon. Here, we report a case of BML associated with primary lung cancer.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient was a 50-year-old Asian woman who had undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma at the age of 37 years old. She did not smoke cigarettes and only drank alcohol socially.\n\n【12】She was referred to our hospital because of sudden anterior chest pain. Hematology, biochemistry and blood gas analysis were normal. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her left S10 lung segment (Figure 1A ) which was 1.3 cm in size, and a solitary small nodule of 5 mm in diameter localized in her left S4 segment (Figure 1B ).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**CT scan of our patient's chest on admission to our hospital** . (A) Chest CT scan shows GGO (arrow) in her left S10 lung segment of 1.3 cm in size. (B) Chest CT scan shows a solitary small nodule (arrow) of 5 mm in diameter in her left S4 segment.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】From the beginning, we suspected lung carcinoma, but we could not get our patient's consent for performing bronchoscopic examination and surgical resection. Follow-up with CT showed that the GGO size had slightly increased and that the small nodule size had not changed. We suspected that the GGO was lung carcinoma, but it was difficult to rule out whether the small nodule was a lung metastasis. If this small nodule was not lung metastasis, the lung carcinoma could have been considered as being in the early stage. We considered that pathological examination by surgical resection was appropriate because it was also an approach for treating the lung carcinoma. We performed a left lower lobectomy and an upper lung partial resection in order to make a definitive diagnosis and to decide further therapeutic strategies. The pathological diagnosis of the GGO in her left S10 segment was primary lung adenocarcinoma(localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma; Figure 2 ). On the other hand, pathological examination of the small nodule in her left S4 showed spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells and low cuboidal metaplastic bronchiolar epithelia, surrounded by fascicles of smooth muscle cells without mitosis and nuclear atypia (Figure 3A ). Immunohistochemical staining for thyroid transcription factor-1(TTF-1) and surfactant apoprotein A (SP-A) showed epithelial structures composed of alveoli or bronchioli (Figure 3B, C ), suggesting that the low cuboidal metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium derived from the pre-existing bronchiolar epithelium. There was positive immunohistochemical staining for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and spindle-shaped cells (Figure 3D ), suggesting that the spindle-shaped cells were smooth muscle cells. Positive immunoreactivity for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) suggested that the spindle-shaped cells were uterine smooth muscle cells (Figure 3E, F ). Unfortunately, a histological sample of the uterine leiomyoma was not available for comparison. The small nodule was diagnosed as a BML based on the results of immunohistochemical staining and her past history of uterine leiomyoma.\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Histopathology of the lung tumor in her left S10** .

During four years of follow-up, no recurrence of either the BML or lung cancer could be detected.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】BML is a disease in which a tissue from a benign uterine leiomyoma is detected as a solitary nodule or as multiple nodules in the lungs of patients with a previous history of hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma. In 1939, Steiner _et al_ . \\[ 1 \\] were the first to report BML as metastasizing fibroleiomyoma of the uterus, and since then there have been several similar reports.\n\n【29】Abramson _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] reported that the average age of patients with BML is 48 years old, that the period from hysterectomy to nodule discovery is variable from three months to 26 years and that the first symptom of BML may sometimes be cough or chest pain although it can also be almost indiscernible. Horstmann _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\] reported that the radiological presentation of BML can be as multiple nodules in 87% of cases (bilateral nodules, 70% and unilateral nodule, 17%) or as a solitary nodule in 13% of cases. The main metastatic site of BML is the lung but other sites, including lymph nodes, soft tissue of the pelvis, bone, bone marrow, greater omentum, peritoneum and heart, have been also reported \\[ 4 \\]. Tsunoda _et al_ . \\[ 5 \\] reported only one case of benign metastasizing leiomyoma of the lung complicated with primary lung cancer. To the best of our knowledge, there are no cases in the literature about the association between lung cancer and BML other than this report. Thus, we believe that this is a very rare case of BML associated with primary lung cancer.\n\n【30】Recent studies have shown that BML is caused by lung metastasis of uterine leiomyoma, which is histologically a benign tumor with a very low grade of malignancy; uterine leiomyoma has been reported to depend on sex hormones \\[ 1 , 6 – 8 \\]. On the other hand, Patton _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] have previously reported that BML results from the monoclonal, hematogenous spread of an apparently benign uterine leiomyoma. However, these conclusions are still controversial.\n\n【31】Pathological examination of the BML in our case showed spindle-shaped cells without mitotic activity or nuclear atypia, surrounded by cuboidal bronchiolar epithelial cells; additional immunohistochemical staining showed that the spindle-shaped cells derived from smooth muscle cells of the uterus, and that the low cuboidal metaplastic cells derived from pre-existing bronchial cells \\[ 4 \\]. The presence of TTF-1 is usually assessed to confirm the diagnosis of primary non-small cell lung carcinoma (especially adenocarcinoma) \\[ 10 \\]; the purpose of TTF-1 staining in our particular case was to decide whether the low cuboidal metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium observed in the pathological specimens derived from the pre-existing bronchiolar epithelium, because it is known that TTF-1 is only expressed on the normal epithelium of the lung and thyroid \\[ 10 \\]. We believe that the diagnosis of BML is not dependent on the expression of TTF-1. Pathological comparison between the solitary pulmonary nodule and the original uterine tumor should provide confirmatory evidence but the sample was not available. However, the small lung nodule was diagnosed as BML based on the results of the immunohistochemical staining and the past history of hysterectomy for uterine leiomyoma.\n\n【32】There is no standard therapy for BML. Recently, Patton _et al_ . \\[ 9 \\] suggested the possibility of hormonal treatment for BML with positive immunoreactivity for ER and PgR. Other studies have shown improvement of BML after ovariectomy, administration of progesterone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and menopause \\[ 11 \\]. The prognosis of the disease is also unclear. In the present reported case, although the pathological stage of lung carcinoma was stage IA, we considered that CT follow-up was necessary at intervals of three to six months including follow-up of BML recurrence. No additional therapy was done and the follow-up by chest CT showed no recurrence of the BML or lung cancer.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】We report a very rare case of BML associated with primary lung cancer. This comorbid association should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a solitary lung nodule is detected in a patient with a history of uterine leiomyoma.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Congenital coronary anomalies (CAA) are rare and reportedly occur in 0.64 to 1.3 % of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Approximately 80 % of these coronary anomalies are benign; only 20 % cause symptoms \\[ 1 \\]. Dual left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) has been reported to occur with an incidence of 1 % \\[ 2 , 3 \\], and most of the patients were asymptomatic \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】This case report describes a rare variation, which has not been reported in the literature, in which the accessory coronary artery arose from the right coronary artery (RCA), reentered the LAD, and then ran as a single vessel.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Here we present a case of a rare coronary anomaly in a 47-year-old white man with an unremarkable past medical history who presented with atypical angina in late 2012; he does not have a family history of any heart disease, he is not allergic to anything, and he has never had any cardiac procedure. A physical examination and resting electrocardiogram results were normal, and transthoracic echocardiography showed no wall-motion abnormality and normal global left ventricular systolic function. His biochemical parameters were within normal limits. The treadmill exercise test showed 1-mm down-sloping ST-segment depression in leads V4 to V6. Multidetector computed tomographic angiography was performed to evaluate coronary artery disease and revealed an accessory coronary artery arising from the proximal RCA. It took an intramuscular course between the right ventricular outflow tract in the interventricular septal area to the anterior interventricular sulcus (AIVS), giving off septal perforators that reentered the medial LAD. Both vessels ran after the anastomosis in the AIVS as a single vessel (Figs. 1 and 2 ). A coronary angiography was performed to characterize the coronary anomaly and to detect any resultant ischemia. His RCA was dominant, giving origin proximally to an anomalous accessory coronary artery that reentered his medial LAD and ran as a single vessel (Fig. 3 ). The left main artery arose from the left coronary sinus and branched into a proper LAD and a circumflex artery (Fig. 2 ). There was no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. We measured the pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) to detect ischemia in the distal LAD after the anastomosis of the accessory coronary artery using a 0.014-inch (0.3556 mm) pressure wire (Volcano Corporation) during infusion of increasing doses of dobutamine (5, 10, 20, and 30 μg kg <sup>−1 </sup> minute <sup>−1 </sup> , each in 5-minute increments). The FFR was >0.95. Thus, this anomaly did not cause ischemia during exercise.

Spindola-Franco _et al_ . classified dual LAD into four angiographic subtypes based on the origin and course of both LADs as follows \\[ 3 \\]. Type I: Running in the AIVS, the short LAD is generally the source of all major proximal septal perforators. The long LAD also runs in the AIVS, descending on the left ventricular side of the AIVS, and then reentering the distal AIVS. It is the source of the major diagonal vessels. Type II: The short LAD is the same as in Type I. The long LAD differs only in that it descends on the right ventricular side, rather than the left, before reentering the AIVS. Type III: The long LAD travels intramyocardially in the ventricular septum. The short LAD is the same as in Types I and II. Type IV: The long LAD originates from the RCA and enters the anterior interventricular groove. Type IV dual LAD is a rare congenital anomaly of the coronary arteries and may be mistreated. The exact description of coronary artery anatomy is important in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations or percutaneous coronary intervention \\[ 5 \\]. In our case, the accessory coronary artery arose from the RCA and took a course between the right ventricular outflow and aorta, then took an intramuscular course beneath the right ventricular outflow tract in the interventricular septal area to the AIVS. It gave off septal perforators, then reentered the medial LAD, and both vessels ran after the anastomosis in the AIVS as a single vessel. This course can be associated with limiting coronary blood flow, when dilation of the aorta occurs during exercise or due to the stretch of the intramural segment. The FFR measurements during the infusion of increasing doses of dobutamine showed that this coronary anomaly does not lead to ischemia. We propose that this anomaly represents a new type of dual LAD.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】Our case, in which the accessory coronary artery arose from the RCA, reentered the LAD, and then ran as a single vessel, is the first such report in the literature. This coronary artery anomaly does not cause ischemia. Recognition of this coronary anomaly is important in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft operations.\n\n【29】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【30】AIVS, anterior interventricular sulcus; CAA, congenital coronary anomalies; FFR, fractional flow reserve; LAD, left anterior descending coronary artery; RCA, right coronary artery", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Renal replacement therapy has been shown to be beneficial in acute kidney injury, but treatment highly depends on the cause of the acute kidney injury. One less common cause is tubulointerstitial nephritis, which comes in different entities. A very rare type of tubulointerstitial nephritis is tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome, in which the patient presents with additional uveitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 19-year-old caucasian male presented with mild dyspnea, lack of appetite, weight loss, and moderate itchiness. Lab results showed an acute kidney injury with marked increase of serum creatinine. The patient was started on prednisolone immediately after admission. As the patient in this case showed symptoms of uremia on admission, we decided to establish renal replacement therapy, which is unusual in tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome. During his course of dialysis, the patient developed symptoms of sepsis probably due to a catheter-related infection requiring intensive care and antibiotic treatment, which had to be terminated early as the patient developed a rash. Intensified immunosuppression, combined with antibiotics, significantly resolved excretory kidney dysfunction.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Since both the primary inflammatory process and the secondary infectious complication significantly impaired excretory kidney function, kidney function of younger individuals with new-onset anterior uveitis should be monitored over time and during follow-up.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Acute kidney injury (AKI) substantially worsens the prognosis of hospitalized patients worldwide. The in-hospital incidence increased over the last decades and varies between 5% and 20%, with an average mortality of 5–10% \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. However, the mortality risk dramatically increases under intensive care conditions, reaching 50% or even more \\[ 4 \\]. AKI has been identified as an independent risk factor for death at the intensive care unit (ICU) \\[ 5 \\]. However, one must keep in mind that there are different definitions of AKI and the incidences vary depending on the criteria used \\[ 6 \\]. Among the causes, renal hypoperfusion of various origin is the most frequent. Regarding less frequent etiologies, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) accounts for 2–27% of all AKI events in the hospital \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. ATIN is most likely underdiagnosed since it may exclusively be associated with urine abnormalities such as tubular proteinuria or isolated or combined electrolyte loss. In more severe cases, subjects potentially suffer from systemic manifestations also (fever, rush, myalgia/arthralgia) \\[ 9 \\]. The most common cause of ATIN is transient or regular administration of a certain type of drug. Proton pump inhibitors, beta-lactam antibiotics, and allopurinol have been identified to be responsible with higher probability, although in theory, any particular drug can cause ATIN. Other causes are systemic disorders, electrolyte disturbances, and infections \\[ 10 \\]. Tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (TINU) syndrome is rarely responsible for ATIN. The disease was initially described in the mid-1970s \\[ 11 \\]. Since then, hardly 300 cases have been reported worldwide.\n\n【10】Herein, we present the case of a 19-year-old male patient who developed renal replacement therapy (RRT)-requiring AKI due to TINU syndrome. The second part will summarize information about both the epidemiology and etiology of TINU syndrome. Additionally, data on RRT in TINU-associated AKI will be discussed.\n\n【11】Case report\n-----------\n\n【12】In May 2021, a 19-year-old caucasian male patient was referred to the university hospital of Brandenburg owing to a severe decline of excretory kidney function. The serum creatinine concentration was 649 µmol/l (normal range 62–106 µmol/l) at the time of admission (Fig. 1 ). The patient suffered from mild dyspnea, lack of appetite, and moderate itchiness.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Lab results and creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). On admission, serum creatinine of our patient was 649 µmol/l and prednisolone treatment was started. Serum creatinine decreased markedly after the first two sessions of RRT. It increased again when the patient developed catheter-associated infection around day 10. After the last session of RRT on the 12th day after admission, serum creatinine levels kept falling in our patient and reached around 200 µmol/l when he was discharged\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The patient did not report any known diseases, nor did he take any medication on a regular basis. Approximately 10 weeks earlier, he had an upper respiratory tract infection that did not require antibiotics or other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since then, he did not recover completely but instead suffered from persistent fatigue. Also, he lost 8 kg of body weight until admission. He denied fever, nausea/vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, skin abnormalities, photosensitivity, Raynaud symptoms, and hair loss. He did not report morning stiffness or lower back pain. Three weeks before admission, he noticed pain in his right eye, accompanied by redness and blurred vision. A prompt ophthalmological examination led to the diagnosis of anterior uveitis. The ocular inflammatory process was not treated in a systemic manner, particularly not with systemic steroids, antibiotics, or NSAIDs. He exclusively received steroid-containing eye-drops. One day before admission, he underwent outpatient control of several blood parameters to identify the etiology of ocular inflammation. Serum analysis showed severely deteriorated kidney function.\n\n【18】At the time of admission, he presented an overall reduced physical condition. His height was 180 cm and body weight 93 kg (BMI: 28.7). His initial blood pressure was 144/114 mmHg and heart rate 124 beats per minute. Respiratory rate was 14 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation was 99%. He had no increased body temperature. Examination of heart, lungs, and abdomen did not reveal any pathological findings, the same applied for both the central and peripheral nervous system. Abdominal skin was moderately affected by striae distensae.\n\n【19】Besides impaired excretory kidney function, the patient showed moderately increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (45.7 mg/l; normal range < 5 mg/l) and elevated haptoglobin (2.6 g/l; normal range 0.3–2.0 g/l). Also, parathormone (PTH) was mildly elevated (72.8 pg/ml; normal range 15–65 pg/ml). Immune diagnostics revealed the following positive findings: anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) titer (1:160; normal range < 1:160) and anti-La (56.6; normal range < 46). Both cytoplasmic and perinuclear Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (c- and pANCA) were negative, anti-proteinase 3 was 2.3 U/mL (normal range < 10 U/mL). Light chain (LC) diagnostics showed increases of both, kappa- and lambda-LC (121 mg/l; normal range 3.3–19.4 mg/l, and 60.1 mg/l; normal range 5.71–26.3 mg/l), and the ratio differed from the normal range as well (2.01; normal range 0.26–1.65). Total serum immunoglobulin-G (IgG) was mildly elevated (22.1 g/L; normal range 5.49–15.8 g/L). _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ \\-IgG (21 RE/ml; normal range < 16 RE/ml) was positive, as was serological testing for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) \\[virus-capsid antigen (VCA) EBV-IgG-antikoerper (Ak) (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 137 RE/mL (normal range < 16 RE/mL), Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA 1)-IgG-Ak 1.02 (normal range < 80)\\]. Differential blood cell count showed an eosinophil percentage of 3.6% (normal range 0.5–7%). Other non-aberrant findings were monocytes, platelet count, and serum and urine calcium.\n\n【20】Semiquantitative urine analysis showed a proteinuria of 0.25 g/l and few erythrocytes (25/µl; normal: negative). The daily proteinuria was determined to be 0.77 g (normal range < 0.15 g). Urinary eosinophils were negative.\n\n【21】Transthoracic echocardiography showed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (50%; normal range > 60%). Diastolic function was impaired, although mild as well. The inferior part of the left ventricle was akinetic. Visually, the right ventricular function was slightly reduced. Computed tomography of thorax and abdomen revealed diffuse intraabdominal lymph node expansion. The initial ophthalmological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of unilateral anterior uveitis of the right eye. Specifically, the right conjunctiva showed perilimbical hyperemia, and the cornea was unaffected. The anterior chamber was not flattened and did not contain relevant cell numbers. Retinal investigation did not reveal any signs of inflammation.\n\n【22】Due to AKI of unknown origin, we performed kidney biopsy (6 days after admission). Two samples were obtained from the left kidney. Initial ultrasound analysis showed normal organ dimensions and no signs of obstruction. The pathological investigation by an experienced renal pathologist showed interstitial inflammatory infiltrates around the tubuli mainly composed of lymphocytes (Fig. 2 ). The findings led to the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis \\[ 12 \\]. Signs of glomerular inflammation were absent. The diagnosis was tubulointerstitial nephritis with anterior uveitis (TINU) syndrome of no specific or suspected origin.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Kidney histology (hematoxylin–eosin staining). Both images ( **A** and **B** ) show the renal biopsy of our patient with TINU syndrome (magnifications: left panel 10×, right panel 40×), revealing interstitial inflammatory infiltrates around the tubuli mainly composed of lymphocytes\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Immediately after admission, the patient received intravenous glucocorticoids (prednisolone 250 mg daily) on three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily for 7 days, dose reduction of 10 mg daily every 7 days thereafter) since we initially suspected an ANCA-associated autoinflammatory disease. Also, we started the patient on renal replacement therapy (RR, hemodialysis) after central vein catheter insertion into the right femoral vein. Volume depletion during individual dialysis session was not mandatory since urine production was not affected. One week after admission, the patient suffered from fever and general weakness. He received intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin and tazobactam) and was transferred to the local intensive care unit (ICU). The central vein catheter was removed since the patient showed localized pain around the insertion area, that is, signs of catheter-related blood infection. RRT was continued after establishing a new central vein catheter at the ICU. Two days after the initial fever attack, the patient developed generalized rash including moderate itchiness. The antibiotics therapy was adapted to meropenem. During the ICU stay, oral prednisolone therapy was continued as initiated. Discharge from the ICU was initiated after 3 days. The last dialysis treatment session was performed 1 week before discharge from the hospital (Fig. 1 ). Kidney excretory function continuously improved, with a last serum creatinine concentration of 214 µmol/l. Also, the ocular manifestation resolved almost completely after local corticosteroid eye drop treatment for 7 days. The in-hospital stay lasted for nearly 3 weeks, and the further management was planned in the outpatient area.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Herein, we present the case of a 19-year-old male subject who suffered from dialysis-requiring AKI due to TINU syndrome, aggravated by catheter-associated systemic infection. The latter was promoted by immunosuppressive therapy for interstitial nephritis.\n\n【30】TINU syndrome was first described by Dobrin _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\]. They reported on two patients who presented with AKI (therein: renal failure) due to interstitial nephritis, accompanied by bilateral anterior uveitis. Also, subjects showed granuloma formation in the bone marrow and a substantial increase in humoral markers of inflammation. In 2001, Mandeville and colleagues \\[ 13 \\] identified a total of 133 TINU patients described in the literature. Sixteen years later, Okafor _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] reviewed epidemiological data of TINU syndrome in a detailed manner. They cited studies on uveitis etiologies in several countries and finally identified the syndrome to be prevalent in 0.1–2.0% of all subjects suffering from uveitis. On the other hand, ATIN can be found in 10% of all biopsies in AKI cases, and TINU syndrome accounts for 9–22% of ATIN cases \\[ 8 , 15 \\]. Meanwhile, several risk or etiological factors have been identified to cause the syndrome. For instance, the risk varies with age, with TINU syndrome being more prevalent in younger individuals. Both Mandeville \\[ 13 \\] and Mackensen \\[ 16 \\] reported an age median of 15 years. Okafor _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] summarized several references on genetic factors potentially responsible for increasing the risk even further. Two etiological categories shall be discussed briefly: medications and infections. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have reliably been documented to increase the risk for interstitial nephritis in general \\[ 17 \\]. Surprisingly, a literature search applying either the terms “TINU” and “PPI” or “TINU” and “proton pump inhibitors” reveals one particular reference: a review article on interstitial nephritis in rheumatic diseases. The missing association between PPI and TINU syndrome indicates a distinct pathogenesis of the syndrome, which apparently differs from the pathogenesis of incident ATIN without ocular manifestations. In contrast to PPI, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with TINU syndrome by at least three authors \\[ 18 , 19 , 20 \\]. However, whether the substances were responsible in a mechanistic manner is speculative in nature. In a larger case series study published by Li and colleagues in 2014 \\[ 21 \\], the administration of the following antibiotics was reported prior to TINU syndrome manifestation: amoxicillin, cephalexin, cefoperazone, cefuroxime, meropenem, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. Overall, 19.4% of the patients had a positive drug history for at least one of the substances within 20 days before TINU onset. In very few subjects (3.2%), Chinese herbs were administered before disease onset. Among infections, viruses have been suggested to play the most critical roles in TINU induction \\[ 14 \\]. At least two references indicate an association with Epstein–Barr virus infections \\[ 22 , 23 \\]. However, it always needs to be noted that serological abnormalities that potentially indicate (sub)acute virus infections also may occur as bystander phenomena. Our patient showed positive anti-EBV-IgG. His abdominal lymph node expansion might have occurred as late or persistent manifestation of infection with the virus weeks before onset. However, making a distinct decision is difficult since we did not perform a more detailed EBV analysis of the kidney specimen. It also needs to be mentioned that a drug-induced pathogenesis was very unlikely in our patient: he did not receive any systemic medications at all prior to admission.\n\n【31】TINU syndrome is not only a rare cause of tubulointerstitial nephritis, but in many cases renal function is reduced only marginally and the ophthalmologic symptoms are predominant. As in other types of ATIN, RRT in TINU syndrome is most likely not required as long as the diagnosis has been made in time. Regarding our patient, the disease onset arguably took place 10 weeks or even longer before admission to the hospital. A PubMed-based search for the terms “TINU” and “dialysis,” performed in July 2021, delivered only six references. One reference reported on 21 Japanese children with ATIN, three of who suffered from TINU syndrome \\[ 24 \\]. In total, 4 out of 21 subjects required RRT because of AKI. In 2015, Hoste and colleagues \\[ 25 \\] published a prospective investigation that analyzed numerous risk and outcome variables in subjects treated at a total number of 139 intensive care units in 33 countries. RRT became mandatory in 13.5% of the 1802 included patients. These data were acquired in critically ill subjects. Therefore, the RRT prevalence of all in-hospital AKI cases is supposedly lower. But even if it ranges around 10%, only very few AKI subjects require RRT because of ATIN. Assuming that 2–27% of all in-hospital AKI events are triggered/caused by ATIN \\[ 8 , 9 \\], and also assuming that ATIN results from TINU syndrome in 9–22% of cases \\[ 15 \\], the percentage of all AKI subjects requiring RRT because of tubulointerstitial nephritis with anterior uveitis syndrome is marginal. It needs to be emphasized that every individual AKI episode increases the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the long term \\[ 26 , 27 \\]. Our patient required transient RRT, but the whole procedure, although undoubtedly life-saving, increased the CKD risk even further since he developed catheter-related blood infection. The latter was followed by an additional AKI episode as shown in Fig. 1 . Therefore, he is at substantial CKD risk in the long term, although an exact risk prediction is still difficult to provide. We recommended controls of serum creatinine at least twice monthly after discharge. Finally needs to be mentioned that the diagnosis ATIN could have been suspected earlier since systemic prednisolone therapy was initiated immediately. Therefore, typical ATIN-associated findings such as eosinophil accumulation/appearance in blood/urine might have been disappeared. On the other hand, the severity of the disease did not allow the decision for or against steroids to be prolonged.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】In summary, we reported the case of a 19-year-old male patient with RRT-requiring AKI due to TINU syndrome of unknown etiology. The disease required intensified immunosuppressive therapy and transient dialysis. Since both the primary inflammatory process (ATIN) and the secondary infectious complication significantly impaired excretory kidney function, kidney function of younger individuals with new-onset anterior uveitis should be monitored over time and during follow-up.\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request at daniel.patschan@mhb-fontane.de.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, the clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors remains limited owing to the patients’ immunological status, such as the number of lymphocytes, programmed death ligand 1 expression, and tumor mutation burden. In this study, we successfully treated two patients with advanced esophageal cancer who responded to the combination of adoptive immune cell therapy and a low-dose immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Two Asian (Japanese) patients with advanced esophageal cancer who were resistant to conventional chemoradiation therapy were referred to our hospital for immune therapy. Case 1 was a 66-year-old woman who was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer. She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy and then underwent subtotal esophagectomy, after which she became cancer free. However, she relapsed, and cancer cells were found in the lung and lymph nodes 6 months later. She enrolled in a clinical trial at our institution (clinical trial number UMIN000028756). She received adoptive immune cell therapy twice at a 2-week interval followed by low-dose nivolumab with adoptive immune cell therapy four times at 2-week intervals. A follow-up computed tomography scan showed partial response, with mass reduction of the metastatic lung and mediastinal lesions. Case 2 was a 77-year-old man. He received concurrent chemoradiation therapy with fluoropyrimidine/platinum, and gastroscopy revealed complete remission of esophageal cancer. He was disease free for 5 months, but routine computed tomography revealed multiple metastases in his lungs and lymph nodes. He visited our clinic to receive adoptive immune cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy. Radiographic evidence showed continuous improvement of lesions. There was no evidence of severe adverse events during the combination therapy.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The combination of adoptive immune cell therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor might be a possible treatment strategy for advanced esophageal cancer.\n\n【7】_Trial registration_ UMIN000028756. Registered 14 September 2017\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】Esophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy and the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide \\[ 1 \\]. Although treatment strategies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy have been developed in recent years, the prognosis for patients with recurrent or advanced-stage esophageal cancer remains poor \\[ 2 \\]. The limited improvement in treatment outcome obtained by conventional therapies has prompted the search for innovative strategies for the treatment of this cancer, especially molecular or immune-targeting treatments.\n\n【11】The programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway serves as a checkpoint to limit T-cell-mediated immune responses. Two ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PDL-L2), engage the PD-1 receptor and induce PD-1 signaling and associated T-cell exhaustion, resulting in reversible inhibition of T-cell activation and proliferation \\[ 3 \\]. Tumor cells can co-opt the PD-1 pathway to evade immune responses by expressing PD-L1 on the cell surface and engaging PD-1 receptor-positive immune effector cells \\[ 4 \\]. Thus, PD-1 and PD-L1 have attracted considerable attention for their roles in tumor immunology and as immune-based therapeutic targets \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. A number of clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 signal-blockade agents as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently demonstrated dramatic antitumor efficacy in patients with numerous types of malignancy, including esophageal cancer \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【12】Although PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues prior to treatment correlates with clinical outcomes, the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the invaded margin of the tumor may better predict the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy \\[ 8 \\]. Recent research has shown four different types of tumor microenvironment based on the presence or absence of TILs and PD-L1 expression \\[ 9 \\]. Tumors that are both PD-L1 and TIL positive are most likely to benefit from single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade because such tumors possess preexisting TILs that are turned off by PD-L1 engagement. Thus, better understanding of PD-L1 expression and TIL status in esophageal cancer tissues may have considerable clinical implications.\n\n【13】Adoptive T-cell therapy using TILs has been found to mediate durable, complete cancer regression in patients with melanoma and epithelial cancers \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Collectively, these responses were likely based on the recognition of unique, patient-specific mutated neoantigens through the T-cell receptor (TCR) \\[ 12 \\]. However, isolation of TILs from cancer tissue is not always feasible. It was recently demonstrated that peripheral blood lymphocytes contained TIL-like cells recognizing tumor-specific antigens and could be a source of noninvasive options for immune cell therapy \\[ 13 \\]. Previously, we and others reported that adoptive T-cell therapy using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (adoptive cell therapy, ACT), which are activated and proliferated through a culture process involving stimulation with an immobilized anti-CD-3 antibody and interleukin-2 (IL-2), has shown certain efficacy against various cancers without severe adverse events \\[ 14 , 15 \\], indicating that the efficacy of ACT might partially be derived from TILs associated with peripheral blood cells.\n\n【14】Although ICIs have great potential for cancer immunotherapy, their efficacy is still limited by some toxicities. Synergies between ICI therapy and other immunotherapies including cancer vaccines or ACT are currently being investigated in several clinical trials \\[ 15 \\]. Here, we report the cases of two patients with advanced esophageal cancer who were successfully treated and responded to the combination of ACT and an ICI, nivolumab, suggesting that this combination might be a possible treatment strategy for advanced esophageal cancer.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】### Case 1\n\n【17】A female Asian (Japanese) patient was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer in February 2016 at 66 years of age. Biopsy and computed tomography (CT) revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus at clinical stage IV (UICC, T4N2M0). She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) with fluoropyrimidine/platinum from March to April 2016, then underwent subtotal esophagectomy in June 2016. Histopathological analysis of surgical tumor specimens revealed that her esophageal cancer was at clinical stage II (UICC, T3N0M0). She remained disease free until November 2016, when routine CT revealed a new pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymph node swelling, 2.0 cm in diameter, in her left lung. She visited our clinic to receive ACT in December 2016 after radiotherapy for the lymph node metastasis in her lung from January to February 2017. During radiotherapy, she also received ACT using αβT lymphocytes four times at 2–3-week intervals until April 2017. Then chemotherapy using fluoropyrimidine/platinum/docetaxel was administered until January 2018. However, routine CT revealed multiple lung metastases in February 2018. In July 2018, she enrolled in a clinical trial at our institution (clinical trial number UMIN000028756) (Fig. 1 a). Before starting the clinical trial, we evaluated PD-L1 expression level using her tumor specimens and found that the PD-L1 expression level in the tumor tissue was less than 1%. The tumor was negative for microsatellite instability (MSI; data not shown). She received ACT twice at a 2-week interval, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg body weight with ACT four times at 2-week intervals, as part of induction therapy. A follow-up CT scan on 19 September 2018 (9 weeks after nivolumab initiation) showed partial response, with 48% mass reduction of the lung metastases and mediastinal lesion (Fig. 1 b). She was allowed to continue with nivolumab treatment at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight as maintenance therapy at 3-week intervals. Over her clinical course in 2018, there was radiographic evidence of slight improvement (Fig. 1 c), and maintenance nivolumab therapy was continued because the patient was clinically well and alive. Mild, asymptomatic hypothyroidism developed, which required thyroid hormone supplementation, but she showed no other clinically significant treatment-related toxicity.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Clinical course of case 1.

CT and biopsy of specimens revealed squamous carcinoma of the esophagus at clinical stage IV (UICC, T4N2M1). He received CCRT with fluoropyrimidine/platinum from July to November 2017. In December 2017, gastroscopy revealed complete remission of esophageal cancer. He remained disease free until April 2018, when routine CT revealed multiple metastases in his bilateral lungs and lymph nodes of the right hilum (Fig. 2 a). He was administered docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy from May to September 2018, but his lung metastases were found to have progressed (Fig. 2 b). He visited our clinic to receive ACT in October 2018, followed by ACT using αβT lymphocytes three times at 2–3-week intervals until December 2018. He then received dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with MUC1, MAGE3, and survivin, which were expressed on his tumor cells as tumor antigens, 12 times at 2–3-week intervals from 26 December 2018 to 28 June 2019 (Fig. 2 ). During ACT and pulsed DC therapy, he developed brain metastasis in November 2018 and underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastasis. Routine CT revealed that the sizes of multiple lung and lymph node metastatic lesions were reduced, which were evaluated as partial response on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in January 2019 (Fig. 2 c). Furthermore, the sizes of brain metastatic lesions were decreased in April 2019. In September 2019, follow-up CT revealed regrowth of metastatic lesions in the lung and hilar lymph nodes, and he started to receive ACT once a month (Fig. 2 d). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the PD-L1 expression level in the tumor was 1%, and the tumor was negative for MSI (data not shown). Following ACT, he received nivolumab at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg body weight four times at 2-week intervals as part of induction therapy. A follow-up CT scan on 27 November 2019 (8 weeks after nivolumab initiation) showed partial response, with 60% reduction of the lung mass and hilar lymph node swelling (Fig. 2 e). He was allowed to continue with nivolumab treatment at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight as maintenance therapy at 3-week intervals. Over his clinical course in 2019, radiographic evidence showed continuous improvement of lesions, and his treatment was continued with maintenance nivolumab therapy (Fig. 2 f) because the patient was clinically well and alive. There was no evidence of adverse events during combination therapy.\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Clinical course of case 2.

The numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) and CD45 <sup>+ </sup> leukocytes in peripheral blood did not change after ICI and ACT combination immunotherapy (Fig. 3 ). The numbers of CD3 <sup>+ </sup> , TCRαβ <sup>+ </sup> , TCRγδT <sup>+ </sup> , CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>− </sup> T, and CD4 <sup>− </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects before ACT \\[ 16 \\], and increased after ICI and ACT combination immunotherapy (Fig. 3 ). There were no significant differences in the numbers of CD3 <sup>− </sup> CD56 <sup>+ </sup> , IFN-γ+IL4 <sup>− </sup> (Th1), IFN-γ-IL4 <sup>+ </sup> (Th2), and Foxp3+ (Treg) cells among the CD3 <sup>+ </sup> CD4 <sup>+ </sup> subset cells (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【30】**Fig. 3**\n\n【31】Flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and 2 weeks after combination therapy with ICI and ACT.

The solid line indicates the number of cells in case 1, and the dotted line indicates that in case 2\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【34】We describe herein two cases of patients treated with the combination of ACT and an ICI; one patient was treated concurrently with ACT and an ICI, and the other patient obtained a partial response by administration of ACT and a DC vaccine followed by ICI administration for recurrence.\n\n【35】Although grade 1 hypothyroidism occurred in case 1 that required thyroid hormone supplementation, we observed no further severe adverse events in either case. Since we assumed that combination therapy with ACT and the ICI might increase the incidence and severity of adverse events, we used a much lower dose of nivolumab than the standard dose, that is, 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg body weight (20 mg/kg body weight or 40 mg/kg body weight), respectively. The standard dose of nivolumab used in cancer therapy is usually 240 mg/kg body weight, so the dose administered in this trial was one-sixth or one-twelfth of the standard dose of nivolumab, for which no sufficient clinical data have been reported for evaluating the efficacy of nivolumab for esophageal cancer. However, it has been shown by _in vitro_ analysis that even a low dose of nivolumab, 0.3 mg/kg body weight, was sufficient to inhibit PD-L1/PD-1 association \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【36】Several biomarkers that can predict the clinical response of nivolumab have been reported. PD-L1 expression is one of the candidates, since a number of gastrointestinal cancers overexpress this molecule \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Although PD-L1 expression determined by immunohistochemical staining has been correlated with prognosis and response to ICIs in several studies \\[ 17 , 18 \\], other studies demonstrated ICI efficacy in patients deemed to be PD-L1 negative \\[ 20 \\]. Thus, the true relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical efficacy has not yet been elucidated. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with PD-1 and the PD-L1 blocking response. Cancers that have a higher TMB, that is, a higher neoantigen exposure to the immune system, seem more likely to respond to ICIs \\[ 21 \\]. In both patients reported herein, analysis of their tumor specimens showed microsatellite stability and a PDL-1 expression level of 1% or lower. TILs are also found to be an independent marker for prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival in esophageal cancer, thus indicating the critical role of T cells in tumor immunity \\[ 22 \\]. Nevertheless, these markers do not always determine the treatment response to ICIs, suggesting that other factors, such as host immunity, might affect the clinical response to ICIs. For example, an association has been demonstrated between pretreatment lymphocyte count and response to ICIs: patients with higher baseline lymphocyte counts showed better clinical benefits from ICIs \\[ 23 \\]. Lymphocytes in peripheral blood have been reported to include T cells targeting neoantigens derived from tumor cells \\[ 13 , 24 \\]. Thus, an adequate immune status of T cells in patients is necessary to obtain better efficacy of ICIs. Our previous studies revealed that the T cell immune status was impaired in advanced cancer patients and it was restored by ACT, suggesting the beneficial effect of combination therapy with ICIs and ACT \\[ 16 , 24 \\]. Compatible with these observations, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the numbers of CD3 <sup>+ </sup> T lymphocytes and their subsets, including TCRαβ <sup>+ </sup> , TCRγδT <sup>+ </sup> , CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD8 <sup>− </sup> T, and CD4 <sup>− </sup> CD8 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, increased after ICI and ACT combination therapy in both patients (Fig. 3 ), and it might lead to favorable responses to ICIs.\n\n【37】Although the dose of nivolumab given to both patients was very low, it remains unclear whether clinical responses could be obtained at a much lower dose of the ICI alone or the combination of ACT and the ICI. A controlled study is necessary with a large number of patients to clarify this issue. In the case that even a very low dose of nivolumab is found to be effective, dose escalation studies may be required to reevaluate the doses of ICIs for cancer treatment.\n\n【38】Patients and methods\n--------------------\n\n【39】### Patients\n\n【40】This study was conducted from September 2017 to March 2019. The patients were administered ACT twice at a 2–3-week interval followed by 0.3–0.6 mg/kg nivolumab and ACT four times at 2-week intervals. The institutional review board of the hospital approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from the patients (clinical study number, UMIN000028756: an exploratory clinical trial on the safety of combination therapy with effector cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with malignant tumor).\n\n【41】### Preparation for ACT\n\n【42】Activated lymphocytes were generated as previously described \\[ 14 \\]. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the patients’ peripheral blood using a Vacutainer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The PBMCs were activated in a culture flask with an immobilized monoclonal antibody to CD3 (Jansen-Kyowa, Tokyo, Japan) in HyMedium 930 (Kohjin Bio, Saitama, Japan) containing 1% autologous serum. The PBMCs were then cultured for 14 days with 700 IU/ml IL-2 (Proleukin <sup>® </sup> ; Chiron, Amsterdam, Netherlands), after which 3–10 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells were harvested and suspended in 50 ml normal saline for intravenous injection. To prepare a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, PBMCs were collected from the patients by leukapheresis and allowed to adhere to a plastic culture flask. The adherent cell fraction was used for DC culture for 6 days in a medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml IL-4 (Primmune Corp., Osaka, Japan) and 50 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Primmune Corp.) to generate immature DCs. The DCs were pulsed with antigenic tumor-specific peptides or an autologous tumor lysate and allowed to mature for 24 h. After the culture, 1–10 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> mature DCs were harvested and suspended in 1 ml normal saline for subcutaneous injection, then cryopreserved until the day of administration.\n\n【43】### Flow cytometry of PBMCs\n\n【44】Heparinized whole blood was collected from the patients. The phenotype of PBMCs was analyzed by whole-blood staining with OptiLyse C lysis solution \\[ 16 \\]. Absolute cell number was determined using Flow-Count™ fluorospheres as internal standard beads. OptiLyse C, Flow-Count beads, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD45, CD56, TCR pan αβ, TCR pan γδ, and TCR Vγ9 were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Brea, CA, USA). Lymphoprep™ (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) was used with gradient centrifugation to isolate the PBMCs. For Foxp3 staining, the PBMCs were fixed and permeabilized using a fixation/permeabilization kit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol, and Foxp3 was stained with anti-Foxp3 mAb (clone 259D, BioLegend). For intracellular cytokine production assay, the PBMCs were suspended in a conditioned medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO <sub>2 </sub> for 4 h for the IFN-γ/IL-4 assay. After the activated cells were fixed and permeabilized, intracellular cytokines were stained with an anti-IFN- γ or anti-IL-4 (Beckman Coulter) antibody. A Cytomics FC500 or a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) was used for data acquisition, and the data were analyzed using CXP or Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter).\n\n【45】### Immunohistochemistry\n\n【46】To measure the PD-L1 expression level in cancer tissue, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\n【47】### Microsatellite instability\n\n【48】Microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined using a modified version of the pentaplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as described by Buhard _et al_ . \\[ 25 \\] using five markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24, and MONO-27) and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\n【49】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【50】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【51】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【52】PD-1:\n\n【53】Programmed death 1\n\n【54】ICI:\n\n【55】Immune checkpoint inhibitor\n\n【56】ACT:\n\n【57】Adoptive immune cell therapy\n\n【58】PD-L1 and PD-L2:\n\n【59】Programmed death ligand-1 and programmed death ligand-2, respectively\n\n【60】TIL:\n\n【61】Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte\n\n【62】TCL:\n\n【63】T-cell receptor\n\n【64】IL-2:\n\n【65】Interleukin-2\n\n【66】PBMC:\n\n【67】Peripheral blood mononuclear cell\n\n【68】DC:\n\n【69】Dendritic cell\n\n【70】GM-CSF:\n\n【71】Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor\n\n【72】MSI:\n\n【73】Microsatellite instability\n\n【74】CT:\n\n【75】Computed tomography\n\n【76】CCRT:\n\n【77】Concurrent chemoradiation therapy\n\n【78】DTX:\n\n【79】Docetaxel", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In turn, there has been a growing interest in cancer prevention and minimizing exposure to potential environmental carcinogens that surround us. In the 1980s, several chemical carcinogens, including perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and benzene, were detected in water systems supplying Camp Lejeune, a US Marine Corps Base Camp located in North Carolina.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This article presents three cases of cancer patients who have lived at Camp Lejeune, and, decades later, came to our clinic located 1000 miles from the original exposure site. The first patient is a young Caucasian man who was diagnosed with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 37, and the second patient is a Caucasian man who had multiple types of cancer in the prostate, lung, and colon as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia in his 60s and 70s. The third patient is another Caucasian man who had recurrent skin cancers of different histology, namely basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma, from his 50s to 70s.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The US Congress passed the Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act in 2012, which covers appropriate medical care for the people affected by the contamination. We hope that this article raises awareness about the history of Camp Lejeune’s water contamination among cancer care providers, so the affected patients can receive appropriate medical coverage and cancer screening across the country.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Camp Lejeune is a US Marine Corps Base Camp covering 256 square miles on the Atlantic Seaboard in Onslow County, North Carolina. Since its establishment in 1942, it has provided training facilities and barracks for recruits as well as housing units for enlisted personnel and their families. The camp also contains nonresidential facilities such as administrative offices, hospitals, schools, day-care centers, and recreational sites. It is estimated that approximately 170,000 active-duty personnel, family members, and civilian employees live in or around the camp at any given time \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】In August 1982, a routine water sample screening at one of the water treatment plants in the camp detected high levels of halogenated hydrocarbons \\[ 2 \\]. Subsequent analysis confirmed that these included perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and their degradation products—dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride. The levels of these compounds were well above the maximum contaminant levels (MCL) of 5 parts per billion (ppb; µg/L) which is determined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Further investigation in 1985 revealed that several water-supply wells which collected groundwater were the sources of contamination. It was postulated that the contaminants leached into the water-supply wells from underground water tables, and were subsequently pumped into the water treatment plants where the water was mixed and eventually distributed to both residential and nonresidential portions of the camp. The contaminated wells supplied water to Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point, but the Hadnot Point water system was also responsible for distributing water to housing on Holcomb Boulevard until 1972, and then intermittently thereafter (Fig. 1 ). The contaminated water-supply wells were eventually shut down from February to April 1985.\n\n【11】**Fig. 1**\n\n【12】 \n\n【13】_Source_ Maslia ML.

April 29–30, 2009; p. 149.\n\n【14】Map of Camp Lejeune and the water distribution areas.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】In April 1985, the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (NCDNRCD) analyzed water samples taken from the affected water-supply wells plus the monitoring wells installed for the remedial investigation. This information, combined with underground water table data that indicated a southeast direction of water flow, narrowed the contamination source to an off-base dry-cleaner \\[ 3 \\]. The dry-cleaning establishment was geographically located on the northwest edge of the PCE plume and in close proximity to several of the water-supply wells servicing Tarawa Terrace. The owner of the business stated in a deposition that the cleaner had routinely used PCE for dry-cleaning since it opened its business in 1953 \\[ 4 \\]. He indicated that PCE was used as a solvent for clothes as they were spun in the wheel of the dry-cleaning machine. He also stated that the waste product was gathered in powder form and was used to fill potholes. This contamination scenario was corroborated by an extremely high level of PCE from a monitoring well that was installed close to the dry-cleaning facility \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【17】Other volatile organic compounds (VOC) were also potentially involved. Personnel from the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported a “strong gasoline odor” at one of the water-supply wells during a routine reconnaissance in October 1986 \\[ 5 \\]. A review of records traced it back to various gasoline leaks and spills from underground storage tanks located near the Tarawa Terrace shopping center. Several buildings with underground storage tanks were identified in the vicinity that served as gasoline stations \\[ 2 \\]. Of note, there was an accidental discharge of 4400 gallons of unleaded gasoline to the subsurface on September 21, 1985, and leakage of a 3000-gallon tank of leaded gasoline on July 23, 1986 \\[ 2 \\]. In addition, a more comprehensive assessment of the local contamination and toxic release history suggested that small leaks of gas probably started in the 1950s \\[ 5 \\]. As of May 4, 1987, it was estimated that there was more than 2 feet of floating gasoline above the water table around the Tarawa Terrace shopping center \\[ 6 \\]. Compared to Tarawa Terrace, the water-supply contamination scenario for Hadnot Point was more complex. There were multiple potential sources of pollutants surrounding the Hadnot Point supply wells, including hazardous waste sites, fire training areas, and industrial storage lots. Several pieces of evidence suggested that the magnitude of groundwater contamination was much more extensive at Hadnot Point than at Tarawa Terrace \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【18】Currently, most of the marines and their families who once lived at Camp Lejeune during the affected period have moved to different areas of the United States, and they now carry a high risk of developing cancers that are potentially associated with the abovementioned chemical carcinogens. In this article, we present the cases of three patients who lived at Camp Lejeune and developed a rare type or multiple different types of cancers decades later. Then, we review epidemiological studies that examined associations between the chemicals found in the Camp Lejeune water supply and specific cancer types. We hope that this report will raise awareness of water contamination as an important source of carcinogenesis among cancer care providers as well as the general public.\n\n【19】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【20】### Patient #1\n\n【21】The first patient is a 37-year-old Caucasian man who had been relatively healthy until he presented with severe fatigue and muscle ache that persisted for several months. He visited his primary care doctor, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed a high leukocyte count and the presence of peripheral blasts. When he was sent to an emergency room, his total white blood cell (WBC) count was recorded at 20.5 k/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL, and the platelet count was 146 k/mm <sup>3 </sup> . He underwent a bone marrow biopsy that revealed hypercellular marrow with involvement of T lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis was positive for del 11q23 ( _KMT2A_ ), and rearrangement of 14q32 ( _IGH_ ). BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was detected in a qualitative test, but it was not detected in a quantitative test. The discrepancy was due to a very low level of BCR-ABL fusion in the specimen. Hence the mutation was unlikely a pathogenic driver. Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.\n\n【22】His father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis of leukemia but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was _in utero_ when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.\n\n【23】The patient was started on the Linker regimen for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well, and his leukemia remains in complete remission.\n\n【24】### Patient #2\n\n【25】The second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 × 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at ×400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.\n\n【26】At the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.\n\n【27】This patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.\n\n【28】### Patient #3\n\n【29】The third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe _de novo_ allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.\n\n【30】He lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. His mother, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, but no one else in his family has had cancer. Timelines of events for each patient are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【31】**Table 1 Timeline of events**\n\n【32】Full size table\n\n【33】A review of epidemiological studies\n-----------------------------------\n\n【34】Sir Bradford Hill proposed nine criteria for determining an association between a cause and a disease.\\[ 7 \\] Realistically, the assessment of potential carcinogens is heavily reliant upon epidemiological data due to a long latency period from the initial exposure to the development of cancer. Moreover, some cancers occur at a relatively low frequency, requiring long-term monitoring of a large cohort. Nonetheless, there have been several case–control and ecological studies that have suggested an association between the contaminants found in the Camp Lejeune water supply and several different cancers. However, these results must be interpreted cautiously, as there are inherent limitations in the retrospective analyses of such large datasets. Among the studies presented here, the strength of association may vary for the same chemical because different assumptions were made when calculating group exposures based on histological data. The possibility of co-contaminants confounding the health of affected individuals also cannot be ruled out. Being mindful of these unavoidable limitations, we review the following analyses of large patient cohorts that have been thoroughly studied using rigorous standards.\n\n【35】### PCE and TCE\n\n【36】PCE (also known as “perc”) and TCE are both halogenated solvents widely used for industrial purposes (Fig. 2 ). They are colorless, noninflammable, and volatile liquids with an ether-like odor. The vapor from PCE and TCE is heavy, and it readily contaminates ambient urban air. These chemicals are used for dry-cleaning, textile processing, and metal degreasing, and as feedstock in the production of chlorinated chemicals \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. PCE is relatively stable in its natural state, but it decomposes slowly in contact with moisture. Thus, PCE, TCE, and their by-products, DCE and hydrogen chloride, are commonly found as co-contaminants. These molecules can be absorbed by humans via inhalation or ingestion of contaminated vapor or water, whereas dermal absorption is considered a minor route \\[ 10 \\]. PCE and TCE have been classified as probable and known human carcinogens, respectively, by the US EPA, and thus the goal is to achieve zero public exposure. However, the MCL was set at 5 ppb (µg/L) for both PCE and TCE because this is the lowest concentration that is reliably detectable \\[ 11 \\]. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has developed the Hazardous Substance Release and Health Effects Database (HazDat) to collect public health data and compile lists of contaminants specific to known hazardous waste sites. In this database, the most frequently found single-agent contaminant in groundwater was TCE (42.4%), and the most frequently found combination of substances was TCE and PCE (23.5%) \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【37】**Fig. 2**\n\n【38】Chemical structures of **a** PCE and **b** TCE\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】In 1976 and 1978, high levels of PCE were detected in two different areas of Rhode Island by the US EPA, and vinyl liners inside the water distribution pipe were identified as the source of contamination. The vinyl-lined pipes were installed in the 1960s to treat water acidity, and the inner surface of the pipe was coated with vinyl toluene resin in which the solvent used was PCE \\[ 13 \\]. This discovery prompted an inspection of water pipes in other states of New England, and an investigation by Massachusetts revealed that a considerable length of the problematic pipes was installed in the upper Cape Cod area, including Barnstable, Bourne, Falmouth, Mashpee, and Sandwich. In certain sites in Falmouth, where water flow was low, the level of PCE reached as high as 18,000 ppb \\[ 14 \\]. By the early 1980s, either the affected taps were closed or the pipes were flushed to reduce the PCE concentrations below 40 ppb as a remedial action. Several years after the contamination was first identified, a significantly higher incidence of cancers was observed in towns located in upper Cape Cod relative to the entire state, which occurred in breast, colorectal, lung, and hematopoietic organs \\[ 15 \\]. Several case–control studies were subsequently published. One study by Paulu _et al._ calculated estimated doses of exposure for the involved population based on the residence history, water flow characteristics, pipe age, and dimensions. For people whose exposure level was over the 90th percentile, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for lung cancer (adjusted for sex, age, other chemical exposures, smoking status, and comorbidities) was elevated at 6.2 \\[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–31.6\\] after a 7-year latency period, and at 19.3 (95% CI 2.6–141.7) after a 9-year latency period \\[ 16 \\]. Another study by Aschengrau _et al._ observed an elevated adjusted OR for leukemia among those whose exposure level was over the 90th percentile (OR 8.33, 95% CI 1.53–45.29 without latency; OR 5.84, 95% CI 1.37–24.91 with latency) \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【41】Another incidence of water contamination with PCE and TCE was reported in 2002 in the city of Redlands in San Bernardino County, California. Water sample tests and hydrogeological studies from this area indicated that the PCE contamination in the water-supply wells began as early as 1980, with levels ranging from 5 to 98 ppb. TCE contamination likely occurred a decade earlier, with levels ranging between 0.09 and 97 ppb \\[ 18 \\]. In 1991, the affected wells were removed from the water system, and the water was treated to reduce the concentrations of PCE and TCE. One ecological study calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of different cancer types in the affected area from 1988 to 1998, based on the actual incidence compared with the expected number of cancers. This study found that the incidence of melanoma and uterine cancer was significantly elevated in the Redlands area during those 10 years, with lower ends of a 99% CI above 1.0 (SIR 1.42, 99% CI 1.13–1.77 for melanoma; SIR 1.35, 99% CI 1.06–1.70 for uterine cancer). However, the prudent authors could not rule out possible confounding effects and stated that distinct area-related socioeconomic status could have impacted their level of healthcare access and vigilance to health-related issues \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【42】In New Jersey, routine semi-annual water testing for VOCs became mandatory in 1984. Test results in 1984 and 1985 revealed detectable levels of non-trihalomethane (THM) VOCs, namely PCE, TCE, DCE, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), in part of the water systems supplying 20% of the state’s population. An ecological study performed in 1990 in the potentially affected area reported an elevated SIR for leukemia in males (SIR 1.53, 95% CI 1.02–2.21). In this analysis, however, the contaminants were measured as a group of chemicals (non-THM VOC) and not individually, and the total level was only moderately elevated between 37 and 72 ppb \\[ 19 \\]. A cohort study in 1994 categorized different levels of TCE in New Jersey water systems based on historical monitoring data in 1978–1984 and mandatory testing results in 1984–1985 and examined differences in rates of hematological malignancies. This study confirmed that the rates of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia were elevated in towns where the average level of TCE was 0.1–5.0 ppb or > 5.0 ppb. However, a dose–response relationship was not so evident, likely because the exposure levels were broadly stratified into < 0.1, 0.1–5.0, and > 5.0 ppb. For patients diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, for example, the age-adjusted ratio was higher for the 0.1–5.0 ppb exposure level than it was for the > 5.0 ppb level. However, when assessing all types of leukemia, there was a tendency for an increased rate with higher levels of exposure. For males, the age-adjusted rate ratio (RR) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.71–1.02) for the exposure level of 0.1–5.0 ppb, which increased to 1.10 (95% CI 0.84–1.43) for the exposure level of > 5.0 ppb. For females, the association was stronger. The age-adjusted RR was 1.13 (95% CI 0.93–1.37) for the exposure level of 0.1–5.0 ppb and 1.43 (95% CI 1.07–1.90) for the exposure level of > 5.0 ppb. Assuming the validity of this positive association, females were more likely to be diagnosed with leukemia than males. This suggests that sex differences may also play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia following exposure to these chemicals \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【43】Based on the knowledge obtained from laboratory research and epidemiological data, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US EPA provide hierarchal classification systems for potential carcinogens (Additional file 1 : Tables S1, S2). The IARC and the US EPA have classified PCE as a group 2A and a group B carcinogen, respectively, or “probable human carcinogen” \\[ 21 , 22 \\]. TCE was classified as a group 1 carcinogen, “carcinogenic to humans,” per IARC standards, and a group A, that is, a “known human carcinogen,” by the US EPA standards \\[ 22 , 23 \\].\n\n【44】### Benzene\n\n【45】Benzene is a hexagonal aromatic hydrocarbon that is volatile and highly flammable (Fig. 3 ). It evaporates quickly in room air and emits a unique gasoline-like odor. The vapor is heavier than air, and the liquid form floats on water. It is one of the most widely used chemicals in the United States, and functions as a solvent as well as an intermediate substrate in the various chemical production of plastics, synthetic fibers, rubbers, dyes, and drugs. Benzene is produced naturally in volcanoes and forest fires but is more commonly found in crude oil extracts and produced in the oil-refining process \\[ 8 \\]. The general public can be exposed to low levels of benzene from automobile exhaust or industrial emissions. Cigarette smoking is also a major source of benzene exposure in the USA. Rarely, leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks or hazardous waste sites can contain benzene and contaminate drinking water, like what probably happened at Camp Lejeune \\[ 24 \\]. Based on EPA guidelines, the MCL of benzene is 5 ppb, although the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) is zero \\[ 11 \\]. In the HazDat database by ATSDR, benzene was the most frequently found air contaminant (6.0%) and the fourth most frequently found water contaminant (25.8%) in hazardous waste sites \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【46】**Fig. 3**\n\n【47】Chemical structure of benzene\n\n【48】Full size image\n\n【49】The adverse health effects of chronic benzene exposure are well known, especially hematopoietic toxicities. Animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to benzene is associated with pancytopenia and aplastic anemia as well as chromosomal changes \\[ 25 , 26 \\]. Different types of skin, gastrointestinal epithelium, liver, respiratory tract, and bone marrow tumors were observed in mice after either prolonged ingestion or inhalation of benzene \\[ 27 \\]. The carcinogenicity of benzene was also established in human studies on exposed workers. One of the most extensively studied populations is the rubber hydrochloride workers, the so-called Pliofilm cohort. Exposure to benzene in this cohort occurred at rubber film manufacturing plants in Ohio from the 1930s to the 1970s. During the manufacturing process, the natural rubber was dissolved in benzene and was thinly spread on a conveyer belt. The benzene was then evaporated for recycling, and the rubber film was rolled and recovered from the conveyor belt. Rubber production took place at three different sites in Ohio. In one plant, workers were exposed from 1939 to 1976, and in the other two plants, exposure occurred from 1936 until 1965 \\[ 28 \\]. Rinsky _et al._ meticulously estimated the individual risk of exposure based on company personnel records and past environmental measurements \\[ 29 \\]. They reviewed job titles and types of work in the rubber hydrochloride plants to determine “exposure classes,” and combined these data with employment periods and the results of past industrial-hygiene measurements to calculate estimated exposure levels. Then they reviewed the vital status of the employees who worked at one of the three plants for at least 1 day between 1940 and 1965. Deaths were captured as an outcome after January 1, 1950, or earlier if the cumulative personal exposure to benzene reached at least 1 ppm-day (1 day of exposure). As a result, a total of 1165 white men were included in the cohort, contributing to 31,612 person-years at risk. Among these, 330 people died, out of which 15 people had died of lymphatic or hematopoietic cancers as of December 31, 1981. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for both leukemia and multiple myeloma were significantly elevated (SMR 3.37, 95% CI 1.54–6.41 for leukemia; SMR 3.09, 95% CI 1.10–10.47 for multiple myeloma). When the cohort was divided into different exposure strata, there was a progressively increasing dose–response relationship for leukemia, but not for multiple myeloma. In an individually matched nested case–control analysis, it was confirmed that both cumulative dose and duration of exposure were higher for those diagnosed with leukemia and myeloma. Paustenbach _et al._ considered additional factors in the exposure assessment, including short-term, high-level exposures to vapors, background concentrations in the building, and dermal absorption. These additional exposures significantly increased the estimated total absorption, which was 3–5 times as high \\[ 30 \\]. In an updated analysis that added 6 years of observation to the Pliofilm cohort, an additional five cases of leukemia were reported, and there were no additional cases of multiple myeloma. While it was suggested that a higher concentration of benzene was required for leukemogenic potential, the more general association between benzene exposure and leukemia was confirmed \\[ 31 \\].\n\n【50】In China, a national occupational survey was carried out in 1981 which reported that more than 500,000 workers in 28,808 factories throughout the country were exposed to various levels of benzene between 1979 and 1981. In this report by Yin _et al._ , the investigators found a higher number of acute or chronic benzene poisoning cases among workers of shoemaking factories where benzene was mixed in the adhesive \\[ 32 \\]. Subsequently, they monitored the cancer mortality rate among 28,460 workers who worked for at least 6 months in factories where benzene was used for painting, shoe manufacturing, rubber production, or adhesive production. Compared with workers in factories with no evidence of benzene, radiation, or other known carcinogen exposure, SMRs were elevated for leukemia, lung cancer, primary hepatocarcinoma, and stomach cancer \\[ 33 \\]. After these reports, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) collaborated with the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to expand the analysis and consolidate the assessment, employing qualitative evaluation of the exposure. This analysis included 74,828 benzene-exposed workers from 1972 through 1987 in 672 factories in China and a control group of workers from workplaces where benzene was not used during the same period. The time-weighted average of benzene exposure was estimated by local industrial hygienists and occupational health personnel using measurements of historical ambient benzene levels combined with production and process information for the specific job title in each factory. This updated analysis confirmed that the incidence rate of hematological neoplasms was significantly elevated after benzene exposure. For the workers with estimated average exposure of ≥ 25, RR for all hematological neoplasms was 2.8 (95% CI 1.4–5.7). Moreover, the dose–response relationship was evident with the _p_ \\-value for trend < 0.5, when the average exposure was divided into < 10, 10–24, and ≥ 25 \\[ 34 \\].\n\n【51】Human data supporting benzene carcinogenicity after oral absorption are relatively scarce. Nonetheless, an accumulating number of studies report that water contamination by benzene does occur. For example, benzene was detected in service lines supplying drinking water to standing structures after the record California wildfire in 2018 \\[ 35 \\]. The risk of water contamination with benzene is associated with human activities as well. Hydraulic fracturing is used at an increasing frequency for the cost-effective extraction of natural gas, but this process requires the injection of a large amount of water containing chemical additives. The risk of benzene exposure occurs when the flowback water returns to the surface, laced with the remaining additives, solvents, and petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. One study found that the benzene level increased to 148 ppb in a water sample obtained from a reservoir near coal-bed methane fracturing well sites in Sullivan County, Indiana \\[ 36 \\]. In addition, there was a report of contaminated water on a container ship, attributed to the internal coating of the water tank \\[ 37 \\], and there was a detectable level of benzene with other organic pollutants and organophosphorus pesticides in water reservoirs in the Haihe river basin of China \\[ 38 \\]. In the District of Columbia, there was a cluster of leukemia-associated deaths that mysteriously occurred among the mechanics working in the Department of Public Works from 1990 to 1992. In a survey conducted to characterize exposure to carcinogens, the mechanics reported that they used petroleum to clean parts and wash their hands. They also admitted to occasionally siphoning petrol by mouth, resulting in possible oral absorption of benzene \\[ 39 \\].\n\n【52】Based on the large volume of evidence characterizing benzene as a carcinogen in both animals and humans, IARC categorized benzene as a group 1 carcinogen, “carcinogenic to humans.” Under the US EPA classification, benzene is a “known carcinogen to humans,” group A. Although human data are relatively lacking for oral carcinogenicity, the US EPA has extrapolated cancer risk from the inhalation data to oral absorption \\[ 24 \\].\n\n【53】Health effects of water contamination in Camp Lejeune\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】After the revelation about water contamination in Camp Lejeune in 1985, multiple scientific and health investigations ensued. In 2009, the National Research Council convened a “Committee on Contaminated Drinking Water at Camp Lejeune” and released a comprehensive report on the incident. This report illustrates contamination scenarios based on groundwater models, provides exposure assessment, and reviews relevant toxicology and epidemiological studies \\[ 5 \\]. TCE and PCE contamination was the primary interest of this report, since sampling data were available for retrospective review for these chemicals. These data repeatedly supported high levels of contamination in the supply wells and mixed water supplies. At Hadnot Point, the level of TCE in mixed water reached 1400 ppb, with a mean level of 399 ppb from 1980 to 1985. However, there was a relative lack of focus on other organic compounds, especially benzene. Benzene was detected in water samples collected at the Tarawa Terrace water treatment plant in 1985, albeit in a small amount (< 5 ppb). In the Hadnot Point water system, a significant level of benzene was detected in several supply wells, with the maximum value reaching 720 ppb in 1984. Data before 1980 were not available. It is unknown whether the high concentration of benzene in the wells reached the tap water, because the water from the supply wells was pumped to the treatment center and mixed before distribution, and the wells were cycled on and off to allow only a few wells to operate at any given time. Available records indicate that benzene has not been detected in the mixed water samples since 1980, but the data were missing in 38 out of the 52 mixed water samples from the Hadnot Point water system during the testing period from 1980 to 1985 \\[ 2 \\]. Despite the missing data, there were reasons to suspect benzene leakage into the water supply because of multiple potential sources of pollutants in these areas, including industrial dumpsites, transformer storage lots, fire training areas, liquids disposal areas, and fuel tanks \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【55】Large-scale cohort studies were conducted for the enlisted personnel and civilian employees who resided or worked at Camp Lejeune during the affected period. The first study published in 2014 by Bove _et al._ examined a cohort of 154,932 Marine and Naval personnel who were stationed at Camp Lejeune at any time between April 1975 and December 1985. The cancer mortality rate in this cohort was compared with that of a comparison cohort which consisted of 154,969 Marine and Navy personnel who were stationed in the same period at Camp Pendleton in southern California where there was no evidence of water contamination. Demographic and social/educational characteristics were comparable between the two cohorts. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted by sex, race, rank, and education. When the base location was used as a dichotomous variable, with no regard to cumulative exposure, the HR for all-cancer mortality was elevated at 1.1 in the Camp Lejeune cohort, with a _p_ \\-value of 0.02. However, the _p_ \\-value was > 0.10 for any specific type of cancer mortality. Another statistical analysis that was used in this study was to include the estimated cumulative exposure as a time-varying variable. Cumulative exposure was calculated based on monthly average contaminant concentrations in the water system of each individual’s primary residence and the occupancy dates. The investigators found that higher levels of cumulative exposure to the total VOCs, which is the sum of all contaminants (TCE, PCE, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and benzene), were associated with elevated kidney cancer-specific mortality, and a dose–response relationship was also found in TCE and benzene with Hodgkin’s lymphoma-specific mortality \\[ 40 \\]. For a more focused interpretation of these results, the authors created a list of cancers of primary interest, based on previous health outcomes of water contamination in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. These included kidney cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, and hematopoietic malignancies \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. In this list, the disease-specific mortality was elevated in the Camp Lejeune cohort for kidney cancer (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.84–2.16), liver cancer (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.92–2.20), esophageal cancer (HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.85–2.38), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HR 1.47, 95% CI 0.71–3.06), multiple myeloma (HR 1.68, 95% CI 0.76–3.72), leukemia (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.75–1.62), and cervical cancer (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.24–7.32). Among those cancers with elevated HR, there was evidence of a dose-related effect in kidney cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as they occurred primarily or exclusively in people with higher cumulative exposure \\[ 40 \\].\n\n【56】A second study by the same authors looked at a different cohort affected by the contamination at Camp Lejeune. The cohort consisted of 4647 full-time civilian employees who worked between April 1973 and December 1985. All of these civilian workers resided off-base where there was no known contamination. The individuals worked in maintenance facilities, administrative offices, commissaries, and warehouses in the main area of the camp, which was served by the Hadnot Point water system. The comparison cohort at Camp Pendleton, California, included 4690 full-time civilian employees. In this analysis, the elevated mortality from all cancers was not as evident as in the previous study (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92–1.36). An exposure–response relationship was found with higher levels of chloride and PCE associated with increased leukemia-specific mortality. Among the diseases of primary interest, the HR for mortality was elevated for kidney cancer (HR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58–6.34), multiple myeloma (HR 1.84, 95% CI 0.43–7.58), and leukemia (HR 1.59, 95% CI 0.66–3.84). When the result was viewed together with the previous study on the cohort of Marine and Naval personnel, the cancers with elevated mortality in both studies were kidney cancer, multiple myeloma, leukemia, rectal cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer \\[ 41 \\]. One potential confounder in both studies was the effect of other carcinogens. Although individual information on smoking and alcohol use was unavailable, comparing the two cohorts of similar demographics and occupations in Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton probably mitigated this confounding effect. The 95% CIs were wide in these studies because of the small numbers of deaths that occurred. The median age at the end of follow-up was 49 years among the Marine and Navy personnel, and 58 years among the civilians, which could be too young to sufficiently monitor cancer occurrence, let alone cancer-specific mortality.\n\n【57】In addition, there was a case report of hairy cell leukemia in a 55-year-old man who served at Camp Lejeune for 5 years in the 1970s \\[ 42 \\]. Although this report does not establish a definite causal link between water contamination and hairy cell leukemia, the patient did not have any other known exposure to pesticides, petroleum, or radiation. The estimated incidence of hairy cell leukemia is three cases per one million person-year in the United States \\[ 43 \\].\n\n【58】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【59】Janey Ensminger, a daughter of a former Marine Corps Master Sergeant, Jerry Ensminger, was born in 1976 when her family was living at Camp Lejeune. In 1983, Janey was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and in 1985, she died at the age of 9. Since then, Jerry, her father, struggled with reconciling himself to her death in light of no family history of the disease. A plausible explanation was not found until 1997 when he discovered in the local news that the tap water at Camp Lejeune was contaminated by toxic chemicals for nearly three decades. Since then, Jerry Ensminger has campaigned for the potential victims among former Camp Lejeune residents, seeking to establish a medical health registry and provide due benefits \\[ 44 \\]. In 2012, Congress passed the Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act, which covers medical care for veterans and family members affected by the water contamination. In response, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a VA clinical guidance for health conditions identified among the potential victims. To be eligible for benefits under the law, a veteran or family member must have resided at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days between January 1, 1957, and December 31, 1987. Latency period was not considered, to maximize benefits for the veterans and families. Cancers or neoplasms that are covered under this act are esophageal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Precancerous lesions are also listed, including ductal carcinoma _in situ_ of the breast, Barrett’s esophagus, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Cancers that have been diagnosed any time during or after residency at Camp Lejeune are included, and clinically indicated screening is also covered without a co-pay for veterans and their families \\[ 45 \\].\n\n【60】Initially, it seemed more than coincidental that three patients who were affected by the water contamination at Camp Lejeune were seen in one clinic located 1000 miles away. On the other hand, the encounter with these three patients speaks to the magnitude of the contamination and the numbers of patients spread throughout the United States and abroad. Based on our experience, it is likely that people who have lived in Camp Lejeune will be seen in oncology clinics across the country with a new cancer diagnosis. For those affected individuals, thorough history-taking can lead to a high level of vigilance and appropriate cancer screening, so that the eligible patients may receive financial coverage for the medical care that they need. We hope that this article raises awareness about the history of Camp Lejeune’s water contamination among cancer care providers and ultimately serves as a public reminder about the importance of chemical carcinogens in the surrounding environment.\n\n【61】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【62】All data supporting the findings of this study are available within the published article and its Additional file 1 .\n\n【63】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【64】PCE:\n\n【65】Perchloroethylene\n\n【66】TCE:\n\n【67】Trichloroethylene\n\n【68】DCE:\n\n【69】Dichloroethylene\n\n【70】MCL:\n\n【71】Maximum contaminant level\n\n【72】EPA:\n\n【73】Environmental Protection Agency\n\n【74】NCDNRCD:\n\n【75】North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development\n\n【76】VOC:\n\n【77】Volatile organic compound\n\n【78】USGS:\n\n【79】US Geological Survey\n\n【80】CBC:\n\n【81】Complete blood count\n\n【82】WBC:\n\n【83】White blood cell\n\n【84】CNS:\n\n【85】Central nervous system\n\n【86】ALL:\n\n【87】Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\n【88】NGS:\n\n【89】Next-generation sequencing\n\n【90】MRD:\n\n【91】Measurable residual disease\n\n【92】PSA:\n\n【93】Prostate-specific antigen\n\n【94】SBRT:\n\n【95】Stereotactic body radiation therapy\n\n【96】CLL:\n\n【97】Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\n【98】ATSDR:\n\n【99】Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\n\n【100】HazDat:\n\n【101】Hazardous Substance Release and Health Effects Database\n\n【102】OR:\n\n【103】Odds ratio\n\n【104】CI:\n\n【105】Confidence interval\n\n【106】SIR:\n\n【107】Standardized incidence ratio\n\n【108】THM:\n\n【109】Trihalomethanes\n\n【110】TCA:\n\n【111】Trichloroethane\n\n【112】RR:\n\n【113】Rate ratio\n\n【114】WHO:\n\n【115】World Health Organization\n\n【116】IARC:\n\n【117】International Agency for Research on Cancer\n\n【118】MCLG:\n\n【119】Maximum contaminant level goal\n\n【120】SMR:\n\n【121】Standardized mortality ratio\n\n【122】NCI:\n\n【123】National Cancer Institute\n\n【124】HR:\n\n【125】Hazard ratio\n\n【126】IOM:\n\n【127】Institute of Medicine", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "37c61474-43a4-47d5-baf1-a76b7a8a0289", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Introduction\n\n【2】Stress urinary incontinence surgeries (transobturator tape and tension-free vaginal tape) are safely performed with success rates over 90%. The transobturator tape procedure attracted more attention due to the lack of major complications, such as intraabdominal organ and vascular injuries, related to the tension-free vaginal tape procedure. Although there are no major or mortality-related complications, more lower urinary complaints, especially vaginal erosion, are reported in transobturator tape surgery. Here we present a rare complication of transobturator tape surgery: the accidental placement of mesh material in the bladder neck. With this case report, we aimed to discuss the diagnosis and management of misplaced transobturator tape material.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 38-year-old Caucasian woman who had stress urinary incontinence that had persisted for 6 years underwent transobturator tape surgery in a different clinic 2 years ago. Subsequently, she presented to our clinic with lower urinary tract complaints such as incontinence and dysuria. A physical examination was unremarkable besides total incontinence. A diagnostic cystoscopy was performed and sling material that crossed her bladder neck from 3 o’clock to 10 o’clock was identified. The misplaced transobturator tape material was cut endoscopically with an internal urethrotomy knife. Afterwards, a midurethral incision was made and mesh parts were removed bilaterally. After successful removal of the mesh material, a new transobturator tape was placed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Even though transobturator tape surgery is a safe and effective procedure for stress urinary incontinence, certain complications can be encountered. Misplacement of the mesh material through the bladder neck is a rare complication and can be managed by successfully removing the mesh material and appropriately placing new transobturator tape material.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Midurethral vaginal suspension surgeries are successful surgical methods that provide patient satisfaction rates of over 90% for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) was introduced in 1995 by Ulmsten _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\]. In spite of its high success rates, undesired bowel and bladder injuries were observed \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. To reduce these complications, Delorme described the transobturator midurethral route in 2001 \\[ 6 \\]. However, bladder and urethral injuries were also observed in the transobturator tape (TOT) procedure, even though the retropubic route was not used \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Estimating the incidence and prevalence of midurethral sling-related complications and quickly recognizing and managing them properly are key factors in improving quality of care of patients who undergo surgery for SUI. In this case report, we aimed to discuss the diagnosis and management of misplaced TOT material.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 38-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of TOT surgery 2 years ago presented to our hospital with complaints of urinary incontinence that emerged during coughing, walking, and physical exercises or activities. She had also experienced dysuria and urine leakage during sexual intercourse. Therefore, she had not had regular sexual intercourse for 2 years. Prior to her admission to our hospital, she was diagnosed as having SUI and used duloxetine (80 mg, daily) for 3 months. She took no other medications on a regular basis. She had performed Kegel exercises routinely. However, her symptoms persisted. She was a housewife, with no history of alcohol consumption or tobacco smoking. She had had two deliveries: one vaginal birth and one cesarean delivery. There was no similar history of illness in her family.\n\n【12】On admission, her temperature was 36.6 °C, pulse was 82 beats/minute, and blood pressure was 110/65 mmHg. She was fully conscious and responsive. Psychologically, she was depressed. On systematic physical examination, no abdominal tenderness and no anatomic anomalies were detected. No murmurs or arrhythmia were detected during auscultation of her heart. Respiratory frequency was 14/minute and no wheezing or rales were detected. On neurological examination, her muscle strength and tone were normal. Ulnar, patellar, and Achilles reflexes were all normal (2+). A urogynecological physical examination revealed SUI without any urogenital prolapse. In laboratory analysis, her total white blood cell count was 6.9 × 103/mm <sup>3 </sup> , hemoglobin was 12.1 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase was 38 u/l, aspartate aminotransferase was 35 u/l, C-reactive protein was 1.1 mg/l, creatinine was 0.6 mg/dl, and serological tests were negative: hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), and anti-HIV. Urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria and urine culture was sterile. Post-void residual volume was insignificant. A diagnostic cystoscopy was performed and sling material which crossed her bladder neck from 3 o’clock to 10 o’clock was identified (Fig. 1 ). The mesh material was cut with an endoscopic internal urethrotomy knife and retrieved by using foreign body grasping forceps. Other mesh parts were excised through a transvaginal midurethral incision. New TOT material was placed and the procedure was terminated. Our patient was discharged on the first postoperative day. First week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up visits showed complete absence of urinary incontinence and other urinary complaints.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】The _blue arrows_ show the mesh material passing through the bladder neck. The _red arrow_ indicates the granulation tissue around the sling material. The _dark arrow_ shows the urethrotomy knife\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】We present a case who underwent a TOT procedure 2 years ago and who we diagnosed as having sling material in her bladder neck. She had persistent dysuria and total incontinence, besides multiple unsuccessful treatments. At a diagnostic cystoscopy, the misplaced sling material was identified. After successful removal of the mesh, new TOT material was placed in the same session.\n\n【19】The success rates of transvaginal sling operations, whichever is applied, are above 90%. In addition, patients with SUI are treated with sling surgeries that offer high success rates with minimally invasive surgeries and rapid recovery rates. The main measure of success is vaginal dryness and patient satisfaction \\[ 1 , 2 , 11 , 12 \\]. In 1995, Ulmsten _et al_ . first introduced the TVT method \\[ 3 \\]. However, in 2001, the transobturator route was described by Delorme to reduce major complications, such as bladder and bowel injuries, related to the TVT procedure \\[ 6 \\]. Although fewer complications have been reported for TOT procedures than for TVT procedures, complications such as bladder perforation have been reported for TOT procedures \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Since 2011, mini-sling methods have been applied to reduce complication rates \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【20】Misplacement of the mesh material inside the bladder is rarely encountered in sling surgeries. The incidence of sling material placement in the bladder and urinary tract is reported to be between 1 and 6% in the literature. However, during TOT procedures, bladder perforation is less common, because the retroperitoneal route is not used \\[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 \\]. Perforation of the bladder or urethra may occur during abrupt dissection with scissors, incorrect placement of the trocar, passage of the needle through the bladder or urethra, or erosion of the urethra or bladder due to the suspension material \\[ 2 \\]. Our patient had undergone TOT surgery in a different hospital 2 years ago and details of the operation were not known. We thought that these findings might be due to urethral erosion or wrong trocar access. During the operation, if entry of the trocar into the bladder is noticed, the path of the needle can be corrected and the sling material can be re-placed into the suburethral space. In other words, this inaccuracy can be corrected intraoperatively, without further complications \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【21】Predisposing factors for these complications can be listed as surgeons’ lack of experience, presence of cystocele, advanced patient age, history of tobacco smoking, presence of diabetes mellitus, patients with low body mass index (BMI), and patients with a history of vaginal or pelvic surgery \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. Cystoscopy is recommended for cases with predisposing factors for complication or suspected perforation. However, it is not always possible to identify the misplaced material, if it is very closely related to the bladder neck. Overlooked cases despite cystoscopy have been reported \\[ 6 , 20 \\]. During cystoscopy, the use of 70-degree lenses is particularly important to visualize the bladder neck and avoid misdiagnosis. In patients with bladder perforations, attempts are made to medically treat complaints, such as urinary incontinence, increased urinary frequency, dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infection, urgency, incontinence, hematuria, and vaginal discomfort; therefore, it can take months or even years to diagnose and treat the underlying pathology \\[ 20 , 22 \\]. The average duration between diagnosis and treatment is 7–36 months \\[ 5 , 20 , 22 \\].\n\n【22】Most of the patients who have undergone midurethral sling surgery develop calcification and a stone in the suspension material \\[ 5 , 23 \\]. For patients who have undergone midurethral sling surgery and have had lower urinary tract complaints with or without bladder stone detection in the postoperative period, the possibility of bladder and urethral perforation should be kept in mind. Diagnostic cystoscopy is crucial to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected perforation. Various treatment modalities can be used for the treatment of misplaced mesh material. Endoscopic knife, transurethral electrocautery, holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho: YAG) laser, laparoscopy combined with endoscopy, and open cystotomy can be listed as described treatment alternatives \\[ 5 , 18 , 22 , 23 \\].\n\n【23】Jo _et al._ reported 23 bladder and urethral perforation cases in patients who had undergone TOT ( _n_ \\= 11) and TVT and mini-sling ( _n_ \\= 12) surgeries \\[ 22 \\]. Among these patients, 15 of them were treated by transurethral resection-electrocautery (TUR-E) and 8 of them were treated by transurethral resection-holmium (TUR-H) surgery. They have also performed midurethral vaginal incision for the removal of remaining suspension parts \\[ 22 \\]. There are various other treatment options for the removal of inappropriately placed mesh material. Chan and Tse shared a bladder perforation case in a 71-year-old woman who had undergone intravaginal slingplasty (IVS) surgery 9 months ago \\[ 18 \\]. She presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and sling material was detected inside her bladder during a cystoscopic examination. A laparoscopic approach was preferred for the removal of the sling material. Ozdemir _et al._ preferred open cystolithotomy and Burch surgery for a 56-year-old patient with bladder perforation due to a prior TVT operation \\[ 5 \\]. Foley _et al_ . removed the sling material by cutting it through the urethral meatus with a scissor by using a nasal speculum \\[ 23 \\]. Recognizing and treating bladder perforation can relieve lower urinary tract symptoms like dysuria and urgency, however, SUI should be treated effectively, which was the underlying reason for surgery in the beginning. Foley _et al._ reported that re-placement of a new mesh material is effective in treating SUI and those who did not accept new sling material had persistent symptoms after perforation surgery \\[ 23 \\]. In our patient, after we removed the previously placed sling material, we placed new TOT sling material and we ensured the continence of our patient.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【25】Even though TOT surgery is a safe and effective procedure for SUI, complications can be encountered. Misplacement of the mesh material through the bladder neck is a rare complication and can be managed by successfully removing the mesh material and appropriately placing new TOT material. Cystoscopic evaluation is not recommended routinely, but it must be performed if the patient has sufficient complications to create doubt.\n\n【26】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【27】SUI:\n\n【28】Stress urinary incontinence\n\n【29】TOT:\n\n【30】Transobturator tape\n\n【31】TVT:\n\n【32】Tension-free vaginal tape", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Diamond–Blackfan anemia is both clinically and genetically a heterogenous condition ranging from subtle asymptomatic erythroid abnormalities to non-immune hydrops fetalis. Current treatment options include corticosteroid therapy, chronic red blood cell transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with gene therapy receiving recent attention. We report the first documented case of Diamond–Blackfan anemia in a Caucasian girl secondary to a sporadic heterozygous whole gene deletion in _RPL35A_ in South Africa. Limited resources, non-availability of tests, unfamiliarity that comes with rare diseases, an expanded differential diagnosis, and an associated neutropenia led to a delay in the diagnosis of Diamond–Blackfan anemia. This case reminds clinicians of Diamond–Blackfan anemia as a cause of aplastic anemia and highlights the difficulty and obstacles in diagnosing Diamond–Blackfan anemia in resource-limited countries.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 6-week-old Caucasian girl presenting with urosepsis and heart failure secondary to a severe anemia and neutropenia. Limited experience and resources resulted in a delay in diagnosis. Genetic studies later confirmed a heterozygous whole gene deletion of _RPL35A._ Initial treatment was directed toward correcting the anemia with red blood cell transfusion every 3 to 5 weeks.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Diamond–Blackfan anemia is a rare disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Limited health resources, patient registries, and specialists as seen in developing countries result in a paucity of knowledge about Diamond–Blackfan anemia in Africa. This case reminds clinicians about Diamond–Blackfan anemia as a cause for anemia in infants, the limitations in making the diagnosis in under-resourced health care systems, and the need for standardized treatment protocols applicable to resource-limited countries.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital red blood cell (RBC) aplasia characterized by failed erythropoiesis, congenital abnormalities, and a predisposition to malignancy. Also known as one of the rare groups of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, this clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition was first described by Josephs in 1936 and then as a distinct entity in 1938 by Diamond and Blackfan \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】Numerous theories regarding the etiology of DBA have been proposed. Traditionally, DBA was considered a ribosomopathy caused by genetic mutations in one of 19 ribosomal proteins affecting ribosome synthesis. More recently, however, three non-ribosomal gene mutations have been identified: _GATA1_ (an erythroid transcription factor), _TSR2_ (a gene encoding a direct binding partner of _RPS26_ ) \\[ 2 , 3 \\], and _EPO_ \\[ 4 \\]. The exact pathogenesis underlying the tissue expression in DBA and predilection for erythroid defects is not fully understood.\n\n【11】The characteristic hematological features of DBA include a severe normochromic macrocytic anemia, reticulocytopenia, isolated erythroid hypoplasia in the bone marrow, and an increased erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) \\[ 5 \\], erythrocyte “i” antigen, and fetal hemoglobin (Hb) \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【12】The prevalence of DBA in South Africa is not currently known. Data published from international registries report an incidence of 1:100,000–200,000 live births \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. With no known geographical variance in DBA and approximately 1,000,000 live births annually in South Africa, one can estimate between five and ten cases of children born with DBA every year. Limitations in access to children’s health care and knowledge around rare diseases remain a significant challenge in developing countries and could explain the low incidence of reported cases. Although the anemia can present at any age, the median age of diagnosis is 12 weeks of age, with 90% of patients presenting with anemia within the first year \\[ 9 \\]. It is therefore essential that DBA be considered in the workup of any infant presenting with anemia. We present the first known recorded case of DBA in South Africa.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 6-week-old Caucasian girl was admitted to a private hospital in South Africa with acute onset symptomatic cardiac failure secondary to anemia. Her parents reported a 1-day history of lethargy, poor feeding, shortness of breath, and irritability on a background history of progressive pallor.\n\n【15】There was no family history of note. Antenatal history included a low maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) level (0.376 IU/L) which resulted in a high-risk screening protocol for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and fetal chromosomal anomalies. Cell-free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid testing from maternal blood excluded aneuploidies for the common trisomies \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\] and subsequent fetal anomaly ultrasound and echocardiogram scans were all normal. A caesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for spontaneous labor, IUGR, and breech presentation. The delivery was uneventful and apart from a low birth weight of 2465 g, a healthy baby was discharged 3 days post caesarean section as per normal protocol.\n\n【16】On admission to hospital at 6 weeks of age, the baby under examination was severely anemic, tachycardic, and lethargic. There were no stigmata of immunocompromise, infection, or icterus. The baby weighed 3200 g with a head circumference of 38 cm.\n\n【17】There were no obvious craniofacial or skeletal abnormalities of note and examinations of her other systems were normal. The preliminary results with normal range for age in brackets showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 3.1 gm/dL (10–18 gm/dL) and a hematocrit of 9% (31–55%), mean corpuscular volume of 106 fl (85–123 fl), mean corpuscular Hb concentration 34 g/dL (32–37 g/dL), reticulocyte production index of 0.0, and an absolute reticulocyte count of 5.1 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (20–60 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Her white cell count was low 4.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (5–19.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) but apart from a low neutrophil count of 0.32 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (1–9 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), the remaining differential count was normal. Her platelet count was increased 655 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (140–420 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Her C-reactive protein was marginally raised at 7.7 mg/L (< 5 mg/L), and the infective work up was positive for _Escherichia coli_ cultured from the urine. Tests for cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rubella, Epstein–Barr virus, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. A diagnosis of _E. coli_ urosepsis was made. The baby was transfused with leukodepleted irradiated red cell concentrate to an Hb level of 10 g/dL and given goal-directed antibiotics and discharged 6 days later.\n\n【18】Readmission 14 days later with an anemia (Hb 7.7 g/dL) and associated reticulocytopenia of 7.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (20–60 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) prompted a provisional diagnosis of transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC), which was made after infection, HIV, and tuberculosis were excluded. Three further admissions over the next 3 months for anemia requiring red cell transfusions and a persistent neutropenia prompted a bone marrow biopsy (Figs. 1 and 2 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Bone marrow trephine hematoxylin and eosin stain. Normocellular trephine showing normal megakaryopoiesis and granulopoiesis\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】Bone marrow glycophorin. Absence of red blood cell precursors\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Review of the bone marrow biopsy showed reactive features with markedly increased megakaryopoiesis and significant lymphocytic infiltrate. Flow cytometry demonstrated the infiltrate to consist of T cells, mature B cells, and hematogones. An absence of red cell precursors and immunohistochemical glycophorin stain on the bone marrow trephine confirmed a pure red cell aplasia.\n\n【28】Due to the unavailability of molecular and eADA testing in South Africa, specimens for molecular testing were sent to Oxford, UK, for identification of a possible heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with DBA. A multigene panel using the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification kit (MRC-Holland) confirmed a heterozygous whole gene deletion of _RPL35A_ . In addition, dried plasma was sent to Duke University Medical Center, USA, to exclude adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency.\n\n【29】Once the diagnosis of DBA was made, the non-standardized management and limited experience in managing DBA in South Africa resulted in inconsistencies in opinion in the optimal early management of the case. Controversies around Hb transfusion threshold, optimal Hb target, frequency of transfusions, and timing and dosage of corticosteroid treatment and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) resulted in different opinions from different specialist practitioners.\n\n【30】Together with input from international DBA specialists managing large numbers of patients with DBA, the initial hematopoietic management in this case was directed toward correcting the anemia with transfusions every 3–5 weeks with irradiated leukodepleted RBC concentrate. A transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL was used and a volume of 10–15 ml/kg transfused on each visit. Planned iron chelation therapy to prevent transfusional hemosiderosis will be delayed until approximately 170–200 ml/kg of transfused red packed cells has been given. A planned trial of corticosteroids will be given at 1 year of age.\n\n【31】At follow-up at 6 months of age, the baby was stable requiring red cell concentrate infusion therapy every 3–4 weeks. Persistence in the neutropenia was noted, with no changes in the other cell lineages. Her current ferritin level is 573 μg/L and a total of 90 ml/kg of red packed cells has been transfused, thus, iron chelation therapy has not yet been instituted. Apart from a delay in gross motor development and growth (weight and height), all other parameters and development are within normal limits.\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】DBA is a rare cause of aplastic anemia and the main differential diagnosis of anemia due to decreased RBC production includes TEC, infections, and other genetic causes of bone marrow failure. These are, however, usually associated with additional cytopenias and include Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, Fanconi’s anemia, dyskeratosis, and Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome. Other acquired causes include aplasia associated with viral infections, drugs, autoimmune conditions, malignancies, and, rarely in adults, a thymoma should be considered \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【34】_RPL35A_ is a gene that encodes a 60S large ribosomal subunit protein and accounts for 3.3% of cases of DBA identified with a gene mutation \\[ 6 \\]. It was described by Farrar _et al._ \\[ 14 \\] in 2008 and was the first large ribosomal subunit protein defect directly linked to DBA in humans. Although a pure red cell aplasia is typical of DBA, _RPL35A_ mutations may have an associated neutropenia \\[ 9 \\]. To date, mutations in 19 ribosomal genes ( _RPS7, RPS10, RPS15A, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS26, RPS27, RPS28, RPS29, RPL5, RPL11, RPL15, RPL18, RPL26, RPL27, RPL31, RPL35, RPL35A_ ) and 3 non-ribosomal genes ( _GATA1, TSR2, EPO_ ) have been implicated in DBA \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【35】The criteria used to establish the diagnosis of DBA have evolved. The current criteria proposed by Vlachos _et al._ \\[ 8 \\] use clinical, histological, biochemical, and genetic parameters. Using the current proposed guidelines, there are a number of obstacles to making the diagnosis of DBA in South Africa and other countries in Africa. This is largely due to limited resources, tests, and health care services available. In addition, the historical access to health care and worker migration may influence obtaining an accurate family history about inheritance patterns of diseases. In children, TEC is the main differential diagnosis which must be excluded before making the diagnosis of DBA. Both i-RBC antigen testing and eADA activity testing which are used to differentiate TEC from DBA are not freely available in Africa. In addition, both genetic testing for DBA and eADA are not available in South Africa, and although bone marrow biopsies and histopathology are available, it is limited to a few of the larger centralized health institutions.\n\n【36】DBA currently has no curative treatment option. Mainstay treatment options to correct the anemia include chronic RBC transfusions, corticosteroid therapy, and HSCT \\[ 10 , 15 , 16 \\]. Gene therapy, although still novel, does provide a theoretical cure to DBA. Increasing interest in gene therapy using viral vectors \\[ 6 , 17 \\] and novel gene editing tools CRISPR/Cas9 \\[ 18 \\] could change current treatment protocols. Debnath _et al._ \\[ 6 \\] recently reported successfully correcting the anemia in a mouse with DBA using a lentiviral vector with cellular promoters.\n\n【37】Current guidelines, however, are to initially treat the anemia with red cell transfusions until 1 year of age when a trial of steroids should be done \\[ 15 \\]. Some authorities propose an earlier trial of steroids (6 months of age) in certain cases such as the possibility of no access to safe blood products. There are, however, concerns around growth stunting and neuromotor development with early use of corticosteroids \\[ 19 , 20 \\]. Despite 70–80% of patients initially responding to corticosteroids, only half remain on corticosteroid doses low enough to minimize toxicity \\[ 10 \\]. Approximately 20% go into remission and the remaining 40% remain transfusion dependent \\[ 11 \\]. Apart from corticosteroids, there are limited case reports of remission or improvement in Hb level using leucine \\[ 13 , 21 \\] or metoclopramide \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】DBA although a rare cause for red cell aplasia needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis especially in infants. The diagnosis of DBA in this patient subsequently highlighted not only the difficulty in diagnosing DBA in a resource-limited setting, but also the lack of consensus in treating DBA. This case highlights the need for the establishment of a protocolized workup for infants with persistent anemia of unknown cause that includes rare genetic causes. Limited access to investigations needed to make the diagnosis of DBA using current diagnostic criteria needs to be reviewed due to the inaccessibility in Africa of some of the specialized tests. Familiarization with international treatment guidelines is important in the treatment of rare diseases but local guidelines need to be established.\n\n【40】Lastly, this case highlights the paucity of knowledge around DBA in Africa and the need for further research into the epidemiology of DBA in Africa and the establishment of local treatment guidelines.\n\n【41】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【42】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【43】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【44】DBA:\n\n【45】Diamond–Blackfan anemia\n\n【46】eADA:\n\n【47】Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase\n\n【48】Hb:\n\n【49】Hemoglobin\n\n【50】HIV:\n\n【51】Human immunodeficiency virus\n\n【52】HSCT:\n\n【53】Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n\n【54】IUGR:\n\n【55】Intrauterine growth restriction\n\n【56】RBC:\n\n【57】Red blood cell\n\n【58】TEC:\n\n【59】Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is made according to the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, and it does not contain lymphadenopathy as diagnostic criteria. However, lupus lymphadenopathy has an estimated prevalence of 5–7% at the onset of disease, and 12–15% at any stage of the disease.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 19-year-old Sinhalese girl had neck nodules since the age of 5 years, which increased in size and became tender since 1 year. She had alopecia and joint stiffness for 6 months. She presented with a 5-day history of worsening joint pain, fever, and painful, enlarging cervical nodules. She had tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and a vasculitic rash on both lower limbs. She had pancytopenia, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 92, positive antinuclear antibody titer, and high anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), with low C3 and C4 complements. She had a high reticulocyte count of 5%, with direct and indirect antiglobulin tests being positive, indicating autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Lymph node biopsy showed moderate reactive follicular hyperplasia, with scattered plasma cells and immunoblasts, with varying degree of coagulative necrosis, suggestive of lupus lymphadenopathy. On immunohistochemistry of the lymph node biopsy, Bcl2 was negative, excluding lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of abdomen and chest was normal with no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Later, with development of generalized edema, she was found to have impaired renal function, and renal biopsy showed lupus nephritis. She was started on hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil, and her symptoms improved and lymphadenopathy regressed.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】In the case of cervical lymphadenopathy in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, the possibilities of lupus lymphadenopathy, Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease, and lymphoma should all be considered, after excluding secondary infection due to immunosuppression. Histology confirms the differentiation of these pathologies. It is important to differentiate the cause for lymphadenopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus as the outcome and treatment varies. Lupus lymphadenopathy is usually generalized, but isolated cervical lymphadenopathy could also rarely be the first presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus lymphadenopathy can be the only presenting feature, and needs a high index in suspecting systemic lupus erythematosus, though it is not included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder with antibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens causing multisystem involvement. The worldwide prevalence of SLE varies geographically, with the likely highest being in North America with a prevalence of 241/100,000, and in Asia ranging from 30 to 50/100,000 \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The female-to-male ratio of SLE ranges from 2:1 to 15:1 among adults \\[ 1 \\]. The currently recommended criteria in diagnosing SLE are the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) diagnostic criteria. Though these do not contain lymphadenopathy as a criterion, it can be a presenting feature, or the only presenting feature that should not be missed. The presence of lymphadenopathy in SLE can be multifactorial. Therefore, it is important to identify the etiology of lymphadenopathy in SLE, which could include lupus lymphadenitis, lymphoma associated with SLE, Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease, and secondary infection in an immunocompromised host, as the treatment and outcome may differ for each. Due to nonspecific presentations and multisystem involvement of SLE, it is important to have a high index of suspicion and prompt early diagnosis and treatment to improve survival.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 19-year-old Sinhalese girl had neck lumps since the age of 5 years, which were not evaluated before. They have now increased in size and become tender since 1 year. She had a rash on both her lower limbs for 6 years, but no other photosensitive rashes. She had alopecia for 4 years, and pain and morning stiffness of small and large joints for 6 months. She had no gritty eyes or visual impairment. She had loss of appetite but no loss of weight. She attained menarche at the age of 13 years, and had regular menstruation since then. She had no family history of rheumatological disease or malignancy. Her mother had a history of one miscarriage. She had no history of thrombotic phenomena. She presented with a 5-day history of worsening joint pain, fever, and painful, enlarging cervical nodules.\n\n【12】Her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and pulse rate was 80 beats per minute. She had bilateral soft tender cervical lymphadenopathy involving the anterior cervical region, and tender and swollen interphalangeal and carpometacarpal joints. She had an erythematous non-blanching macular rash suggestive of a vasculitic rash on both lower limbs, but no oral ulcers. She had no malar or photosensitive rashes and no digital ulcers or calcinosis cutis. She had no hepatosplenomegaly, with normal examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. She had no focal neurological signs or proximal myopathy, and fundoscopy was normal.\n\n【13】She had pancytopenia (white blood cell count 2.3 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> , hemoglobin 10 g/dl, platelet count 118 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> ). She had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 92, positive anti nuclear antibodies (ANA) titer of 1:640 on Hep-2 cells, and a high anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibody level of 15 IU/ml (positive if > 10 IU/ml), with low C3 and C4 complements of 0.5 g/l (low < 0.785 g/l) and 0.08 g/l (low < 0.145 g/l), respectively, compatible with findings of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Blood picture showed moderate mixed deficiency anemia with moderate rouleaux formation. She had mild iron deficiency anemia with hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dl, low serum ferritin of 8 μg/l, and low transferrin saturation of 15% with no bleeding manifestations. She had a high reticulocyte count of 5% (0.5–1.5%), with LDH of 182 U/l (140–280 U/l). Her direct and indirect antiglobulin tests were positive, and C3d specificity was positive with negative immunoglobulin (IgG) specificity indicating autoimmune hemolytic anemia. She was seen by a hematologist and was started on iron and folic acid supplements. Ultrasound scan of the neck showed reactive lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. Lymph node biopsy showed moderate reactive follicular hyperplasia, with scattered plasma cells and immunoblasts, with varying degree of coagulative necrosis, suggestive of lupus lymphadenopathy. She did not have distorted nodular architecture with cortical and paracortical nodules with proliferation of histiocytes, and karyorrhexis, and crescentic histiocytic nuclei to suggest Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease. On immunohistochemistry of the lymph node biopsy, CD20 was positive in follicles, CD5 was positive in interfollicular areas, and Bcl2 was negative, excluding lymphoma histologically.\n\n【14】Ultrasound abdomen and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of abdomen and chest was normal with no hepatosplenomegaly or intraabdominal lymphadenopathy. Antibodies for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Mantoux were negative. Skin biopsy showed fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels with fibrin extravasation suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Her cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), anti-Ro, anti-La, and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative, but anticardiolipin antibody was positive. However, she did not fit the criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome as she had no history of thrombotic phenomena or pregnancy-related complications of placental insufficiency. She was advised on using compression stockings during long distance travel, adequate hydration, and thromboprophylaxis during major surgery or during future pregnancies. Her serum creatinine was normal (77 μmol/l), urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 343 mg/g, and she had no dysmorphic red cells in urine. She was seen by a nephrologist, and it was decided that a renal biopsy was not indicated at present. She was planned to be closely monitored, and to consider renal biopsy only if urine protein was more than 500 g/dl, or red cells in urine > 5–10/high power field (HPF) with > 10% dysmorphic red cells on follow-up. Ophthalmological evaluation showed no eye involvement of SLE.\n\n【15】Her SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) at diagnosis was 22. She was seen by a rheumatologist, dermatologist, nephrologist, and hematologist for specialist opinion and was started on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily and prednisolone 30 mg daily along with gastric protection, and vitamin D and calcium supplements for bone protection. Her symptoms improved and lymphadenopathy regressed, and prednisolone was gradually tailed off over 3 months.\n\n【16】Six months after the initial presentation, she developed loss of appetite, generalized edema and was found to have a blood pressure of 135/100 mmHg, which later increased to 160/110 mmHg during the course. She was found to have an increased serum creatinine of 128 μmol/l, proteinuria with a urine-to-protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 3854 g/dl, and 20–25 red blood cells in urine on high-power field that were dysmorphic, with red cell urinary casts. Renal biopsy confirmed mixed grade III and grade V lupus nephritis, evidenced by less than 50% of the glomeruli showing proliferation without sclerosis, and diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane on light microscopy, and subepithelial immune deposits on immunofluorescence. The SLEDAI during this flare was 26. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days and intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy with the first dose being 0.75 g/m <sup>2 </sup> followed by five doses of 0.5 g/m <sup>2 </sup> for induction. She was started on cilnidipine 10 mg twice per day and telmisartan 80 mg daily for blood pressure control and reduction of proteinuria, and mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice per day for maintenance, and oral methylprednisolone 8 mg daily for lupus nephritis. Methylprednisolone was continued for 5 months and gradually tailed off, after which she was normotensive with UPCR less than 500 g/dl on several occasions, the latest being 125 g/dl 7 months after induction, with no hematuria on follow-up. The SLEDAI 7 months after induction for lupus nephritis was 2.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】SLE is a multisystem disease, which is diagnosed by the presence of 10 or more of a total score of the diagnostic criteria and one or more clinical criteria for SLE according to the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) diagnostic criteria. This patient had arthritis, nonscarring alopecia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, subacute cutaneous lupus, positive ANA and dsDNA, anticardiolipin antibodies, and low C3 and C4, which account for the diagnosis of SLE with a score of 33 initially, and later with a score of 43 with the development of lupus nephritis, according to the 2019 EULAR/ACR diagnostic criteria for SLE \\[ 3 \\]. Her earliest presentation and most significant complaint was cervical lymphadenopathy. However, lymphadenopathy is not among the diagnostic criteria of SLE \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【19】Infective causes for lymphadenopathy such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, HIV, and tuberculosis were initially considered, as they are a possibility in a patient on immunosuppressants. This is, however, unlikely in this case as this patient’s first presentation was lymphadenopathy that developed prior to starting any immunosuppressants. When investigating for lymphadenopathy in SLE, the possibilities of lymphoma associated with SLE, Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease (KFD) associated with SLE, and lupus lymphadenopathy (LL) should be considered \\[ 4 \\]. Though they can have a similar presentation in SLE, differentiating these three conditions is important as their prognosis and mode of treatment are different.\n\n【20】LL has an estimated prevalence of 5–7% at onset of disease, and 12–15% at any stage of the disease \\[ 5 \\]. This lymphadenopathy is typically soft, mobile, painful, and nonadherent to deep structures \\[ 5 \\]. LL is typically generalized, and there are several case reports indicating that generalized lymphadenopathy can be the first manifestation of SLE \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. This patient had isolated cervical lupus lymphadenopathy, which is a rare presentation, and there were no previous reported cases of isolated cervical LL as the first presentation in Sri Lanka. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy since an early onset of 5 years of age is also a rare occurrence.\n\n【21】The histological findings of LL are usually nonspecific and consist of moderate follicular hyperplasia with increased vascularity, DNA deposits in vessel walls, and scattered immunoblasts and plasma cells. The presence of several degrees of coagulative necrosis with hematoxylin bodies is characteristic of LL, but is rarely seen. The histological appearance varies depending on the clinical manifestations and the disease course \\[ 4 \\]. SLE disease activity measured by the British isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index has been found to be higher among patients with LL \\[ 9 \\]. Some authors have reported a relationship between disease activity and LL, and have recommended that LL should be included among clinical findings indicating disease activity in SLE \\[ 9 \\]. SLE patients with LL are found to show more constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, weight loss, more cutaneous and mucosal signs including alopecia, higher incidence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, increased anti-dsDNA titers, and decreased complement levels. Irrespective of the presence of LL, there were no differences in renal or nervous system manifestations in SLE patients \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【22】The possibility of a hematological malignancy such as lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia was excluded in this patient by immunohistochemistry of the lymph node biopsy, and did not have an indication for further evaluation with bone marrow biopsy. Several studies have reported an increased risk of malignancy, most significantly hematological malignancies such as lymphoma, in patients with autoimmune diseases like SLE \\[ 10 \\]. Phenotypes of SLE that include hematological manifestations such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, sicca syndrome with salivary gland enlargement, and pulmonary infiltrates are found to be associated with a higher risk of a lymphoma \\[ 11 \\]. Since this patient had hematological manifestations as mentioned above, it was important to clearly exclude the possibility of a lymphoma. There is no relationship found between malignancy in SLE with antirheumatic cytotoxic drugs such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide \\[ 11 \\]. Another study showed that SLE in patients with younger age of onset, severe end organ damage, and longer disease duration was associated with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma \\[ 12 \\]. If the lymphadenopathy was due to lymphoma, it will not improve with antirheumatic drugs and steroids given in SLE, and will require specific cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, this patient’s lymphadenopathy regressed with treatment for SLE.\n\n【23】Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, has a very similar presentation to SLE, with female preponderance, young age of onset, and clinical features of fever, arthralgia, skin eruptions, lymphadenopathy, leukopenia, and elevated ESR as in this case \\[ 4 \\]. The differentiating clinical feature is that KFD has an erythematous or ulcerating oropharyngitis, which is not typical of SLE \\[ 4 \\]. Lymphadenopathy in KFD typically involves the cervical region, as in this case, but rarely causes generalized lymphadenopathy \\[ 13 \\]. LL typically causes generalized lymphadenopathy, but this case had only isolated cervical lymphadenopathy and, thus, warranted active exclusion of KFD \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 \\]. The diagnosis of KFD is by lymph node biopsy. Histology commonly shows geographic necrosis with foci of apoptotic cells with abundant karyorrhectic fragments surrounded by histiocytes \\[ 14 \\]. Studies have shown occurrence of KFD prior to SLE in 30% of cases, simultaneous occurrence of both conditions in 47% of cases, and occurrence of KFD after diagnosis of SLE in 23% of cases \\[ 14 \\]. KFD is self-limiting and resolves in 1–6 months. Such cases need to be assessed for SLE and followed up for a possible development of SLE subsequently \\[ 4 , 14 \\]. The coexistence of KFD in an SLE patient is associated with a more aggressive course, and treatment is needed to prevent relapse. KFD associated with SLE can be complicated with hemophagocytic syndrome, heart failure, or recurrent aseptic meningitis that requires intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids \\[ 13 \\]. Therefore, even in a patient diagnosed with LL, it is important to actively exclude concurrent KFD.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【25】When there is cervical lymphadenopathy in patient with SLE, the possibilities of LL, KFD, and lymphoma should all be considered after excluding infections due to immunosuppression,. Lymph node histology and immunohistochemistry differentiates these pathologies. LL is usually generalized, while isolated cervical lymphadenopathy is more common in KFD. SLE can precede, coincide with, and be followed by KFD. It is important to differentiate the cause for lymphadenopathy in SLE as the outcome and treatment varies. Isolated cervical lupus lymphadenopathy can be the only presenting feature, and needs a high index in suspecting SLE, though it is not included in the diagnostic criteria, as early diagnosis and treatment is important in improving outcome.\n\n【26】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【27】Not applicable.\n\n【28】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【29】SLE:\n\n【30】Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n【31】LL:\n\n【32】Lupus lymphadenopathy\n\n【33】KFD:\n\n【34】Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease\n\n【35】ANA:\n\n【36】Antinuclear antibodies\n\n【37】dsDNA:\n\n【38】Double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid\n\n【39】LDH:\n\n【40】Lactate dehydrogenase", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In particular, trochanteric bursitis is an extremely rare manifestation of osteoarticular tuberculosis. We describe a case of tuberculous coxitis with trochanteric bursitis, successfully treated with a fourfold tuberculostatic therapy _._\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 43-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-negative Sudanese man with osteoarticular tuberculosis, who was originally admitted with the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Low grade fever together with the positive result of an interferon-gamma release assay test as well as findings from magnetic resonance imaging provided clues to the diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis could be set after a computed tomography-guided biopsy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Apart from a rare involvement pattern of osteoarticular tuberculosis, including trochanteric bursitis, this case highlights the increasing importance of osteoarticular tuberculosis as a differential diagnosis of rheumatic disorders. With the growing migration flows from tuberculosis-endemic African countries, clinicians in central and northern Europe may be more frequently confronted with atypical involvement patterns of osteoarticular tuberculosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis may affect various organs, causing a broad range of clinical manifestations \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. It provides an important source of mortality, especially if not diagnosed in time. Moreover, in cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis, misdiagnosis of an autoinflammatory disease and the consequent immunosuppressive therapy can further enhance morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis. Here we report the case of a 43-year-old African refugee, who was referred to our clinic with the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 43-year-old man – a refugee Sudanese man – who had been living in Germany for 19 months was referred to our clinic by his rheumatologist with low back pain and the suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. On admission our patient complained of low back pain radiating into his right hip, which started gradually during the last 4 months. He described the pain as persistent and more intense at night so that he could not sleep. Fever, weight loss, and night sweats were denied. In the clinical examination, movements of his right hip were painful. Before admission treatment with 25 mg prednisolone and diclofenac had been already initiated since spondyloarthritis was suspected. Prednisolone therapy was started 2 months before admission with an initial dose of 40 mg/day and was tapered to 25 mg/day until admission. On admission his erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal and his C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (87 mg/l, normal range < 5 mg/l). The rest of routine laboratory tests were normal, except for a slight increase in gamma glutamyltransferase (gamma GT, 78 U/l; normal range < 55 U/l). The immunological tests showed a low titer of antinuclear antibodies (1:160) with no specification in the extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screening test. The tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies were negative. An HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) test was also negative. A conventional chest X-ray revealed no pathological findings. During his in-patient stay low grade fever was discovered. Conventional radiographs of his right hip, pelvis, sacroiliac joints, and his lumbar spine revealed osteosclerosis of his left sacroiliac joint without further abnormalities. In correlation with the pain in the area of his right hip, a pelvis and hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed synovitis of his right hip with trochanteric bursitis (Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, there was left-sided osteitis of the sacral bone. We then performed an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), which was positive. Therefore, we collected material for microbiological as well as pathological diagnostics by puncture of his left hip joint. Histological examination of the periarticular tissue revealed the formation of granulomas with caseous necrosis (Fig. 2 ). Despite a negative acid-fast stain of the gained tissue sample, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culture for mycobacteria remained negative. All other specimens submitted for microbiological testing (blood culture and sputum probes) remained culturally and PCR negative for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis._\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging scans; T2-weighted images. A right-sided coxitis ( _right_ ) with a trochanteric bursitis ( _middle picture_ ) as well as a left-sided osteitis of the sacral bone ( _left_ ) are indicated with _red arrows_\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Histopathological examination: granuloma formation with caseous necrosis and epithelioid macrophages (left, 10× magnification; right, 40× magnification of the area, marked with a _star_ on the _left-sided_ photograph)\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Based on the above described findings, we made a diagnosis of tuberculous coxitis with trochanteric bursitis. Molecular testing yielded no evidence of mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin. We therefore started a four-drug anti-mycobacterial regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Prednisolone was gradually reduced until its complete discontinuation. After 2 months of therapy, ethambutol and pyrazinamide were stopped. Rifampicin and isoniazid were continued for 7 more months. In the follow-up, 6 months after starting therapy and 2 months after completion of a 9-month anti-mycobacterial regimen, his CRP was normal, and low back pain and painful motility of his right hip resolved completely. Conventional radiographs of his right hip showed a slight joint space narrowing with no further pathological findings. In the absence of functional limitation no surgical treatment was required.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】According to the last “Global tuberculosis report” of the World Health Organization, the number of new cases of tuberculosis has tended to decrease over the last decades \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Despite that, tuberculosis remains an important source of mortality, especially in developing countries. In 2014 tuberculosis caused 0.97–1.3 million deaths worldwide. In Germany, tuberculosis is relatively rare. However, in view of the recent developments in migration of refugees from Africa and Arabic countries to Europe, tuberculosis may become a more frequent entity in central and northern Europe in the future \\[ 4 \\]. At present, osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for 1–4.3% of all cases of tuberculosis \\[ 3 \\]. In Germany, approximately 20% of newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis had an extrapulmonary focus \\[ 5 \\]. Osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for 8.1% of newly diagnosed cases and is more common among patients of Asian or African origin. Tuberculous coxitis is thought to arise as a consequence of prior pulmonary tuberculosis through hematogenous spread of mycobacteria \\[ 3 , 6 \\]. Retrograde lymphatic or contiguous dissemination are also possible but less common.\n\n【23】Symptom onset is typically insidious (for example low grade fever, night sweats, and weakness) in cases of skeletal tuberculosis. Localized skeletal pain may appear later delaying the diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis for many months \\[ 7 \\]. The mean time until diagnosis after symptom onset has been reported to be approximately 16–19 months.\n\n【24】A positive IGRA or tuberculin skin test (TST) is crucial for diagnosing tuberculosis \\[ 8 \\]. IGRAs have a higher specificity and sensitivity in comparison to TST. Despite the high specificity of the currently commercially available IGRAs, their sensitivity remains relatively low (ranging from 80 to 88% depending on the study and the assay) \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Skeletal tuberculosis presents no specific radiological findings \\[ 7 , 12 \\]. In cases of spinal tuberculosis, destruction of the intervertebral disc and both adjacent vertebral bodies is characteristic. The appearance of an osteolytic lesion can mimic metastatic tumors or primary osseous lesions. Computed tomography (CT) scans cannot discriminate between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. MRI scans are more sensitive in showing early inflammatory lesions and, thus, suggesting the diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis at an earlier stage. Typically, hypointense or isointense signals appear on T1-weigted images and hyperintense abnormalities appear on T2-weighted images of osseous and soft tissue lesions. The sensitivity of MRI can reach 100% whereas the sensitivity of CT may be around 88%.\n\n【25】A definitive diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis requires the obtaining of specimens from the relevant sites for microscopy and culture, although the sensitivity of these procedures is relatively low \\[ 13 \\]. CT-guided or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration is essential for accurate diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis \\[ 14 \\], which is also reflected in the presented case. Revelation of granulomas and detection of mycobacteria by means of imaging-guided needle aspiration is the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis. Isolation of mycobacteria may have therapeutical consequences by revealing possible drug resistances. The application of sensitive molecular techniques can be extremely helpful especially in cases of samples with low numbers of mycobacteria.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】This case presents a rare involvement pattern of osteoarticular tuberculosis, including trochanteric bursitis. With the increasing migration flows from African countries, which are endemic for tuberculosis, osteoarticular tuberculosis arises as an important differential diagnosis of rheumatic disorders in central and northern Europe.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Immediately after the injection, she developed an acute erythema of the legs and abdomen, angioedema, hypotension (blood pressure 80/40mmHg), tachycardia (heart rate 140/minute), hyperthermia (38.8°C), and respiratory distress. Allergological examinations showed a positive skin-prick test to prednisolone and methylprednisolone. In addition, an oral exposure test with dexamethasone (Fortecortin®) and betamethasone (Celestamine®) was conducted to find alternative corticosteroids for future treatments. After oral application, no local or systemic reactions were observed for these two substances.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case report demonstrates that systemic allergic reactions are possible in patients with uveitis or other inflammatory ophthalmological conditions treated with intravenous corticosteroids. Intravenous administration of cortisone, for example, in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis, should always be conducted with caution because of a possible allergic reaction. For patients who react to a particular steroid, it is necessary to undergo allergological testing to confirm that the compound in question is indeed allergenic, and to identify other corticosteroids that are safe for future anti-inflammatory treatments.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Glucocorticoids are among the most effective and longest known pharmaceuticals for the suppression of immunological reactions. Since their initial therapeutic use in medicine in 1948 \\[ 1 \\], they have been used for their anti-inflammatory effect in a variety of indications. There are also a lot of indications in ophthalmology, for example, treatment of uveitis or ocular toxoplasmosis (OT). However, since their first use, many intolerance reactions have been described. These were mainly reported for local \\[ 2 \\], intramuscular \\[ 3 \\], oral \\[ 4 \\], and inhalation \\[ 5 \\] applications. Only a few cases report an anaphylactic reaction after intravenous administration of cortisone \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Therefore, we report for the first time the case of a systemic allergic reaction by a patient with OT treated with a single dose of intravenous prednisolone-21-hydrogensuccinate (Solu-Decortin® H) to reduce the ocular inflammatory response of OT.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 57-year-old Caucasian woman reported a decrease in visual acuity for 2 weeks. Her best-corrected visual acuity for her right eye was 20/20 and for her left eye 20/100. A slit-lamp examination and intraocular pressure were unremarkable in both eyes. Fundus examination of her left eye revealed temporal intraretinal infiltrates and vitreous opacities (Figure 1 ). Her right eye was unremarkable.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Fundus examination of the left eye revealed vitreous opacities and chorioretinal infiltrates.**\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Fluorescein angiography showed hyperfluorescence of her optic disc, leakage along the vessels, and chorioretinal hyperfluorescent infiltrates (Figure 2 ). The diagnosis of OT was based on the typical morphology of her ocular lesions and a positive serological testing for _Toxoplasma gondii_ (immunoglobulin G concentration = 537IU/mL).\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Fluorescein angiography of the left eye revealed vitreous opacities, a hyperfluorescence of the optic disc, leakage along the vessels, and chorioretinal infiltrates.**\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】She was treated with clindamycin (Clindamycin® H) 4 × 300mg daily over 3 days without any significant improvement of visual acuity. On the fourth day of hospitalization, she received 100mg prednisolone-21-hydrogensuccinate (Solu-Decortin® H) intravenously in addition to her treatment with clindamycin (Clindamycin® H). Within 2 minutes she developed an acute erythema, particularly of her legs and abdomen (Figure 3 ), angioedema, hypotension (blood pressure 80/40mmHg), tachycardia (heart rate 140/minute), hyperthermia (38.8°C), and respiratory distress. Subsequently, she was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be monitored and treated with clemastine fumarate (Tavegil®), ranitidin (Ranitic®), and intravenous fluids. After 1 hour she recovered and after 12 hours she was transferred back to the ophthalmological ward. Her erythema and angioedema persisted for 32 hours. She had no history of previous steroid use. Subsequent allergy testing was conducted after 3 months in the Department of Dermatology in our hospital. The testing showed a positive skin-prick test for prednisolone and methylprednisolone in the form of a 5mm wheal, and negative results for dexamethasone and hydrocortisone (Table 1 ), which confirmed her suspected allergy to prednisolone. Because of her allergic reaction to class A (prednisone-type) corticosteroids and possible complications due to cross-reactions to class D2 (prednicarbate-type) corticosteroids, we avoided any further treatment with systemic or intravitreal corticosteroids.\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Erythema, particularly of the legs and abdomen, and angioedema after intravenous injection of prednisolone (photo was taken after return from Intensive Care Unit).**\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Table 1 **Skin-prick test****\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】In addition, an oral exposure test with a step-by-step elevation of doses up to 2.0mg of dexamethasone (Fortecortin®) and 1.5mg betamethasone (Celestamine®) was conducted to find alternative corticosteroids for future treatments. For both substances, no local or systemic side effects were observed.\n\n【29】After 1 month of treatment with clindamycin (Clindamycin® H) monotherapy without any increase in visual acuity, the patient underwent a vitrectomy with balanced salt solution filling because of heavy vitreous opacities, and to obtain a sample of the vitreous body. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the sample was positive for _Toxoplasma gondii_ .\n\n【30】The postoperative examination of her left eye revealed chorioretinal scars and infiltrates (Figure 4 ). Her right eye was still unremarkable. Fluorescein angiography of her left eye also revealed hyperfluorescent intraretinal infiltrates of the temporal hemisphere and a scar of the inferotemporal retinal vein branch (Figure 5 ). Her visual acuity recovered to right eye 20/20 and left eye 20/40.\n\n【31】**Figure 4**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】**Fundus examination of the left eye after vitrectomy revealed a clearer insight, and chorioretinal scars.**\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】**Figure 5**\n\n【36】 \n\n【37】**Left eye showing chorioretinal infiltrates and a temporal scar as detected by fluorescein angiography.**\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】The first unquestionable anaphylactic reaction to intravenous corticosteroids was described in the year 1974 after treatment of a patient with methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone during an acute asthma attack \\[ 6 \\]. The medical literature describes only approximately 40 cases of allergic reactions after systemic administration of cortisone \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Moreover, this is the first reported case of an acute allergic reaction to intravenous prednisolone in a patient with OT. Accordingly, this case demonstrates that the use of intravenous cortisone requires caution because of a possible allergic reaction, albeit very rare. In the case of a severe systemic reaction to intravenous corticosteroids, we advise allergological testing of the most frequently administered corticosteroids and of all other components of the administered formulation. This is, on the one hand, to find the compound responsible for the allergic reaction and, on the other hand, to identify corticosteroids for future treatment.\n\n【41】A few publications report a dramatic clinical course with subsequent death of the patient after intravenous administration of corticosteroids. However, in these cases the correlation between intravenous corticosteroids and subsequent death was hypothesized only due to the chronological connection \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Our patient showed the typical signs of anaphylaxis as described in a few publications and recovered completely after 2 days \\[ 12 \\]. However, the hyperthermia of the patient after the cortisone administration is not a typical feature of anaphylaxis. Nevertheless, since there was no concurrent infection other than OT, it was concluded that hyperthermia was part of the anaphylactic reaction in this case, although it is not commonly so.\n\n【42】In the literature, there is epidemiological data about the incidence of corticosteroid allergies. In a routine epicutaneous test in 2073 patients there was a positive test result in 61 patients (2.9%) \\[ 13 \\]. In a study by Alexiou _et al._ \\[ 12 \\], in three of 300 patients an anaphylactic reaction to prednisolone-21-hydrogensuccinate (Solu-Decortin® H) occurred during a 3-day therapy with intravenous cortisone up to 1000mg per day. This would correspond to a frequency of 1%. In contrast to this study, the number of case reports in the medical literature is very low \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【43】To confirm the suspected allergy to corticosteroids in the present case, a skin-prick test and an epicutaneous test were carried out. The skin-prick test was performed by puncturing the skin of the patient’s lower arm with a lancet in an area where a drop of the possible allergenic solution had been applied. Immediately after puncturing the antigen solution was wiped off and following 5 to 15 minutes and 24 hours, the skin reaction was evaluated. A positive reaction was noted if there was a wheal at the puncture. There was a positive control (histamine application) and a negative control (0.9% sodium chloride application). In the present case, the skin-prick test was positive in the form of a 5mm wheal for prednisolone and methylprednisolone after 24 hours. Due to the fact that the skin-prick test was positive for pure preparations of corticosteroids, there was no need to test for other candidate substances. Solu-Decortin® H is sealed in glass ampules under nitrogen, which can hardly be a cause for an allergy. If there had been additional ingredients such as preservatives, these should have been tested as well. It is important to conduct allergological testing for every suspected substance because every compound administered could indeed be allergenic. Given the positive prick-test an intracutaneous test was waived because of the danger of a possible anaphylactic reaction. The epicutaneous test of our patient was negative for all substances being tested. This could be because an epicutaneous test is a test for Type IV reactions. The epicutaneous test was performed to test if the patient had a possible contact allergy for corticosteroids. However, the anaphylactic reaction in our case was a Type I reaction, which could be confirmed with the skin-prick test that tests Type I reactions. Overall, immunological reactions to systemic corticosteroids are frequently of Type I according to the classification by Gell and Coombs \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【44】Detection of antibodies is often difficult because there are no specific data for the technical analysis of serum samples. Specific serum IgE antibodies to corticosteroids were detected in only a few cases \\[ 15 – 17 \\] and often antibodies could not be found \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【45】The clinical course of OT is usually self-limiting but can recur after years. However, in some cases, OT can lead to loss of vision, optic nerve or macular affection, and vitreous opacities \\[ 18 \\]. Previous studies \\[ 19 \\] have shown that pars plana vitrectomy can be performed safely on patients with OT who suffer from vitreoretinal complications. Our findings in this case report are consistent with these results. In the case of our patient, after the vitrectomy, her visual acuity recovered due to the removal of vitreous opacities. Moreover, another benefit is the diagnostic certainty obtained by conducting PCR analysis on a sample of vitreous body when a diagnosis remains inconclusive solely based on clinical symptoms.\n\n【46】The most common therapy for OT is a triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and corticosteroids \\[ 20 \\]. Steroids are successful in reducing the ocular inflammatory response. To reduce ocular inflammation, the use of intravitreal triamcinolone or dexamethasone is an alternative treatment for patients with OT. A study by Soheilian _et al._ \\[ 21 \\] compared intravitreal injection of clindamycin and dexamethasone with the standard treatment for OT, consisting of systemic pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and prednisolone. The authors showed that intravitreal injections of clindamycin and dexamethasone resulted in lower systemic side-effects and greater convenience than systemic OT medications. However, in the case of a proven prednisolone allergy, intravitreal injection of an alternative steroid, for example dexamethasone, would only be feasible if an allergic reaction towards the intravitreal deposit of the drug can definitely be excluded. Due to the possibility of an allergic cross-reaction toward dexamethasone, which would probably reside in the eye for weeks after intravitreal deposition, we strictly avoided such a treatment.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【48】In summary, this case report demonstrates that systemic allergic reactions are possible in patients with uveitis or other inflammatory ophthalmological conditions treated with intravenous corticosteroids. Intravenous administration of cortisone, for example in the treatment of OT, should always be conducted with caution because of a possible allergic reaction. For patients who react to a particular steroid, it is necessary to undergo allergological testing to confirm that the compound in question is indeed allergenic, and to identify other corticosteroids that are safe for future anti-inflammatory treatments.\n\n【49】Consent\n-------\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

In particular, in the culprit lesion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), it is easier for the wire to go through the false or dissection lumen \\[ 1 \\]. Repercutaneous intervention treatment, including wiring the true lumen and exclusion stenting of the dissection flap, is usually performed. Detailed descriptions of techniques for guiding the wire to re-enter the true lumen with chronic total occlusions have been published. Here, we present an interesting case of successful intentional false lumen stenting with re-entry into the true lumen of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and implementation of another stent to restore Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade III coronary flow.\n\n【10】In this case, the procedural details of how to open the false lumen, perform intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided wire into the true lumen, and avoid rewiring the mesh of the previous stent, which differed from other cases, were described in detail.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 40-year-old Chinese man had a history of ST-segment elevation inferior myocardial infarction 6 months earlier. He received primary PCI therapy at another hospital. Following predilation with a 2.0 × 20-mm balloon at 12 atm for 6 seconds, a 3.5 × 24 mm sirolimus-eluting stent (EXCEL, JW Medical Systems, Shandong Province, China) was implanted in the lesions of the proximal RCA. However, after stent implantation, coronary angiography (CAG) showed TIMI grade 0 flow in the RCA (Fig. 1 ). He did not receive further PCI therapy because he had no persistent chest pain at that time. He was prescribed regular dual anti-platelet (PLT) therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as statin treatment.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】The primary percutaneous coronary artery intervention therapy for acute proximal right coronary artery occlusion in another hospital. **a** Angiography for right coronary artery. **b** Angiography after balloon predilation. **c** Stent implement in false lumen of proximal right coronary artery. **d** Final angiography\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Six months later, he was admitted to our hospital for recurrent unstable angina. He denied a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and valvular heart disease. He also denied being allergic to pollen, dust medications, or food, and surgical procedures and injuries. He was married at the age of 23 years and he had one boy and one girl. He received aspirin (0.1 g per day) and clopidogrel (75 mg per day) prior to admission. He had smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, and had drunk a little amount of alcohol for 20 years.\n\n【18】A physical examination showed: temperature (T) 36.4 °C, pulse (P) 85/minute, respiratory rate (RR) 20/minute, and blood pressure (BP) 130/80 mmHg. He was well developed, moderately nourished, and active. His skin was not stained yellow, with no cyanosis, pigmentation, skin eruption, or spider angioma. There was no pitting edema.\n\n【19】A heart examination revealed no bulge, abnormal impulse, or thrills in precordial area. The border of his heart was normal, and the point of maximum impulse was in his fifth left intercostal space inside the mid clavicular line and it was not diffuse. There was no pericardial friction sound. His heart sounds were strong and there was no splitting. His cardiac rhythm was regular with no pathological murmurs.\n\n【20】A neurological examination showed normal abdominal, bicipital muscular reflex, patellar and heel-tap reflex with Babinski sign (−), Oppenheim sign (−), Gordon sign (−), Chaddock sign (−), Hoffmann sign (−), Kernig sign (−), and Brudzinski sign (−).\n\n【21】An electrocardiogram (ECG; 24 October 2017) in our hospital showed that deep Q waves were present in the II, III, and aVF leads, suggesting old lower wall myocardial infarction. An initial echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41%.\n\n【22】Laboratory findings (25 October 2017) in our hospital showed: red blood cells (RBC) 4.41 × 10 <sup>12 </sup> /L, white blood cells (WBC) 5.81 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, N 71.9%, hemoglobin (HGB) 133 g/L, PLT 225 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 10.5 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 11.7 U/L, creatinine (Cr) 7.2 mmol/L, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 102 umol/L. Cardiac biomarkers of troponin T (TnT), creatine kinase (CK), and isoenzyme of CK (CK-MB) were negative.\n\n【23】A repeat CAG showed that although the proximal edge of the previous stent exhibited total occlusion, flow into the distal RCA through another pathway could be seen. The JR4.0 guide catheter was placed immediately outside the ostium of the RCA, and we adjusted the direction of the guide wire to direct it from the ostial true lumen into the distal RCA. Then, IVUS was performed to confirm that the previously deployed stent was in the false lumen, resulting in stent occlusion, and that this guide wire did not go through the struts of the previous proximal stent \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. A balloon (Sprinter 2.0 × 20 mm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) was then predilated at 14–16 atm to crush the previous stent. Another 4.0 × 20 mm stent (BuMA™, SINOMED, Tianjin, China) was deployed in the true lumen of the proximal RCA to crush the previous stent, followed by postdilation with a 4.0 × 12 mm balloon at 16–18 atm. Blood flow into the RCA finally recovered to TIMI grade III (Fig. 2 ). Another 12 months of dual anti-PLT therapy was recommended to prevent stent thrombosis and restenosis. Our patient completed his 6-month and 9-month out-patient follow-up visits with no complaints of discomfort (Table 1 ).\n\n【24】**Fig. 2**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound. **a** Wire re-entry into true lumen of right coronary artery. **b** Coronary angiography revealed that the wire was in true lumen of right coronary artery. **c** Coronary angiography after true lumen stent implementation. **d** – **f** Intravascular ultrasound confirmed that wire was in the true lumen from distal, mid, and proximal right coronary artery respectively\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Table 1 Timeline**\n\n【29】Full size table\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Stent restenosis or occlusion is a potentially life-threatening complication of PCI that may cause myocardial infarction or heart failure. Here, we report a case of repeat stent implementation to completely rescue occlusion of the RCA by crushing a previous stent in the false lumen \\[ 4 \\]. We also described the procedural steps of how to open the false lumen, perform IVUS-guided wire into the true lumen, and how to avoid rewiring the mesh of the previous stent in detail, all these differed from other literature.\n\n【32】There are several points we can learn from this case. First, imaging results from angiography must be read carefully, and confirming the true lumen before PCI is important. Repeat CAG revealed flow into the distal RCA from the ostial true lumen. Then, a JR4.0 guide catheter was placed outside the ostium to allow guide wire entry into the true lumen of the proximal RCA \\[ 5 \\]. IVUS proved to be a pivotal tool in confirming false or true lumen, as well as determining favorable proximal site entry points to avoid rewiring the mesh of the previous stent. Furthermore, there are some surgical points that should be considered to avoid wiring the false lumen. Contralateral angiography, microcatheter angiography, and IVUS can be performed to confirm whether the guide wire is in the true lumen. Physicians should not predilate lesions with a balloon or deploy a stent if they are uncertain that the guide wire is in the true lumen. Physicians should also avoid aggressively engaging the ostium of the coronary artery with the guide catheter, and it is safer to place the guide catheter immediately outside the ostium to avoid catheter-induced dissection.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】IVUS proved to be a pivotal tool in confirming false or true lumen, as well as determining favorable proximal site entry points to avoid rewiring the mesh of the previous stent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

CT scan of the chest revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple hypodensities in the liver, along with marked periaortic and pericaval lymphadenopathy. CT/PET scan showed extensive areas of abnormal hypermetabolism in the mediastinum, subcarinal, left hilum, porta hepatis, celiac, retrocrural and superior mesenteric artery nodal areas. In addition, there was increased uptake in the spleen and liver. (Figure 1 ). An initial CT guided core biopsy of a retroperitoneal node was non-diagnostic. A laparoscopic excisional node biopsy and liver biopsy were then performed. Both of these specimens showed involvement with Hodgkin's lymphoma (Figure 4 : Reed-Sternberg cell variants surrounded by small lymphocytes hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification ×40; Figure 5 : CD30 positive Reed-Sternberg cell variants, original magnification ×40, all consistent with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma). She was then treated with standard ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). After four cycles she was felt to be in complete remission by PET/CT (Figure 2 ), then underwent two more cycles and was followed closely. She did well for the next 5 months but then developed neck pain and fatigue. Her physical examination was negative and laboratory evaluation, including a sedimentation rate and LDH, was unremarkable. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously. Three weeks later, she presented with complaints of lower extremity edema and tender erythematous nodules in her lower extremity and wrists which were felt to be consistent with a diagnosis of erythema nodosum. She denied having any pulmonary symptoms, fevers, chills or sweats. A chest x-ray incidentally obtained as part of annual employee health screening for a prior tuberculosis exposure showed new right hilar adenopathy. A PET/CT done to evaluate this revealed extensive hypermetabolic mediastinal adenopathy (Figure 3 ). With recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma in mind, salvage chemotherapy was scheduled and options for stem cell transplant were also discussed. In order to be certain of the diagnosis, the patient underwent a mediastinoscopy. Excisonal biopsies of 3 mediastinal nodes (2 right paratracheal and one subcarinal node) showed numerous non-necrotizing granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytes. Ziehl-Neelsen and Gomori Methanamine Silver stains were negative for mycobacteria and fungi. There was no evidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The mediastinal node findings were felt to be consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis (Figure 6 : Multiple non-necrotizing, epithelioid granulomas, hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnification ×40). Her provisionally scheduled chemotherapy was cancelled. She was treated with low dose (20 mg/d) prednisone for her erythema nodosum, felt to probably arise as a component of sarcoidosis. Within a few days the tender nodules on her legs resolved completely. Eighteen months later she remains in clinical remission, with 2 follow-up PET/CT scans which were negative for recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n【5】**Figure 1**\n\n【6】 \n\n【7】PET/CT scan showing extensive areas of abnormal hypermetabolism in the mediastinum, subcarinal, left hilum, porta hepatis, celiac, retrocrural and superior mesenteric artery nodal areas.

The diagnosis is established by clinical presentation and confirmed by typical histology. In the USA it has a predilection towards females and in blacks. A sarcoidosis-lymphoma association has been described in which there is an increased incidence of lymphoma at least 5.5 times higher than expected in patients with sarcoidosis. \\[ 2 \\] Hodgkin's lymphoma following a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is well reported in the literature\\[ 3 \\] and concomitant lymphoma and sarcoidosis have also been described\\[ 4 \\]. However, very few reports exist of sarcoid like reactions following treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma\\[ 5 \\]. It has been postulated that bleomycin or other chemotherapeutic agents may precipitate a granulomatous reaction and the development of sarcoidosis but this has not been proven \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Sarcoidosis often presents with constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, malaise and weight loss but erythema nodosum may also be seen. Hodgkin's lymphoma may present with similar findings but the diagnosis relies on pathological confirmation. Treatment options for relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma include salvage chemotherapy regimens and/or high dose chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant. Since these therapies are potentially very toxic, a definitive tissue confirmation of relapsed Hodgkin's is essential. Clinical presentation, physical exam, lab investigations and, as this case illustrates, even PET/CT scans may not be able to discriminate between Hodgkin's lymphoma and sarcoidosis.

It accounts for 4% of all non-epithelial sinonasal tumors. According to the literature, radiotherapy is the standard therapy for extramedullary plasmacytoma. However, the conversion rate of extramedullary plasmacytoma to multiple myeloma is reported to be between 11 and 33% over 10 years. The highest risk of conversion is reported during the first 2 years after diagnosis, but conversion has been noted up to 15 years after diagnosis. Once conversion to multiple myeloma is complete, less than 10% of patients will survive 10 years.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present three cases of sinonasal extramedullary plasmacytoma who underwent radiotherapy: a 61-year-old white man, a 60-year-old white man, and a 37-year-old white woman. We found long-term survival with stable disease in all three cases.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The management of solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas of the sinonasal tract is not well established yet. However, the possibility of recurrence and progression to multiple myeloma requires a thorough follow-up protocol. Due to the absence of a standardized protocol for these tumors, we tried to design a tailored long-term follow-up scheme.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Plasmacytoma is a malignant neoplasm of monoclonal B cells first described by Schridde in 1905 \\[ 1 \\]. It consists of three distinct entities according to the International Myeloma Working Group, 2003: solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB), extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP), and multiple primary or recurrent plasmacytomas (Table 1 ) \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【10】**Table 1 International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria of solitary plasmacytoma of bone, extramedullary plasmacytoma, and multiple solitary plasmacytomas (primary or recurrent) \\[ 3 \\]**\n\n【11】Full size table\n\n【12】EMP accounts for less than 4% of all plasma cell tumors and represents 1% of all head and neck tumors \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. More than 80% of plasma cell tumors are localized in the upper aero-digestive tract with approximately 80% within the sinonasal cavity \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. In general, the median age at diagnosis of EMP is 55 to 60 years with a male/female ratio of 3:1 \\[ 7 \\]. Only a few cases of EMP (15 to 20%) progress to multiple myeloma (MM) \\[ 4 \\]; however, despite recent advances in laboratory, imaging, and clinical evaluation, it is still impossible to identify which cases of EMP progress to MM \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【13】Nasal obstruction, usually unilateral, is the most common presenting symptom of sinonasal EMP; however, it is observed in only 29.8% of cases \\[ 8 \\]. Other commonly presenting symptoms are epistaxis, facial swelling, pain, and rhinorrhea \\[ 5 \\]. The presence of cervical lymph nodes involvement at diagnosis ranges from 5 to 20% of cases \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【14】A biopsy of the tumor is required to confirm the diagnosis of EMP \\[ 7 , 9 \\]. It is based on the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings of localized monoclonal plasma cells in the absence of plasma cells proliferation in other sites, especially in the bone marrow, and in the absence of malignant lymphoma \\[ 5 \\]. CD138 is the most useful plasma cell marker \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【15】Although different therapeutic approaches have been proposed in the literature, due to its high radiosensitivity, radiotherapy represents the treatment of choice for EMP \\[ 1 , 5 \\]. However, complete surgical excision is suggested only in small localized lesions, while the role of chemotherapy still remains unclear \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【16】In this article we reported a series of three sinonasal EMPs (two men, one woman; mean age 53, range 37 to 61) aiming to clarify some diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.\n\n【17】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【18】### Case 1\n\n【19】A 61-year-old white man complained of diffuse right maxillary sinus pain, ipsilateral epistaxis, and rhinorrhea for 4 months. A complete basal serum work-up was normal, including serum and urine protein electrophoresis. A nasal endoscopy showed a bloody tumor mass occupying his right nasal cavity; at clinical examination no palpable laterocervical lymph nodes were found.\n\n【20】A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of soft tissue involving his right maxillary sinus extending into the ipsilateral nasal cavity with size greater than 4 cm. Signs of bone erosion were observed at the level of alveolar superior bone, with osteolytic area of 2.5 cm extended to his nasal septum.\n\n【21】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast medium showed hyperintense signal in T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and hypointense signal in T2 in his right maxillary sinus and nasal fossa.\n\n【22】A nasal biopsy performed under local anesthesia allowed the diagnosis of EMP. An immunohistochemical study showed diffuse positivity for CD138 with immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa light chain restriction. An iliac crest needle biopsy did not demonstrate bone marrow involvement; total body sestamibi scintigraphy showed normal tracer uptake in bones and soft tissues.\n\n【23】He underwent radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gy, by linear accelerator, with complete disappearance of disease, but after 5 years he presented with a local recurrence confirmed by a biopsy of the lesion. He was then treated with chemotherapy based on thalidomide and dexamethasone without any response. He received further treatment with bortezomib/dexamethasone followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. However, he experienced a further relapse 1 year later: he was treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, with partial and stable remission. After 13 years, he is still alive with signs of stable local disease.\n\n【24】### Case 2\n\n【25】A 60-year-old white man complained of right nasal respiratory obstruction and ipsilateral epistaxis and rhinorrhea. No abnormalities were evident by basal serum work-up, including serum and urine protein electrophoresis. A nasal endoscopy showed a bloody tumor mass occupying his right nasal cavity (Fig. 1 ); at clinical examination no palpable laterocervical lymph nodes were found.\n\n【26】**Fig. 1**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Nasal endoscopy of Case 2.

Morphological, immunophenotypic, and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the presence of EMP with a diffuse reactivity for CD138. An iliac crest needle biopsy did not demonstrate bone marrow involvement, total body sestamibi scintigraphy showed normal tracer uptake in bones and soft tissues.\n\n【41】He underwent radiotherapy with a total dose of 40 Gy showing a total response without significant side effects. After 5 years he presented with recurrence localized to the left humerus bone, which was treated with radiotherapy with a total dose of 20 Gy, followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. Three years later, a new recurrence to his right clavicle was treated with radiotherapy with total dose of 40 Gy and a further localization to his right hip appeared 1 year later and was treated with radiotherapy with total dose of 40 Gy followed by maintenance chemotherapy with thalidomide and dexamethasone with partial therapeutic response. After 12 years, is still alive with stable signs of local disease.\n\n【42】### Case 3\n\n【43】A 37-year-old white woman complained of left nasal respiratory obstruction. A monoclonal spike in serum as well as monoclonal Bence Jones protein in the urine electrophoresis were absent. Her renal functions, liver functions, and blood profile were normal. A nasal endoscopy showed a bloody tumor mass occupying her left nasal cavity; at clinical examination no palpable laterocervical lymph nodes were found.\n\n【44】CT and MRI revealed a mass involving her left maxillary sinus and the ipsilateral nasal cavity (size approximately 5 cm).\n\n【45】A nasal biopsy performed under local anesthesia confirmed the diagnosis of EMP. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed diffuse reactivity for CD138 with kappa light chain restriction. An iliac crest needle biopsy did not demonstrate bone marrow involvement.\n\n【46】She underwent radiotherapy for a total dose of 40 Gy, but due to progression of disease 6 months later, she underwent four cycles of chemotherapy according to the vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD) scheme with only a partial response. After 2 years, because of systemic disease progression, she again received three cycles of chemotherapy according to the VAD scheme and autologous bone marrow transplantation, obtaining complete disease remission. After 12 years, she is still alive and in disease remission.\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】EMP is a rare plasma cell neoplasm which involves soft tissues, without systemic involvement. It most frequently occurs in the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity (Table 2 ) \\[ 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 10 \\]. Since EMP can have different clinical and therapeutic features, the diagnosis of EMP and the choice of the treatment should be discussed by a multidisciplinary cancer board including an otolaryngologist, an oncohematologist, a pathologist, and a radiotherapist.\n\n【49】**Table 2 Extramedullary plasmacytoma cases of nasal and paranasal sinuses reported in the English language literature**\n\n【50】Full size table\n\n【51】In addition to biopsy and histological examination, EMP diagnostic procedures should comprise laboratory studies including serum and urine protein electrophoresis, quantitative Ig and beta-2-microglobulin determination in serum, complete nasal endoscopic examination, extensive imaging study (CT, MRI), and functional tests such as <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or sestamibi scintigraphy. EMP must be distinguished from reactive plasma cell lesions and lymphoma. The diagnosis of EMP is based on monoclonal plasma cells infiltrate without B cell component. Monoclonality and/or an aberrant plasma cell phenotype should be demonstrated with useful immunophenotypic markers such as CD138, CD38, kappa/λ light chain ratio, CD19, CD56, CD27, CD117, and cyclin D1 \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【52】Furthermore, bone marrow biopsy and/or needle aspiration is of utmost importance to determine the percentage of plasma cells, which should be less than 5% \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【53】Regarding the natural history of the disease, Batsakis \\[ 12 \\] defined five possible stages that EMP can present:\n\n【54】1.  I.\n    \n    Localized disease; solitary, controlled by surgery, radiotherapy, or both; without recurrence or dissemination.\n    \n2.  II.\n    \n    Disease with local recurrence controlled by additional therapy.\n    \n3.  III.\n    \n    Aggressive disease, persistent or recurrent; death by uncontrollable local extension.\n    \n4.  IV.\n    \n    Local disease with regional lymph node “metastasis” without evidence of distant spread.\n    \n5.  V.\n    \n    Local disease, recurrent or followed by dissemination and development of another neoplasm of plasma cells and/or MM \\[ 13 \\].\n    \n\n【55】Following this classification all three of our patients are in stage V.\n\n【56】According to the literature, the gold standard therapy for EMP is radiotherapy \\[ 5 , 8 \\]. In fact, solitary EMPs smaller than 5 cm have an excellent local control with radiation doses of 30 to 40 Gy in 20 fractions, whereas tumors larger than 5 cm may require higher doses (40 to 50 Gy) \\[ 5 \\]. Cervical nodes should be included if involved \\[ 5 \\]. Overall, most studies report high local control rates of approximately 80 to 100% with moderate doses \\[ 14 \\]. Chemotherapy is considered only in patients with tumors larger than 5 cm, high-grade tumors, refractory and/or relapsed disease, and in case of progression to MM \\[ 1 , 15 \\]. Only in small localized cases is complete surgical excision appropriate \\[ 5 \\]. However, when clear surgical margins are obtained, the rate of local control with surgery alone is similar to that achieved with radiotherapy alone. Instead, radiotherapy followed by surgical excision is often employed to reduce the tumor volume and consequently the invasiveness of surgery \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【57】Since head and neck plasma cell neoplasms can be very aggressive with a high tendency to local recurrence, it is important to adequately irradiate all cancer cells with enough doses to ensure tumor control. On the other hand, healthy tissues are very sensitive to radiation. For instance, salivary glands, larynx, and constrictor muscles can be particularly damaged by radiotherapy resulting in long-term sequelae with an incidence of acute as well as late side effects, especially regarding skin toxicity, mucositis, xerostomia, dry-eye syndrome, radiation-induced retinopathy, and neovascular glaucoma, lacrimal duct stenosis, brain necrosis, and osteoradionecrosis of the maxilla \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【58】The long-term survival rate reported in the literature \\[ 8 \\], the presence of long-term stable disease as observed in our patients, and the possibility of late recurrences suggest the need of long-term follow-up.\n\n【59】A recent systematic review of 175 sinonasal EMPs by D’Aguillo _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] confirmed a higher occurrence of these neoplasms in men, with a male to female ratio of 2.3:1. They found that the mean age of diagnosis was 55 years, with a range of 5 years to 79 years. Moreover, they showed that a sinonasal EMP most often recurs as a space-occupying lesion. They found that nasal obstruction was the most common presenting symptom (29.8% of 175 cases). Other commonly cited presenting symptoms included epistaxis (24.2%), facial swelling (9.9%), facial pain (9.9%), painless mass (6.8%), and change or loss of vision (6.2%). The development of MM is a known sequelae of EMP. The rate of conversion of EMP to MM is lower than other plasma cell neoplasms, such as SPB, with rates reported to be between 11 and 33% over 10 years \\[ 8 \\]. The highest risk of conversion is in the first 2 years after diagnosis, but conversion has been noted up to 15 years after diagnosis. Once conversion to MM is complete, less than the 10% of patients will survive 10 years. In the recent review published by D’Aguillo _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\], 16 patients (9.1%) converted to MM, with a median follow-up of 39 months (3.25 years). Eleven of these 16 patients (68.8%) died because of their disease. So it is recommended that patients receive regular follow-up after diagnosis of EMP due to the relatively high risk of conversion.\n\n【60】The rarity of the tumor, the lack of randomized clinical trials, and the propensity toward case reports create a debate regarding the optimal follow-up protocol for solitary EMPs of the sinonasal tract, which continues to be ambiguous.\n\n【61】Myeloma Guidelines by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) \\[ 16 \\] suggest the first screening 45 to 60 days after radiotherapy by serum examinations, then every 3 months for the first year, subsequently every 6 months by serum, radiological, and bone marrow examinations, if necessary. Due to the high risk of conversion, D’Aguillo _et al_ . \\[ 8 \\] proposed a regular screening for MM every 6 weeks for the first 6 months after diagnosis of EMP and then periodically, but without a specific timing. For these reasons, we propose a follow-up protocol consisting of nasal endoscopy and serum examinations every 3 months, and imaging study with MRI 3 months after radiotherapy and subsequently every 6 months per year for 5 years; after 5 years, we propose serum examinations and nasal endoscopy every 6 months and MRI every year. We recommend a biopsy only in cases of clinical and instrumental suspicion of recurrence.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【63】In conclusion, due to the rarity, sites, clinical history, proximity of critical structures, as well as long-term stable disease survival, we believe that the diagnostic approach to EMP should be multidisciplinary and the treatment considered case by case, confirming, in our experience, radiotherapy as the therapy of choice. According to the literature, we observed a high (10 years) survival rate. This aspect, in addition to the possibility of recurrence and the relatively high risk for conversion to MM, prompts a thorough follow-up protocol that, in our opinion, should be designed as described.\n\n【64】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【65】AIOM:\n\n【66】Italian Association of Medical Oncology\n\n【67】CT:\n\n【68】Computed tomography\n\n【69】EMP:\n\n【70】Extramedullary plasmacytoma\n\n【71】FDG-PET:\n\n【72】<sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography\n\n【73】FLAIR:\n\n【74】Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery\n\n【75】MM:\n\n【76】Multiple myeloma\n\n【77】MRI:\n\n【78】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【79】SPB:\n\n【80】Solitary plasmacytoma of bone\n\n【81】VAD:\n\n【82】Vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This enables early and potentially life-saving treatment of intracranial hypertension.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An intraparenchymal pressure probe was placed in the hemisphere contralateral to a large basal ganglia hemorrhage in a 75-year-old Caucasian man who was mechanically ventilated and sedated because of depressed consciousness. Intracranial pressures were continuously recorded and never exceeded 17 mmHg. After sedation had been stopped, our patient showed clinical signs of transtentorial brain herniation, despite apparently normal intracranial pressures (less than 10 mmHg). Computed tomography revealed that the size of the intracerebral hematoma had increased together with significant unilateral brain edema and transtentorial herniation. The contralateral hemisphere where the intraparenchymal pressure probe was placed appeared normal. Our patient underwent emergency decompressive craniotomy and was tracheotomized early, but did not completely recover.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Intraparenchymal pressure probes placed in the hemisphere contralateral to an intracerebral hematoma may dramatically underestimate intracranial pressure despite apparently normal values, even in the case of transtentorial brain herniation.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Elevated supratentorial intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause transtentorial brain herniation, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion, brainstem herniation, and ultimately death, if left untreated \\[ 1 \\]. ICP monitoring is, therefore, commonly implemented in patients with neurologic injury and a high risk of developing intracranial hypertension, in order to detect changes in ICP in a timely manner and to induce therapeutic interventions \\[ 2 \\]. Measurement of ICP appears particularly important in patients who cannot be clinically evaluated due to sedation \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【10】In this case report, we present a patient who experienced transtentorial brain herniation despite an apparently normal ICP.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 75-year-old Caucasian man with chronic arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to the emergency department with right-sided hemiplegia and facial nerve paresis, global aphasia and gaze deviation to the left. His level of consciousness was depressed (Glasgow Coma Scale 11) and arterial blood pressure was elevated (200/90 mmHg). There was no history of trauma or known coagulation disorder. An urgently performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a large left-sided basal ganglia hemorrhage. After admission to the intensive care unit, our patient's level of consciousness further deteriorated (Glasgow Coma Scale 6) and he had to be intubated to protect his airway. Since he could not be clinically evaluated due to sedation required for endotracheal tube tolerance and mechanical ventilation, ICP monitoring was indicated. An intraparenchymal pressure probe (Spiegelberg PN; Spiegelberg GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was uneventfully inserted into the right hemisphere. The ICP measured was initially 17 mmHg, but rapidly decreased with adequate sedation using a continuous propofol infusion and repeated fentanyl injections. By that time, arterial blood pressure had decreased to tolerable levels (150/90 mmHg) and heart rate was moderately reduced to 50 to 60 bpm after endotracheal intubation. After several hours, during which the ICP remained low (Figure 1 ) and the arterial blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, propofol infusion was stopped to clinically evaluate our patient. Soon afterwards our patient started to show extensor posturing in reaction to pain, with sinus bradycardia (heart rate 30 to 35 bpm) and severe arterial hypertension (systolic arterial blood pressure more than 220 to 240 mmHg) rapidly developing. Pupils were mid-sized and pupillary responses were maintained. Paradoxically, during the development of typical clinical signs of transtentorial brain herniation, ICP remained low and never exceeded 10 mmHg (Figure 1 ). Our patient was immediately rushed to the radiology department where computed tomography (CT) scanning detected an increase in both hemorrhage and perifocal edema size (Figure 2A ). This mass lesion caused ipsilateral displacement of the parahippocampal gyrus into the tentorial notch (Figure 2B ), as well as subfalxial brain herniation. Whereas the left hemisphere was edematous with loss of gyral differentiation, the interhemispheric falx was not displaced, and the right hemisphere, where the intraparenchymal catheter was placed, appeared structurally normal (Figure 2C ). In an emergency surgical procedure, decompressive craniotomy was performed. Post-operatively, right-sided hemiplegia persisted and the level of consciousness remained depressed. Therefore, early tracheotomy on intensive care unit day three was performed. Ten days following the intracerebral hemorrhage, our patient was discharged from the intensive care unit. When he entered long-term neurologic rehabilitation another ten days later, his neurologic function of our patient remained impaired (right-sided hemiparesis, Glasgow Coma Scale 10 to 11, no communication possible).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Continuously recorded intracranial pressure readings from the time of insertion of the intraparenchymal pressure probe (black arrow) to the time that clinically evident brain herniation appeared (grey arrow)** .\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**CT scan images after clinical signs of brain herniation developed** .

(C) Edema of the left hemisphere with normally appearing right hemisphere.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Traditionally, intraparenchymal pressure probes are placed in one of the frontal lobes in an attempt to minimize complications \\[ 3 \\]. Although some study results have been controversial \\[ 4 \\], a notable amount of evidence indicates that marked and clinically relevant ICP gradients within the supratentorial compartment may exist in patients with neurologic injury \\[ 3 , 5 – 7 \\]. ICP gradients of up to 28 mmHg were reported in humans \\[ 8 \\]. In contrast to diffuse lesions, interhemispheric ICP gradients were detected in almost half of patients with a focal brain lesion. In most of these cases, ICP was higher in the vicinity of the focal mass and correlated directly with its size \\[ 3 , 5 – 7 \\].\n\n【23】The guidelines in our center require that ICP be recorded at the site of the lesion. However, the guidelines were not followed in this case. In our patient, the ICP gradient was so high that \"normal\" ICP was measured in the right hemisphere while transtentorial herniation of the left hemisphere occurred. The size and location of intracerebral hemorrhage could explain why even a moderate increase in left-hemispheric ICP may have caused transtentorial brain herniation in our patient and did not increase right-hemispheric ICP first. Thirty years ago, Papo _et al._ suggested that neurological deterioration and even brain herniation may occur in the absence of significant ICP changes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage \\[ 9 \\]. Even though we cannot definitely exclude the possibility, it is unlikely that an artifact of the ICP monitor caused the observed discrepancy of brain herniation in our patient with apparently low ICP. CT images showing a massively swollen left hemisphere with a structurally normal right hemisphere underline this assumption. Furthermore, substantial drifts of intraparenchymal pressure devices usually do not occur immediately after insertion \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【24】Although this report describes a single patient, we believe that relevant lessons for ICP measurement in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage can be drawn from this case. First, placement of an intraparenchymal probe into the hemisphere contralateral to a large intracerebral hemorrhage may grossly underestimate ICP around the hematoma. This can be particularly devastating when hemorrhage occurs in deep brain structures such as the basal ganglia which are anatomically close to the tentorium. Considering experimental study results \\[ 11 , 12 \\], it must be assumed that placement of the intraparenchymal pressure probe on the ipsilateral side of the lesion would have allowed detection of locally elevated ICP in our patient. Furthermore, one can hypothesize that measurement of ICP through an intraventricular sonde might have rendered even more reliable ICP results than placement of a left-sided intraparenchymal sonde in the presented patient. Since intraventricular sondes record the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid which distributes equally throughout the supratentorial compartment, it is unlikely that they are prone to recording false low ICPs even if relevant supratentorial ICP gradients are present.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【26】Intraparenchymal pressure probes placed in the hemisphere contralateral to an intracerebral hematoma may dramatically underestimate ICP and render apparently normal values even in the case of transtentorial brain herniation.\n\n【27】Consent\n-------\n\n【28】Written informed consent for publication of this case report and any accompanying images was obtained from the patient's next of kin.

{"seq_id": "2de995e0-f263-49f9-9adb-2c10f1fbfb0b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Mutations or polymorphisms of genes that are associated with inflammasome functions are known to predispose individuals to Crohn’s disease and likely affect clinical presentations and responses to therapeutic agents in patients with Crohn’s disease. The presence of additional gene mutations/polymorphisms that can modify immune responses may further affect clinical features, making diagnosis and management of Crohn’s disease even more challenging. Whole-exome sequencing is expected to be instrumental in understanding atypical presentations of Crohn’s disease and the selection of therapeutic measures, especially when multiple gene mutations/polymorphisms affect patients with Crohn’s disease.\n\n【3】### Case summary\n\n【4】We report the case of a non-Hispanic Caucasian female patient with Crohn’s disease who was initially diagnosed with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with fluctuating anxiety symptoms at 9 years of age. This patient was initially managed with pulse oral corticosteroid treatment and then intravenous immunoglobulin due to her immunoglobulin G1 deficiency. At 15 years of age, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, following onset of acute abdomen. Treatment with oral corticosteroid and then tumor necrosis factor-α blockers (adalimumab and infliximab) led to remission of Crohn’s disease. However, she continued to suffer from chronic abdominal pain, persistent headache, general fatigue, and joint ache involving multiple joints. Extensive gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing, but whole-exome sequencing identified two autosomal dominant gene variants: _NLRP12_ (loss of function) and _IRF2BP2_ (gain of function). Based on whole-exome sequencing findings, infliximab was discontinued and anakinra, an interleukin-1β blocker, was started, rendering marked improvement of her clinical symptoms. However, Crohn’s disease lesions recurred following _Yersinia_ enterocolitis. The patient was successfully treated with a blocker of interleukin-12p40 (ustekinumab), and anakinra was discontinued following remission of her Crohn’s disease lesions.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Loss-of-function mutation of _NRLRP12_ gene augments production of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, while gain-of-function mutation of _IRF2BP2_ impairs cytokine production and B cell differentiation. We propose that the presence of these two autosomal dominant variants caused an atypical clinical presentation of Crohn’s disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes involved in innate immune responses, sensing nonspecific signals through pattern recognition receptors that belong to a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family \\[ 1 \\]. Upon these signals, inflammasomes convert pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 into active forms and release them. Most NLR family members are associated with inflammasomes that promote inflammatory responses, while NLR protein 12 (NLRP12) exerts suppressive actions \\[ 1 \\]. Autosomal dominant LOF mutations of _NLRP12_ cause familial autoinflammatory syndrome \\[ 2 \\]. NLRP12 also plays a role in intestinal homeostasis, in part promoting bacterial tolerance in the gut \\[ 3 \\]. In rodent models, NLRP12 deficiency leads to colitis caused by an increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 \\[ 3 \\]. LOF _NLRP12_ mutations were reported to cause autoinflammatory syndrome \\[ 2 \\]. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBDs), polymorphism of _NLRP12_ is associated with changes in TNF-α production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) \\[ 4 \\]. Therefore, individuals with LOF _NLRP12_ variants are likely prone to IBD and may present with symptoms observed in patients with autoinflammatory syndromes.\n\n【10】The availability of WES began to disclose that the presence of additional mutations can alter the clinical presentation of _NLRP12_ variants. Tal _et al._ reported a case of _NLRP12_ mutation with a variant of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) which presented as severe esophagitis of human simplex virus (HSV) and CD without periodic fever \\[ 5 \\]. A child with variants of _POLR3A_ and _NLRP12_ reportedly presented with recurrent acute disseminated encephalomyelitis/optic neuritis along with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【11】The presented case was initially diagnosed with PANS, with favorable responses to pulse OCS and then IVIg. However, the patient subsequently developed CD and revealed atypical responses to TNF-α blockers. WES identified AD variants of _NLRP12_ and _IRF2BP2_ . A GOF mutation of _IRF2BP2_ is reported in familial common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), resulting in impairment of B cell differentiation, and production of T cell/monocyte cytokines. In the presented case, the presence of these two variants appears to have resulted in a puzzling array of clinical features.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The presented case is a non-Hispanic Caucasian female who was diagnosed with PANS at age 9 years, following acute onset of severe anxiety that manifested as separation anxiety and school phobia. Tics, and other physical symptoms typically seen in PANS patients, were not present as per her parents. The patient was initially treated with ibuprofen, and then OCS. The patient responded favorably to pulse OCS therapy initially. Secondary to persistently low immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1), the patient was referred to the Pediatric Allergy/Immunology Clinic at age 10 years. Her condition was stable for the next 2 years with prophylaxis antibiosis (azithromycin) only. At age 12 years, following a viral syndrome, a major exacerbation of anxiety occurred and a high dose IVIg (1 gram/kg/dose x2) caused a severe adverse reaction (nausea, vomiting, and severe headache). Supplemental IVIg (0.8 g/kg/dose every 3 weeks) to prevent recurrent respiratory infection was well tolerated, with resolution of her anxiety symptoms. However, at age 15 years, sudden onset of acute abdomen resulted in a visit to the emergency room. Abdominal pain progressively worsened over the next several months. She was eventually diagnosed with CD based on biopsy findings: CD lesions in the terminal ileum. Her CD was treated with oral budesonide (Entocort EC) for 1 month without improvement. Thus, adalimumab 7.5 mg subcutaneous (SQ) injection every 2 weeks was started, and then switched to 7. 5 mg SQ every week, resulting in improvement of her gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with resolution of CD lesions 8 months after weekly adalimumab 7.5 mg SQ. However, she suffered from severe joint symptoms; she was found to have positive antihistone antibody and thought to have had drug-induced lupus. Therefore, adalimumab was switched to infliximab IV (300 mg/dose) every 8 weeks and then eventually ever 4 weeks. Switching to infliximab IV infusion led to onset of severe fatigue/headache and adverse reactions to IVIg (joint ache, headache, skin rash, and malaise). Part of her pain symptoms were attributed to subcutaneous nerve entrapment at that time. Prior to the start of TNF-α blockers, she tolerated IVIg without any adverse reactions. During the next 12 months, she continued to have severe fatigue, headache, joint ache, and recurrence of abdominal pain without symptomatic relief by changing Ig infusion from IV to SQ routes. Various regimens of pre- and post-medications for IVIg provided no symptomatic relief. The results of extensive GI workup exploring the organic causes affecting intestine, pancreas, and liver were unrevealing. Because of her puzzling clinical features, we turned to genetic analysis. WES revealed AD variants of _NLRP12_ \\[C.1054>T, minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.04%\\] and _IRF2BP2_ (c.1180A>C, MAF 0.006%), and heterozygous, autosomal recessive, pathological variant of _ATM_ (c.7089+2T>G). GOF mutations of _IRF2BP2_ were reported to cause hypogammaglobulinemia, suppressing production of cytokines and B cell differentiation \\[ 7 \\]. NLRP12 is reported to have a role in gut immune homeostasis, and the mutation found in this case is reported in two patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome (CAPS) \\[ 8 \\]. These variants are inherited from her father. Interestingly, the paternal grandmother, who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, did not respond well to TNF-α inhibitors either, as per her parents. Prior to this genetic workup, the presented case was diagnosed with low Von Willebrand status based on DDVAP challenge in 2017; she has had symptoms of easy bruising and hypermenorrhea.\n\n【14】Given the similarity of her neuropsychiatric and joint symptoms to autoinflammatory syndrome and her lack of responses to TNF-α inhibitors, infliximab was discontinued. Then, 10 weeks after, anakinra, an IL-1β blocker, was started (100 mg/day). Supplemental Ig was also discontinued secondary to her severe adverse reactions. She revealed marked improvement of her clinical symptoms (headache, fatigue, joint ache, sleep disturbance, and symptoms resembling postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)) over 2–3 months after starting anakinra SQ injection. However, her POTS symptoms were not completely resolved. Five months after starting anakinra, she had recurrence of mild diarrhea that resolved with a 10-day course of metronidazole, although microbial workup was negative. Then, 12 months after discontinuation of infliximab, the GI symptoms due to _Yersinia_ enterocolitis occurred, which led to the recurrence of CD lesions. Thus, 5 months after onset of _Yersinia_ enterocolitis, treatment with ustekinumab (45 mg SQ injection x2, 4 weeks apart, then every 12 weeks) was initiated, and remission of CD was achieved in 6 months. Anakinra was discontinued after remission was achieved.\n\n【15】Laboratory findings\n-------------------\n\n【16】Two AD variants of _NLRP12_ and _IRF2BP2_ are expected to alter cytokine production by monocyte–macrophage lineage cells \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Therefore, cytokine production by purified peripheral blood monocytes (PBMo) with methodologies reported elsewhere \\[ 12 \\] was determined at two time points: prior to starting anakinra, which was 2 months after discontinuation of infliximab, and then 5 months after starting anakinra.\n\n【17】The results of these assays revealed a decrease in the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in response to candida heat extract as a source of β-glucan, which activates the inflammasome pathway \\[ 12 \\]. There was no increase in spontaneous production of cytokines at two time points. Production of counterregulatory cytokines (IL-10, sTNFRII, or TGF-β) in response to β-glucan did not differ after starting anakinra (Fig. 1 ). Such changes were not observed in PBMo cytokine production in response to TLR agonists (LPS, zymosan, and CL097). Production of IL-1β and TNF-α was evaluated after initiation of usterkinumab treatment, following the initial submission of this manuscript. They remained within normal limits.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Changes of cytokine levels produced before and 5 months after starting anakinra 100 mg SQ injection daily\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Progress in genetic analysis has made it possible to evaluate the effects of variants of genotypes on both the clinical manifestation and therapeutic responses of autoimmune diseases. Risk variants of genes have been implicated in the onset and progression of IBD, in close association to interactions with gut microbiota \\[ 13 \\]. The presented case illustrates complex gene–gene interactions in association with IBD and the utility of WES for assessing atypical clinical manifestation of IBD.\n\n【24】NLRP12 has emerged as a crucial regulator of innate immunity, and the presence of NLRP12 variants is expected to increase the risk of GI inflammation by affecting gut immune homeostasis. In rodent models, NLRP12 is reported to promote bacterial tolerance, augmenting the diversity of microbe and gut immune homeostasis \\[ 3 \\]. This is partly due to proteasomal degradation of NOD2 by NLRP12 \\[ 10 \\]. NLRP12 is also known to exert a broad range of regulatory actions on major activation signaling pathways (NF-kB, NFAT, MAPK, and mTOR pathways) \\[ 14 \\]. As a result, the presence of NLRP12 variants is expected to result in increased production of inflammatory cytokines, which include IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In IBD patients, increase in serum levels of TNF-α is associated with the _NLRP12_ variant (rs34436714) \\[ 4 \\]. In two CAPS patients, with the same NLRP12 variant that was found in the presented case, increase in spontaneous production of TNF-α and IL-1β has been reported \\[ 9 \\]. Therefore, presence of the _NLRP12_ variant in the presented case is expected to be a predisposing factor for developing IBD.\n\n【25】The increased production of inflammatory cytokines, discussed above, is also expected to affect the central nervous system. It is well known that patients with dysregulated cytokine production of IL-1β as seen in autoinflammatory syndromes are known to exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms \\[ 15 \\]. Increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) has also be reported in common neuropsychiatric conditions including depression and schizophrenia \\[ 16 \\]. It is of note that the presented case was initially diagnosed with PANS due to predominant anxiety symptoms, although she did not reveal other symptoms typically seen in PANS (tics, changes in fine motor functions, etc.). Increase in these inflammatory cytokines and the resultant symptoms can be controlled with OCS. In fact, in the presented case, initially, she responded well to pulse OCS for controlling anxiety.\n\n【26】WES analysis revealed that she had an AD GOF variant of _IRF2BP2_ . IRFBP2 exerts regulatory functions on multiple lineage cells, by serving as a transcriptional co-repressor \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 \\]. These actions of IRF2BP2 on monocyte–macrophage lineage cells suppress the differentiation of inflammatory type 1 (M1) macrophages, attenuating inflammation \\[ 11 , 20 \\]. Repressive actions of IRF2BP2 have been shown to attenuate atherosclerosis and CN inflammation, partly suppressing production of inflammatory cytokines \\[ 11 , 20 \\]. However, excessive suppression through IRF2BP2 can be harmful. It was shown that an AD GOF mutation of _IRF2BP2_ was implicated in a familial form of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) \\[ 7 \\]. In the reported CVID cases with the _IRF2BP2_ mutation, excessive IRF2BP2 actions impaired terminal differentiation of B lineage cells \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】The presented case paternally inherited AD variants of both _NLRP12_ and _IRF2BP2_ . A LOF AD variant of _NLRP12_ is expected to augment production of inflammatory cytokines and disrupt gut immune homeostasis, while the AD GOF variant of _IRF2BP2_ suppresses activation signals of multiple lineage cells. We hypothesized that the presence of the AD _NLRP12_ variant predisposed her to CD and neuropsychiatric symptoms following immune insults. Development of hypogammaglobulinemia may have been associated with the AD GOF _IRF2BP2_ variant. Antagonistic actions of these two variants ( _IRF2BP2_ and _NLRP12_ ) may have provided the relatively stable condition seen during treatment with monthly IVIg, which likely attenuated immune insults from microbial infection. However, the development of CD and subsequent treatment with TNF-α inhibitors may have augmented the effects of the _NLRP12_ variant on inflammasomes, leading to clinical features resembling autoinflammatory syndromes. Lack of recurrent fever and skin symptoms may have been associated with the GOF _IRF2BP2_ variant. Once CD reached remission, we hypothesized that a low dose of anakinra (100 mg/day) may have helped restore balance to her inflammatory responses. Indeed, she revealed marked improvement of her clinical symptoms with anakinra. In two patients with the same _NLRP12_ variant as found in the presented case, anakinra treatment caused increase in TNF-α production within 3–4 months \\[ 9 \\]. However, in the presented case, anakinra treatment did not cause an increase in TNF-α production (Fig 1 ). In fact, this patient did not reveal an increase in spontaneous production of TNF-α or IL-1β. This may be due to the presence of the GOF _IRF2BP2_ variant. However, following immune insults, she may require additional anti-inflammatory medications to control TNF-α-mediated inflammation. This became apparent when she experienced recurrence of CD lesions following _Yersinia_ enterocolitis. Treatment with ustekinumab was successful for controlling her recurrent CD lesions and led to the subsequent discontinuation of anakinra. This may be due to the fact that ustekinumab, a monocloncal antibody against IL-12p40, which blocks signaling pathways of IL-12 and IL-23, can successfully block IL-1β-mediated Th17 cell activation as well as TNF-α-induced Th1 activation \\[ 21 , 22 \\].\n\n【28】However, her fluctuating neuropsychiatric symptoms may also be affected by other factors. For example, the presence of maternal diabetes and use of steroids can worsen the manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Crohn’s disease \\[ 23 , 24 \\], although her mother denied history of gestational diabetes during her pregnancy.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【30】The revelation of two AD GOF gene variants by WES provided a better understanding of the atypical clinical features and failed responses to TNF-α inhibitors in the presented case. In IBD cases with puzzling clinical features and suboptimal responses to first.line therapeutic measures, genetic workup using WES may be helpful. In addition, her atypical course of CD emphasizes the importance of endoscopic biopsies for diagnosis and follow-up.\n\n【31】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【33】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【34】AD:\n\n【35】Autosomal dominant\n\n【36】CAPS:\n\n【37】Cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome\n\n【38】CD:\n\n【39】Crohn’s disease\n\n【40】CVID:\n\n【41】Common variable immunodeficiency\n\n【42】GOF:\n\n【43】Gain of function\n\n【44】IBD:\n\n【45】Inflammatory bowel disease\n\n【46】Ig:\n\n【47】Immunoglobulin\n\n【48】IL:\n\n【49】Interleukin\n\n【50】IVIg:\n\n【51】Intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【52】LOF:\n\n【53】Loss of function\n\n【54】LPS:\n\n【55】Lipopolysaccharide\n\n【56】MAF:\n\n【57】Minor allele frequency\n\n【58】NLR:\n\n【59】NOD-like receptor\n\n【60】OCS:\n\n【61】Oral corticosteroids\n\n【62】PANS:\n\n【63】Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome\n\n【64】PBMo:\n\n【65】Peripheral blood monocytes\n\n【66】SQ:\n\n【67】Subcutaneous\n\n【68】TLR:\n\n【69】Toll-like receptor\n\n【70】TNF:\n\n【71】Tumor necrosis factor\n\n【72】WES:\n\n【73】Whole-exome sequencing", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Amphiphysin antibody is an onconeural antibody linked to the diagnosis of breast cancer and small-cell lung cancer. It is uncommon and typically associated with stiff-person syndrome, of which 90% of patients are eventually diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman with metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who developed bilateral facial nerve palsy while on treatment with nab-paclitaxel. The patient was found to have anti-amphiphysin antibody in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. She was treated with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in partial improvement in her facial nerve palsy.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral facial nerve palsy that likely related to paraneoplastic syndrome associated with the presence of anti-amphiphysin antibody.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is an immune-mediated phenomenon in which antibodies respond against neuronal proteins produced by tumor cells (onconeural antibodies) \\[ 1 \\]. The presence of onconeural antibodies is a useful diagnostic marker of PNS \\[ 2 \\]. They are specific to a group of malignant diseases rather than identified as a neurological syndrome \\[ 3 \\]. An amphiphysin antibody is an onconeural antibody that has been identified and linked to the diagnosis of breast cancer and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【10】We describe the first case in the literature of bilateral facial nerve palsy with the presence of anti-amphiphysin antibodies in a patient diagnosed with metastatic hormone receptor-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 47-year-old Caucasian woman with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade 0 presented with a palpable mass in the left breast associated with an enlarging scalp lesion over 4 months. Biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of metastatic ER/PR positive, HER2-negative breast carcinoma (Fig. 1 ). Computerized tomography staging demonstrated a multifocal primary lesion fixed to the chest wall, axillary lymphadenopathy, and lung and liver lesions, as well as omental, scalp, and bony involvement. She had no other significant comorbidity. She was started on chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel, a commonly used agent in the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Photomicrograph of breast and scalp lesions shows staining for **a** AE1/AE3, **b** CK 7, **c** focal mucin droplets, and **d** mammaglobin\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Following three cycles of nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> every 21 days each cycle), there was a partial response with shrinkage of tumor in all areas. Her cancer antigen 15-3 declined from 179 to 25 kU/L. She continued with a further three cycles of chemotherapy. Prior to proceeding with the sixth cycle of nab-paclitaxel, she presented with a left-sided lower motor neuron weakness of the face. It was classified as severe as she was unable to close her eyes. There was no evidence of an intracranial lesion or ischemic changes on CT or MRI of the brain. At this point, she was diagnosed with bilateral facial nerve palsy and was administered a trial of oral prednisolone for 5 days without any improvement in her symptoms.\n\n【18】One week later, she presented with a lower motor neuron weakness of the contralateral face, giving her bilateral facial nerve palsy. The remainder of the neurological examination did not reveal additional deficits. Subsequent MRI of the brain demonstrated evidence of bilateral facial nerve neuritis involving predominantly the terminal branches. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed no infective or malignant etiology. Interestingly, the paraneoplastic screening showed the presence of anti-amphiphysin antibodies in both serum and CSF. All other anti-neuronal antibodies, including anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, were not detected. A repeat CT scan following the completion of six cycles of chemotherapy demonstrated a partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria to the visceral diseases, with a further reduction in cancer antigen 15-3 (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Computerized tomography scans demonstrating reduction in tumor size of the liver ( **a** – **c** ) and lung ( **d** – **f** ) metastases after three and six cycles of nab-paclitaxel\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】The patient was started on 1 g IV pulse methylprednisolone for 3 days. This was followed up with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) at a dose of 2 g/kg divided over 5 days. She completed four cycles of IVIG at the 2 g/kg dose, which resulted in a subtle improvement of the frontalis muscle; however, the loss of nasolabial folds and inability to close her eyes persisted. A repeat MRI revealed resolution of facial nerve neuritis. A repeat analysis of CSF showed a high level of anti-amphiphysin antibodies titer of 1:640. Nerve conduction study and electromyography suggested evidence of peripheral nerve reinnervation. She continued with monthly IVIG for the next 6 months. Her chemotherapy was stopped and switched to maintenance hormonal therapy with letrozole 2.5 mg daily to help control her malignant disease. A repeat CT scan 3 months later showed overall stable malignant disease.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】PNS is a rare event that affects < 1% of patient with an underlying malignancy \\[ 3 \\]. An international panel of neurologists categorize the diagnosis of PNS into two subgroups—“definite” and “possible.” A definite diagnosis can be made when there is a classical or nonclassical neurological syndrome with the presence of onconeural antibodies (that is, amphiphysin antibody), with or without evidence of malignancy. The classical neurological syndromes include encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, subacute cerebellar degeneration, and opsoclonus-myoclonus \\[ 7 \\]. A small number of case reports have described the link between amphiphysin antibodies with these classical neurological syndromes in patients with breast cancer and SCLC \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【26】Amphiphysin is a nerve-terminal protein that is found in high concentration in the nervous system and is presumed to have a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The anti-amphiphysin autoantibody reacts with 128-kD protein in synaptic vesicles \\[ 8 \\]. They are usually seen in both serum and CSF in a subset of patients with stiff-person syndrome (SPS), breast cancer, and SCLC \\[ 9 \\]. Around 90% of SPS patients with amphiphysin antibody have been found to have breast cancer during their illness \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【27】There has been no published report on the association between the presence of amphiphysin antibodies in breast cancer and bilateral facial nerve palsy. The diagnosis of bilateral facial nerve palsy is itself a rare entity. It is unlikely to be idiopathic in nature and usually reflects an underlying pathology. The potential causes include bilateral acoustic neuroma, Lyme disease, Guillain–Barre syndrome, syphilis, HIV, sarcoidosis, or a tumor, among others \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\].\n\n【28】Our case highlights an unusual presentation of bilateral facial nerve palsy and a diagnostic dilemma. The potential causes may be either PNS or drug-induced nerve palsy with nab-paclitaxel. The presence of amphiphysin antibody in her blood and CSF despite four cycles of IVIG and a modest response to treatment led us to believe the underlying process to be due to paraneoplastic syndrome. However, the indolent nature and stable state of her breast cancer does not support PNS, as it usually behaves aggressively.\n\n【29】Alternatively, nab-paclitaxel can commonly cause sensory peripheral neuropathy and motor neuropathy \\[ 16 \\]. One important risk factor for this is high dosing and frequency of treatment. A case report previously described a case of bilateral facial nerve palsy in metastatic breast cancer following one cycle of high-dose paclitaxel (825 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), which eventually resolved after 23 months \\[ 17 \\]. Another case described a case of unilateral facial nerve palsy following nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), which improved after 9 months \\[ 18 \\]. Though drug-induced facial nerve palsy is a possible cause for our patient’s presentation, her facial nerve palsy has not significantly improved since cessation of nab-paclitaxel. Moreover, it does not explain the presence of amphiphysin antibody in our case.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【31】Identifying the cause of PNS can sometimes be challenging. Our approach to the case was to stop nab-paclitaxel because of the possibility of its being a direct cause of bilateral facial nerve palsy and switch to endocrine therapy as well as treat the underlying PNS with IVIG and high-dose methyl prednisolone. Currently, there are no guidelines for the management of PNS; however, the principle of treatment suggests treating the underlying tumor with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy \\[ 3 \\]. Other modalities of treatment include immunotherapy with high-dose methyl prednisolone or IVIG.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Please contact author for data requests\n\n【34】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【35】CSF:\n\n【36】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【37】CT:\n\n【38】Computerized tomography\n\n【39】HIV:\n\n【40】Human immunodeficiency virus\n\n【41】IVIG:\n\n【42】Intravenous immunoglobulins\n\n【43】MRI:\n\n【44】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【45】PNS:\n\n【46】Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome\n\n【47】SCLC:\n\n【48】Small-cell lung cancer\n\n【49】SPS:\n\n【50】Stiff-person syndrome", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Balloon angioplasty and stenting are considered to be effective options to deal with the plug dislodgement of an EXOSEAL vascular closure device. We must be prepared for every rare complication during endovascular treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】In the contemporary era of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the use of vascular closure devices (VCDs) has become the standard method for achieving rapid hemostasis at the puncture site of the common femoral artery (CFA). Among them, the EXOSEAL (Cordis, NJ, USA) VCD can deliver a bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid plug to fill the subcutaneous puncture route at the groin. The EXOSEAL VCD is more advantageous than other VCDs because it leaves nothing behind inside the vessel, which reduces the risks of anchor-related luminal narrowing, occlusion, and distal embolisms. However, we encountered a case of acute popliteal artery (POP-A) occlusion associated with EXOSEAL VCD. We performed successful bailout stenting and confirmed that the postoperative course was uneventful in an 18-month follow-up study. We also reviewed the literature to discuss this rare complication caused by EXOSEAL VCD.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 83-year-old Japanese man underwent PCI for a proximal stenosis in his left circumflex artery through a 7-Fr sheath from his right CFA. We used an EXOSEAL VCD for hemostasis after we confirmed no calcification at the puncture site of the CFA. We performed the plug implantation according to the manufacturer’s instructions without any complications. However, we could not achieve complete hemostasis just with this procedure. Therefore, we added manual compression for 10 minutes in total, and we finally completed hemostasis. The next day, he complained of short distance intermittent claudication.\n\n【12】His past medical history was significant for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and silent myocardial ischemia. His regular medications were dual-antiplatelet therapy of aspirin (100 mg) + prasugrel (3.75 mg), and an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, 2.5 mg twice daily). There was no family history. He was a farmer. He did not smoke tobacco and he was a social drinker. His physical examination revealed an absence of a right popliteal pulse. His right lower extremity was pallid and perishing cold without ulceration. There was no motor and sensory loss. His blood pressure was 170/75 mmHg, pulse rate was 70 beats/minute, oxygen saturation was 98%, and body temperature was 36.5 °C. The laboratory examination findings were as follows: serum creatinine 1.28 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 1236 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 45 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 25 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 229 U/L, C-reactive protein 0.7 mg/dL, white blood cell count 4.63 × 103/μL, red blood cell count 11.6 × 106/μL, and platelet count 176 × 103/μL. His blood culture was negative.\n\n【13】A chest X-ray demonstrated no abnormal findings. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm and complete left bundle branch block. On echocardiography, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 42% and diffuse motion abnormality in his left ventricle was observed. His ankle-brachial pressure index could not be measured on his right leg. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated no stenosis or occlusion in the visible area of his right CFA and superficial femoral artery (SFA). However, in his right POP-A, the acceleration time was prolonged up to 125 msec, and the blood flow pattern was monophasic. Therefore, severe stenosis or occlusion in the distal SFA was suspected, and we performed an emergency angiography.\n\n【14】The angiography showed no significant stenosis from the right common iliac artery to the CFA. However, a subtotal occlusion at the proximal site of POP-A was observed, and we moved on to endovascular treatment (EVT) using a 6-Fr guiding sheath via his left CFA. First, we pressed his POP-A by a cuff at 200 mmHg for the purpose of avoiding a distal embolization due to further treatment. We performed manual aspiration using a 6-Fr guiding catheter, but no embolus was aspirated and we could not recanalize the artery. Next, we passed a 0.014-inch guidewire with the support of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS imaging demonstrated a smooth-surfaced high-density homogenous structure that was suspected to be polyglycolic acid fiber plug material of the EXOSEAL VCD (Fig. 1 ). We tried embolectomy by pulling an ordinary 5.0 × 20-mm inflated balloon catheter back from the POP-A into the 6-Fr guiding catheter in the SFA, similar to using a Fogarty balloon catheter. However, the embolus was too large to be collected into the 6-Fr guiding catheter. Therefore, we decided to seal the material on the arterial wall with a stent. To avoid stenting the POP-A, we pulled the embolus up to the proximal SFA and compressed it on the arterial wall by 5.0 × 20-mm balloon catheter inflation for 30 seconds (Fig. 2 ). We confirmed that the embolus was attached to the arterial wall of the proximal SFA by angiography and IVUS. Then, we deployed a 7.0 × 60-mm self-expandable nitinol SMART (Cordis, CA, USA) stent to seal the embolus (Fig. 3 ). Final angiography demonstrated a favorable blood flow in our patient’s right lower extremity (Fig. 4 ). After the procedure, the value of his ankle-brachial index (ABI) was normalized and his symptoms completely disappeared. Angiography conducted 11 months postoperatively demonstrated no significant restenosis in the stent of his right CFA. Doppler ultrasound performed 18 months postoperatively showed no stenosis or occlusion in his right CFA and SFA. His postoperative course was uneventful in an 18-month follow-up study.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**a** The angiography showed subtotal occlusion (arrow) at the proximal popliteal artery. **b** Intravascular ultrasound image demonstrated a smooth-surfaced high-density homogenous structure (arrow) which was suspected as a polyglycolic acid fiber plug material of the EXOSEAL vascular closure device\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】We pulled the embolus (arrows) up to the proximal superficial femoral artery, similar to using a Fogarty balloon catheter, and compressed it on the arterial wall by 5.0 × 20-mm balloon catheter inflation\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】**a** We confirmed the embolus (arrows) was attached to the proximal superficial femoral artery by angiography and intravascular ultrasound. **b** We implanted a 7.0 × 60-mm self-expandable nitinol stent to seal the embolus (square bracket)\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】**a** Final angiography demonstrated a favorable blood flow in the right lower extremity. **b** There was no radiolucent mass in the proximal superficial femoral artery where the embolus was sealed with a self-expandable stent\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【29】We encountered a case of acute POP-A occlusion associated with EXOSEAL VCD, and performed successful bailout stenting after pulling the embolus with an inflated balloon catheter up to the SFA from the POP-A. Acute limb ischemia (ALI) caused by EXOSEAL VCD is a very rare complication. In addition, no effective bailout procedure has been established. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful bailout EVT for such a complication.\n\n【30】The use of VCDs has now become part of the standard method for achieving rapid hemostasis at the puncture site of CFA. VCDs have considerable potential for reducing procedure time, length of hospital stay, and duration of restricted ambulation. To date, several VCDs employing different mechanisms for hemostasis have become available. The safety and efficacy of these VCDs have been confirmed for retrograde access usage in several studies \\[ 1 \\]. However, they sometimes cause rare complications such as luminal stenosis, occlusion, or peripheral embolism. VCD-induced lower limb ischemia has been reported infrequently, and was only encountered in 0.3% of patients in a recent meta-analysis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【31】The EXOSEAL VCD adopts a completely absorbable polyglycolic acid plug. The absorbable plug is fully enclosed in the distal portion of the delivery shaft. The plug applicator positions and deploys the absorbable plug to the extravascular surface of the arterial access site through the existing sheath without the need for a sheath exchange before device deployment. The device has two safety mechanisms to prevent intravascular deployment of the plug. The first one is a capillary bleed backflow visual indicator. While the plug is still inside the vessel or within the vessel wall, the backflow of the blood can be observed. The second one is an indicator wire at the tip of the device. Only when the indicator wire is stretched by the vascular wall, can the deployment button be pushed. Unlike other VCDs, the EXOSEAL VCD does not leave any foreign bodies, such as an anchor, nitinol clip, or sutures, inside the vessel owing to these two safety mechanisms. Therefore, the EXOSEAL VCD exhibits relatively lower risks of anchor-related luminal narrowing, occlusion, and distal embolisms than other VCDs.\n\n【32】The 2009 ECLIPSE trial reported by Wong _et al._ remains the only available randomized trial that evaluated the EXOSEAL VCD system regarding patient safety and successful hemostasis \\[ 3 \\]. In this study, no major complications were observed (0/267 cases). Kamusella _et al._ reported a case of device related stenosis (0.1%) among 1000 patients in whom the EXOSEAL VCD was used. The stenosis was detected by the partially intravascular position of the plug, but hemodynamically significant stenosis was not evident \\[ 4 \\]. As described above, complications of arterial occlusion induced by EXOSEAL VCD are thought to be very rare. To the best of our knowledge, only three cases have been reported to date. Maxien _et al_ . reported a case of ALI caused by an EXOSEAL VCD. They performed endovascular repair by balloon angioplasty and stenting \\[ 5 \\]. Takasawa _et al_ . reported two cases of femoral artery occlusion after using this device. Both cases underwent surgical repair \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【33】The causes of acute artery occlusion associated with the EXOSEAL VCD are considered as follows. First, if an operator pushes the EXOSEAL VCD system itself toward the body while simultaneously pushing the deployment button, the plug may be released into the vascular lumen. Second, when the indicator wire at the tip of the EXOSEAL VCD gets stuck in a stent or vascular atherosclerotic calcifications before the indicator wire reaches the vascular wall, the visual indicator changes its color from white to black. In this case, although blood backflow is still observed, there is a risk of the operator pushing the deployment button based on the indicator marker. Third, if an additional manual compression at the puncture site after deployment of the EXOSEAL VCD is too strong, the plug may partially or wholly fall into the vessel.\n\n【34】In our case, we confirmed the absence of atherosclerotic lesions in the CFA. We pushed the deployment button after confirming the visual indicator while tightly fixing the EXOSEAL VCD system to not move at all. Through this procedure, we most likely did not leave the plug in the vessel at the time of deployment. However, we added relatively strong compression on the puncture site for 10 minutes in total because we could not achieve complete hemostasis just with initial deployment of the plug. This extra manual compression may have caused the plug to dislodge partially or wholly from the right position into the vascular lumen. We consider that manual compression after EXOSEAL VCD use should be as gentle as possible, but enough to complete hemostasis.\n\n【35】When ALI is induced by plug dislodgement of EXOSEAL VCD, EVT is considered an effective option. Aspirating the plug through a guiding catheter seems impossible because the plug becomes too large in the vessel to be collected into the guiding catheter. Grasping the embolus by biopsy forceps risks breaking the embolus into small pieces and distally scattering them. The plug swelling in the blood is relatively soft and cylindrical, thus, we consider the stenting method to seal the plug material to be an effective and minimally invasive resolution. It is desirable to use a self-expandable stent because the plug material is completely absorbed in the body by 90 days after implantation, by which time enough expansion of the stent is expected after the plug vanishes. When the plug is located in a non-stenting zone, like our case, we have to move the embolus to be sealed by a stent to the appropriate location. At the same time, it is important that we press the POP-A from the outside and block the blood flow to lower extremities to prevent distal embolization.\n\n【36】Here we demonstrated a successful bailout procedure for acute POP-A occlusion associated with EXOSEAL VCD. Although the rate of ALI caused by EXOSEAL VCD is not higher than other VCDs, we always have to prepare for every rare complication during EVT. Balloon angioplasty and stenting are considered to be effective options to deal with dislodging of the EXOSEAL VCD plug.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】ALI:\n\n【39】Acute limb ischemia\n\n【40】CFA:\n\n【41】Common femoral artery\n\n【42】EVT:\n\n【43】Endovascular treatment\n\n【44】IVUS:\n\n【45】Intravascular ultrasound\n\n【46】PCI:\n\n【47】Percutaneous coronary intervention\n\n【48】POP-A:\n\n【49】Popliteal artery\n\n【50】SFA:\n\n【51】Superficial femoral artery\n\n【52】VCD:\n\n【53】vascular closure device", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, given the broad differential diagnosis of transient loss of consciousness, it can be challenging to determine the exact etiology.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This case presents a 42-year-old Caucasian female patient with recurrent transient loss of consciousness due to a hitherto undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism. The patient had been thoroughly tested for all typical causes of syncope without finding any causal explanation. An oral glucose tolerance test confirmed rapidly dropping blood glucose levels associated with rapidly fading consciousness as the underlying cause of transient loss of consciousness. Further diagnostic workup revealed that the patient suffered from impaired glucose tolerance and subsequent hyperinsulinism without overt diabetes mellitus. Nutritional counseling including reduction of glucose intake and frequently eating smaller meal portions led to a significant reduction in the frequency of transient loss of consciousness and overall improvement in quality of life.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on syncope does not list hypoglycemia as a cause of transient loss of consciousness. However, this case report stresses that metabolic dysregulation can indeed lead to self-limited transient loss of consciousness. Thus, in the case of recurrent syncope with an unclear underlying mechanism, physicians should consider transient hypoglycemia and metabolic workup as a possible differential diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is a state of real or apparent loss of consciousness with loss of awareness, amnesia for the period of unconsciousness, abnormal motor control, loss of responsiveness, and short duration \\[ 1 \\]. TLOC can be grouped into TLOC due to head trauma and nontraumatic TLOC, which includes epileptic seizures, psychogenic causes, and rare causes (for example subclavian steal syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage), and syncope \\[ 1 \\]. Syncopes are defined as self-limited TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion \\[ 1 \\]. Syncopes represent a highly relevant disorder due to their high lifetime prevalence and deleterious effect on quality of life \\[ 1 \\]. Finding and effectively treating the underlying cause of syncopes or TLOC can be challenging due to the many shared clinical features with other disorders. The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on syncope presents a thorough differential diagnosis paired with etiological explanations \\[ 1 \\]. However, metabolic disorders are only acknowledged as causing persistent and not self-limiting loss of consciousness. In this case, we present a 42-year-old female patient who suffered from recurrent TLOC labeled as syncopes. Despite extensive workup, no cardiac cause could be determined. In contrast, reactive hyperinsulinism was found to cause real TLOC.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The 42-year-old Caucasian female patient was hospitalized for further evaluation because frequent TLOC in recent weeks had resulted in drastically reduced quality of life and potentially harmful incidents. TLOC had started appearing 11 months earlier (see “Timeline”), right after she had been hospitalized for a herpes zoster oticus infection with involvement of the vestibular nerve. Ten months earlier, she had experienced three symptomatic hypertensive emergencies with headaches and impaired vision. She had been prescribed 2.5 mg bisoprolol daily; however, compliance was poor, as she reported significant fatigue as a side effect. The patient reported recurrent TLOC especially during light exercise such as walking. In some instances, prodromes such as dizziness and sweating preceded TLOC; other times they occurred suddenly, leading to falls including serious injury. Dyspnea or angina pectoris-like symptoms were not present.\n\n【12】During presentation, we initially took a detailed history and were able to establish that she indeed suffered from TLOC during these episodes. She also reported long-lasting psychosocial distress as she and her partner had been suffering from unintended childlessness. This had fortunately been resolved when they adopted a child 13 months ago.\n\n【13】The physical examination did not show any abnormalities. Height was 174 cm, weight 64 kg, body mass index (BMI) 21.1 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Heart rate was regular and palpable symmetrically in all extremities (67 beats per minute), and blood pressure was 130/75 mmHg, with no heart murmurs, normal auscultation of the lungs, and no peripheral edema. The abdominal examination revealed no masses and no tenderness.\n\n【14】Recommended basal evaluation of syncopes and TLOC including history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure measurements, and orthostatic testing did not yield any pathological findings.\n\n【15】We focused on further evaluating a potential cardiac cause of TLOC. A treadmill cardiac stress test showed normal physical fitness, no arrhythmias, normal blood pressure and heart rate response, and the absence of relevant ST changes. A 24-hour Holter ECG revealed no pathological findings. To account for rare causes of syncopes, Brugada syndrome was ruled out by performing an ajmaline test. Echocardiography showed normal ejection fraction and no valvular dysfunction or other structural disease. No hint of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy could be detected in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Urinary levels of catecholamines and their metabolites were normal.\n\n【16】Upon repeated history-taking about preceding situations and potential triggers, we could elaborate on an association with the intake of carbohydrate-rich foods. The patient reported that the TLOC followed carbohydrate-rich meals by approximately 1–2 hours. She had already intuitively changed her diet by abstaining from carbohydrate-rich meals. To evaluate the association with meals, we performed an oral glucose tolerance test. One hundred and eighty minutes after ingestion of 75 g of glucose, the serum glucose level dropped to 39 mg/dL (see Fig. 1 ), which induced the same aura symptoms that were familiar to the patient from her previous TLOC with dizziness and rapidly fading consciousness. To prevent complete loss of consciousness, glucose was injected intravenously. Taken together, this provocation test and the detailed medical history proved the hypoglycemic etiology. We therefore established the diagnosis of a pathological glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism resulting in hypoglycemia and TLOC.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】Values of serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide during the oral glucose tolerance test after ingestion of 75 g glucose. Arrow indicates onset of symptoms of presyncope and administration of intravenous glucose to prevent loss of consciousness.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a normal pancreas. A 72-hour-fasting glucose test had been performed and insulinoma had been ruled out. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were normal. Cortisol showed normal levels in serial testing throughout the day. There was no hint of adrenal insufficiency, with normal morning cortisol of 16.2 µg/dL. No insulin antibodies were measurable. Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) is a very rare disease causing postprandial hypoglycemia. Testing includes stimulation of pancreatic β-cells by invasive calcium administration, \\[ 2 \\] which was not performed in our patient. Given the relief of symptoms after lifestyle and dietary changes, further invasive testing to distinguish prediabetes from NIPHS was not performed. We recommended primarily dietary changes including frequent small meals to reduce the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes and avoidance of carbohydrate-rich meals as treatment. We discontinued the β-blocker therapy to avoid interference with glycogenolysis. If symptoms persisted, an off-label metformin therapy for the treatment of her pathological glucose resistance or a treatment test with acarbose, which delays hydrolysis of ingested complex carbohydrates and reduces postprandial glucose and insulin peaks, was suggested. At a follow-up consultation 3 months later, the patient reported no further TLOC after the suggested dietary changes, which led to a markedly improved quality of life.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Determining the cause of syncopes and TLOC can be challenging given the broad differential diagnosis. However, identification of the underlying mechanism is crucial to provide optimal treatment and thereby reduce the rate of hospitalization to improve quality of life \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Lifetime prevalence of at least one syncope reaches almost 50% \\[ 1 \\]. The most common cause of syncopes is reflex syncope, causing about 20% of all syncopes, followed by cardiac and orthostatic syncopes, each accounting for about 10% of all syncopes \\[ 3 \\]. However, in more than one third of all patients, no clear etiology can be identified \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. The current ESC guidelines list metabolic disorders including hypoglycemia as a possible false diagnosis for syncope, stating that metabolic changes produce impairment of consciousness instead of loss thereof and produce a much longer duration than the typically short TLOC in syncope \\[ 3 \\]. Contrary to this statement, we hereby report that hypoglycemia can indeed lead to a short, self-limiting loss of consciousness, hence perfectly imitating a syncope.\n\n【23】In this case, the differential diagnosis was complicated as the patient was suffering from various different conditions that may also cause TLOC, dizziness, or vertigo (for a summary of differential diagnosis and rule-out criteria in this patient, see Table 1 ). These include herpes zoster infection with involvement of the vestibular nerve \\[ 6 \\], psychogenic non-epileptic seizures \\[ 7 \\], hypertensive emergencies \\[ 8 \\], and histamine intolerance \\[ 9 \\]. Cardiac syncopes represent a common etiology of TLOC and can be caused by potentially life-threatening pathologies \\[ 3 \\]. Intensive electrophysiological and imaging studies to reveal structural diseases could rule out a cardiac cause for the syncopes.\n\n【24】**Table 1 Differential diagnoses in our patient showing possible symptoms of the different pathologies that can cause or mimic transient loss of consciousness or syncopes**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】Loss of consciousness due to hypoglycemia occurs almost exclusively in older, long-term diabetic patients, especially in combination with antidiabetic medication such as sulfonylurea or insulin \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Despite still being under debate, reactive hypoglycemia after ingestion of especially carbohydrate-rich food due to increased peripheral insulin resistance and disturbed insulin secretion has been suggested in prediabetes \\[ 13 , 14 \\]. In conclusion, given its high prevalence, prediabetes and subsequent dysregulation of insulin secretion causing transient hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of the TLOC in our patient. As TLOC sometimes occurred suddenly without any prior aura, the use of a device for continuous real-time glucose monitoring could be advised to further improve quality of life by preventing harmful accidents.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】In summary, the case of this 42-year-old female patient shows the complexity and difficulties of the workup in patients presenting with recurrent syncope. Hypoglycemic episodes in the absence of manifest diabetes can be a rare differential diagnosis for syncopes and should be considered in patients without conclusive workup. Hypoglycemia usually produces prolonged loss of consciousness. To our knowledge, this is the first case describing transient, self-limiting hypoglycemia as a cause for TLOC. This case stresses the importance of thorough history-taking and metabolic workup in patients presenting with syncopes or TLOC.\n\n【29】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【30】Not applicable.\n\n【31】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【32】ECG:\n\n【33】Electrocardiogram\n\n【34】MRI:\n\n【35】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【36】NIPHS:\n\n【37】Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome\n\n【38】TLOC:\n\n【39】Transient loss of consciousness", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is characterized by congenital profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, a long QT interval, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and episodes of _torsade de pointes_ on an electrocardiogram. Cardiac symptoms arise mostly in early childhood and consist of syncopal episodes during periods of stress, exercise, or fright and are associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death.

In addition, this finding contributes to our understanding of genetic disease in the Moroccan population.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) 220400, is a rare autosomal recessive cardioauditory ion channel disorder that affects 1/200,000 to 1/1,000,000 children \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. It is characterized by congenital profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), a long QT interval usually greater than 500 ms, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and episodes of _torsade de pointes_ on an electrocardiogram (ECG) \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. Cardiac symptoms mostly arise in early childhood and consist of syncopal episodes during periods of stress, exercise, or fright with a high risk of sudden cardiac death \\[ 2 \\]. Homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in _KCNQ1_ on 11p15.5 are responsible for 90% of cases of JLNS \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. Biallelic mutations in _KCNE1_ on 1q22.1-q22.2 have been identified as an additional cause of JLNS, establishing the genetic heterogeneity of the disease \\[ 6 \\]. The two genes encode respectively the α subunits and β subunits of the voltage-gated potassium channel that in the heart conducts the slow delayed rectifying potassium ion (K <sup>+ </sup> ) current during cardiomyocyte repolarization, while in the ear it is involved in potassium-rich endolymph production of inner ear hair cells \\[ 5 , 7 \\]. Here we report the clinical and molecular analysis of a Moroccan family affected by JLNS.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 10-year-old Moroccan boy was referred by his cardiologist to our medical genetics department (Institut National d’Hygiène, Rabat) for genetic evaluation. He is the firstborn of a healthy consanguineous couple (first-cousins; Fig. 1 ), both originating from the Northwest of Morocco. There was no family history of sudden death, deafness, syncope, epilepsy, or any other genetic disease. The pregnancy had been medically followed, and no complications were reported. His mother presented with no history of drug ingestion or phytotherapy. His birth weight and length were within normal range and no dysmorphic signs were recorded. At 6 months, he was diagnosed as having severe bilateral SNHL on auditory evoked potential measurement. His first syncopal episode occurred at 24 months of age. His ECG revealed a markedly prolonged QTc interval of 530 ms (corrected by Bazett’s formula) and T-wave alternans on V1 to V4 (Fig. 2 ). Echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart. Treatment was immediately started with a β-adrenergic blocker. His parents and his two younger brothers, who were 7-years old and 1-year old, were clinically normal. Blood samples from all his family’s members were collected after we were given written informed consent. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated using standard techniques \\[ 8 \\]. Molecular genetic testing of the entire coding region and flanking intronic regions of _KCNQ1_ and _KCNE1_ was undertaken by Sanger sequence analysis (details available on request). This led to the identification of a homozygous frameshift mutation c.1343dupC (p.Glu449Argfs\\*14) in the index patient. Both parents and one sibling (IV-2) were heterozygous for this mutation. The youngest child of the family did not carry the frameshift mutation (IV-3, Fig. 3 ). This variant was previously reported in a heterozygous state in an individual with long QT syndrome (LQTS) \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Pedigree of the studied family.

The _arrows_ indicate the location of the mutated base\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】The primary electric disorders, which among others include LQTS, short-QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), are often characterized by specific ECG abnormalities either at baseline or during particular conditions, such as exercise (for example, CPVT and LQTS), fever (for example, BrS), or pharmacological challenge (for example, BrS). The list of familial arrhythmia syndromes has been in recent years expanded by the recognition of two other disorders, namely early repolarization syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【26】LQTS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Syncopal episodes may occur from infancy through middle age, with risk of sudden death \\[ 10 \\]. The autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is typical for all LQTS forms (previously described as the Romano–Ward syndrome). Three genes account for approximately 90% of patients with genotype-positive LQTS. LQT1 is characterized by broad-based T waves and cardiac events during exercise or emotion. It arises from loss-of-function mutations in _KCNQ1._ In LQT2, T waves are bifid and cardiac events predominantly occur during exercise or emotion. It arises from loss-of-function mutations in _KCNH2_ (also known as _hERG_ ). Gain-of-function mutations in _SCN5A_ are associated to LQT3. These patients show a long ST segment, short T waves, and experience cardiac events predominantly during rest or sleep. Twelve additional genes encoding either ion channel subunits ( _KCNJ5_ , _KCNE1_ , _KCNE2_ , and _SCN4B_ ) or proteins that regulate ion channel function ( _AKAP9_ , _CAV3_ , _ANKB_ , _SNT1_ , _CALM1_ , and _CALM2_ ) have been associated with LQTS; however, most of them are only rarely implicated (<1%) \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【27】Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is a rare clinical variant of LQTS that manifests with extracardiac phenotypes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Patients with JLNS present with severe prolongation of the QT interval and congenital SNHL. It is one of the most severe forms of LQTS. By the age of 3 years, 50% of patients have had an event and by the age of 18 years, 90% of patients with JLNS have developed symptoms \\[ 2 \\]. Therefore, the real incidence of JLNS is probably underestimated because of its high mortality in early infancy, in particular in populations with a high rate of consanguineous marriages like Morocco \\[ 11 \\]. In addition, even in the presence of medical therapy the occurrence of sudden cardiac death in JLNS exceeds 25% \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【28】To date, approximately 21 distinct _KCNQ1_ mutations have been characterized in patients with JLNS according to The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) at the Institute of Medical Genetics in Cardiff (HGMD, http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php ). Three different mutations in the _KCNE1_ gene were also reported in patients with JLNS. These mutations have been found homozygously or in a compound heterozygous state (Fig. 4 ) and, interestingly, one of the families studied in the initial description of _KCNE1_ in JLNS originated from Morocco \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【29】**Fig. 4**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Schematic view of _KCNQ1_ gene structure and localization of identified _KCNQ1_ mutations in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.

Identifying a case of leptospirosis in Switzerland is uncommon. Although kidney complications are frequent in severe forms, including tubular dysfunction, observing this complication is rare in our country. We report the case of a patient with leptospirosis and kidney dysfunction, which was notable for proximal tubulopathy. This case report describes the diagnosis and management of this patient’s tubular dysfunction.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 34-year-old Caucasian male known for alcohol and drug abuse presented to our emergency department suffering from severe pain in the lower limbs, jaundice, and fever with flu-like symptoms. Physical examination was not contributory. Blood tests showed cytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, acute kidney injury, and altered liver function tests with predominant cholestasis. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and significant glycosuria without concomitant hyperglycemia. Leptospirosis was suspected and confirmed by both positive serum polymerase chain reaction and elevated immunoglobulin M for _Leptospira interrogans_ . The patient was treated with intravenous amoxicillin–clavulanate and doxycycline for 7 days. After antibiotic treatment, symptoms disappeared, and kidney dysfunction completely resolved.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Our case focuses on the description of leptospirosis-related acute kidney injury with proximal tubular dysfunction, which is a rare finding in Switzerland.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_ . It is transmitted to humans through water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected mammals, most commonly rodents. Contamination occurs by inhalation or ingestion, or through a breach in the skin. Symptoms vary from mild illness with self-limited fever to life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction \\[ 1 \\]. Antibiotic therapy with beta-lactams, doxycycline, or macrolides is the mainstay of treatment \\[ 2 \\]. In Switzerland, infections mostly occur during summer and fall, probably because the climate favors spirochete growth, and aquatic activities in rivers or lakes increase during the warm season \\[ 3 \\]. In Switzerland, 2–13 cases were reported yearly between 1988 and 1996, corresponding to the last year of mandatory reporting for human infections \\[ 4 \\]. According to the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, mortality rate is about 20% for severe forms \\[ 5 \\], referred to as Weil’s disease, which occurs in 5–10% of patients. Clinical manifestations include jaundice, thrombocytopenia, respiratory symptoms, myocarditis, conjunctival suffusion, and kidney impairment \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【10】Kidney complications include acute kidney injury (44–67% of patients \\[ 7 \\]), commonly due to tubulointerstitial nephritis, and tubular dysfunction. The latter has been associated with hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and metabolic acidosis, mimicking Fanconi syndrome \\[ 8 , 9 \\], which represents impaired reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the nephron, resulting in loss of bicarbonate, glucose, phosphate, uric acid, and amino acids \\[ 10 \\]. We report herein a case of acute kidney injury with partial Fanconi syndrome in a leptospirosis-infected patient.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 34-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department complaining of a 4-day history of unbearable leg pain with diffuse arthralgia, fluctuating low-grade fever with profuse sweating, vomiting and diarrhea without abdominal pain, odynophagia, dry cough, headaches, and fatigue. He denied any contact with animals or travel abroad, had not consumed unpasteurized food, and had his last unprotected sexual intercourse 4 months earlier.\n\n【13】He was taking no medications and was known for alcohol abuse (mainly beer and spirit, approximately 185 alcohol units/week), drug abuse (cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis, methylphenidate, clonazepam, lorazepam), and smoking tobacco. On physical examination, he was afebrile and hypotensive (blood pressure 94/50 mmHg) with a normal heart rate (77 beats/minute). Oral examination revealed dry mucosa and erythematous tonsils without exudate, cardiopulmonary examination was normal, abdominal palpation was unremarkable, and no cutaneous rash was noted. Testing of the lower limbs revealed preserved strength and sensitivity as well as symmetric deep tendon reflexes.\n\n【14】Laboratory findings showed normocytic, normochromic, hypoproliferative anemia (hemoglobin 99 g/l, normal range 140–180 g/l) with thrombocytopenia (24 G/l, normal range 150–350 G/l), left shift without leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (213 mg/l, normal range < 10 mg/l), elevated transaminases (three times the upper limit of normal) with cholestasis and elevated conjugated bilirubin (29 µmol/l on admission, 190 µmol/l on hospital day 8, normal range 0.5–9.5 µmol/l). There was a stage 3 acute kidney injury according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria with a serum creatinine of 112 µmol/l on admission and 247 µmol/l on hospital day 3 (patient’s baseline value 70 µmol/l), a serum urea of 11.4 mmol/l on admission (12 mmol/l on hospital day 3), and preserved urine output. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (spot urine: protein 1.4 g/l, creatinine 11.5 mmol/l, urine protein–creatinine ratio 1.076 g/g), albuminuria (2+ on semiquantitative analysis), presence of 97 M/l leukocytes, 25 M/l erythrocytes, and renal tubular cells (1+ on semiquantitative analysis). Sodium excretion was high (fractional excretion of sodium on spot urine 3.56%). Due to the context of sepsis, hypovolemic status of the patient, and urinalysis findings, acute tubular necrosis was the suspected mechanism of acute kidney injury.\n\n【15】Analysis of serum electrolytes showed mild hyperphosphatemia (1.53 mmol/l, normal range 0.80–1.45 mmol/l), hyponatremia (131 mmol/l, normal range 136–144 mmol/l), mild hypouricemia (246 µmol/l, normal range 286–518 µmol/l), low serum chloride (94 mmol/l, normal range 98–106 mmol/l), hypokalemia (2.8 mmol/l, normal range 3.6–4.6 mmol/l), and an anion gap of 10 mmol/l. The transtubular potassium gradient was elevated (16.4). Albumin level was 29 g/l (normal range 35–48 g/l), and creatinine kinase level was 312 U/l on admission, rising to 404 U/l the next day and normalizing on hospital day 4. Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.49 (normal range 7.35–7.45) with elevated bicarbonates (29.3 mmol/l, normal range 22–26 mmol/l) and normal pCO <sub>2 </sub> (5.25 kPa, normal range 4.7–6.4 kPa). Urine pH was 6 (normal range 5–6.5). Presence of glycosuria (7 mmol/l, normal range 0.1–0.9 mmol/l), with concomitant euglycemia (6.6 mmol/l, normal range 4.1–11 mmol/l) and a hemoglobin A1c of 5.1% was highly suspicious of proximal tubular dysfunction.\n\n【16】Upon admission, Streptococcus A rapid test was negative, chest radiograph was normal, and an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly, a heterogeneous parenchyma with hyperechogenicity around periportal spaces and lymph nodes, liver parenchymal arterialization, and a layer of perihepatic fluid, all consistent with hepatitis. The bile ducts were not dilated. Kidneys were of normal size and morphology, without any urinary tract dilatation. On the second day after admission, the patient developed drowsiness and confusion with high fever (exceeding 40 °C). Normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture excluded central nervous system infection. Clinical features were suggestive of bacterial sepsis \\[sequential organ failure assessment \\[SOFA\\] score of 10\\], justifying empiric broad spectrum antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral clarithromycin.\n\n【17】Detailed history revealed that the patient swam in a river in the Geneva lake area 1 week before hospital admission, raising the diagnostic suspicion of leptospirosis in this clinical setting. Serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for _Leptospira interrogans_ was positive, and specific serologies revealed elevated IgM levels (> 100 U/ml, normal range < 15 U/ml). Although IgG levels were below the positive threshold, the values increased from < 2 U/ml initially to 6 U/ml 1 week later (normal range < 10 U/ml). Unfortunately, no ulterior dosage was performed. Antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous amoxicillin–clavulanate and doxycycline for 7 days with clinical improvement. Serology for hantavirus was performed, revealing an indeterminate result due to nonspecific reactions. Considering the positive results for _Leptospira interrogans_ , additional tests for hantavirus were not performed.\n\n【18】Along with clinical improvement, kidney function recovered with creatinine normalizing to 87 μmol/l on the sixth hospital day, and all electrolyte abnormalities resolved. Liver tests also normalized as confirmed by a routine blood sample 1 year after discharge. In addition, glycosuria significantly decreased from 7 to 0.5 mmol/l on the 12th day of hospital stay.\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【21】We report the case of a patient with leptospirosis who developed acute kidney injury and partial Fanconi syndrome diagnosed on the basis of euglycemic glycosuria. The patient also had proteinuria, although its tubular origin cannot be definitely proven in the absence of a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. There was no evidence of proximal renal tubular acidosis. The patient also had mild hyperphosphatemia, but this could be attributed to severe acute kidney injury. Concerning hypokalemia with an increased transtubular gradient, it is most likely explained by an elevated aldosterone level in the context of sepsis and hypovolemia.\n\n【22】The alkalosis observed is unusual in the setting of proximal tubulopathy and acute kidney injury. Considering the context of hypovolemia and sepsis, without hypocapnia, contraction alkalosis is an explanation. Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis may also have been caused by the vomiting.\n\n【23】In humans, leptospirosis-induced kidney tubular dysfunction is mostly observed in the proximal tubule \\[ 8 \\]. Some reports of proximal tubular dysfunction in leptospirosis-infected patients described hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia, glycosuria, and metabolic acidosis \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\].\n\n【24】Animal models have confirmed that _Leptospira interrogans_ can infect kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells through hematogenous spread. Spirochetes enter cells through the basal membrane and then translocate to the apical membrane where they form a biofilm-like structure enabling them to resist the urinary stream \\[ 15 \\]. Leptospirosis also inhibits expression of electrolytes transporters in nephrons. The outer membrane protein (OMP) of spirochetes inhibits mRNA synthesis of the sodium, potassium, and chloride cotransporter (NKCC2) \\[ 16 \\]. Antibiotic treatment results in an increased activity of the transporters \\[ 17 \\]. Other molecular mechanisms of tubular injury in leptospirosis involve the sodium–hydrogen exchanger type 3 (NHE3) \\[ 17 \\], Toll-like receptor-dependent pathway \\[ 18 \\], and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB) \\[ 19 \\]. A detailed description of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this manuscript.\n\n【25】As glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 and, to a lesser extent, sodium–glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT2, SGLT1) (Fig. 1 A), the euglycemic glycosuria developed by our patient suggests a potential inhibition of SGLT2 and/or SGLT1 by spirochetes (Fig. 1 B).\n\n【26】**Fig. 1**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the nephron ( **A** ) and its impairment in leptospirosis ( **B** ). The mechanism is similar for SGLT1 in the distal segment of the proximal tubule\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Although acute interstitial nephritis is part of the differential diagnosis of tubulopathy, we do not think it is the most likely explanation owing to the clinical presentation, the urine sediment findings (tubular cells), and the absence of white blood cell casts.\n\n【31】Although alcohol and drug abuse are known to induce Fanconi syndrome \\[ 20 \\], our patient was reportedly abstinent during the week prior to hospital admission, and a toxicology screening at the beginning of the hospitalization was only positive for benzodiazepines, which the patient was given in hospital previously to the screening. Moreover, glycosuria resolved after antibiotic treatment, thus favoring our hypothesis that the partial Fanconi syndrome was secondary to leptospirosis rather than substance abuse.\n\n【32】To conclude, the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis are numerous and nonspecific, which possibly leads to misdiagnosis, especially in Switzerland, where this infection is seldom reported. Among the known clinical manifestations, we focused on kidney tubular dysfunction—specifically, impaired proximal reabsorption of glucose. Our case illustrates the occurrence of transient euglycemic glycosuria in the setting of leptospirosis, which resolved after appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n\n【33】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【34】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【35】Change history\n--------------\n\n【36】*   ### 16 August 2021\n    \n    A Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03040-9\n    \n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】PCR:\n\n【39】Polymerase chain reaction\n\n【40】IgM/IgG:\n\n【41】Immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G\n\n【42】KDIGO:\n\n【43】Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes\n\n【44】pCO <sub>2 </sub> :\n\n【45】Partial pressure of carbon dioxide\n\n【46】SOFA:\n\n【47】Sequential organ failure assessment\n\n【48】OMP:\n\n【49】Outer membrane protein\n\n【50】mRNA:\n\n【51】Messenger ribonucleic acid\n\n【52】NKCC2:\n\n【53】Sodium, potassium, and chloride cotransporter\n\n【54】NHE3:\n\n【55】Sodium–hydrogen exchanger type 3\n\n【56】NFkB:\n\n【57】Nuclear factor kappa-B\n\n【58】SGLT1 and 2:\n\n【59】Sodium–glucose cotransporter 1 and 2", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In the advanced stage of the disease, the classical triad of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, and systemic embolization is common. Segments involved are the apex and mid inferior and lateral walls. The right ventricular apex may be affected as well.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 29-year-old Caucasian male was hospitalized with dyspnea and fatigue at minimal exertion during the last months before admission. He also described a history of edema of the legs and abdominal pain in the last weeks. Physical examination revealed dyspnea, pulmonary rales, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with nonspecific repolarization changes. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring identified ventricular tachycardia episodes with right bundle branch block morphology. Transthoracic echocardiography at admission revealed dilated left ventricle with trabeculations located predominantly at the apex but also in the apical and mid portion of lateral and inferior wall; end-systolic ratio of noncompacted to compacted layers > 2; moderate mitral regurgitation; and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Between apical trabeculations, multiple thrombi were found. The right ventricle had normal morphology and function. Speckle-tracking echocardiography also revealed systolic left ventricle dysfunction and solid body rotation. Abdominal echocardiography showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Abdominal computed tomography was suggestive for hepatic and renal infarctions. Laboratory tests revealed high levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and liver enzymes. Cardiac magnetic resonance evaluation at 1 month after discharge confirmed the diagnosis. The patient received anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and heart failure treatment. After 2 months, before device implantation, he presented clinical improvement, and echocardiographic evaluation did not detect thrombi in the left ventricle. Coronary angiography was within normal range. A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted for prevention of sudden cardiac death.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Left ventricular noncompaction is rare cardiomyopathy, but it should always be considered as a possible diagnosis in a patient hospitalized with heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and systemic embolic events. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance are essential imaging tools for diagnosis and follow-up.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is rare congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by a double-layered aspect of the myocardium: a compacted epicardial layer and a noncompacted endocardial layer, with trabeculations and recesses that communicate with the left ventricular (LV) cavity \\[ 1 \\]. Segments involved are the apex and mid inferior and lateral walls. Right ventricular (RV) apex may be involved as well. In some cases, trabeculations are presented in both LVNC and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\n\n【10】The echocardiographic appearance of a patient with LVNC in an advanced stage of the disease might be similar to any cause of DCM \\[ 2 \\]. When LV function is severely decreased, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, and systemic embolization may also be common \\[ 2 \\]. This makes differentiation difficult.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 29-year-old Caucasian male was hospitalized with dyspnea and fatigue at minimal exertion during the last months before admission. He also described a history of edema of the legs and abdominal pain in the previous weeks.\n\n【13】Physical examination revealed a patient with orthopnea, crepitations on the lower pulmonary lobes, upper abdominal pain due to congestive hepatomegaly, and symmetrical edema of both lower extremities. Blood pressure at admission was 100/60 mmHg. Signs of LV enlargement were present with the cardiac impulse displaced in intercostal space VII, lateral to the left midclavicular line. Heart rate was 90 beats/minute, the first and second heart sounds were normal, and S3 and S4 gallop were present. Auscultation identified a grade III/VI systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border. Jugular venous pressure was increased. Abdominal palpation identified congestive hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and also positive abdominal jugular reflux.\n\n【14】Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly (Fig. 1 a).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**a** Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly (arrow). **b** Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG): sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities including T-wave flattening and inversion in the inferior and lateral leads II, III, aVF, V3–V6. **c** 2D Echocardiography: apical four-chamber (A4c) view showing dilated LV, trabeculation of apex, the apical segment of the interventricular septum, medium and apical segments of the lateral wall with two-layer aspect (arrow). **d** 2D Echocardiography: modified apical three-chamber (A3c) view with zoom showing trabeculation of the apex, medial, and apical segments of the inferolateral wall with thrombus between the recesses (arrow). **e** 2D Echocardiography: parasternal short-axis view at the intermediate level, between the papillary muscles and the apex revealing ratio between NC/C layers = 2.1 (arrow). **f** 2D Echocardiography: parasternal short-axis at the papillary muscles level showing dilated LV with posterior displacement of the papillary muscles (arrow)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration, and nonspecific repolarization abnormalities including T-wave flattening and inversion in the inferior and lateral leads II, III, aVF, V3–V6. (Fig. 1 , Panel b).\n\n【20】Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring identified ventricular tachycardia episodes with right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC).\n\n【21】Transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) evaluation was obtained according to Recommendations for Cardiac Chamber Quantification by Echocardiography in Adults of the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging 2015 \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【22】Two-dimensional (2D) TTE examination revealed a dilated and remodeled, spherical LV with morphological changes: a two-layered aspect of the myocardium with trabeculations located predominantly at the apex, but also in the apical and mid portion of the lateral and inferior wall (Fig. 1 c, Additional files 1 , 2 ). Multiple mobile thrombi were present between apical trabeculations (Fig. 1 d, Additional file 3 ). The end-systolic ratio of noncompacted to compacted layer measured in the parasternal short-axis view was 2.1 (Fig. 1 e). Color Doppler displayed flow within the deep intertrabecular recesses. Mitral annulus diameter dimension was 45 mm, the height of coaptation was 1.67 cm, and the tenting area was 6.72 cm <sup>2 </sup> . Short-axis view examination showed papillary muscles posteriorly displaced (Fig. 1 , Panel f). LV presented diffuse hypokinesia accentuated at the level of trabeculated zones, with asynergy of contraction, which was observed on 2D examination and in color M-mode; septal to posterior wall motion delay (SAPWD) was 140 ms (Fig. 2 a). Simpson biplane method revealed an increased left atrium volume index (LAVi) of 44 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**a** Color M-mode; septal to posterior wall motion delay (SAPWD) calculation: 140ms. **b** Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler of mitral diastolic inflow, revealing a restrictive filling Pattern. **c** Color M-mode al the level of the mitral valve with velocity propagation (vp) measurement. **d** 2D tissue Doppler echocardiography with e wave velocity measurement. **e** M-mode echocardiography at the level of lateral tricuspid annulus providing tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】2D Color Doppler echocardiography and continuous Doppler (CW) echocardiography 2D Color Doppler echocardiography and continuous Doppler (CW) echocardiography revealed functional mitral regurgitation due to LV remodeling (Additional file 4 ).\n\n【28】For LV systolic function, many methods were used, trying to differentiate between the LVNC and a DCM with trabeculations in the LV. The biplane Simpson method revealed increased volumes: LV end-diastolic volume (LVDV) 296.6 ml, LV end-systolic volume (LVSV) 221 ml, decreased LVEF: 25%, and cardiac index (CI) 3.06 ml/minute/m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【29】Tissue Doppler echocardiography also showed decreased velocities at the level of septal (7 cm/second) (Fig. 2 d) and lateral (5 cm/second) mitral annulus.\n\n【30】LV diastolic function was evaluated using pulsed wave (PW) Doppler of mitral diastolic inflow, revealing a restrictive filling pattern (Fig. 2 b), color M-mode an E/vp ratio of 3.5 (Fig. 2 c), and tissue Doppler echocardiography an E/e ratio of 15.41 (Fig. 2 d). These measurements revealed an increased LV filling pressure.\n\n【31】On speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) examination, global longitudinal strain (GLS) was decreased (7.43%), as well as LVEF (22%) (Fig. 3 a–c). Twist motion was calculated using the difference in peak rotation between the basal and apical short-axis planes of LV: instantaneous peak LV twist (apical LV peak rotation – basal LV peak rotation). A decreased LV twist of 0.24 was found (Fig. 3 d, e). The RV had normal morphology, dimension, and function; fractional area change (FAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (Fig. 2 e), tissue Doppler velocities at the level of tricuspid annulus, GLS, and RVEF by STE (Fig. 3 f) evaluations were within a normal range.\n\n【32】**Fig. 3**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】**a** 2D Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) A3c view, sowing decreased left ventricle (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). **b** 2D STE A4c view: decreased LV GLS and LVEF. **c** 2D STE A2c view: decreased LV GLS and LVEF. **d** 2D STE: peak radial strain at the LV basal level. **e** 2D STE: peak radial strain at the LV apex. **f** 2D STE: Right ventricle (RV) GLS\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】Tricuspid regurgitation was moderate, and inferior vena cava dilated, without inspiratory collapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was 42 mmHg. Laboratory tests detected high levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pBNP) and liver enzymes.\n\n【37】Abdominal ultrasound examination showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was suggestive of hepatic and renal infarctions. Angiography found no coronary lesions.\n\n【38】The patient was scheduled for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), which was possible after 1 month. This approach was taken into consideration for LVNC diagnosis certification and to differentiate it from DCM. During this time, the treatment included anticoagulant, antiarrhythmic, diuretic, beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\n\n【39】The LVNC diagnosis was confirmed by CMR, that is, by the presence of trabeculations located from the medial to apical zones of LV (Fig. 4 ), two-layer aspect (Fig. 4 a–d), and fragmentation aspect of papillary muscles (Fig. 4 e). The maximal thickness of the myocardium was 8 mm, at the basal anteroseptal level. Examination detected no edema areas, and the following values: LVDV 375 ml (197 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> ), LVSV 245 ml (129 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> ), LVEF 35%, LVMi 230 g (121 g/m <sup>2 </sup> ), RVDV 152 ml (80 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> ), RVSV 44 ml (23 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> ), and RVEF 71% (Fig 4 a, b, f). The ratio of noncompacted myocardium to compacted myocardium was greater than 2.3 during diastole, and trabeculated left ventricular mass accounted for more than 20% of the total mass. The RV had standard dimensions and systolic and diastolic function, without kinetics modifications. The right ventricle ejection fraction (RVFE) was 71%. Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were moderate. Late contrast administration identified a zone with suspicion of scar (fibrosis) or Fabry disease at the level of subendocardial inferior and inferolateral wall (Fig. 4 d–f). Genetic tests were negative for Fabry disease, as well as for Gaucher and Niemann–Peck diseases.\n\n【40】**Fig. 4**\n\n【41】 \n\n【42】**a** – **d** Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showing dilated LV with trabeculations, recesses, and two-layer aspect of the myocardium (arrows). **e** CMR: fragmentation aspect of papillary muscles (arrow). **f** CMR: Late contrast administration identifying a zone with suspicion of scar (fibrosis) or Fabry disease at the level of the subendocardial inferior and inferolateral wall (arrow)\n\n【43】Full size image\n\n【44】Familial screening of first-degree relatives was also negative for LVNC, DCM, and congenital heart disease.\n\n【45】The second evaluation of the patient was performed after 2 months of anticoagulation and treatment of heart failure. He had no signs of heart failure. Echocardiographic examination detected no thrombi in the apex of the left ventricle between trabeculations (Additional files 5 , 6 ). A cardioverter defibrillator was implanted for prevention of sudden cardiac death (Additional file 7 ).\n\n【46】The patient was proposed for cardiac transplantation.\n\n【47】Discussions\n-----------\n\n【48】Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy. Prevalence is less than 0.02% \\[ 1 \\] and is male predominant \\[ 1 \\]. It can occur in isolation or association with other pathologies of the heart, with or without associated gene mutations \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. LVNC may be familial with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance or sporadic \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The sporadic occurrence was found in up to 60–70% of the cases \\[ 1 \\]. Prominent trabeculations on the endocardial surface with deep recesses extending into the left ventricle (LV) wall characterize the disease \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【49】Genetic studies showed that mutations were significantly more frequent in sarcomere genes (82%) \\[ 2 \\]. Non-sarcomere gene mutations might be identified in a minority of genetic cases and rare cases presenting with complex genotypes \\[ 2 \\]. Some genes involved in LVNC are also involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy (genes that encode sarcomere proteins) \\[ 2 \\]. LV systolic dysfunction seems to be more frequent in genetic than in sporadic cases. In a patient with a myocardial phenotype of LVNC, the association between a genetic mutation and LV dysfunction as a risk factor of the worse outcome supports the hypothesis that LVNC is a genetically determined cardiomyopathy \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【50】In 2006, The American Heart Association (AHA)-led working groups and councils classified LVNC as congenital genetic cardiomyopathy \\[ 4 \\]. In 2008, the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases considered it an unclassified familial cardiomyopathy \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【51】In embryogenesis, before the development of coronary arteries, the myocardium has a trabeculated aspect. The process of trabecular compaction in the human heart starts at the base of the LV and progresses toward the apex \\[ 6 \\]. LVNC is considered to be the consequence of early cessation of compaction during embryogenesis. This anomaly may be why ventricular noncompaction usually involves the apical regions \\[ 6 \\]. The result is an epicardial layer that is compacted and an endocardial layer with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the left ventricle cavity \\[ 6 \\]. Segments involved in more than 80% of patients are apical and mid-ventricular inferior wall segments and the mid-ventricular lateral wall \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【52】In LVNC, there is a mismatch between the myocardial mass and the number of capillaries, leading to hypoperfusion of the endocardial myocardium despite normal epicardial coronary arteries \\[ 6 \\]. The disease is usually associated with reduced ejection fraction and systolic dysfunction, attributed to hypoperfusion and to asynchronism of contraction between the compacted and noncompacted myocardial layers. Hypokinesia was observed both in compacted and in noncompacted segments \\[ 6 \\]. Papillary muscles are not well developed. The right ventricular apex may be involved as well \\[ 6 \\]. Trabeculations diminish ventricular compliance, leading to diastolic dysfunction, that is, an abnormal relaxation or a restrictive filling pattern \\[ 6 \\]. Ischemia is responsible for the progressive fibrosis, which also contributes to the decrease of LVEF and predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【53】Patients with LVNC can be asymptomatic or may present symptoms of heart failure (HF), supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and sudden cardiac death. Symptoms of HF occur in more than half of the patients with LVNC, LV dysfunction being reported in up to 84% of them. In total, 36% of study patients had heart failure of function class III and class IV \\[ 6 \\]. Systemic embolic events are frequent in patients with LVNC. The incidence of thromboembolic complications ranges from 5% to 38% \\[ 6 \\]. Cardioembolic events are secondary to mural thrombi formed in the recesses between trabeculations in the noncompacted myocardium, but also to the depressed LVEF or the development of atrial fibrillation \\[ 6 \\]. Systemic embolic complications secondary to LVNC are cerebral, myocardial, renal, and mesenteric \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【54】ECG can be normal in 13% of cases \\[ 6 \\]. Early repolarization abnormalities were found in 40% of patients with LVNC, and QTc prolongation in over 50% of patients \\[ 6 \\]. Repolarization disturbances predispose patients to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death \\[ 6 \\]. Atrial fibrillation has been reported in over 25% of cases, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 47% \\[ 6 \\]. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and complete heart block have also been reported \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【55】According to the 2006 AHA scientific statement, the LVNC cardiomyopathy diagnosis is obtained by using imaging techniques, that is, TTE, CMR imaging, or LV angiography with ventriculography, but no specific guidelines or imaging criteria recommendations are formally provided \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【56】The most used method of diagnosis is echocardiography \\[ 7 \\]. There are two sets of echocardiographic criteria: the Jenni criteria focused on the presence of a two-layered structure \\[ 8 \\], and the Chin criteria focused on the depth of the recess compared with the height of the trabeculations \\[ 9 \\]. Jenni criteria \\[ 8 \\] are the most accepted validated echo criteria and consist of evidence of a two-layer structure: a compacted thin epicardial layer and a thicker noncompacted endocardial layer with prominent trabeculation and deep intertrabecular recesses. In the short-axis view, the end-systolic ratio of noncompacted to compacted layers > 2.0 is diagnostic \\[ 8 \\]. Additional criteria that must be met include the absence of any coexisting cardiac abnormalities and color Doppler evidence of deep perfused intertrabecular recesses \\[ 8 \\]. Chin criteria \\[ 9 \\] considered for diagnosis are the presence of numerous, excessively prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses with the ratio of the distance from the epicardial surface to the trough of the trabecular recesses and distance from the epicardial surface to the peak of trabeculation ≤ 0.5, assessed at end-diastole on short-axis parasternal views and/or apical views. It is also important that no other cardiac structural abnormalities be present \\[ 9 \\]. Stollberger _et al._ defined LVNC as trabeculations >/ 3, prominent formations along the left ventricular endocardial border, located apically to the papillary muscles, visible in end-diastole, in one imaging plane, moving synchronously with the compacted myocardium, distinct from the papillary muscles, false tendons, or aberrant bands \\[ 10 \\]. Ghebhard _et al._ considered compacted myocardium systolic thickness < 8 mm for diagnosis of LVNC \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【57】In difficult cases, other echocardiographic techniques can be used for diagnosis: contrast enhancement, three-dimensional echocardiography, speckle tracking, and tissue Doppler imaging. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) was used in borderline cases because LVNC affects the left ventricle twist \\[ 12 \\]. In a normal heart, left ventricular twisting motion is caused by rotation in a clockwise direction (as seen from the apex) at the level of the mitral valve (basal level) and counterclockwise rotation of the apex (apical level). This movement contributes 60% to ejection fraction and 15% to fiber shortening. Left ventricular untwisting is involved in active diastolic filling \\[ 12 \\]. In patients with LVNC, an abnormal rotation pattern was described, that is, with basal and apical rotation in the same direction, resulting in almost total absence of left ventricular twist. This rotation pattern was described by Dalen _et al._ in 2008 as left ventricular solid body rotation, and it was proposed as a sensitive and specific marker for LVNC diagnosis that could differentiate it from DCM \\[ 13 \\]. It has also demonstrated its importance in prognosis: patients with rigid body rotation and noncompaction cardiomyopathy had a lower NYHA functional status as compared with patients without rigid body rotation \\[ 13 \\]. Peters _et al._ found rigid body rotation in 53% of patients with LVNC, and they highlighted the importance of left ventricular twist evaluation in cardiomyopathies \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【58】Echocardiography is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of this entity \\[ 14 \\]. There are frequent doubtful cases that need multimodal confirmation (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging) \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【59】CMR imaging is superior to echocardiography for the identification of noncompacted myocardium, with better image quality and increased sensitivity for identifying trabeculations, particularly at end-diastole \\[ 15 \\]. Petersen _et al._ criteria elaborated in 2005 are accepted cardiac MRI diagnostic parameters for the evaluation of LVNC, that is, the presence of two distinct myocardial layers and marked trabeculations with deep intertrabecular recesses within the inner noncompacted layer; a noncompacted/compacted myocardium ratio > 2.3 at end-diastole was considered suggestive \\[ 15 \\]. Additional parameters have been introduced for the assessment of LVNC. Jacquier _et al._ considered a trabeculated left ventricular mass > 20% of the global left ventricular mass measured at end-diastole as a sensitive and specific finding for the diagnosis of LVNC \\[ 16 \\]. Grothoff _et al._ introduced a quantitative measurement for LVNC diagnosis: trabeculated mass should represent > 25% of the LV global mass and > 15 g/m <sup>2 </sup> \\[ 17 \\]. It was suggested that CMR should play a significant role in the evaluation when the diagnosis by the echocardiogram is not confirmed, a good-quality echocardiogram cannot be obtained, and/or the degree of fibrosis may help in delineating the severity of the disease \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【60】Genes coding for sarcomere proteins, ion channels, and cellular signaling pathways implicated in other cardiomyopathies have been associated with LVNC \\[ 18 \\]. LVNC may appear in isolation or can be associated with other cardiomyopathies, including DCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease, such as Ebstein anomaly \\[ 18 \\]. It might also be associated with Barth syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, and myotonic dystrophy \\[ 18 \\]. Mutations in genes MYH7, MYBPC3, and TTN are the most common in patients with LVNC \\[ 18 \\].\n\n【61】The 2011 HRS/EHRA Expert Consensus Statement on the State of Genetic Testing for the Channelopathies and Cardiomyopathies states that, owing to the low rate of a positive genetic test in index cases, the utility of genetic testing for the definitive diagnosis and care of the index case is of limited use \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【62】Family screening in patients diagnosed with LVNC can help determine if a cardiac abnormality is sporadic or familial. Relatives may present with isolated LVNC and with other forms of congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy with or without LVNC \\[ 19 \\]. For family members in whom trabeculations or LVNC are identified, close clinical surveillance should be recommended \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【63】There is no therapy specific for patients with LVNC \\[ 20 \\]. Data from randomized controlled trials to guide the management of LVNC cardiomyopathy are limited, and interventions are focused on complications, that is, heart failure, systemic embolism, and sudden cardiac death \\[ 20 \\]. The same treatment is recommended to patients with DCM and reduced ejection fraction \\[ 20 \\]. Prevention of systemic embolism is an important management goal in these patients \\[ 20 \\]. Whether anticoagulants should be administered to every LVNC patient is, however, still debated \\[ 20 \\]. Anticoagulation therapy must be targeted to the individual patient after careful assessment of the benefit and risks. Oral anticoagulation therapy (target INR 2.0–3.0) was recommended in patients with impaired systolic function (LV ejection fraction ≤ 40%), previous history of embolism, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, and intracardiac thrombi identified on echocardiogram or another cardiac imaging modality \\[ 20 \\]. Otherwise, risk assessment based on CHADS2/CHADS2-Vasc scores as guidance and preference of the patient is recommended \\[ 20 \\].\n\n【64】Patients with LVNC and sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation require cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. These patients are at higher risk for SCD, even with normal EF \\[ 21 \\]. This should be based on current ICD primary and secondary prevention guidelines \\[ 21 \\]. ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death is indicated for patients with LVNC who present with cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction ≤ 35% \\[ 21 \\]. Patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia should undergo ICD implantation for secondary prevention \\[ 21 \\].\n\n【65】Prognosis is proportional to the severity of systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle \\[ 22 \\]. In 2012, Greutmann _et al._ found that NYHA class of heart failure >/ 3 and cardiovascular complications at presentation were strong predictors for adverse outcomes \\[ 22 \\]. In 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of Aung N. _et al._ found that, compared with DCM, patients with LVNC have similar risks of cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, thromboembolic complications, and ventricular arrhythmia. The most important predictor of worse outcomes in patients with LVNC was low LVEF \\[ 23 \\].\n\n【66】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【67】We presented a rare case of heart failure in a patient with left ventricular noncompaction complicated with heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and systemic embolization. LVNC is a rare cardiomyopathy and should always be considered as a possible diagnosis in a patient with the echocardiographic feature of dilatation and trabeculation of left ventricle.\n\n【68】The differentiation between LVNC and DCM in some patients remains challenging. A gold standard for diagnostic criteria has not been established. Echocardiogram is the initial study of choice, and if the diagnosis is indeterminate, a CMR may be the reasonable next test, which will also permit fibrosis assessment.\n\n【69】This case emphasizes the importance of imaging techniques, that is, echocardiography and CMR in early diagnosis, management, and follow-up.\n\n【70】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【71】The authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Additional files.\n\n【72】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【73】ALT:\n\n【74】Alanine transaminase\n\n【75】AST:\n\n【76】Aspartate transaminase\n\n【77】CI:\n\n【78】Cardiac index\n\n【79】CMR:\n\n【80】Cardiac magnetic resonance\n\n【81】CT:\n\n【82】Computed tomography\n\n【83】CW Doppler:\n\n【84】Continuous wave Doppler\n\n【85】DCM:\n\n【86】Dilated cardiomyopathy\n\n【87】ECG:\n\n【88】Electrocardiography\n\n【89】FAC:\n\n【90】Fractional area change\n\n【91】GLS:\n\n【92】Global longitudinal strain\n\n【93】HCM:\n\n【94】Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\n【95】ICD:\n\n【96】Implanted cardioverter defibrillator\n\n【97】LAVi:\n\n【98】Left atrial volume index\n\n【99】LV:\n\n【100】Left ventricle\n\n【101】LVEF:\n\n【102】Left ventricle ejection fraction\n\n【103】LVDV:\n\n【104】Left ventricle end-diastolic volume\n\n【105】LVSV:\n\n【106】Left ventricle end-systolic volume\n\n【107】LVNC:\n\n【108】Left ventricular noncompaction\n\n【109】LVMi:\n\n【110】Left ventricle mass index\n\n【111】NTpBNP:\n\n【112】N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide\n\n【113】PASP:\n\n【114】Pulmonary artery systolic pressure\n\n【115】PE:\n\n【116】Physical examination\n\n【117】PVC:\n\n【118】Premature ventricular contractions\n\n【119】PW Doppler:\n\n【120】Pulsed-wave Doppler\n\n【121】RBBB:\n\n【122】Right bundle branch block\n\n【123】RV:\n\n【124】Right ventricle\n\n【125】RVEF:\n\n【126】Right ventricle ejection fraction\n\n【127】RVDV:\n\n【128】Right ventricle end-diastolic volume\n\n【129】RVSV:\n\n【130】Right ventricle end-systolic volume\n\n【131】SAPWD:\n\n【132】Septal to posterior wall motion delay\n\n【133】STE:\n\n【134】Speckle-tracking echocardiography\n\n【135】TAPSE:\n\n【136】Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion\n\n【137】TTE:\n\n【138】Transthoracic echocardiography", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

They occur most commonly at the carotid bifurcation, where they are known as carotid body tumors. Most paragangliomas are benign, locally aggressive, infiltrative tumors. Approximately 10% of patients with paragangliomas develop distant metastases, 10% present with multiple or bilateral tumors (mostly carotid body tumors), and 10% have a family history of paragangliomas. The malignant transformation of carotid body tumors has been reported in 6% of cases.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 64 year-old Caucasian woman with a gigantic glomic tumor mass in the neck. Twenty years before the consultation, the patient had undergone an unsuccessful attempt to remove the mass. Over the last 3 years, the patient had felt enlargement of the mass at an increased rate, almost doubling the prior size. Angio magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 c m of the trachea. Due to the change in the tumor behavior, the maxillofacial team at Ruber International Hospital decided to remove the tumor surgically after embolization. During the surgery the tumor was gently dissected from the carotid an removed from the carotid bifurcation uneventfully. Two small nodes adhering tightly to the internal carotid adventitia and the posterior torn hole were left in place to avoid any potentially life-threatening complications. The final biopsy confirmed the initial diagnosis of carotid body paraganglioma and showed a Ki-67 expression of 19%. Due to the aggressive growth behavior and high Ki-67 expression of the tumor, the patient was referred to the CyberKnife Unit of Ruber International Hospital for treatment of the remaining nodes.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The management of cervical paragangliomas is difficult and remains a challenge. Although the likelihood of tumor control is high with surgical or radiotherapeutic treatments, we currently lack consensus regarding the best treatment option. Nevertheless, in selected complex cases, such as the case we present, the combination of surgery and radiosurgery may allow complete local tumor control with minimal morbidity.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Paragangliomas are rare vascular neuroendocrine tumors that develop in the extra-adrenal paraganglion tissue. They represent less than 0.5% of all head and neck tumors. In the head and neck, paragangliomas are named after their site of origin. They occur most commonly at the carotid bifurcation, where they are known as carotid body tumors. Additional sites of origin include the jugular bulb (jugular paraganglioma), the vagus nerve (vagal paraganglioma), and within the middle ear mucosa (tympanic paraganglioma) \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【10】These tumors grow slowly, and they are reported to have a median doubling time of 4.2 years. Without therapy, they may grow to a considerable size and become life threatening.\n\n【11】Most paragangliomas are benign, locally aggressive, infiltrative tumors. Approximately 10% of patients with paragangliomas develop distant metastases, 10% present with multiple or bilateral tumors (mostly carotid body tumors), and 10% have a family history of paragangliomas. The malignant transformation of carotid body tumors has been reported in 6% of cases \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【12】The clinical signs and symptoms of benign and malignant paragangliomas overlap significantly. Most lesions produce local compressive symptoms including hearing loss, otalgia, tinnitus, neck mass, or cranial neuropathy. Cranial neuropathy can lead to dysphagia, facial weakness, and vocal fold paresis. A small proportion of head and neck paragangliomas may also show biochemical activity similar to that of pheochromocytomas, possibly inducing symptoms of diarrhea, hypertension, and flushing \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【13】The diagnosis of paragangliomas is generally based on radiological appearance because biopsy is challenging due to the anatomical location and vascularity. The literature contains little information about the specific clinical behavior of malignant paragangliomas that would help to distinguish them from benign lesions prior to therapy. Furthermore, the diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma is problematic and often relies on final pathological results \\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【14】Several of these tumors are inherited through mutations of the genes that encode for the succinate dehydrogenase enzymes SDHD and SDHB. Although the inheritance of both genes is autosomal dominant, the SDHD gene is subject to maternal imprinting, and the SDHB gene has incomplete penetrance. Patients with the inherited gene almost invariably have multiple tumors \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【15】Three treatment options are currently recognized: surgical resection, radiation therapy, and a wait-and-scan policy. Of these, surgery is the only curative treatment. However, because surgery may be complicated by significant morbidity, especially in larger tumors, it is considered by some authors to be controversial.\n\n【16】Here, we present the case of a giant paraganglioma body tumor treated with a combined surgical and radiotherapeutic (CyberKnife) protocol. This case report review has been approved by the Ethics Committee at the Ruber International Hospital.\n\n【17】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【18】A 64-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our office for the assessment of a gigantic left neck mass (Fig. 1 ). The patient reported that she had started to feel a paratracheal node 34 years previously, and that it had grown progressively during the subsequent three decades. She had undergone an operation in the area 24 years previously, although the surgery had to be terminated due to massive bleeding from the mass. During surgery, the mass was diagnosed as most likely a glomus tumor. No further surgeries to remove the mass were attempted, and it had been allowed to grow steadily.\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Preoperative image shows the large mass protruding in the left side of the neck\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】In May 2013, the patient was referred elsewhere for further study of the mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hypervascularized mass with a maximum diameter of 4 cm located at the bifurcation of the left carotid artery and causing the forward displacement of the external carotid artery and the backward displacement of the internal carotid artery. The patient refused surgery at that time and remained asymptomatic for almost 3 years. She then decided to consult a physician again due to the enlargement of the mass, which caused discomfort and mild compression symptoms when swallowing.\n\n【24】In 2016, angio MRI (Fig. 2 ) showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 cm of the trachea. The mass was pulsatile and slightly painful. No Horner syndrome or Hering–Breuer reflex was noted. A carotid occlusion test and a complete angiography were also performed, and these confirmed the permeability of the Willis polygon and the diagnosis of the mass.\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】**A** Angio MRI image showed a 9 cm paratracheal mass on the left cervical side that laterally displaced the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 cm to the right side the trachea. **B** Coronal axial vascular MRI showing the same paratracheal mass on the left cervical side involving the carotid bifurcation\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Due to the change in the behavior of the tumor, which had doubled in size within 3 years after remaining relatively stable for almost three decades, the size of the tumor, which had started causing compression symptoms, and the Shamblin grade II classification, the maxillofacial team at Ruber International Hospital decided to remove the tumor surgically after embolization.\n\n【30】The surgery was performed in February 2016. The tumor was approached through a wide cervical exposure after identifying the primitive carotid artery (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【31】**Fig. 3**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】Neck mass appearance at the beginning of the dissection\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】The tumor was gently dissected from the carotid bifurcation in a subadventitial plane (Fig. 4 ), with great emphasis placed on maintaining hemostasis.\n\n【36】**Fig. 4**\n\n【37】 \n\n【38】Paraganglioma showing its relationship to the carotid glomus\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】The surgeons would like to note that a partially blunt Freer periostotome is the best tool to use in high-risk areas. The vagal nerve was readily identified and separated from the mass. The hypoglossal nerve and major neck vessels were also preserved (Fig. 5 A, B). The mass was then removed from the bifurcation uneventfully. Two small nodes adhering tightly to the internal carotid adventitia and the posterior torn hole were left in place to avoid any potentially life-threatening complication.\n\n【41】**Fig. 5**\n\n【42】 \n\n【43】**A** Surgical field following paraganglioma removal. The great displacement of the internal and the external carotid arteries at the glomus due to the progressive enlarging mass protrusion of the paraganglioma can be noted. **B** Surgical specimen\n\n【44】Full size image\n\n【45】The postoperative phase was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 6 days after the surgery with moderate hoarseness, which was resolved within 1 month. The final biopsy confirmed the initial diagnosis of carotid body paraganglioma and showed a Ki-67 expression of 19%.\n\n【46】Due to the aggressive growth behavior and high Ki-67 expression of the tumor, the patient was referred to the CyberKnife Unit of Ruber International Hospital for treatment of the remaining nodes. A thermoplastic mask was made to ensure that the patient remained immobilized during the treatment. A T2 MRI and computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast were performed to locate the above-mentioned remaining nodes of the paraganglioma. The treatment was performed separately in each affected area on two consecutive days. A coverage dose of 14 Gy and an isodose of 83% were administered using 5- and 7.5-mm collimators. The maximum dose used was 16.87 Gy. The medullary canal received a dose of less than 4 Gy, and the left VII and VIII nerves received a dose of less than 5 Gy (Fig. 6 ). The treatment course was uneventful, and no complication occurred during or after treatment.\n\n【47】**Fig. 6**\n\n【48】 \n\n【49】CyberKnife planning: Coverage dose of 14 Gy and an isodose of 83% were administered using 5- and 7.5-mm collimators.

No recurrence has been detected\n\n【55】Full size image\n\n【56】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【57】The carotid body tumor is the most common type of paraganglioma in the head and neck, and is the only pathology to affect the carotid body \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. Carotid body tumors may be sporadic or familial; the sporadic form is slightly more common in women \\[ 3 , 10 , 11 \\]. These tumors often present as slow-growing, non-tender neck masses located just anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the thyroid \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【58】The differential diagnosis includes cervical lymphadenopathy, carotid artery aneurysm, brachial cleft cyst, laryngeal carcinoma, and metastatic tumor. Carotid body tumors are typically mobile in the lateral plane but have restricted mobility in the cephalocaudal direction (Fontaine sign). Occasionally, such tumors may transmit the carotid pulse or demonstrate a bruit or thrill. Due to the close proximity to the carotid vessels and cranial nerves X–XII, tumor enlargement may cause progressive neurological symptoms, such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or hoarseness \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\].\n\n【59】Histologically, carotid body tumors resemble the normal architecture of the carotid body. The tumors are highly vascular and contain clusters of tumor cells between the capillaries, producing the pseudoalveolar pattern of Zellballen (cell balls) \\[ 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 \\]. These cells have fine-grained eosinophilic cytoplasm and small round or oval nuclei. The malignant potential of these tumors cannot be predicted by histological studies. The diagnosis of malignancy is based on the invasion of lymph nodes, vessels, nerves, the airway, or the base of the skull, rather than on tumor size or histological features \\[ 9 \\]. Chapman _et al._ \\[ 4 \\] recently suggested that pain, a rapidly enlarging neck mass, and younger age are predictive factors of underlying malignancy, which should prompt the consideration of an aggressive diagnostic and management approach.\n\n【60】Contrast CT and MRI \\[ 9 \\] have evolved as effective noninvasive imaging modalities for the detection of carotid body tumors. They commonly demonstrate tumor blood supply and the widening of the carotid bifurcation by a well-defined tumor blush (Lyre sign), which is a classic pathognomonic contrast angiographic finding. Carotid angiography also plays an important role in the evaluation and management of these tumors. Angiography demonstrates the vascular extent of the tumor, carotid artery involvement, the size and location of tumor-feeding vessels (useful for evaluating the possibility of tumor embolization), and coexisting atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries.\n\n【61】The management of carotid body tumors has been controversial because of their low malignant potential and high rates of operative complications. Early experiences with carotid body tumor resections were associated with operative mortality rates ranging from 5% to 13%, postoperative cranial nerve palsy in 32–44% of patients, and other postoperative neurological complications in 8–20% of patients. However, most recent experiences have demonstrated the safety of the surgical approach, with mortality rates of 1–2% but a high (40%) morbidity rate due to cranial nerve injury and cerebral ischemic events \\[ 12 \\]. Surgical treatment has been the standard approach to symptomatic carotid body tumors for many years and has shown high cure rates \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【62】The size of a carotid body tumor is a very important consideration in the development of a treatment strategy. As in the case reported here, tumors larger than 4–5 cm tend to show partial or complete encirclement of the carotid arteries. Larger tumors have been associated with higher risks of bleeding and cranial nerve injury during surgery. Preoperative tumor embolization has been employed to reduce tumor size and thereby decrease the risk of complications. The Shamblin classification system (Table 1 ), which is based on tumor size, was proposed in 1971. According to this classification, group I tumors are relatively small and minimally attached to carotid vessels; the surgical excision of these tumors is not difficult. Group II tumors, including the case reported here, are large and show moderate attachment to the carotid vessels; these tumors are amenable to careful surgical excision. Group III tumors are very large and encase the carotid vessels; these tumors often require arterial resection and grafting \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【63】**Table 1 Shamblin classification of carotid body paraganglioma. Shamblin, 1971 \\[ 13 \\]**\n\n【64】Full size table\n\n【65】As previously described, a thorough subadventitial dissection with proximal control of the primitive carotid artery and the early identification and dissection of the cranial nerves (mainly the vagal and hypoglossal nerves) help to prevent much of the morbidity related to the surgical excision.\n\n【66】Recent studies have reported on the use of radiotherapy as the first-choice treatment for paragangliomas \\[ 14 \\]. The main arguments in favor of this treatment are that it is less invasive than surgery, has fewer complications, and achieves high rates of local control. Hinerman and colleagues \\[ 14 \\] reported a 96–100% tumor control rate in cervical paragangliomas after radiation therapy using a dose of 45 Gy. However, the cure criterion for radiotherapy, which is growth cessation rather than disappearance, is difficult to evaluate \\[ 15 \\]. Thus, in gigantic tumors such as the one presented here, radiotherapy may stop growth but will not reduce the tumor mass. In such cases, compression symptoms may not worsen but will not disappear.\n\n【67】Further complications of radiation therapy may include inflammation of the external auditory canal and middle ear, osteoradionecrosis, cranial nerve neuropathies, and direct injury to brain tissue. Furthermore, it must be remembered that surgery will be more difficult if radiation therapy fails \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【68】Histological examination has shown that the chief cells are minimally affected by radiation; rather, the distinctive vascular structure of the tumor is replaced by fibrous connective tissue \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. This development is of concern in potentially malignant tumors, which have been reported in 3–5% of cases. In our case, we used the predictive factors of Chapman _et al._ \\[ 4 \\] to consider the possibility of malignant transformation of the chemodectoma. Given the wide experience of the surgical team with this type of tumor, surgical excision was selected as the primary treatment option.\n\n【69】Radiosurgery has arisen as a promising approach to the management of paragangliomas, especially glomus jugular tumors. Radiosurgery provides a high degree of accuracy, exquisite precision, and rapid radiation-dose falloff at the peripheries of the target lesions, allowing the clinician to deliver a high radiation dose to neoplastic tissue while sparing healthy brain tissue. This treatment is also relatively noninvasive and can be performed as an outpatient procedure \\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 \\].\n\n【70】In the case reported here, a preoperative goal of zero morbidity was defined according to the patient’s desires. Therefore, although the tumor resection was practically completed, we did not attempt to remove the nodes adhering most strongly to the skull base and internal carotid artery to avoid taking any further risks. Thus, gamma-knife radiosurgery was crucial to ensure effective local disease control with minimal morbidity.\n\n【71】In summary, the management of cervical paragangliomas is difficult and remains a challenge. Treatment must be individualized, taking into account the patient’s age, tumor site and size, multicentricity, and preexisting cranial nerve deficits. Although the likelihood of tumor control is high with surgical or radiotherapeutic treatments, we currently lack consensus regarding the best treatment option. Nevertheless, in selected complex cases, the combination of surgery and radiosurgery may allow complete local tumor control with minimal morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In 2009, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that at least 2.4 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths were related to a TBI, either alone or in combination with other injuries\\[ 1 \\]. Posttraumatic intracranial mass lesions are commonly seen after severe TBI and are usually involved in the pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension. They may vary from extra-axial mass lesions (acute subdural hematomas, \\[ASDHs\\], and extradural hematomas, \\[EDHs\\]) to intraparenchymal mass lesions (contusions and intracerebral hematomas)\\[ 2 – 5 \\]. However, EDH following decompressive surgery for ASDH is an uncommon situation with only few cases previously reported in the English medical literature\\[ 6 – 10 \\].\n\n【10】The present report describes the case of a Brazilian man who evolved EDH following decompressive surgery for ASDH. We review similar cases previously published.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 39-year-old White Brazilian man was admitted to our Emergency Department after a motorcycle accident on a highway. Although he was hemodynamically stable, a neurological assessment revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of six points and right eye mydriasis. No clotting dysfunction was detected by laboratory test. Computed tomography (CT) of his brain revealed right side ASDH, hemispheric edema and midline shift of 15.7mm with compression of his right lateral ventricle (Figure 1 ). He was immediately transferred to the Operating Room and a right decompressive craniectomy was performed. He was kept under sedation and his intracranial pressure (ICP) was continuously monitored in the intensive care unit. On the first postoperative day, he started to present elevated ICP refractory to hyperventilation and osmotic therapy. A new CT was then obtained and showed a large contralateral EDH (Figure 2 ) and frontal hemorrhage associated with catheter insertion. He was taken again to the Operating Room and surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed. A brain CT following the second operation, revealed no residual EDH (Figure 3 ). He evolved hemodynamically unstable within the first 48 hours and no neurological improvement was observed after weaning sedation. He died on the ninth postoperative day.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**(A/B): Admission computed tomography showing right acute subdural hematoma.**\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**(A/B): Computed tomography following decompressive surgery showing contralateral extradural hematoma.**\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Computed tomography following drainage of extradural hematoma.**\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】Posttraumatic intracranial mass lesions are commonly seen after severe TBI and are usually involved in the pathophysiology of intracranial hypertension. ASDH is frequently associated with other intracranial abnormalities, and only 30% to 40% of all ASDHs requiring surgery are isolated lesions\\[ 11 , 12 \\]. The most frequently associated intracranial lesions are contusions and intracerebral hematomas, associated EDHs are noted in 6% to 14% of patients\\[ 12 , 13 \\]. However, EDH following decompressive surgery for ASDH is an extremely uncommon situation with only 38 cases previously reported in the English medical literature\\[ 6 – 10 \\].\n\n【27】Several neurosurgical procedures have been reported to be associated with contralateral EDH, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion and evacuation of acute and chronic ASDH\\[ 6 – 10 , 14 , 15 \\]. Shen _et al._ \\[ 6 \\], in 2013, estimated that the percentage of occurrence of EDH contralateral to the site of drainage of ASDH was 2.4% according to the published data. Most of the patients were male, with an average age of 35 years and with a main mechanism of traffic accident\\[ 6 \\]. The present report describes the case of an adult who had a motorcycle accident who was admitted to our Emergency Room showing signs of severe neurological damage, with GCS of six points and anisocoria.\n\n【28】Many signs have been proposed as alert hints to the detection of contralateral EDH following drainage of ipsilateral ASDH, such as intra-operative brain swelling, postoperative neurological deterioration, pupillary dilation contralateral to the site of ASDH, grand mal seizure and intractable elevated ICP\\[ 8 , 14 , 15 \\]. In our case, the patient was admitted in poor neurological status and was continuously sedated. ICP monitoring revealed increased ICP from the first postoperative day and was refractory to all initial clinical maneuvers. A postoperative CT showed the presence of a large contralateral EDH. As already highlighted by other authors, on the presentation of “red flags” immediate CT is recommended because it may lead to urgent evacuation surgery of these life-threatening mass lesions\\[ 7 , 16 \\].\n\n【29】The pathophysiology involved in the formation of delayed contralateral EDH following decompressive surgery is not fully understood, but may include loss of tamponade effect, vasomotor mechanisms, and coagulopathy, with the main cause appearing to be the upsetting of the equilibrium of the damaged vessels and the reactive ICP\\[ 17 \\]. In the present case, although a linear fracture ipsilateral to the ASDH had been identified on the admission CT, no other structural abnormality was found during drainage of contralateral EDH, making us believe that the main mechanism involved in our case was the loss of tamponade effect following decompressive surgery and microvascular ruptures in the virtual epidural space.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【31】In conclusion, the present case highlights the importance of close monitoring of the ICP of patients who have severe TBI, even after decompressive procedures, because of the possible development of contralateral EDH. Although most instances of increased ICP after ASDH drainage seem to be associated with brain swelling, these phenomena should raise the suspicion of evolution of contralateral hematoma.\n\n【32】Consent\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

According to the current WHO classification, this disorder is characterized by one of the following: a generalized proliferation of scattered single cells, small nodules or linear proliferations of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells \\[ 2 \\]; in addition, it is considered to be a precursor for pulmonary carcinoid tumors.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Here we report on a patient with DIPNECH who coincidently developed a pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The 60-year-old female patient was initially referred to our hospital because computed tomography scans revealed a tumor-like lesion measuring 2.9 cm in its widest diameter in segment 2 (right upper lobe, posterior segment) of the right lung. Additionally, several lesions as large as 0.6 cm were evident in segments 4 (right middle lobe, lateral segment) and 6 (right lower lobe, superior segment) of the right lung. These lesions were suggested to represent metastases of the lesion in segment 2. A CT scan of the chest (Fig. 1 ) was indicated following detection of a pulmonary nodule in the right upper field on routine chest -x-ray. The patient had a 10 pack-year smoking history and complained of shortness of breath upon admission; the remaining review of symptoms was negative. Pre-operative diagnostics revealed arterial hypertension and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary function tests were unsuspicious (VC 143%, FEV1 128%). Since the CT findings raised the suspicion of a malignancy, a diagnostic thoracotomy with a concurrent sleeve lobectomy of the right upper lobe was performed in combination with a systematic lymphadenectomy. Pathological processing of the specimens revealed a 3.5 × 3 × 2.8 cm adenocarcinoma of a mixed subtype with partial neuroendocrine differentiation (Fig. 2 ). The tumor was strongly positive for CK7, CK18, TTF1 and SPA and focally positive for CEA, NSE and chromogranin A. The proliferation rate (Ki67) was 20–30%. Besides this main tumor there were multiple small metastases with a similar degree of differentiation in the upper right lobe as well as in segment 4 of the middle right lobe. Tumor infiltration of intrapulmonary and mediastinal lymph nodes was also present. Therefore, the TNM classification for the pulmonary adenocarcinoma was pT4, pN2 (16/27), pM1, G3. However, further processing of the multiple small lesions in the upper and middle lobe revealed five foci less than 5 mm in diameter with a different trabecular and nest-like morphology (Fig. 2 ). In these lesions, the cells were strongly positive for CD56, synaptophysin, NSE and chromogranin A and focally positive for CK7, CK18, TTF1 with a proliferation rate (Ki67) of 1–2%. Therefore, the diagnosis of multiple tumorlets (microcarcinoids) was made. Due to the multicentricity of the lesions and a size of <5 mm in diameter, the correct diagnosis was DIPNECH. Lesions >5 mm are classified as carcinoids according to the current WHO classification\\[ 2 \\]. There were no clinical symptoms suggestive of any proteins and/or hormones released, but interestingly, NSE (20 ng/ml) and CEA (33 ng/ml) were slightly elevated, whereas Cyfra was within the normal range (1.4 ng/ml). The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. Six months after the operation the patient is still alive and no tumor recurrence has been detected so far.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Preoperative CT scans. The preoperative CT scans clearly demonstrate the main tumor in the upper lobe of the right lung.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Histology of the adenocarcinoma and a representative tumorlet. Pathological processing of the resected specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma of a mixed subtype with partial neuroendocrine differentiation (A; primary magnification ×10) and multiple tumorlets, i.e. diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH; B; primary magnification ×10).\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】DIPNECH is an exceedingly rare disease involving generalized proliferation of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, which leads to an occlusion of the bronchial lumina and consequent clinical symptoms such as shortness of breath. Due to its neuroendocrine origin, its similar morphology to pulmonary carcinoids and particularly due to its association with pulmonary carcinoids, the disease is considered to be a precursor lesion for theses entities. Only 40 cases of DIPNECH have been reported in the literature to date \\[ 1 \\] and there are no predictive histological or genetic data available so far. However, it has become generally accepted that DIPNECH is a precursor to pulmonary carcinoid tumors \\[ 3 \\]. In a recent study including 1090 patients, who received resections for primary lung tumors, Ruffini and colleagues found that the overall prevalence of pre-invasive lesions for lung carcinomas was 6.7%. Only 3 of these 1090 cases were associated with DIPNECH and the primary tumors were carcinoids in all of these cases \\[ 4 \\]. We have recently reported a similar case in which DIPNECH was associated with a carcinoid \\[ 5 \\]. The current report represents the first case of a patient with DIPNECH accompanied by a pulmonary adenocarcinoma of mixed subtype with partial neuroendocrine differentiation. The adenocarcinoma was positive for typical markers such as CK7, CK18, TTF1, and SPA and additionally, it was positive for NSE and CEA, which were also measured to be elevated in the patient's serum. Interestingly, besides typical carcinoid markers such as CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A, the DIPNECH lesions were also positive for NSE. However, it remains elusive if the elevated NSE levels in the patient's serum belong to the adenocarcinomas, the DIPNECH lesions or a combination of both. Nevertheless, our findings raise the hypothesis of a common pathogenic background of pulmonary tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation, which should further be investigated. Although it is unlikely that DIPNECH is a precursor lesion for other tumors of the lung with neuroendocrine differentiation besides carcinoid tumors \\[ 6 \\], this possibility cannot yet be excluded considering the small number of the cases described to date. Since it has been suggested that DIPNECH represents an underrecognized spectrum of disease and since it is being increasingly diagnosed \\[ 7 \\], we report this case to contribute to a better understanding of the disorder and its associated pathologies. However, the association of DIPNECH with a higher overall cancer incidence should be regarded carefully, since there is evidence that malignancies at other sites lead to an increased use of imaging and thereby to a more frequent detection of DIPNECH \\[ 7 \\]. Therefore, more data are needed to accurately draw a conclusion on the incidence of associated malignancies.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【22】DIPNECH is a rare disorder and it is considered to be a precursor lesion for pulmonary carcinoid tumors. Information on the disease is still limited, especially with regard to management and prognosis. This case is the first report of a patient with DIPNECH in association with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Since an increasing incidence of DIPNECH cases has been noted in the past few years, we report this case to contribute to a better understanding of the disorder and its associated pathologies.\n\n【23】Consent\n-------\n\n【24】Written consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of the report.\n\n【25】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【26】DIPNECH:\n\n【27】diffuse idiopathic neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia\n\n【28】CK7:\n\n【29】cytokeratin\n\n【30】CK18:\n\n【31】cytokeratin 18\n\n【32】TTF1:\n\n【33】thyroid transcription factor 1\n\n【34】SPA:\n\n【35】surfactant protein A\n\n【36】CEA:\n\n【37】carcinoembryonic antigen\n\n【38】NSE:\n\n【39】neuron specific enolase.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Skin affected by atopic dermatitis not only shows a high percentage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ colonization, but corneal barrier dysfunction is also known to occur. It is considered a risk factor for bacterial infections in various areas of the body. However, the relationship between atopic dermatitis and bacterial infection following neurological surgery has not yet been reported. Here, we present a case of atopic dermatitis in which the surgical site became infected twice and finally resolved only after the atopic dermatitis was treated.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 50-year-old Japanese woman with atopic dermatitis underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping to prevent impending rupture. Postoperatively, she developed repeated epidural empyema following titanium cranioplasty. As a result of atopic dermatitis treatment with oral antiallergy medicines and external heparinoids, postoperative infection was suppressed by using an absorbable plastic plate for cranioplasty. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful for 16 months.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Atopic dermatitis is likely to cause surgical-site infection in neurosurgical procedures, and the use of a metal implant could promote the development of surgical-site infection in patients with dermatitis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus. AD patients are likely to develop bacterial infections due to frequent _Staphylococcus aureus_ colonization at a rate as high as 80–100% \\[ 1 , 2 \\] and corneal barrier dysfunction \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【10】Patients with AD are at a high risk of developing bacteremia \\[ 3 , 4 \\], which is considered a risk factor for surgical-site infection (SSI) in some areas of the body \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. Previously, no relationship between AD and bacterial infection following neurosurgical procedures has been reported; however, in this study, we report the case of a 50-year-old woman with AD who developed repeated staphylococcal infections after cranioplasty. She was subsequently treated for AD, and cranioplasty was performed without a metal implant, and demonstrated a good postoperative course.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 50-year-old Japanese woman presented to us complaining of a sudden headache. Her medical history revealed she suffered from AD, and was allergic to pollen, house dust, acetaminophen, and gabapentin. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head was performed when the patient first presented, showing no significant results. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a right internal carotid artery–anterior choroidal artery aneurysm (Fig. 1 ). Since impending rupture of the cerebral aneurysm was suspected, she underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping (Sugita Clip Titanium, MIZUHO Co., Tokyo, Japan) the following day, which was performed via right frontotemporal craniotomy. Titanium implants (Saney Plate system, Saney Seiko Inc., Saitama, Japan) and a pterion plate (Titanium skull mesh, Muranaka Medical Instruments Co., Osaka, Japan) were used in the cranioplasty. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 13. On POD 25, she presented with swelling of the right eyelid and fever, at which point she was treated with oral cefazolin. However, she did not respond well to the treatment and was admitted to the hospital on postoperative day 33 because of continuous fever. On physical examination, eyelid swelling associated with tenderness was observed. She had a low-grade fever of 37.0 °C and eczema of the face. Meningeal signs were negative. Pale red papules, which are characteristic of AD, were observed on the face and fissures of both ear lobes. A blood test revealed that her white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 7300/mm <sup>3 </sup> and 7.0 mg/dL, respectively. Based on these findings, the patient was hospitalized for SSIs.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Three-dimensional image of cerebral angiography. Left internal carotid arterial angiography revealed a left internal carotid artery–anterior choroidal arterial aneurysm\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Neuroradiological findings were as follows: a head CT scan (Fig. 2 ) revealed isodense pooling in the right frontal epidural space. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a corresponding high-intensity lesion was seen on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig. 3 a) and on T2-weighted imaging (Fig. 3 b). Epidural empyema due to SSI was suspected; therefore, she underwent emergent removal of the infected bone flap the day after admission. During surgery, pus was found in the epidural space, requiring irrigation with a high volume of saline (Fig. 4 ). After surgery, she was treated with intravenous meropenem at a dosage of 6 g/day. The culture revealed methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA); thus, the antibiotic regimen was changed to cefazolin at a dosage of 6 g/day. Swelling of the eyelid and fever improved immediately after surgery, and both CRP and WBC levels decreased to within the normal limits; therefore, she was discharged 15 days after bone flap removal. Five months after the first bone flap removal, the patient underwent a second cranioplasty. In this procedure, artificial bone (ARTBONE, AHEAD Laboratories, CA, USA) was fixed using titanium plates (Saney Plate system, Saney Seiko Inc., Saitama, Japan). The patient was discharged 10 days after the operation without any signs of infection. Twenty-five days after the cranioplasty, the patient presented again with fever associated with headache and swelling of the right eyelid. The implant was removed because recurrent SSI was suspected. The operative findings were similar to those observed when the bone flap was removed. The muscle and subcutaneous tissue were swollen, and it was difficult to turn the skin flap. The dural surface was covered with a dark-red hematoma and yellow granulation tissue. These areas were irrigated as extensively as possible. The pus culture revealed MSSA. Intravenous cefazolin was initiated as antibacterial treatment. At this point, the AD was not cured. We also considered metal hypersensitivity as a differential diagnosis, and subsequently, she underwent a metal patch test. The test showed negative results for the metal samples, including titanium. She was also treated with oral levocetirizine dihydrochloride, (tranilast) at a dosage of 100 mg/day (two capsules per day), and a topical heparinoid. The dermatitis and pruritus have resolved. Fourteen months after the second implant removal, the patient underwent cranioplasty. The artificial bone (ARTBONE) was placed with an absorbable plastic plate (CRANIOFIX absorbable, B-BRAUN, Hessen, Germany). She has not developed another recurrent infection over 28 months following the last cranioplasty.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】CT of first empyema.

Pus was observed in the epidural space, while the dural surface was covered by granulation tissue\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】AD is likely to cause surgical-site infection (SSI) for two reasons: high colonization rate of _Staphylococcus aureus_ on the skin and abnormal barrier function. Generally, patients with dermatitis have a high proportion of _Staphylococcus aureus_ on their skin, whereas _Staphylococcus aureus_ is not detected in normal, healthy skin. It has been reported that the detection rate of _Staphylococcus aureus_ is approximately 80–100% in dermatitis lesions and 75% in non-dermatitis lesions \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The severity of dermatitis is believed to be proportional to the detection rate of _Staphylococcus aureus_ \\[ 1 \\]. The barrier function of the stratum corneum is impaired by lipid reduction, and it has been demonstrated that scratching also stimulates bacteria that colonize the skin to invade the bloodstream \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【32】In this case, AD was suspected to be the cause of SSI because the first two cranioplasties, after which an infection developed, were performed before the AD was treated, while the cranioplasty after the AD was resolved resulted in no complications. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports suggesting a relationship between AD and intracranial infection in neurosurgery. AD is reportedly related to SSI in other surgical specialties. Aoyagi _et al_ . reported two cases of infectious endocarditis associated with AD, in which blood culture and skin colonization revealed _Staphylococcus aureus_ of the same strain \\[ 5 \\]. There are also some reports suggesting that AD increases SSI in ophthalmic and orthopedic surgeries \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. The authors of these reports suspect that the high incidence of _Staphylococcus aureus_ colonization in dermatitis is an important cause of postoperative infection. We believe that this would also increase the risk of infection after neurosurgical operations.\n\n【33】In general, sufficient treatment is needed to prevent postoperative infections in patients with AD, and it is necessary to plan the timing of surgery according to the condition of the skin \\[ 4 \\]. During surgery, the dermatitis lesions must be completely drained. If they are not, the area should be washed well with povidone iodine. Blood contamination and stress due to gauze coverage may exacerbate the skin lesions. Hair washing as soon as possible may help reduce stress and prevent infection \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【34】According to a survey of 348 cases reported by Tol _et al_ ., complications of cranioplasty include infections, which occur in 26.4% of patients, followed by convulsions (14.4%) and hematoma formation (6.9%) \\[ 13 \\]. Other factors that could cause SSI after cranioplasty include age, hemorrhagic diseases, bifrontal cranioplasty, reoperation, long skin incision, long operation time, and thin connective tissue at the surgical site \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【35】In this case, the contribution of using bioabsorbable implants instead of a titanium plate for preventing repeated infection is negligible. Metal implants may result in repeated infections. Generally, bioabsorbable plates are expected to reduce the risk of long-term infection. However, in the short term, some infections have been reported in cases using bioabsorbable implants \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. Considering that this patient had repeated infection in the short term, the effect of using bioabsorbable plate instead of titanium plate on recurrent infection may be insignificant.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】We encountered a case of AD complicated by repeated epidural abscesses after cranioplasty. In this case, sufficient control of the AD resulted in a good postoperative course. Preoperative treatment of AD after neurosurgical procedures should focus on the prevention of postoperative infections.\n\n【38】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【39】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Based on this result, treatment via immune checkpoint inhibition with the monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab was pursued. After 21 cycles, the patient sustained a complete response. Therapy was stopped after the 40th cycle, and she was moved to surveillance. She remained disease free 19 months off treatment.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case report of a patient with perivascular epithelioid cell tumor treated successfully with programmed cell death protein-1 targeted therapy suggests that programmed cell death ligand-1 levels should be measured in patients with perivascular epithelioid cell tumor and immunotherapy considered for recurrent or metastatic patients. Future phase II/III studies in this disease should focus on sequencing of surgery and immunotherapy with a design of curative intent.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Perivascular epithelial cell tumors (PEComas) are an exceedingly rare, heterogeneous category of neoplasms identified in the last two decades \\[ 1 \\]. In 1991, Pea _et al_ . \\[ 2 \\] were the first to describe perivascular epithelioid cell tumors in both angiomyolipomas (AML) and clear cell “sugar” tumors of the lung (CCST). A few years later, in 1996, Zamboni _et al_ . \\[ 1 , 2 \\] introduced the name PEComa in their study of clear cell “sugar” tumors. This family of tumors, the etiology of which has yet to be elucidated, includes angiomyolipomas (AML), clear cell “sugar” tumors of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and clear cell myomelanocytic tumors of the falciform ligament/ligamentum teres (CCMMT), as well as unusual clear cell tumors of the pancreas, rectum, abdominal serosa, vulva, uterus, heart, and thigh \\[ 1 , 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【10】Reports of PEComa are observed to predominantly occur in women over a wide age range, with the exception of CCMMT, which commonly occurs in young girls with a mean age of 11 years at diagnosis. The most frequent reported sites of occurrence for PEComa are the kidney and uterus \\[ 5 \\]. Typically, PEComa presents as a painless mass, with the exception of uterine PEComas and CCMMT, which present with vaginal bleeding and painful abdominal masses, respectively.\n\n【11】PEComas are characterized by perivascular location with a radial cell arrangement around the vascular lumen, involving epithelioid and spindled cells resembling smooth muscle that vary considerably by proportion between cases. Clear-to-mildly-eosinophilic cytoplasm and round-to-oval nuclei surrounded by small nucleoli are common, although nuclear irregularity has been observed \\[ 6 \\]. PEComas typically display a myomelanocytic phenotype with expression of melanocytic markers, such as HMB-45, melan-A, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF), as well as myoid markers, such as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and caldesmon \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. Frequently, they are S100 and desmin negative \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【12】PEComas are uniquely challenging cases not only diagnostically secondary to their diverse features and varying degrees of malignancy but also in terms of developing treatment approaches in advanced metastatic disease. Treatment of PEComa may be multimodal, potentially including chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant), surgical resection, and radiation therapy. PEComas may or may not be associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations. Studies have investigated whether loss of heterozygosity at TSC2 may be involved in the carcinogenesis of PEComa \\[ 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. These mutations on TSC1 and TSC2 inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thereby leading to cell growth and proliferation. Indeed, current case report literature has demonstrated some utility in treatment of PEComas with mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and sirolimus, which function to inhibit mTOR, which, as aforementioned, is activated in PEComas \\[ 5 , 11 , 12 \\]. However, to date, no large-scale clinical studies have evaluated the use of mTOR inhibitors for PEComa, although preliminary data are promising and suggest the possibility of complete response \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. This outcome indicates the need for the development of new treatment options \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【13】In the last few years, strides have been made in exploring PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcomas upon recognition of increased expression of these markers in these tumors. In 2016, a study by Paydas _et al_ . \\[ 14 \\] noted that expression in soft-tissue sarcoma subtypes ranged from 20% to 66% for PD-1 and 25% to 33% for PD-L1. Although this study of 65 patients did not detail whether these levels were clinically meaningful or affected potential patient outcomes, it did suggest that treatment targeted at this pathway might be considered in these diseases. In their study of 82 soft-tissue sarcoma patients, Kim _et al_ . \\[ 15 \\] demonstrated 43% overall PD-L1 expression among the subtypes as follows: epithelioid sarcoma (100%), synovial sarcoma (33%), rhabdomyosarcoma (38%), Ewing sarcoma (33%), and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (0%).\n\n【14】Having observed increased PD-L1 expression in sarcoma, clinical trials have examined targeting this pathway. In a phase II SARC028 trial in 2017, Tawbi _et al_ . \\[ 16 , 17 \\] investigated objective response to pembrolizumab in 40 metastatic or surgically unresectable, local advanced, soft-tissue sarcoma patients having failed previous systemic antineoplastic therapy. Overall response, which was the primary endpoint, was not achieved. However, clinical response was observed with 18% objective response rate (ORR) and 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) of 55% in the soft-tissue cohort, suggesting some utility in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. In the Alliance A091401 phase II study of 85 metastatic sarcoma patients, D’Angelo _et al_ . \\[ 18 \\] similarly demonstrated the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. Treatment with nivolumab alone demonstrated minimal activity, with an objective response in 5% of patients and confirmed median PFS and overall survival benefit of 1.7 months and of 10.7 months, respectively \\[ 19 \\]. Together, these results suggested that, although the majority of patients did not respond to this therapy, individual patients with specific disease phenotypes could be responders. Our current report highlights a patient initially diagnosed as having sarcoma but found to be histologically consistent with abdominopelvic sarcoma of perivascular epithelial cells (PEComa). The patient had immunohistochemistry showing elevated levels of PD-L1 and was successfully treated with pembrolizumab for their PEComa diagnosis.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】The patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian female who reported asymmetry of her abdomen in early 2011. An abdominal mass was visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 1 ). CT-guided biopsy was undertaken, and pathology was consistent with a T2b grade 3 (stage IIB) high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma arising from the lower rectus abdominis muscle. In March 2011, following surgical resection with concurrent interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy, she had external beam radiation therapy (XBRT). The patient was observed, and 2 years later a solitary metastatic lesion to the anterior lingula of the left lung was noted on follow-up CT scan. This mass was resected in May 2013. Follow up PET/CT in August and November 2013 revealed no further evidence of disease other than a pulmonary nodule in the apical left upper lobe that was not fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid. After an observational period of nearly 2 years, follow-up CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed stability of the apical left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. However, there was development of a pulmonary nodule more caudally in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe concerning for a possible solitary lung metastasis. The anterior segment left upper lobe pulmonary nodule had enlarged on the subsequent, March 2015 PET/CT scan, measuring 1.8 × 1.1 cm and was metabolically active, having a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 5.9, which was consistent with solitary pulmonary metastasis (Fig. 2 ). The patient received a left upper lobectomy in late March 2015. The specimen pathology was found to be metastatic PEComa and was sent for additional genetic testing.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Axial T1 weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating a large heterogeneously enhancing mass arising from the deep surface of the lower rectus abdominis muscle (arrows)\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】The CT ( **a** ) and PET/CT ( **b** ) performed November 2013 do not demonstrate any metabolically active metastases or pulmonary nodules.

In this case, surgical resection was deemed to not be a viable option. Therefore, systemic therapeutic strategies were instead considered. mTOR inhibitors were a potential choice of therapy, based on studies indicating some efficacy in this setting, but no clinical trials utilizing these agents were available \\[ 5 , 11 , 13 , 20 , 21 \\]. Secondary to elevated expression of PD-L1 on IHC of the tumor, treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks was begun in October 2015.\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】CT demonstrates metastatic disease involving a peripherally enhancing and centrally necrotic subaortic lymph node (arrow)\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】After cycle 21, a little more than 1 year after commencing pembrolizumab therapy, the patient had a PET/CT scan with no metabolically active disease (Fig. 4 ). At this time, the patient’s only complaint was shortness of breath on exercise, which was attributed to the prior lung resection. She continued on pembrolizumab treatment with no evidence of disease until April 2018 for a total of 40 consecutive cycles at which time she was placed under surveillance. She has been disease free off therapy for 19 months.\n\n【31】**Fig. 4**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】The PET ( **a** ) and PET/CT ( **b** ) performed at the time of recurrence in September 2015 demonstrate a metabolically active subaortic lymph node metastasis (arrows). The subsequent PET ( **c** ), performed approximately 1 year after commencing treatment with pembrolizumab, did not demonstrated any metabolically active disease, and the PET/CT ( **d** ) confirms no metabolic activity is associated with the prior subaortic lymph node (arrow)\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】A classification system was proposed by Folpe _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\] delineating benign, uncertain malignant potential, and malignant PEComas based upon the following so-called worrisome features: size > 5 cm, infiltrative border, high nuclear grade and cellularity, mitotic rate of 1 per 50 high-power fields or higher, necrosis, and vascular invasion \\[ 3 \\]. Benign PEComas do not have these features, whereas potentially malignant potential PEComas possess size > 5 cm only or nuclear pleomorphism/multinucleated giant cells only and malignant PEComas possess two or more worrisome features. Although the degree of malignancy varies widely, most cases of PEComa are benign \\[ 3 \\]. Our patient demonstrated widely metastatic and recurrent disease that was not cured by surgery and had a metastasis that was not easily approachable by this modality. She was found to have elevated levels of PD-L1 and started on immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Her response was not immediate but took a number of months for a complete response (CR) to develop. It was not clear how long to keep her on therapy, but the patient elected to continue treatment for almost 2 years after this response.\n\n【37】While this patient was being treated, a case report described a patient with epithelioid angiomyolipoma who had failed everolimus even with a mutation in _TSC2_ but had an elevated level of PD-L1 \\[ 22 \\]. With highly metastatic disease, he was treated successfully with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. This patient had a response after five cycles and continued on therapy for 2 years. Like our patient, this individual had prolonged treatment with this immunotherapy. At this time, in PEComa patients who are responding, it is not clear how long therapy should be continued. Also, it is not known how this therapy should be sequenced with surgery. Initial upfront treatment with immunotherapy could save these patients significant morbidity from wide surgical resections. The use of tumor PD-L1 levels as a marker of those who will respond to immunotherapy is controversial. In the current and prior case reports, each of these patients had elevated levels of PD-L1, suggesting that in responders to this therapy these levels are helpful in treatment decisions in PEComas.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【39】We report here on a case of metastatic PEComa in a 69-year-old female, previously treated with chemotherapy and surgery with noted expression of PD-L1. Given the favorable outcome observed, in the case of recurrence following surgical resection of the primary tumor, PD-1/PD-L1 should be measured and the possibility of utilizing targeted immunotherapy considered. Even though this is a rare disease, questions relating to sequencing of therapy, including surgery and immunotherapy, should be evaluated by clinical trials.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】Not applicable.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】CT:\n\n【44】Computed tomography\n\n【45】FDG:\n\n【46】Fluorodeoxyglucose\n\n【47】IHC:\n\n【48】Immunohistochemistry\n\n【49】MiTF:\n\n【50】Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor\n\n【51】OR:\n\n【52】Overall response\n\n【53】PD1:\n\n【54】Programmed programmed cell death protein 1\n\n【55】PD-L1:\n\n【56】Programmed cell death ligand 1\n\n【57】PEComa:\n\n【58】Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor\n\n【59】PET:\n\n【60】Positron emission tomography\n\n【61】SUV:\n\n【62】Standardized uptake value\n\n【63】XBRT:\n\n【64】External beam radiation therapy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We present the case of a patient with advanced basal cell carcinoma and metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial cancer, who was treated with the programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab for both cancers.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of smoking without any comorbidities developed periocular basal cell carcinoma, which was surgically removed but relapsed 4 years later. Surgical excision was carried out twice, but with positive margins, therefore definitive radiotherapy was given. Subsequently, the patient developed non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, which was removed by transurethral resection. Follow-up was irregular owing to the patient’s inadequate compliance, and within 2 years, the patient’s cancer relapsed and histology confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. Definitive radiochemotherapy was not accepted by the patient. Meanwhile, the patient’s basal cell carcinoma had also progressed, despite receiving vismodegib therapy. Therefore, the patient was administered epirubicin-cisplatin. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of epirubicin, treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent could not be continued. The patient developed bladder cancer metastasis in her left suprainguinal lymph nodes. Owing to the presence of both types of tumors, programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor atezolizumab treatment was chosen. In just over 1 year, the patient received 17 cycles of atezolizumab altogether, which was tolerated well without any adverse or side effects. Follow-up imaging scans indicated complete remission of the metastatic bladder cancer and stable disease of the basal cell carcinoma. The patient subsequently passed away in hospital due to a complication of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our patient attained stable disease in advanced basal cell carcinoma and complete remission in metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial cancer after receiving programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report the use of programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, as treatment for advanced basal cell carcinoma. This case may also be of interest for clinicians when treating patients with two synchronous cancers.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common cancer worldwide, which in most cases can be cured by radical surgery. Infrequently, however, BCC can become aggressive, cause tissue destruction and rarely even lead to metastasis \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Since immune mechanisms appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of BCC, studies are being conducted to determine the role of immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, in the treatment of relapsed-recurrent or metastatic BCC \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】The use of checkpoint inhibitors has become increasingly important in the treatment of different cancers, including advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer \\[ 4 \\]. Even if patients initially undergo radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection, metastases may later develop in about half of the cases \\[ 5 \\]. Therefore, systemic platinum-based antitumor therapy is a key element in the treatment of these patients, but checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab have become alternatives for second-line systemic treatments \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【11】Earlier reports have shown positive response to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors in advanced BCC \\[ 3 , 7 \\]. Recently, the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor cemiplimab-rwlc has been approved for locally advanced and metastatic BCC \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【12】In the present case report, we describe the case of a patient with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma, who concurrently developed metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma. The patient’s case is of interest since her BCC remained stable and the metastatic bladder cancer was in complete remission during her treatment with the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, atezolizumab.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of 40 years of smoking without any comorbidities presented with a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the inner canthus of the left eye at the ophthalmology clinic. Surgical excision of the lesion was carried out in April 2008, with limited excision margins. The histological diagnosis was follicular basal cell carcinoma. After being asymptomatic for 4 years, the tumor relapsed and the patient underwent a second surgical excision in August 2012. Resection was incomplete, with positive margins, so the patient underwent another surgery to have the tumor removed; however, histological diagnosis once again showed evidence of positive margins. Finally, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment for the patient. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the patient received 50 Gys of irradiation in 2-Gy fractions on the left halves of the forehead, glabella, nose, and on the left inner periocular eye regions. The patient attended follow-up examinations by the dermatologist every 6 months. Physical examination of the patient and an MRI scan of the affected area were carried out. The patient remained symptom free until 2018.\n\n【15】Figure 1 shows the main events of the patient’s illnesses and treatment.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Flow chart showing the main events of the patient’s illness and treatment.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】In June 2016, the patient presented with hematuria and was subsequently admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR) of urinary bladder cancer. Histological diagnosis confirmed non-muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (G2 pT1). Following surgery, the patient did not attend regular follow-up at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic. Until 2018 the patient remained symptom-free.\n\n【21】In February 2018, the patient once again presented with hematuria at the urology clinic. First cystoscopy, then TUR was performed, and the histological diagnosis confirmed muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (G3, pT2), indicating the relapse and progression of the patient’s bladder tumor. Although both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy were considered and offered as treatment options, neither was accepted by the patient.\n\n【22】In the weeks prior to surgery, once when the patient was blowing her nose, a cavity had spontaneously opened between the inner canthus of the patient’s left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial skeleton, the cervical soft tissues, and the upper mediastinal regions was carried out in April 2018. The MRI scan showed evidence of the relapse of the basal cell carcinoma on the skin of the inner canthus of the left eye, with the tumor invading the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root, as well as spreading into the nasal cavity and frontal sinus, cranially destroying the rhinobasis (Fig. 2 A, B) For this advanced, locally invasive disease, the patient was given three cycles of vismodegib as first-line treatment without any adverse events. A follow-up MRI scan of the region, in September 2018, showed disease progression and the increased destruction of the skin in the left inner canthal region. To ascertain the histological type of the tumor, biopsy of the sinuses was carried out, which confirmed the presence of invasive follicular BCC. Based on the decision of the tumor board, the patient was given eight cycles of epirubicin-cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy between January and September 2019. Follow-up MRI showed stable disease. Throughout the treatment, the patient’s functional status remained ECOG 0, and no side-effects were noted. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of epirubicin, treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent could not be continued. Approval for PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab therapy was requested by the tumor board but was denied.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】**A** , **B** MRI scans of the facial skeleton indicating the spread of the BCC into the nasal and frontal sinuses, as well as into the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root (April 2018)\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Towards the end of her chemotherapy, in the summer, the patient felt a small lump appear in her left inguinal region, so computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in September 2019 at the urology clinic. Although local recurrence of the cancer in the bladder could not be found, lymph node conglomerates could be detected in the aortic and left parailiac regions, and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland raised the possibility of a metastasis (Fig. 3 C). Ultrasound core biopsy was performed from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates, with the subsequent histological diagnosis confirming the metastasis of the muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (CK7+, CK20 focally+, CDX2−, p63, and GATA3+).\n\n【28】**Fig. 3**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】**C** CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis showing the lymph node conglomerates in the aortic and left parailiac regions, indicating the metastasis of the patient’s muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (September 2019). **D** CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis following atezolizumab therapy, showing the regression of the retroperitoneal and left parailiac lymph node conglomerates, indicating complete remission of the urothelial carcinoma metastasis (June 2020)\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】In November 2019, the patient was referred to the National Institute of Oncology for further oncological treatment. Taking into account the recently completed cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the patient’s advanced BCC as well as the metastasis of the muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma, the tumor board recommended the administration of atezolizumab.\n\n【33】Between December 2019 and 2020, the patient was given 17 cycles of 1200 mg atezolizumab. Although not a requirement for second-line atezolizumab therapy, PD-L1 staining was carried out for tissue samples from both types of cancer by applying the Ventana PD-L1 (SP 142) assay. The BCC sample tested positive for PD-L1, with a percentage of PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of 20, while the sample from the lymph node metastasis of urothelial carcinoma showed 0 % IC.\n\n【34】The patient tolerated atezolizumab treatment well; she did not experience any adverse or side effects. Her blood tests were normal, and her performance status remained good (ECOG 0) throughout the treatment.\n\n【35】Follow-up abdominal, chest, and pelvis CT scans in both February and June 2020 showed the regression of the retroperitoneal and left parailiac lymph node conglomerates, while the lesion in the left adrenal gland remained stable, altogether indicating the regression of the patient’s metastatic bladder cancer. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria (Fig. 3 D). CT scans of these regions showed evidence of complete remission in September and later on in December 2020 as well. Follow-up MRI scan of the facial skeleton and cervical region in September showed evidence of stable disease of BCC.\n\n【36】On 30 January 2021, the patient presented with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia at the emergency department. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with high ventricular rate, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Over the next 2 days, the patient’s condition deteriorated, she developed bilateral pneumonia, became somnolent and died. The cause of her death was considered to be due to the complications of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】Our case report describes the steps of therapy—highlighting immunotherapy—taken to treat a patient with two primary cancers: recurrent, advanced BCC and metastatic urothelial carcinoma.\n\n【39】For patients with locally advanced BCC that relapses following surgery, vismodegib, a drug targeting the hedgehog signaling pathway and often dysregulated in BCC is a recommended treatment option \\[ 9 , 10 \\]. The efficacy of vismodegib has been reported by previous studies, however, long-term results have not yet been documented and resistance to vismodegib has also been found in recurrent periocular BCC \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 \\].\n\n【40】In line with treatment recommendations, when our patient’s BCC relapsed following surgery and invaded the adjacent ethmoidal air cells, nasal cavity, and frontal sinus, the patient was approved for treatment with vismodegib. Although sinusoidal progression of the tumor was halted, the destruction of the skin progressed, so overall the treatment was only partially successful.\n\n【41】Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers account for 70% of new bladder cancers and can mostly be treated curatively, with a high 5-year overall survival rate of 90% \\[ 14 \\]. About 15–20% of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers become muscle invasive, however, with high-grade papillary tumors having a higher chance of progressing to muscle-invasive bladder cancers than low-grade papillary tumors \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is an accepted systemic treatment in muscle-invasive bladder cancer; however, for a large proportion of patients, it is not a suitable choice owing to age- or disease-related risk comorbidities \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【42】In our patient’s case, instead of radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy, which were not accepted by the patient, TUR and subsequent close monitoring was the chosen mode of treatment. However, urological follow-up was irregular and when the patient presented at the urology clinic with a palpable lump in her left inguinal region 1 year later, core biopsy showed evidence of a lymphatic metastasis of the bladder cancer.\n\n【43】Immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor was a possible treatment modality at this point; therefore, based on the tumor board’s decision, our patient was given 17 cycles of atezolizumab.\n\n【44】Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors are immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have been shown to be safe and effective for patients with advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer: they have been approved for first-line, second-line, and maintenance therapy in advanced disease \\[ 6 \\]. The IMvigor211 phase 3 study showed that atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, was associated with similar overall survival as patients treated with chemotherapy in platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1, but had a better safety profile and was well tolerated \\[ 17 \\]. Immunotherapy and the use of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have also become an area of interest in the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers including advanced BCC, particularly in patients refractory to Hedgehog pathway inhibitors \\[ 10 , 18 \\]. Several case reports and a small study involving eight patients reported favorable responses with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and cemiplimab \\[ 3 , 7 \\], furthermore, the latter was approved for locally advanced and metastatic BCC by the US Food and Drug Administration \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【45】Atezolizumab treatment was well tolerated by our patient. During the treatment, follow-up imaging showed evidence of complete remission of the metastatic bladder cancer and stable disease of BCC. Thus, atezolizumab treatment appeared to be beneficial for both cancers.\n\n【46】Prior to treatment, PD-L1 staining was carried out. Interestingly, whereas the BCC sample showed intensive staining, the sample from the urothelial carcinoma metastasis did not show any. Although PD-L1 expression, measured by immunohistochemistry, is an accepted and relevant biomarker of response to checkpoint inhibitors, it has been found to be unreliable in some cases \\[ 19 \\] It is plausible that the patient’s metastasis may have contained heterogeneous tumor tissue, or the protein’s expression may have been downregulated, which can explain the efficacy of atezolizumab despite the observed PD-L1 negativity in the tumor sample.\n\n【47】Although there was a positive response to PD-L1 inhibitor therapy, the patient passed away soon after being hospitalized for atrial fibrillation and dehydration. The direct cause of her death was possibly the consequence of complications due to COVID-19 infection.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【49】To our knowledge, this is the first paper to report the use of the PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, as treatment for advanced BCC. With the aging of the population, the incidence of BCC and concurrent morbidity in multiple cancers are likely to increase, and choosing the best treatment for two synchronous cancers may provide a challenge for clinicians. We described such a case, where a patient with both advanced BCC and metastatic bladder cancer received atezolizumab treatment, and the patient’s response to therapy was stable disease of the first and complete remission of the second cancer. Although this report describes only one individual case—and therefore cannot be generalized—the treatment steps may be of interest for clinicians when treating patients with two synchronous cancers.\n\n【50】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【51】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【52】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【53】BCC:\n\n【54】Basal cell carcinoma\n\n【55】PD-L1:\n\n【56】Programmed death-ligand 1\n\n【57】TUR:\n\n【58】Transurethral resection\n\n【59】CDDP:\n\n【60】Cisplatin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Thick pus was aspirated from the renal cyst on six occasions between September 2003 and November 2004. In March 2006, ultrasound examination revealed a cyst measuring 6.2 cm in diameter in the upper pole of the right kidney. Aspiration was planned when the renal cyst reached 7.5 cm in diameter. However, 11 months later, the cyst ruptured spontaneously and drained through the previous surgical scar in the flank, while the patient was recovering from a severe chest infection in the spinal unit.

This patient could have been advised to wear an abdominal corset to protect the right flank from pressure applied unintentionally during turning, hoisting or assisted coughing.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Spontaneous rupture of a renal cyst is a rare event that may occur into the pelvicalyceal system, the perirenal space, or the peritoneal cavity \\[ 1 \\]. We present the case of a tetraplegic patient in whom an infected renal cyst ruptured spontaneously through a surgical scar in the ipsilateral flank. A search in PubMed revealed no other reports of rupture of the renal cyst to the exterior through a surgical scar either in ambulatory individuals or in persons with a spinal cord injury.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 49-year old male sustained C-6 complete tetraplegia in 1975. He underwent extended right pyelolithotomy in 1999. In 2003, this patient noticed a lump on the right side of the abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed several large cysts in the right kidney (Figure 1 ). Open surgical deroofing and marsupialisation of a large cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney were carried out in August 2003. Subsequently, there was recurrence of a thick-walled cystic space-occupying lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney containing reflective fluid, which was consistent with an infected cyst. Thick pus was aspirated from the infected renal cyst on six occasions since September 2003; the last aspiration was performed in November 2004. Microbiology of the aspirate revealed the growth of coliforms. In March 2006, an ultrasound scan revealed a cyst measuring 6.2 cm in diameter in the upper pole of the right kidney. The wall of the cyst was mildly, uniformly thickened with no irregularity. The cyst contained clear fluid. There was a further adjacent 3 cm simple cyst at the upper pole of the right kidney with associated calculi. Gallstones were noted in the gallbladder. The left kidney contained small cysts. As there was no clinical or sonographic evidence of infection in the right renal cysts, the patient was kept under observation.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Axial CT scan of the abdomen, performed on 7 July 2003** . Several cysts are shown in the right kidney, the largest measuring 6 cm in diameter. The outline of the right kidney was intact. The perirenal fat was seen without any discontinuity. The gall bladder contained several stones.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】In November 2006, the patient developed chest infection and required mechanical ventilation. During this admission, medical care was focused on the patient's chest condition, and understandably the renal cyst was not given priority in investigation or treatment. In February 2007, the patient had been weaned off the ventilator but he was still requiring intense chest physiotherapy. While turning the patient, nurses noticed a swelling in the middle of the right flank scar. After two days, the swelling burst and purulent material drained on to the skin. Microbiology of the purulent discharge revealed the growth of _Providencia stuartii_ . This patient did not develop a fever, shivering or any other indicative feature of infection. Ultrasound examination showed a fistulous tract running between the renal cyst and the abdominal wall. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed to look for any collection of pus in the perinephric space. The CT scan revealed loss of the fat plane between the mid-pole of the right kidney and the postero-lateral abdominal wall (Figure 2 ). This was contiguous with a 4 × 2 cm area of soft tissue thickening and fluid collection in the subcutaneous fat. There was a small pocket of gas. There was extruded calcific material from the right kidney antero-lateral to the psoas muscle. On sagittal reconstruction of the CT scan, a communication between the cyst in right kidney and exterior through a defect in abdominal muscles could be seen distinctly (Figure 3 ). The amount of purulent discharge draining through the flank wound decreased gradually over a period of 10 weeks. The patient remained afebrile. This patient was scheduled for aspiration of the remaining cysts in the right kidney once the infective process subsided.\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**Axial CT scan of the abdomen, performed on 5 March 2007** . Cysts in upper pole of right kidney are shown, the largest measuring 7 cm. In contrast to Figure 1, there was a marked loss of fat plane between the mid-pole of the right kidney and the postero-lateral abdominal wall.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】**Sagittal reconstruction of the CT scan of the abdomen, performed on 5 March 2007** . Communication between the cyst in the right kidney and the exterior through a defect in the anterior abdominal wall musculature is revealed.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】A simple renal cyst is the most common abnormality observed during routine ultrasound examination of the kidneys in asymptomatic spinal cord injury patients, and does not usually warrant any intervention \\[ 2 \\]. A renal cyst may be infected, albeit rarely. An infected renal cyst can be distinguished from a simple renal cyst by magnetic resonance imaging, as an infected renal cyst is less intense than a simple renal cyst on T2 weighted imaging \\[ 3 \\]. An infected renal cyst requires drainage without delay \\[ 4 \\]; otherwise, the infected cyst may rupture due to increased intracystic pressure as well as weakening of the thin tissue walls separating the cyst from a closely adjacent collecting system or perinephric space \\[ 5 \\]. Very rarely, rupture of an infected renal cyst may result in fatal consequences \\[ 6 \\]. Spontaneous rupture of an infected renal cyst can pose diagnostic difficulties \\[ 7 \\]. A patient with spontaneous rupture of infected renal cyst may present to the emergency department, with distension of the right flank occurring suddenly \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【27】In the case of our patient, when the renal cyst ruptured, the surgical scar in the ipsilateral flank proved to be the path of least resistance. Drainage of infected material externally through the previous surgical scar helped to prevent systemic infection. If such a weak spot had not existed, the infected cyst might have ruptured into the retroperitoneum resulting in inflammation of the perinephric space and collection of pus, which would have required percutaneous or open surgical drainage.\n\n【28】Unlike ambulatory individuals, tetraplegic patients are at greater risk of sustaining blunt trauma to the abdomen during their routine activities of daily living. Paulson et al \\[ 9 \\] reported rupture of the spleen in a tetraplegic patient, who slid sideways, catching his flank between the wheelchair arm and a slightly reclined wheelchair back. In our patient, there was no history of acute trauma to the abdomen prior to the rupture of the renal cyst. However, repeated minor trauma, sustained during routine activities of daily living, could have played a significant role in the rupture of the renal cyst in this tetraplegic patient. For example, it has been documented that men with spinal cord injury can sustain blunt trauma to the scrotum during transfers to a toilet seat or a car seat \\[ 10 \\]. In the reported cases, the scrotum was compressed by the weight of the body during transfers or the scrotum was trapped between the thighs. Analogous to the blunt trauma to the scrotum incurred during transfers, it is conceivable that, in our patient, the renal cyst situated under the surgical scar was subjected to minor trauma during turning in bed or while hoisting. Further, the right flank might have been subjected to pressure against the side plate of the wheel chair, as the tetraplegic patient was sat up on the chair. The cyst in the right kidney would have been exposed to increased pressures during vigorous chest physiotherapy (for example, assisted coughing), which this patient required because of a severe chest infection. The cumulative effect of repeated minor trauma possibly led to rupture of the infected renal cyst in this patient through a weak spot, that is, a previous surgical scar in the flank.\n\n【29】From this case, we have learnt the following lessons.\n\n【30】*   We should have recognised that the renal cyst was vulnerable to rupture, and should have carried out aspiration of the renal cyst before it reached 7.5 cm in diameter, although a size of 7.5 cm in diameter as the threshold for percutaneous aspiration is an arbitrary setting. This would have prevented rupture of the renal cyst.\n    \n*   We should have advised this patient to wear an abdominal corset, in order to protect the renal cyst and the surgical scar in the flank from pressures applied unintentionally to the lumbar region during hoisting or assisted coughing. We already use abdominal corsets in thin patients, in whom a Medtronic pump has been implanted in the abdominal wall for continuous intrathecal delivery of baclofen.\n    \n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】We have reported the case of a tetraplegic patient in whom an infected cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney ruptured spontaneously and drained its contents to the exterior through a surgical scar in the ipsilateral flank. Spontaneous rupture of a renal cyst is a very rare event and external drainage through a previous surgical scar has not been reported previously in persons with spinal cord injury. This tetraplegic patient possibly sustained repeated minor trauma to his flank during turning, hoisting and chest physiotherapy, which contributed to the rupture of the renal cyst. In hindsight, we should have anticipated that the renal cyst was at risk of rupture and should have observed precautionary measures, such as aspiration of the cyst even before it reached 7.5 cm in diameter. Further, this patient should have been prescribed an abdominal corset to protect the renal cyst and the surgical scar from pressures applied unintentionally to the lumbar region during turning, hoisting and chest physiotherapy.\n\n【33】Consent\n-------\n\n【34】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

This interesting case showed notable difference on the electrocardiogram of a patient 4 months prior to suffering a stroke and 10 days after suffering a stroke. The pre-stroke electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex, while the post-stroke electrocardiogram showed marked left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy was diagnosed using the Sokolow-Lyon indices. The development of left ventricular hypertrophy a few days after suffering a stroke has not previously been reported.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An 83-year-old white British woman with a background history of permanent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous stroke attended the emergency department with a 2-day history of exertional dyspnea, and chest tightness. On examination, she had bibasal crepitations with a systolic murmur loudest at the apex.\n\n【5】In-patient investigations include an electrocardiogram, blood tests, chest X-ray, contrast echocardiogram, coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation, with inferolateral T wave inversion, and left ventricular hypertrophy. A chest X-ray showed features consistent with pulmonary edema. A contrast echocardiogram showed marked hypertrophy of the mid to apical left ventricle, appearance consistent with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed eccentric shelf-type plaque with non-flow-limiting stenosis in the left coronary artery main stem. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging reported findings highly suggestive of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our patient was treated and discharged on rivaroxaban, bisoprolol, and atorvastatin with a follow-up in the cardiomyopathy outpatient clinic.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Electrocardiogram diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy led to the diagnosis of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this patient. Left ventricular hypertrophy was only evident a few days after our patient suffered a stroke. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this remain unclear. Furthermore, differential diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be considered in people with electrocardiogram criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is an important diagnostic tool in identifying causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. Family screening should be recommended in patients with new diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Background\n----------\n\n【10】While stroke is a recognized clinical course of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), it is not known to unmask left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on electrocardiogram (ECG). It is widely accepted that LVH can develop due to intrinsic stimuli such as cardiomyopathy, or extrinsic stimuli such as hypertension \\[ 1 \\]. It is also important to note that LVH is not progressive in the majority of patients \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【11】This is an interesting case because an ECG performed in December 2016 prior to the patient suffering a stroke (Fig. 1 ) showed atrial fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex. Importantly, this ECG did not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of LVH, using the Sokolow-Lyon indices \\[ 2 \\]. However, an ECG performed 10 days after she suffered a stroke showed marked LVH (Fig. 2 ) using the same criteria.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Patient’s electrocardiogram before suffering a stroke\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Patient’s electrocardiogram after suffering a stroke showing marked left ventricular hypertrophy\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】We believe that ECG diagnosis of LVH (as it is the case with most patients) led to the diagnosis of HCM. However, what is surprising is the development of LVH a few days after suffering a stroke. To this effect, we decided to write this case report because it is highly unlikely that our patient developed LVH within 10 days, yet it was previously not evident on her prior ECG. However, it is plausible that suffering a stroke may have played a role in the ECG presentation of LVH. Later investigations confirmed the diagnosis of HCM in this patient.\n\n【21】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【22】An 83-year-old white British woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of exertional dyspnea and chest tightness. Her past medical history included permanent atrial fibrillation, hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, and a previous left shoulder operation. She has no family history of sudden death or cardiovascular disease. On examination, she had bibasal crepitations with a systolic a murmur loudest at the apex.\n\n【23】In-patient investigations include an ECG, blood tests, and a chest X-ray. She also underwent an echocardiogram, contrast echocardiogram, coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular MRI scan in addition.\n\n【24】History revealed that she had been previously admitted 10 days earlier with headache, vomiting, slurred speech, and left-sided facial droop. She was also found to be dyspneic, hypertensive, hypoxic with scattered wheeze, and with bibasal crepitations at the time. Her notes revealed that a bedside echocardiogram performed during that admission showed poor ejection fraction (< 20%). Furthermore, it was clear from her notes that she was treated with intravenous diuretics and glyceryl trinitrate infusion for acute pulmonary edema. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her head performed during the same admission confirmed acute left cerebellum infarct. The patient was subsequently treated for a cerebellar ischaemic stroke with loading dose of aspirin (300 mg), and 75 mg oral aspirin after 2 weeks. An ECG at the time showed no LVH. Her previous echocardiogram in 2015 showed mildly reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function, thickened aortic valve, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary regurgitation with dilated atria. A cardiovascular MRI scan in February 2017 at a regional tertiary center, showed severely impaired biventricular function and evidence of biatrial dilatation, plus a moderate to severe atrial scar.\n\n【25】### Diagnostic focus and assessment\n\n【26】An ECG performed during this admission showed atrial fibrillation, with inferolateral T wave inversion (new since February 2017), and LVH (new) (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【27】Blood results showed elevated troponin I of 95, 89 (normal < 30 ng/L) on repeat, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1175 (normal < 99 pg/mL).\n\n【28】A chest X-ray (Fig. 3 ) showed prominent upper lobe pulmonary vessels in keeping with pulmonary vascular diversion, with interstitial thickening noted along the right base in keeping with septal edema.\n\n【29】**Fig. 3**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Patient’s chest X-ray on admission showing features consistent with interstitial edema\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】An echocardiogram and contrast echocardiogram (Figs. 4 , 5 and 6 ) showed that her left ventricular systolic function visually appeared normal and biplane ejection fraction (EF) of 59% without contrast and 61% with contrast. Importantly, it showed marked hypertrophy of the mid to apical LV, appearance consistent with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The interventricular (IV) septum measured 1.3 cm (normal 0.6–1.2 cm), and the posterior wall measured 1.0 cm (normal 0.6–1.2 cm).\n\n【34】**Fig. 4**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】Apical four-chamber contrast echocardiography showing apical left ventricular hypertrophy\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Fig. 5**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】Apical four-chamber echocardiography showing apical left ventricular hypertrophy\n\n【41】Full size image\n\n【42】**Fig. 6**\n\n【43】 \n\n【44】A different view of apical four-chamber echocardiography showing apical left ventricular hypertrophy\n\n【45】Full size image\n\n【46】Coronary angiography showed (Fig. 7 ) that the left coronary artery main stem has eccentric shelf-type plaque with non-flow-limiting stenosis. This was discussed with a tertiary center interventional cardiologist, and it was deemed nonsignificant to cause ischemia.\n\n【47】**Fig. 7**\n\n【48】 \n\n【49】A coronary angiography showing the left main stem has eccentric shelf-type plaque with non-flow-limiting stenosis\n\n【50】Full size image\n\n【51】Cardiovascular MRI (Figs. 8 and 9 ) reported findings highly suggestive of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The LV apex measurement was 12.4 cm.

She was also referred to the cardiomyopathy outpatient clinic. Family screening was recommended.\n\n【62】### Timeline\n\n| December 2016  | Presentation to a local hospital with shortness of breath  |\n| --- | --- |\n| March 2017  | Presents to a different hospital with headache, vomiting, and slurred speech  |\n| April 2017  | Presents to a local district hospital with chest tightness and exertional dyspnea  |\n\n【64】Discussion\n----------\n\n【65】We believe that ECG diagnosis of LVH was the first step in diagnosing apical HCM in this patient. It is well known that LVH is not progressive \\[ 1 \\]. Therefore it is implausible that this patient developed LVH within 4 months. The factors responsible for the difference in pre- and post-stroke ECGs (Figs. 1 and 2 ) remain somewhat unclear.\n\n【66】We are convinced that LVH diagnosed on the patient’s post-stroke ECG was due to HCM rather than hypertension. This is because she has had hypertension for 20 years, and the pre-stroke ECG did not meet the criteria for LVH (Figs. 1 and 2 ).\n\n【67】Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic heart muscle disease mainly (in about 70%) caused by mutations of the several cardiac sarcomere genes that encode vital proteins central to the contractile machinery of the heart \\[ 1 \\]. It is characterized by LVH of various morphologies with an array of clinical presentations depending upon the location, extent, and distribution of the hypertrophy \\[ 1 \\]. Recently, 11 genes with over 1500 mutations encoding the thick or thin myofilament proteins of the sarcomere and associated Z-disc have been identified \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. In addition, these varied mutations lead to heterogeneous phenotypic expression of HCM with respect to the aforementioned LVH morphologies as well as diverse clinical course that include sudden death, heart failure, and stroke \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. This clinical course is evident from the case presentation because our patient has had heart failure and stroke.\n\n【68】Its prevalence in a variety of ethnic populations around the world has previously been estimated to be 0.2% (1 out of every 500 adults) \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. However, subsequent studies using data from echocardiography, genetic testing, and cardiovascular MRI has estimated the prevalence to be closer to 0.5% (1 out of every 200 adults) \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【69】Interestingly, the main abnormalities present in HCM include LV outflow obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and mitral regurgitation \\[ 1 \\]. These structural and functional abnormalities produce a variety of symptoms for patients including chest pain, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, presyncope/syncope, and palpitations. Importantly, these symptoms are broadly categorized into those related to heart failure (90% of the cases), chest pain (25–30% of the cases), or arrhythmias (including supraventricular primarily atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias) \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【70】As was the case with this patient, atrial fibrillation was permanent, and her presenting symptoms are well recognized in HCM.\n\n【71】Electrocardiography, echocardiogram, and cardiovascular MRI form the basis of diagnosing HCM. In 90% of patients with HCM, ECG is abnormal although there is no specific diagnostic pattern. Main ECG findings include repolarization abnormalities, prominent Q waves, P wave abnormalities, left axis deviation, and deeply inverted T waves \\[ 1 \\]. Findings from echocardiogram suggestive of HCM include asymmetrical LVH involving the septum and anterolateral wall, an increased LVOT gradient, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets associated with an increased LVOT gradient \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【72】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【73】An ECG performed 10 days after our patient suffered a stroke showed marked LVH which was not present 4 months prior to suffering a stroke. It is unlikely that LVH developed within 4 months because the time course of LVH is well documented in the literature. It is also not plausible that the LVH present was due to long-standing hypertension because it would have been present on the pre-stroke ECG.\n\n【74】Diagnosis of LVH was pivotal in diagnosing HCM. There is no clear explanation for the accelerated development of LVH within 4 months, particularly 10 days post-stroke. In addition, stroke may or may not have contributed to the LVH evident in the post-stroke ECG. This phenomenon has not been previously reported. The take-home messages from this case report are as follows: differential diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be considered in people with ECG criteria for LVH. Cardiovascular MRI is an important diagnostic tool in identifying causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. Family screening should be recommended in patients with new diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Hydronephrosis associated with desmoid-type fibromatosis often requires surgery or ureteral stent insertion. Although radiation therapy is recommended for inoperable cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis, there has been no report of treatment for hydronephrosis associated with desmoid-type fibromatosis by radiation therapy alone. We herein report a case of successful treatment for inoperable recurrence of desmoid-type fibromatosis with unilateral hydronephrosis by radiation therapy alone.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 43-year-old Japanese female underwent resection of desmoid-type fibromatosis in the right inguinal region and combined resection of the right external iliac vein 5 years before. Other treatment was not performed because of her pregnancy. Four years after surgery, desmoid-type fibromatosis recurred in the right pelvic wall. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor treatment was given for 1 year, but her desmoid-type fibromatosis enlarged to more than 10 cm, and she had swelling of her right leg and hydronephrosis of her right kidney. The patient received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of prophylactic irradiation using 10 MV X-ray and 9 Gy in five fractions of a sequential boost for the recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis. Although there was temporary tumor progression at 1 month after radiation therapy, slow regression of the tumor was seen. At 5 years after radiation therapy, there was no disease progression or severe complications.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We experienced successful treatment for an inoperable case of desmoid-type fibromatosis with hydronephrosis. Moderate-dose radiation therapy alone is an effective and feasible approach for the management of hydronephrosis associated with desmoid-type fibromatosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare disease that occurs in 2–4 people per million people annually \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Abdominal wall DTF is especially common in females of childbearing age, and the highest incidence is in people between the ages of 10 and 40 years \\[ 3 \\]. DTF can be asymptomatic or can result in pain, swelling, hydronephrosis, neurovascular damage, and other complications \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Wide resection is required for treating DTF in some cases, but recurrence is frequent \\[ 5 \\]. Radiation therapy (RT) is a useful treatment for postoperative or inoperable DTF. In addition, there are some reports of irradiation for DTF being performed by proton beam or carbon ion radiation therapy \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. Although more conservative management has recently been recommended \\[ 8 \\], treatment for a patient who has recurrence of DTF after surgery or a patient for whom conservative treatment cannot be continued due to complications such as hydronephrosis is not clear.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 38-year-old Japanese female in the 15th week of pregnancy presented with a dull pain in her right inguinal region. She had no medical history and no family history of familial adenomatous polyposis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor around the external iliac artery to the femoral artery just below the right abdominal wall (Fig. 1 ). Fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, and the findings were suggestive of DTF. In the 18th week of pregnancy, resection of the DTF was performed. Surgical biopsies of the tumor revealed a DTF and suggested a positive margin of the pelvic wall. Immunostaining was positive for β-catenin and negative for estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors (Fig. 2 ). RT after surgery was not possible because the patient was pregnant.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis.

Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor treatment was given for 1 year. However, MRI showed enlargement of the recurrent tumor measuring 6.8 × 10.0 cm in size (Fig. 3 ), and swelling of her right leg occurred. Computed tomography showed severe right hydronephrosis (Fig. 4 ). Her laboratory values included a serum creatinine level of 0.75 mg/dL. Surgeons recommended ureteral stent insertion for right hydronephrosis. However, she rejected stent insertion owing to concerns about the risks associated with stenting. Surgeons also recommended RT for recurrent DTF because it was located close to the right internal iliac artery and nerve.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Post-gadolinium axial magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showing strong and homogeneous enhancement of lesion by intravenous administration of gadolinium (yellow arrow)\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**a** Axial enhanced computed tomography scan image of the pelvis.

The patient received 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of prophylactic irradiation for the right inguinal region of the postoperative lesion with a margin of 5 cm added to macroscopic tumors. After initial irradiation of 50.4 Gy, the patient received 9 Gy in five fractions of a sequential boost for the right pelvic wall tumor to a total dose of 59.4 Gy (Fig. 5 ). Acute perianal dermatitis of grade 2 occurred at the end of RT, and it could be controlled with conservative therapy. RT did not induce any deterioration in renal function or degree of hydronephrosis.\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】**a** Dose distribution of radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy by four fields. **b** Dose distribution of boost radiotherapy with 9 Gy by eight fields\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】At 1 month after RT, there was temporary tumor progression and the tumor was 7.9 × 10.5 cm in size (Fig. 6 ). However, on subsequent follow-up visits, slow regression of the tumor was seen. The tumor had almost disappeared 2 years after RT. Hydronephrosis also improved (Fig. 7 ). At 5 years after RT, which was 10 years after surgery, there was no disease progression (Fig. 8 ).

Crago _et al_ . reported that 5-year local recurrence-free survival rate after surgery for abdominal wall DTF was 91% \\[ 9 \\]. However, abdominal wall DTF can result in hydronephrosis. Ureteral stenting and renal fistula creation are common treatments for hydronephrosis-associated malignant extrinsic ureteral obstruction (MUO), but their indications are controversial, especially for long survivors. Although stenting is a noninvasive treatment for hydronephrosis, it causes local discomfort related to urination. In addition, a renal fistula causes a decrease in quality of life (QOL) due to physical activity restriction by a drainage tube. Considering the patient’s QOL, it is often difficult to decide whether to perform ureteral stenting or renal fistula creation \\[ 10 \\]. According to previous reports, hydronephrosis associated with DTF occurred in 28% of patients with intraabdominal DTF, and these cases required a ureteral stent or renal fistula \\[ 4 \\]. Treatment of MUO should be judged from the primary tumor, renal function, patient and family wishes, symptoms associated with ureteral obstruction, presence or absence of chemotherapy, and prognosis \\[ 10 \\]. In our case, the reason why stenting was not insisted upon was that renal function was relatively good. However, previous reports on the relationship between stent placement and renal function suggest that stent failure may occur at 4–5 mg of creatinine \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The renal function in our case was not in a state of immediate stenting, and radiation therapy was not likely to reduce renal function. Horan _et al_ . also reported that pelvic radiation therapy did not induce any deterioration in renal function or degree of hydronephrosis \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【52】We were able to treat DTF with hydronephrosis by radiation therapy without surgical treatment or ureteral stent insertion, which the patient rejected. Our results indicated that radiation therapy without stenting for hydronephrosis in a patient with normal renal function is one of the options for treatment of DTF. A previous study showed that medication therapy alone for DTF with hydronephrosis was successful \\[ 13 \\]. As far as we know, our case is the first reported case of long-term successful control of DTF with hydronephrosis by radiation therapy alone.\n\n【53】In our case of abdominal wall DTF, one of the causes of recurrence was considered to be that RT could not be performed after the initial surgical treatment despite the presence of a positive margin because the patient selected to continue her pregnancy. The clinical behavior of DTF in females who are pregnant is not clear. Marco Fiore reported that DTF progression during or after pregnancy can usually be safely managed by watchful waiting alone \\[ 14 \\]. Another study showed that pregnancy does not increase the local recurrence rate after surgical resection of DTF \\[ 15 \\]. Considering these reports, the postoperative course of DTF in our case is different.\n\n【54】Additionally, conservative management has recently been recommended. Retrospective studies have shown that patients can respond to drug therapy and that spontaneous regression can occur after recurrence \\[ 16 , 17 \\], but the size of the tumor increased despite drug therapy in our case. Another study showed that there was a tendency for a lower local control rate in patients with a larger number of operative procedures before RT and in patients who had been treated for recurrent aggressive fibromatosis \\[ 18 \\]. Therefore, in pretreatment evaluation, it was considered that our case might be resistant to RT. Contrary to pretreatment predictions, the success of our treatment may have been due to the dose of irradiation. Regarding the dose of RT for DTF, there seems to be a general consensus for postoperative irradiation and irradiation for unresectable primary cases, but treatment for cases of recurrence in which postoperative irradiation could not be performed is unclear.\n\n【55】There have been few reports with detailed description of the method of RT for progressive recurrent DTF. Several studies have indicated that 50 Gy is sufficient for postoperative patients \\[ 19 , 20 \\].Therefore, the initial RT in our case was performed with 50.4 Gy for the right inguinal region. Retrospective studies have shown that irradiation at 36–75 Gy is a common treatment dose for DTF and that a dose above 56 Gy is a risk for complications in inoperable cases \\[ 6 , 20 , 21 \\]. Considering these reports, it is notable that our unique point was to use a combination of wide-field RT and local RT to increase the dose. As a result, we could irradiate the DTF recurrence with a total dose of 59.4 Gy, and a good therapeutic effect was obtained with few complications. On the other hand, irradiation of a wide field can result in an increase in the risk of secondary cancer. When we treated our patient, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was not used for pelvic tumors in our institution. Although IMRT has excellent dose localization, it may also increase the risk of secondary cancer in long-term survivors \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【56】We experienced successful treatment for a case of progressive recurrent DTF with unilateral hydronephrosis that could not be sufficiently treated initially because the patient was pregnant. Despite the difficulty of continuing conservative treatment after surgery due to tumor progression and onset of hydronephrosis, prevention of recurrence and successful local control without severe complications were achieved in our case for 5 years after RT alone with a moderate dose.\n\n【57】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【58】The data include individual patient data, but the data are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.\n\n【59】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【60】DTF:\n\n【61】Desmoid-type fibromatosis\n\n【62】Gy:\n\n【63】Gray\n\n【64】IMRT:\n\n【65】Intensity-modulated radiation therapy\n\n【66】MRI:\n\n【67】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【68】MUO:\n\n【69】Malignant extrinsic ureteral obstruction\n\n【70】MV:\n\n【71】Megavolt\n\n【72】QOL:\n\n【73】Quality of life\n\n【74】RT:\n\n【75】Radiation therapy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We experienced two cases of traumatic tibia shaft fractures caused by the impact of a golf ball.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 48-year-old Korean man and a 43-year-old Korean man were diagnosed as having linear tibia shaft fractures on the right leg and left leg, respectively. Both of them were treated with closed intramedullary nails. Calculated impact power of the golf ball at the time of tibia fracture was 3372 and 5825 N, respectively. Radiologic and clinical complications such as nonunion and delayed union were not found up to the latest follow-up at 12 months postoperatively.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Players and watchers of golf must take precautionary measures before striking a golf ball. It is advisable that players watching a golfer hitting a golf ball should stand a long way behind or in front of the golfer striking the golf ball. The danger of such injury is on the rise because more and more people are enjoying golf nowadays. Warning players of such dangers is one preventive measure to avoid such injuries in the future.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Golf is a popular recreational sport worldwide. According to estimates, in early 2008 there were at least 58 million regular golfers throughout the world, including 3 million golfers in Korea. Participation in golf has no gender or age limit \\[ 1 , 2 \\]; however, a decline in physical skills and abilities is inevitable with increasing age. As golf skills require muscle endurance, strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness to some extent, all golfers are susceptible to possible injuries. Because golf is a relatively low-intensity sport with low physical demands, it is not associated with a very high risk of injury. However, a large number of golfers are older people in poor physical condition. Therefore, the number of golf-related injuries could still be high \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\].\n\n【10】The most common self-reported mechanisms of injury are overuse followed by technical error. Other relatively common mechanisms include contact with a static object and a sudden or rapid change of club speed. However, traumatic tibia shaft fractures caused by the impact of a golf ball have not been reported in the literature.\n\n【11】Here, we report two cases of tibia shaft fracture caused by the impact of golf ball while playing golf. The impact power of a golf ball and the injury mechanism are also analyzed.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Case 1\n\n【14】The patient was a 48-year-old Korean man among four players who were enjoying a golf game. On the 11th hole, one of the players swung a number 5 wood club to take his second shot. At the time, our patient was watching the shot approximately 10 meters away from the player at a 50 degree angle. The player was an experienced golfer who had played golf as a professional for over 10 years. Our patient fell down after being hit by a high speed golf ball on his lower leg. He presented to our hospital with severe pain in his lower extremity. There was no medical, family, and psychosocial history. An X-ray examination revealed a displaced fracture of the proximal one-third of the tibia (Fig. 1 a , b ). He was treated with an intramedullary nail (Fig. 1c , d ). He had postoperative follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and then yearly.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】**a** , **b** A 48-year-old man with fracture in the lower third of the tibia shaft. **c** , **d** Closed reduction and intramedullary nailing was carried out after the injury\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】### Case 2\n\n【19】A 43-year-old Korean man was one of four players who were enjoying a golf game. On the 12th hole, one of the players took a second shot with a wood club. The one who was making the swing was an inexperienced golfer. Our patient was watching the shot around 5 meters away, 15 degrees left of the player. The golf ball hit by the inexperienced player hit the lower leg of our patient. He was transferred to our hospital. He complained of severe pain of lower extremity. There was no medical, family, and psychosocial history. An X-ray examination revealed that he had a displaced fracture of the distal one-third of the tibia (Fig. 2a , b ). He was treated with an intramedullary nail (Fig. 2c , d ). He had postoperative follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and then yearly.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】**a** , **b** Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of a tibia fracture in a 43-year-old man. Plain films showing a fracture at the junction of the proximal and one third of the tibia. **c** , **d** Bone union following intramedullary nailing shown in anteroposterior and lateral views\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【24】One of the most common mechanisms of golf injuries is overuse. The most frequent nature of injury reported is strains. The parts of the body that are most often injured are the lower back and the shoulder \\[ 4 , 6 , 7 \\]. There have been many reports of golf injuries; however, tibia fracture due to being hit by a golf ball has not been reported yet.\n\n【25】If the details of the golfing actions that caused the injuries to Case 1 and Case 2 are substituted into a formula for average power and taking into account drag force, then the force of the golf ball on impact was found to be approximately 3372 and 5825 N, respectively. In the two cases reported here, both patients were standing at a 15–50 degree angle from the player. Both players were taking their second shot with a wooden club. A ball hit by a wooden club can gain extreme speed, creating a lot of energy. An amateur golfer’s average club head speed is 90 miles per hour (40 m/s). Assuming that the weight of a general wooden club is 200 g and a golf ball’s weight is 45 g, at a shooting angle of 5 degrees the speed of the ball after the impact is calculated to be 16.3–65.3 m/s. The movement of a golf ball can have two physical conditions: inelastic collision and motion by drag force \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【26】### Inelastic collision\n\n【27】Conditions\n\n【28】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_c^i: inital\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ golf\\\\ club $$\n\n【29】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_c^f: final\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ golf\\\\ club $$\n\n【30】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_b^i: inital\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ golf\\\\ ball $$\n\n【31】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_b^f: final\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ golf\\\\ ball $$\n\n【32】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_h^i: inital\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ human $$\n\n【33】$$ {\\\\nu}\\_h^f: final\\\\ velocity\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ human $$\n\n【34】The masses of the three particles (golf club, golf ball, and human) are _m_ <sub>c </sub> \\= 0.2 kg, _m_ <sub>b </sub> \\= 0.045 kg, and _m_ <sub>h </sub> ≈ 60 kg.\n\n【35】$$ {m}\\_c{v}\\_c^i+{m}\\_b{v}\\_b^i={m}\\_c{v}\\_c^f+{m}\\_b{v}\\_b^f $$\n\n【36】(1)\n\n【37】$$ e=-\\\\frac{v\\_c^f-{v}\\_b^f}{v\\_c^i-{v}\\_b^i} $$\n\n【38】(2)\n\n【39】The example gives a restitution coefficient of ball: e = 0.85.

Therefore, the collision coefficient of the second collision is less than that for the first one.

It is advisable that the players watching the golfer striking the golf ball should stand a long way behind or in front of the golfer hitting the golf ball.

Warning players of such dangers is one preventive measure to avoid such injuries in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Pericardial effusion may cause cardiac tamponade and sudden death if not properly controlled. Cardiac tamponade as a complication of pancreatic cancer is very rare. Cardiac tamponade caused by carcinomatous pericarditis induces the retention of pericardial fluid, causing pericardial effusion, and must be treated promptly as an oncologic emergency \\[ 1 \\]. Emergency treatment is necessary to prevent sudden death and relieve symptoms of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic cardiac tamponade \\[ 2 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, pericardial involvement in patients with pancreatic cancer has never been reported. Here, we report a case of metastatic pancreatic cancer complicated by pericardial effusion.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 68-year-old Japanese man was suspected of having pancreatic cancer 3 years previously due to an increase in carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 26-mm hypoechoic mass on the head of his pancreas and liver metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the pancreatic mass revealed adenocarcinoma. He was diagnosed as having Stage IV unresectable pancreatic cancer, and gemcitabine (GEM) plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) doublet chemotherapy was administered. After 2 years of GEM/nab-PTX chemotherapy, progression of the disease was confirmed; therefore, the chemotherapy regimen was changed to GEM + tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil (S1). Six months later, he experienced dyspnea and visited the clinic after a few days of experiencing symptoms. CT revealed pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusion. Laboratory tests revealed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 6.23 mg/dL. Pneumonia was treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, he was diagnosed as having pneumonia and heart failure. The following day, his blood oxygen saturation was 90% on room air, and he had tachycardia (110 beats per minute) and hyperthermia (37.2 °C). His blood pressure was 86/67 mmHg. Respiratory and circulatory failure was managed in an emergency room. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia, and echocardiography revealed a severe pericardial swinging heart motion (Fig. 1 a and b). Pericardial drainage was performed through a pericardial window, resulting in the drainage of 450 mL of blood, and the pericardial fluid was subjected to cytological examination. Cytological examination of the fluid revealed tumor cells indicating adenocarcinoma. Blood levels of CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were 5.8 ng/mL and 50 IU/mL, respectively, which gradually increased during the course of treatment, suggesting pancreatic cancer progression. A pericardial drainage tube was removed after improvement in his general condition. One week after the surgical procedure, intravenously administered chemotherapy with GEM/nab-PTX was re-initiated. Sixteen days after re-initiation of chemotherapy, he was admitted to the emergency room and died of cardiac arrest due to severe respiratory failure without evidence of recurrent pericardial effusion.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**a** Computed tomography findings. Extensive pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusion. **b** Echocardiography (apical four-chamber view) findings. An echo-free space around the heart revealed severe pericardial effusion. _LA_ left atrium, _LV_ left ventricle, _RA_ right atrium, _RV_ right ventricle\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】In this case, a pathological autopsy was performed. On macroscopic examination, the parietal pericardium and visceral pericardium had adhered, indicating cancerous pericarditis (Fig. 2 a). Pericardial effusion was not observed. On microscopic examination, a large number of tumor cells had infiltrated the pericardium, and some had infiltrated the lymph vessels of the myocardium (Fig. 2 b and c). These results suggest pericardial metastasis of pancreatic cancer.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】**a** Cancerous pericarditis: the parietal pericardium and visceral pericardium adhered to each other ( _arrow heads_ ) and exhibited tumor infiltration ( _arrow_ ). **b** Hematoxylin and eosin-stained pericardial tissue.

Findings of pericardial lymphatic invasion and lymphatic metastasis (× 100)\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Carcinomatous pericarditis is observed in 10–20% of patients with malignancies, with the most common malignancies being lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and malignant lymphoma. According to a study by Berge and Sievers, malignant tumor metastasis involving the pericardium was observed in 50% of autopsies of patients with metastatic malignant tumors \\[ 3 \\]. Pericardial metastasis does not frequently cause cardiac tamponade. However, cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. Cardiac tamponade is the lethal phase of neoplastic pericarditis resulting from cardiac compression and the accumulation of pericardial fluid. Intrapericardial pressure increases and cardiac relaxation is inhibited, leading to low output; patients often experience dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, cold sweats, and fatigue \\[ 4 \\]. When symptoms occur, echocardiography should be performed since it is the most useful examination for diagnosing pericardial effusion and detecting signs of tamponade. Although the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is based on established clinical criteria, an accurate and early diagnosis of tamponade can often be established using echocardiography \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【23】When neoplastic cardiac tamponade is diagnosed, drainage by pericardiocentesis should be performed to relieve symptoms and prevent sudden death. A high rate of recurrence (40–70%) has been reported due to the persistence of carcinomatous pericarditis-induced pericardial effusion \\[ 6 \\]. Therefore, systemic and localized treatment should be provided to suppress pericardial effusion. Localized treatment includes percutaneous drainage, anticancer agent injection to destroy pericardial adhesions, and surgical resection of the pericardium. The most appropriate procedure should be selected based on the patient’s general condition. Intrapericardial treatment should be tailored to the type of tumor. For example, tris(1-aziridinyl)phosphine sulfide (Thiotepa) is recommended for patients with breast cancer, and cisplatin is recommended for patients with lung cancer \\[ 7 \\]. The course after pericardial drainage has been reported to vary according to the type of cancer \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【24】Malignant pericardial effusion is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Wang _et al._ and Gross _et al_ . reported that the mean survival times after detection of malignant pericardial effusion by pericardiocentesis were 3.1 and 3.7 months, respectively \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, no reports of intrapericardial treatment or endocardial treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer are available. We continued only systemic treatment because intrapericardial treatment could have caused diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【25】Several mechanisms regarding primary tumor metastasis to the pericardial cavity have been proposed, including lymphatic spread, hematogenous spread, systemic spread via nerves, and direct extension. Most tumors metastasize to the heart through the mediastinal lymph nodes. An autopsy was performed in this case, and a main lesion in the head of the pancreas with extensive fibrosis was observed. Moreover, active tumor cells remained. Vessel invasion and nerve invasion were observed, which were considered to have caused the metastasis to other organs. In the heart, the pericardium and myocardium showed strong tumor adhesion, which was considered indicative of cancerous pericarditis. Tumor cell infiltration was observed around almost the entire pericardium, and extensive lymphatic and nerve invasion was observed. Tumor cells also spread to the lymphatic vessels in the heart parenchyma, and some had infiltrated between myocardial fibers. Reports indicate that aminoglycoside antibacterial agents reduced cardiac contractility \\[ 10 \\]. In this case, these types of antibiotics were not used, and the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction was considered unlikely. From the pathological results, the infiltration of cancer cells into the myocardium was considered remarkable, and the progression of the cancer caused a decrease in cardiac function, ultimately leading to death. Similar to that in the pericardium, severe lymphatic invasion and venous invasion were observed in several organs. Therefore, the tumor was considered to have reached the pericardium via a lymphatic or hematogenous route where it formed an infiltrating lesion. In the lung, metastasis formation, intravascular tumor embolism, and pleural dissemination were observed. The bronchiolar and bronchial walls showed high degrees of tumor invasion, and the peripheral airway was constricted, likely causing respiratory failure. Debilitation occurred throughout the body due to cachexia. Hepatic dysfunction occurred due to tumor infiltration into the liver. Thus, in this case, the cause of death was considered tumor metastasis, including pericardial metastasis, throughout the body. Pericardial metastasis of pancreatic cancer may suggest cancer metastasis throughout the whole body.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】Pericardial metastasis and cardiac tamponade in pancreatic cancer are extremely rare. In this case, lymphatic and vascular invasion caused metastasis to the pericardium and myocardium. In our patient, the interval between tamponade and death was very short (42 days). Pericardial metastasis may be an indication of systemic metastases, and tamponade can be considered an indicator of a poor prognosis. These possibilities are important to consider when pericardial effusion develops in patients with pancreatic cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment significantly mitigated the condition of the patient and lowered biochemical indicators. Unfortunately, the patient developed septicemia and gave up treatment.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The patient was successfully treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, which has not been reported previously.

Congenital bile acid synthesis disorder type 3 (CBAS3) is an extremely rare subtype caused by deficiency of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase encoded by the cytochrome P450 7B1 ( _CYP7B1_ ) gene \\[ 2 \\], manifesting obvious cholestasis in the neonatal period with progressive aggravation and liver enlargement. This rare inborn error of bile acid synthesis responds poorly to bile acid therapy because the progression to cirrhosis is rapid and occurs at an early age. Steroids are rarely used because they can worsen the prognosis of infants with CBAS3 \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. So far, only five patients with CBAS3, four male and one female, have been reported \\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. Two patients died in infancy either before or after liver transplantation \\[ 5 , 7 \\], two patients survived after allograft liver transplantation from parental donors \\[ 6 , 9 \\], and one patient showed normal liver function after about 5 years of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which is the only case treated successfully with drug \\[ 8 \\]. In the same case report, the authors stated that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment worsened the patient’s condition.\n\n【10】Here we report a case of CBAS3 caused by mutation of the _CYP7B1_ gene, which was confirmed by genetic testing. The patient was treated with UDCA and demonstrated a significant improvement both in laboratory tests and in symptoms, suggesting that UDCA may be an effective and economical treatment method for congenital bile acid synthesis disorders.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The patient (a Chinese male, 5 months old) was admitted to our department on 17 May 2020 due to skin yellowing for more than 4 months, worsened for 1 month, and fever for 1 day. The patient was the first pregnancy and first delivered child of the mother and was born at full term with birth weight of 2850 g. The parents were healthy, denied history of intermarriage and genetic metabolic diseases, and denied family history of hepatobiliary diseases. The patient developed skin yellowing 3 days after birth, and the yellowing was not alleviated after taking Chinese medicine intermittently (the specific medicine was unknown). Since the onset of skin yellowing, the patient was in good spirits but had poor appetite with yellow stool and urine. Physical examination showed body weight 6 kg, clear mind, good spirits without special facial appearance, developmental delay, unstable head up, moderate yellow staining of the skin and sclera, no abnormalities on heart and lung auscultation, soft abdomen, and redness and swelling around the umbilicus. The liver was 3 cm below the right rib ridge, with medium texture and clear boundary, and the spleen was unreached.\n\n【13】Abdominal ultrasound showed that the intrahepatic bile duct was well revealed and the biliary tract was unobstructed. Umbilical color Doppler ultrasound showed abnormal echo in the umbilical area, suggesting umbilical sinus (Fig. 1 A, B). Abdominal enhanced CT scan showed that liver was slightly enlarged and the density of parenchyma was diffusely reduced; the volume of both kidneys was increased, parenchymal density was not uniform, and multiple small sac-like unenhanced areas of different sizes were detected, mainly in the renal medulla, suggesting infant polycystic kidneys (Fig. 1 C). Cranial MRI showed multiple punctate abnormal signals in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and near the posterior horn of the right ventricle, suggesting the possibility of multiple small hemorrhage lesions; the bilateral prefrontal space, the left cisterna, and the anterior temporal space were slightly widened, and the posterior horn of bilateral ventricles manifested small patchy abnormal signal foci, suggesting the possibility of myelination dysplasia (Fig. 1 D).\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Umbilical sinus, polycystic kidney, and myelination dysplasia of the patient. **A** , **B** Umbilical color Doppler ultrasound showed abnormal echo (red arrow) in the umbilical area. **C** Abdominal CT showed that the volume of both kidneys was increased, and multiple small sac-like unenhanced areas of different sizes were detected (red arrow) in the renal medulla. **D** Cranial MRI showed the left cisterna and the anterior temporal space were slightly widened, and the posterior horn of bilateral ventricles manifested small patchy abnormal signal foci (red arrow)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Whole-exome sequencing test was performed in the patient and the parents. The patient showed homozygous mutation in the _CYP7B1_ gene NM\\_004820.3:c.334C>T(p.Arg112\\*). The pathogenicity of this mutation has been reported \\[ 2 \\]. According to the ACMG guidelines, this mutation is a pathogenic variant. Both parents of the child showed heterozygous mutation at this locus with normal phenotype, conforming to the rule of autosomal recessive inheritance. Figure 2 shows the sequencing results of the patient, father, and mother, from top to bottom panel, respectively.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Genetic analysis sequencing results.

The yellow staining of the skin was not significantly improved. The patient was given oral UDCA 50 mg three time a day from 21 May to 12 June 2020, 100 mg twice a day from 13 to 18 June, and 125 mg twice a day from 19 June to 1 August. After symptoms improved, the patient was discharged from hospital on 21 June 2020. The patient was regularly followed up for biochemical examinations and check-ups. The parents stopped the drug without doctor’s permission since 2 August, and resumed drug administration at 100 mg twice a day since 19 October 2020 when biochemical examination showed that liver function had deteriorated. On 21 January 2021, the patient was admitted to our department again due to unconsciousness. Unfortunately, septicemia occurred on 21 January 2021, and the family decided to give up treatment on 23 January 2021 and left the hospital.\n\n【24】Blood biochemical examination results of the patient are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3 , revealing that the levels of most indicators increased shortly after UDCA administration, probably because liver function improvement takes much longer after the drug has its pharmacological effects. With the use of UDCA, the symptoms of the patient improved and all indicators demonstrated a declining trend until 2 August, when the patient stopped taking the medicine without consulting doctor. Thereafter, all indicators increased significantly and symptoms deteriorated until the patient resumed the drug again on 19 October 2020, since when some of the indicators declined again. The last two blood tests, performed on 8 and 23 January 2021, respectively, showed significant enzyme-bilirubin dissociation. Combined with the fact that the patient developed septicemia on 21 January 2021, this suggests that significant hepatocyte necrosis might have occurred since early January 2021 and might be part of the cause of the occurrence of septicemia. However, because the parents refused liver biopsy, the exact explanation for the test results and cause of septicemia is not available. No obvious abnormal products were detected in urine mass spectrometry analysis.\n\n【25】**Table 1 Liver function and bilirubin level**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】**Table 2 Coagulation function**\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】**Fig. 3**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Liver function and bilirubin level. **A** – **F** Blood biochemical examination results from May 2020 to January 2021. **A** ALT; **B** AST; **C** total bile acid; **D** total bilirubin; **E** direct bilirubin; **F** indirect bilirubin. Red lines represent the normal range of each indicator\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【34】Congenital bile acid synthesis disorders are extremely rare genetic metabolic disorders caused by enzyme defects and involving the pathways for bile acid synthesis from cholesterol in the liver \\[ 1 \\]. We describe the first case of congenital bile acid synthesis disorder type 3 caused by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency in China. The clinical manifestations and prognosis of this disease are not clearly defined due to the rareness of this disease. The age of these patients at onset is mostly 1–20 weeks after birth. All patients manifested jaundice, enlarged liver, significantly elevated ALT and AST, normal GGT, and normal or elevated total bile acid. Other clinical manifestations include coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, steatorrhea, malabsorption of lipid-soluble vitamins, rickets, and growth retardation.\n\n【35】The patient in this case showed obvious cholestasis in the neonatal period, accompanied by skin itching, and umbilical area redness with frequent secretions. Ultrasound examination revealed umbilical sinus and infant polycystic kidney changes. Moreover, the child also demonstrated physical and nervous system developmental delays. Head MRI revealed multiple small hemorrhage lesions, slightly widened bilateral prefrontal space, left cisterna, and pretemporal space, and myelination dysplasia. Severe infections occurred during the course of the disease, which may be related to the deficiency of the body’s immune function due to liver dysfunction. The umbilical sinus of this patient has not been reported in other cases, and whole-exome sequencing did not detect other related pathogenic gene mutations. Therefore, whether the umbilical change is associated with the _CYP7B1_ gene awaits further study. This patient had polycystic kidneys, the first reported case of oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase deficiency also had renal cyst changes, and certain types of congenital bile acid synthesis disorders have also been reported with renal cyst changes \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. The mechanism of renal cyst formation is not clear but may be related to the abnormal bile acid metabolites produced in bile acid metabolism disorders \\[ 7 , 12 \\]. The physical retardation of this child is considered to be caused by protein and lipid metabolism disorders and insufficient energy intake due to long-term liver function insufficiency and cholestasis. The developmental delay of the nervous system and MRI imaging changes of the patient may be related to the involvement of oxysterol 7α-dehydrogenase in extrahepatic tissues, such as the degradation of cholesterol in the brain and the metabolism of neurosteroids \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【36】Blood biochemical examination of patients with CBAS3 may reveal significant hyperbilirubinemia, with elevation of mainly direct bilirubin, and significantly elevated serum transaminases, but normal level of GGT and normal or slightly increased total bile acid. PT and aPTT are significantly prolonged, which may be caused by vitamin K malabsorption and liver insufficiency. Liver biopsy shows cholestasis, obvious hepatic giant cell transformation, extensive fibrosis, bile duct arrangement disorder, and small bile duct hyperplasia \\[ 13 \\]. The liver function test results of this patient were consistent with the liver function changes of congenital bile acid synthesis disorder, and the PT and aPTT were prolonged. The patient did not undergo liver biopsy, thus pathological changes of the patient’s liver were unavailable.\n\n【37】The current diagnostic methods for CBAS3 mainly include genetic testing and urine mass spectrometry. The _CYP7B1_ gene mutation was initially discovered in hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. The _CYP7B1_ gene is located on chromosome 8q21.3, with full length of 202.66 kb, containing six exons and encoding cytochrome P-450 and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. In this case, a homozygous mutation (c.334C>T) was identified in the third exon of the _CYP7B1_ gene. Moreover, this mutation is a known pathogenic mutation. Multiple urine mass spectrometry examinations were performed in this case, while no special metabolites or monohydroxy bile acids (3β-hydroxy-5-cholanoic acid and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid) were detected. We postulated that these test results might be affected by urine concentration and medication to certain extent. Genetic testing, which requires only 2–3 mL of peripheral blood and usually achieves stable results, is not affected by disease status or medication. Although genetic testing has the disadvantage of high cost, it is a stable and reliable method for diagnosis of this disease.\n\n【38】Among the very few reported CBAS3 cases, successful drug treatment was reported in only one patient who took chenodeoxycholic acid before liver function deteriorated significantly, and achieved symptom improvement and restoration of liver functions \\[ 8 \\]. In this case, the patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. Liver function and bilirubin indicators initially increased after drug treatment. The possible explanation is that blood biochemical changes are the final manifestation of a series of changes induced by the drug. This initial increase is also consistent with the findings reported by Dai _et al._ \\[ 8 \\] that, after UDCA treatment, their patient’s condition worsened. However, after prolonged administration of UDCA, both the physical condition and blood biochemical indicators of our patient improved. Unfortunately, the parents of the patient stopped using the drug without consulting us, resulting in a worsening of the symptoms and biochemical examination results. After several attempts, we persuaded the parents to resume the treatment, thus the patient’s symptoms were improved and blood indicator levels decreased again. Unfortunately, the patient developed septicemia on 21 January 2021, and the family gave up treatment. Based on our communication with the patient’s family, we suspect that the family may not strictly follow our prescription, which may partially lead to the deterioration of the patient’s condition.\n\n【39】Although liver transplantation may be the cure for this disease, due to the unavailability of donors and high cost of the surgery, available effective drug treatment will definitely benefit more patients with this type of disease. Here we report an effective and economical treatment for CBAS3, ursodeoxycholic acid replacement therapy. However, due to the rareness of this disease, treatment efficacy and prognosis await further observation.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】Not applicable.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】CBAS3:\n\n【44】Congenital bile acid synthesis disorder type 3\n\n【45】CYP7B1:\n\n【46】Cytochrome P450 7B1\n\n【47】UDCA:\n\n【48】Ursodeoxycholic acid\n\n【49】ALT:\n\n【50】Alanine transaminase\n\n【51】AST:\n\n【52】Aspartate transaminase\n\n【53】GGT:\n\n【54】γ-Glutamyl transferase\n\n【55】aPTT:\n\n【56】Activated partial thromboplastin time\n\n【57】PT:\n\n【58】Prothrombin time", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Patients with obstructing uterine septum are usually treated with laparouterotomy, causing obvious injury to both the uterus and body of the patients. Therefore, using the natural channel of the vagina is undoubtedly the best way to carry out the surgery. However, obstructing uterine septum usually occurs in puberty in girls without a history of sexual intercourse, thus iatrogenic damage to the hymen during the diagnosis and treatment cannot probably be avoided. However, Chinese people traditionally tend to use hymen intactness as a standard to judge whether an unmarried woman is chaste. Therefore, in China, to protect the hymen from damage during hysteroscopic diagnosis and treatment is of special significance for girls and women with unbroken hymens. None of the previously reported cases were treated with electrosurgical obstructing uterine septum excision based on B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Case 1 patient was a _virgo intacta_ 13-year-old Chinese girl. She was admitted due to an 8-day post-menstruation lower abdominal pain. With the guidance of B-ultrasound, we observed a 30mm×20mm mixed echogenicity mass in her uterine cavity. Case 2 patient was a _virgo intacta_ 14-year-old Chinese girl. She was admitted to our hospital more than 6 months after secondary dysmenorrhea and 6 days after B-ultrasound-diagnosed uterine malformations. We observed a 30mm×25mm mixed echoic area in her uterine cavity with the guidance of B-ultrasound.\n\n【5】Both patients were surgically treated without hymen damage with B-ultrasound-guided combined therapy of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. A needle electrode with an 8mm diameter was placed into their uterine cavities under hysteroscopy. After obstructing uterine septum removal, their uterine cavities showed normal morphology. To protect their hymens, misoprostol was placed into their rectums to soften their cervices, so that the hysteroscope could be inserted into their cavities without damaging their hymens.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】_Virgo intacta_ women with obstructing uterine septum could be treated with electrosurgical obstructing uterine septum excision based on B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Obstructing uterine septum (OUS), also known as Robert’s uterus, is a rare obstructive malformation in the Müllerian duct of the uterus. The lower part of the diaphragm is fused with the uterine wall to close the cavity, which in turn can cause hemometra and exacerbated progressing dysmenorrhea. To date, only several studies have been carried out on OUS\\[ 1 – 5 \\]. Patients with OUS were usually treated with laparouterotomy. However, transabdominal plastic surgery of the uterus will obviously cause complete fracture damage to myometrium and form a permanent scar, resulting in a risk of uterine rupture during patients’ subsequent pregnancies and childbirths. Furthermore, transabdominal laparotomy leads to a relatively large wound of the abdominal wall and causes obvious impact on the patient’s abdominal and pelvic organs. Therefore, taking advantage of the natural channel of the vagina is the best way to conduct uterine plastic surgery. However, a conventional hysteroscopy operation requires vaginal speculum distraction. Since OUS usually occurs in adolescent asexual girls, iatrogenic hymen injury will undoubtedly bring physical harm and psychological trauma to the patients, especially in China, where the hymen is of special significance for young women; hymen injury may affect the patient’s marital life in future, and even cause tragedy. Moreover, in general medical practice, physicians should also follow the basic principle of ‘no harm’. Therefore, the approach of hymen-protective hysteroscopic diagnosis and treatment in _virgo intacta_ girls described in this report is of great significance.\n\n【11】Two _virgo intacta_ patients with OUS were admitted to our hospital, and both were treated with electrosurgical OUS excision based on B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Here, we report these two cases.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Case 1\n\n【14】A 13-year-old Chinese girl was admitted to our hospital 2 days after the diagnosis of uterine mass, which was discovered due to an 8-days post-menstruation lower abdominal pain. She had menarche at the age of 11 years and had no dysmenorrhea history. Her last menstrual period started from July 16, 2010. On July 19, she showed paroxysmal left lower quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. A computed tomography examination performed by the local hospital revealed uterine bleeding, and the results of gynecological B-ultrasonic diagnosis indicated that there was a hypoechoic mass in her uterine cavity, which looked like a 2-month-old embryo. After being admitted to our hospital, she was examined, and the results revealed a normal vulva, a large anteverted uterus, and a mass of approximately 6cm in her left uterine cavity. In addition, B-ultrasound of the urinary tract showed normal results.\n\n【15】To perform the surgery, at 10 p.m. 0.4mg misoprostol was placed into her rectum 3 hours before the surgery to soften her cervix\\[ 6 \\]. On July 29, 2010, after anesthesia with intubation, she received B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, and obstructing septal endometrium coagulation. With the guidance of B-ultrasound, we observed adenomyosis-like changes in the left side of her enlarged uterine wall, a 30mm×20mm mixed echo mass in her uterine cavity, and a 40mm thickness of her right-side uterine cavity muscle layer. The results of hysteroscopy revealed normal endocervical mucosa but a narrow angular-shaped right-side uterine cavity and a thin endometrium. One uterine horn and fallopian tube entry could be observed at the topright of her uterine cavity, but we did not observe another fallopian tube entry or other channels connected to the left side of her uterine cavity. Furthermore, the right corner of her uterine cavity showed normal morphology but the left corner was smooth and enlarged, with a 7cm diameter. In addition, her bilateral fallopian tubes and both ovaries showed normal morphology. A resectoscope with an 8mm diameter was placed into her uterine cavity under hysteroscopy, and a needle electrode was used to cut and pierce the OUS with B-ultrasound guidance to expose the endometrial tissues, with some brown fluid observed. During the process of OUS removal, we observed scattered punctate brown endometriosis lesions in the myometrium. Furthermore, using hysteroscopy, we found that the left side of her uterine cavity became smaller.\n\n【16】### Case 2\n\n【17】A 14-year-old Chinese girl was admitted to our hospital more than 6 months after secondary dysmenorrhea and 6 days after B-ultrasound-diagnosed uterine malformations. She had menarche at the age of 12 years and had a normal menstrual history. However, since January, 2010, she started to suffer from menstrual pain, which could not be alleviated until 1 week after menstruation ending. Her last menstrual period started from July 13, 2010. On July 25, the patient showed intensified persistent abdominal pain with anus bulge, which was slightly alleviated with an unclear treatment by the local hospital. She was then admitted to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. An anal examination revealed a slightly larger anteverted uterus with mild tenderness, and the bilateral adnexa were normal. Examination with color B-ultrasound revealed that the anteverted uterine size was approximately 47mm×37mm×30mm, and the morphology was normal; a 46mm×51mm mass was in the left side of her uterine cavity, which showed blood flow signals by color Doppler flow imaging examination and contained a 34mm×30mm echoic area. The myometrial thickness between the echoic area and the endometrium was approximately 12mm. In addition, B-ultrasound examination of her urinary tract showed normal results.B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were performed on August 5, 2010. Misoprostol (0.4mg) was placed into her rectum at night and 3 hours before the surgery to soften her cervix. The results of hymen-protecting hysteroscopy (Figure 1 ) revealed a narrow horn-shaped right-side uterine cavity. One uterine horn and fallopian tube entry could be observed at the top right of her uterine cavity, but we did not observe another fallopian tube entry or other channels connected to the left side of her uterine cavity. The laparoscopy results revealed a small narrow right-side uterine cavity. However, the left side of the cavity was full without a depressed bottom, and showed an enlarged size, which was analogous to 40 days’ pregnancy (Figure 2 ). Her bilateral fallopian tubes and both ovaries showed normal morphology. The B-ultrasonic monitoring revealed a 30mm×25mm mixed echoic area in the left side of her enlarged uterine cavity, and the oblique septum between the bilateral cavities had a thickness of 12mm and a length of 20mm and was diagnosed as OUS. A resectoscope with an 8mm diameter was placed into her uterine cavity under hysteroscopy, a needle electrode was used to cut and pierce the OUS with B-ultrasound guidance, and subsequently a large amount of brown fluid was observed. Under hysteroscopy, her uterine wall blood was cleaned using uterine distention fluid (Figures 3 a and 3 d). After OUS removal, her uterine cavity showed normal morphology, with both sides of horns and fallopian tube entry visible. In addition, we found that the left side of her uterine cavity became smaller and showed normal morphology.\n\n【18】**Figure 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**A photo showing that the hymen of the patient was not damaged after the hymen-protecting hysteroscopy.**\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Figure 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**The laparoscopy revealed a small narrow right-side uterine cavity and an enlarged left-side cavity, which was full and similar to a 40 days’ pregnancy.** The bilateral fallopian tubes and both ovaries showed normal morphology.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Figure 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】**Photos showing that a resectoscope was placed into the uterine cavity under hysteroscopy, and a needle electrode was used to cut and pierce the obstructing uterine septum with B-ultrasound guidance.** A brown blood stain on the uterine wall was observed. **(a)** Photo showing that a resectoscope was placed into the uterine cavity under hysteroscopy, and **(b)** showing that a needle electrode was used to cut and pierce the obstructing uterine septum with B-ultrasound guidance. **(c)** showing a dark brown viscous blood outflowing, **(d)** showing that a brown blood stain on the uterine wall was observed.\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Three months after the surgery, a hysteroscopy of the case 2 patient showed that her middle uterine wall tilted towards the intrauterine line, the bottom of her uterus protruded towards her uterine cavity similar to incomplete uterine mediastina; her left and right uterine horns were relatively deep, and both sides of uterine horns and fallopian tube entry were visible (Figures 4 a and 4 b). Both patients showed normal recovery after surgery. During the following 3 years of follow-up, their dysmenorrhea disappeared, and their menstruation parameters such as amount and period became normal.\n\n【31】**Figure 4**\n\n【32】 \n\n【33】**Three months after the surgery, hysteroscopy of the case 2 patient showed the recovered uterus with normal morphology. (a)** and **(b)** photos showing that the views in the lower and upper view of uterine cavity morphology respectively.\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】OUS is a rare uterine malformation characterized by the moving of the intrauterine septum towards one side, which separates the uterine cavity into two, and the hemorrhage at the latching side can cause secondary dysmenorrhea\\[ 7 \\]. OUS usually occurs after menstrual cramps in puberty in girls without a history of sexual intercourse. B-ultrasound can identify the two separated cavities, and the latching side cavity is enlarged due to the discharge failure of menstrual blood. However, B-ultrasound has its limitations. For instance, it cannot identify the uterus bicornis unicollis with one unconnected rudimentary horn.\n\n【37】Hysteroscopy can be used to directly observe the structure and morphology of the uterine cavity, and can firmly diagnose uterine malformations when combined with laparoscopy. In the present report, both patients were treated with B-ultrasound-guided combined therapy of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, which can further help in the identification of a uterus bicornis unicollis with one unconnected rudimentary horn and complete uterine septum. For rare malformations, compared with the conventional open surgery and laparoscopic plastic surgery, our transvaginal surgical therapy has several advantages as follows: 1) uterine scar and trauma can be avoided; 2) the removal area and depth can be firmly determined to maximally recover the uterine cavity; and 3) the appearance and function of the uterine cavity can be protected to reduce the risk of uterine pregnancy rupture\\[ 7 \\]. Therefore, our therapy is particularly useful for young patients with anticipated pregnancy in the future.\n\n【38】Furthermore, both patients were surgically treated without hymen damage. In the Chinese culture, the hymen is particularly important for young women\\[ 6 \\]. Hence, diagnosis and treatment of uterine diseases in young women have been difficult. Routine diagnosis based on a speculum stretching the vagina always leads to iatrogenic injury to the hymen, resulting not only in physical injuries but also psychological trauma.\n\n【39】The difficulty in hysteroscopic examination of women with an unbroken hymen lies in the tight cervix. To protect the hymen, the cervix cannot be routinely fixed and opened, and thus it is difficult to place the hysteroscope into the uterine cavity. Hence, misoprostol was placed into the rectum of the patients to soften the cervix, so that the hysteroscope could be easily inserted into the cavity without damaging the hymen. During the surgical process, B-ultrasonic monitoring was used to enhance safety. However, the surgeon should still be experienced in hysteroscopy.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】OUS is a rare uterine malformation. OUS usually occurs in puberty in girls without a history of sexual intercourse. Taking advantage of the natural channel of the vagina is the best way to conduct uterine plastic surgery. However, a conventional hysteroscopy operation requires vaginal speculum distraction. Iatrogenic hymen injury will undoubtedly bring physical harm and psychological trauma to the patients, especially in China. The approach of hymen-protective hysteroscopic diagnosis and treatment in _virgo intacta_ girls described in this report is of great significance. Two _virgo intacta_ patients with OUS were successfully treated with electrosurgical OUS excision based on B-ultrasound-guided hymen-protecting hysteroscopy and laparoscopy.\n\n【42】Consent\n-------\n\n【43】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients' legal guardians for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Removal of such large tumors places a huge burden on the surgeon to reconstruct a breast that is aesthetically acceptable by the patient. We report what may be the largest giant phyllodes tumor and, most likely, the first latissimus dorsi flap used to cover such a large defect caused by the resection.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 36-year-old Malaysian woman who presented with a three-year history of gradually increasing swelling of the left breast, with skin changes. Examination revealed a huge, globular, lobulated mass measuring 400 mm by 350 mm. The patient had a mastectomy with an immediate latissimus dorsi pedicled myocutaneous flap reconstruction. The breast weighed 8.27 kg, and _ex_ _vivo_ , the tumor measured 280 mm by 250 mm by 180 mm. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis as a giant phyllodes tumor. At 12-month follow-up, the patient reports no complications and is satisfied with the aesthetic outcome.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Giant phyllodes tumors are very rare tumors that can reach up to 40 cm in diameter. Reconstruction of such a defect is a great challenge, and we report what we believe is the first latissimus dorsi flap to cover successfully a defect of approximately 400 mm by 350 mm.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors that account for about 0.4% of all female breast tumors. Clinically it resembles a fibroadenoma and can be mistakenly left alone. Giant phyllodes tumors are those larger than 10 cm and account for about 20% of all phyllodes tumors \\[ 1 \\]. Although large tumors have been demonstrated in the past \\[ 1 \\], a literature review did not show any previous reports of the use of latissimus dorsi flaps to cover such defects caused by the removal of tumors of comparable size to that in this case.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 36-year-old married Malaysian woman with three breast-fed children presented to our outpatient clinic with a three-year history of a gradually increasing left-sided breast mass. The mass was not associated with any pain or nipple discharge. She denied any weight loss or loss of appetite and had no history of trauma.\n\n【12】She had no past medical history or family history of note and had never smoked or drunk alcohol.\n\n【13】Before the presentation to the clinic, she went to six different traditional healers, who prescribed her topical oils, massaged her breast, and performed prayers for her. These traditional methods did not alleviate her symptoms, and finally she consulted us for further management, as she could no longer hide the huge size of her left breast.\n\n【14】Examination revealed a huge, globular, lobulated mass measuring 40 cm × 35 cm with an inferomedially deviated and retracted nipple with _peau_ _d'orange_ skin changes (Figures 1 and 2 ). A mammogram was not possible because of the size of the lesion, and a core biopsy revealed a phyllodes tumor. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of local or distant metastasis.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】**Anterior view of the breast tumor on presentation to our clinic** .\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】**Right lateral view of the breast tumor at presentation** .\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】The options for treatment were discussed with the patient regarding the removal of the tumor and the reconstruction, and taking in to account the size of the lesion, a mastectomy was the method of choice. As she had reduced abdominal subcutaneous tissue for a transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, she elected a latissimus dorsi pedicled myocutaneous flap (Figure 3 ). In addition to the mastectomy, our patient also underwent a level II axillary clearance because of the high suspicion of malignancy.\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】**Four months after surgery** . Anterior view of the breast four months after the mastectomy and immediate latissimus dorsi reconstruction.\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The resected breast weighed 8.27 kg, and the nipple-areolar complex was sacrificed in view of a possible malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. As the patient had strong religious beliefs, she refused the offer of an expander/implant to provide additional breast volume.\n\n【29】Microscopically, the mass was composed of compressed ducts lined by two-tiered epithelium arranged in clefts and surrounded by an overgrowth of stroma arranged in a leaf-like structure (Figures 4 and 5 ). A borderline giant phyllodes tumor was diagnosed after the identification of five mitoses per 10 high power fields (hpfs) at the most mitotically active area, and a predominantly expanding border with no overt malignant features (Figure 6 ). The tumor had a minimum of 4 cm clear surgical margin, and no removed nodes exhibited any evidence of malignancy. Our patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy (post-operative radiotherapy or chemotherapy) because of the absence of malignant features.\n\n【30】**Figure 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】**H&E staining of the breast tissue (×1.25 magnification)** .

High-power view shows the cellularity of the stroma, with presence of mitosis (arrow) and moderate cellular pleomorphism. The presence of increased mitotic activity (five per 10 high-powered fields (hpfs) in this patient), as well as the moderate cellular pleomorphism, indicates a diagnosis of \"borderline\" phyllodes tumor.\n\n【41】Full size image\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】Phyllodes tumors are rare tumors of the breast that account for about 0.5% \\[ 1 \\] of all female breast tumors. The World Health Organisation criterion is used to classify the phyllodes tumor as benign, borderline, or malignant, depending on the histologic analysis of the lesion.\n\n【44】Giant phyllodes tumors are those that are more than 10 cm in diameter, and account for about 20% of phyllodes tumors \\[ 1 \\]. A review of the literature revealed two cases of giant phyllodes tumor that are of comparable size to that of our patient. The first patient had a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM) reconstruction \\[ 2 \\], whereas the other did not have a reconstruction as a result of direct invasion into the chest wall \\[ 1 \\].\n\n【45】Although surgery is the method of treatment for phyllodes tumor of the breast, the best type of surgery for benign or borderline tumors is debatable (wide local excision or total mastectomy). However, for tumors of similar size to that of our patient, we recommend a total mastectomy to ensure complete removal of the tumor, and an immediate or delayed reconstruction of the breast to provide an added psychological benefit.\n\n【46】Autologous latissimus dorsi flap has long been the standard procedure for breast reconstruction until the introduction of TRAM and DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flaps. Its advantages include minimal functional morbidity as a result of harvesting the muscle, low risk of flap necrosis (1%) \\[ 3 \\] as a result of unsevered neurovascular supply, reduced donor-site morbidity \\[ 4 \\], in addition to its superiority in high-risk patients (diabetics, smokers, obese, and so on) who may be unsuitable for TRAM or DIEP flaps \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【47】The commonest short-term complication is donor-site seroma collection. In general, patients younger than 50 years had a significantly lower incidence of seroma (17%), compared with those older than 50 years (33%) \\[ 5 \\]. Long-term complications include shoulder weakness, donor-site pain, in addition to the development of capsular contracture in some patients with implants \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【48】We propose that after a mastectomy for the removal of giant phyllodes tumor, a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap can be successfully used to provide an excellent aesthetic outcome for most patients \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【49】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【50】Giant phyllodes tumors are rare, and mastectomy is preferred for complete tumor excision. Latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap can be successfully used to reconstruct the breast after the removal of very large tumors and can provide excellent aesthetic results with a low risk of flap necrosis or donor-site morbidity, and can also be used for high-risk patients who may be unsuitable for TRAM or DIEP flaps.\n\n【51】Consent\n-------\n\n【52】Written informed consent in Malay (the patient does not read or speak English) was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

We report a case of coagulopathy induced by marginally increased levels of vitamin E.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 31-year-old Indian man presented with oral bleeding, black tarry stools, and bruising over his back. He had been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low backache and vitamin E for hair loss. He had mild anemia with normal platelet count, thrombin time, and prolonged bleeding time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time. Serum fibrinogen was slightly raised. Mixing studies with pooled normal plasma, aged plasma, and adsorbed plasma were suggestive of deficiency of multiple coagulation factors due to acquired vitamin K deficiency. Serum phylloquinone was normal, while prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II level was increased. Serum alpha-tocopherol was slightly raised. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed multiple gastroduodenal erosions. A final diagnosis of vitamin E toxicity-related coagulopathy was made. The patient responded well to pantoprazole, vitamin K supplementation, multiple fresh frozen plasma transfusions, and other supportive treatments besides the discontinuation of vitamin E supplementation. The coagulation parameters normalized, and the patient was discharged with complete resolution of symptoms and remained asymptomatic during the follow-up for 6 months.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Vitamin E-related inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors with coagulopathy may occur even at marginally increased levels of serum vitamin E. This risk becomes significant in patients receiving other drugs that may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Vitamin E toxicity is rarely observed due to its ready excretion in bile and urine \\[ 1 \\]. However, it has been noted to occur in cases of lipid or hepatobiliary disorders where its absorption or excretion may be altered. High-dose vitamin E supplementation is known to inhibit vitamin K-related enzyme activation relevant for coagulation factor syntheses, such as factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and S. Deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X promotes bleeding \\[ 2 \\], while deficiency of protein C and protein S leads to the loss of their natural anticoagulant effects, with consequent unrestrained thrombin generation, resulting in thromboembolism \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Generally, deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X is the dominant effect and may lead to bleeding. The mechanism of inhibition of vitamin K-related enzyme activation relevant for coagulation factor synthesis is evidenced by the elevation of levels of prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II), due to an increase in under-gamma-carboxylated prothrombin.\n\n【10】Vitamin E excess further inhibits factor IX activation by reducing vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamate and inhibits platelet aggregation \\[ 5 \\]. Thus vitamin E toxicity can present as coagulopathies alongside general complaints such as malaise, nausea, myalgia, and fatigue \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【11】Though it is generally understood that vitamin E toxicity may occur if consumed at levels greater than 1000 mg/day, there is no fixed cut-off point \\[ 7 \\]. The circulating alpha-tocopherol levels depend heavily on the lipid content of the blood. Vitamin E cannot be measured accurately by circulating alpha-tocopherol levels in patients who have very high or very low cholesterol levels. The same applies to patients with average cholesterol levels as well. This is because of the upregulation of biliary and urinary excretion once vitamin E levels increase in the body \\[ 5 \\]. Because of these irregularities in vitamin E metabolism, the minimum dose, form, and duration of vitamin E intake required to induce a clinically significant effect on coagulation pathways are not known \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【12】Vitamin E toxicity may be overlooked as the cause of coagulopathy if serum levels of vitamin E are only marginally increased. We report a case of coagulopathy induced by marginally increased levels of serum vitamin E.\n\n【13】Case report\n-----------\n\n【14】A 31-year-old Indian man, a restaurateur by profession, presented to the emergency services with complaints of low backache for 1 month and oral bleeding, the passage of black tarry stools, and bruising over his back for the last seven days. He had intense nausea and fatigue for several days and began to develop bruising about 1 week ago. He experienced oral bleeding and passed black tarry stools three times, following which he decided to visit the emergency services.\n\n【15】The backache was non-specific in nature. The patient had been taking over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the form of ibuprofen 400 mg infrequently for the past 1 month for his backache, before his current symptoms of bleeding.\n\n【16】The patient had no complaints of bleeding tendencies in the past, such as frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from gums or injuries, gastrointestinal bleeds, bleeding into joints, easy bruising, and hematuria. There was no history of jaundice, peptic ulcer, malignancy, or bony aches and pains. He had never received any blood transfusions. There was no history of the use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and corticosteroids. There was no history of heavy exposure to pesticides, injury, or surgery.\n\n【17】The patient also reported the use of vitamin E supplementation for his complaints of recent onset hair loss and dryness of the skin. He had taken vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for a period of 2 months, which was accompanied by a fairly poor diet due to work-related stressors.\n\n【18】He was a non-smoker. He drank alcohol sparingly and had no drug addictions. He consumed a mixed diet. He was residing in a semiurban area that had moderate air pollution levels.\n\n【19】He was a bachelor and had two elder brothers. His parents and brothers were healthy. There was no family history of any bleeding disorder in either parents, maternal grandparents, uncles, aunts, or siblings. There was no history of any consanguineous marriage in the family.\n\n【20】On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable. He was well-built and in no distress. His pulse rate was 74 beats per minute, blood pressure was 122/78 mmHg, and oral temperature was 37 °C. He had nonspecific thinning of hair over bitemporal regions. Mild pallor and bleeding from the gums were present. Multiple punctate, perifollicular hemorrhages were present over his forearms (Fig. 1 ) along with large ecchymotic patches over his back (Fig. 2 ). Icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, telangiectasis, signs of chronic liver disease, and pedal edema were absent. Neurological examination showed normal higher mental functions with a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 28/30. The flapping tremor was absent. The cranial nerve examination was normal. No ocular movement dysfunction or nystagmus was seen. There were no fasciculations, motor deficits, or incoordination. Tendon jerks were normal and the plantars showed bilateral flexor response. Sensations were intact.\n\n【21】**Fig. 1**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Petechiae over the arm\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Ecchymosis over the back of the patient\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Examination of the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system was normal. Abdominal examination showed no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or ascites. He was evaluated for gingival bleeding and melena.\n\n【30】The laboratory work-up showed low hemoglobin (11.0 g/dL) with normal mean corpuscular volume (87.2 fl), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (28.9 pg), leukocyte count (9900/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), and platelet count (2,72,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). Random blood sugar, liver and renal function tests, and thyroid profile were within normal range. The anemia was evaluated further. Peripheral blood film showed normocytic normochromic red blood cells, with normal white blood cells and platelets. Serum iron was 39 µg/dL, ferritin 22 µg/L, total iron binding capacity 305 µg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase 277 U/L. Anemia was attributed to his bleeding. Bleeding time (BT) was prolonged (7 minutes, reference range 2–6 minutes). Also activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were significantly prolonged (APTT 104.5 seconds, reference range 29–33 seconds; PT > 1 minute, reference range 11.4–14.8 seconds). Thrombin time (TT) was normal (18 seconds, reference range 14–20 seconds). Mixing studies were performed with pooled normal plasma, aged plasma, and adsorbed plasma. Full correction for APTT and PT occurred with pooled normal plasma. Mixing studies with aged plasma as well as adsorbed plasma did not show correction of abnormal PT of the patient’s plasma and were suggestive of deficiency of multiple factors. Factor VIII assay was 100% (reference range 50–150%). Factor IX assay was 9% (reference range 50–150%). The serum fibrinogen level was slightly raised (430 mg/dL, reference range 200–400 mg/dL). Due to the unavailability of resources, further factor assays were not performed.\n\n【31】A possibility of acquired vitamin K deficiency was considered in view of the deficiency of multiple coagulation factors. The patient was investigated further to elucidate the etiology. Serum phylloquinone (vitamin K1) level was normal (1.14 ng/mL, reference range 0.10–2.20 ng/mL). Serum PIVKA-II level was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) and was increased (326.7 mAU/mL, upper normal limit 40 mAU/mL). Serum alpha-tocopherol, which is considered a surrogate marker for serum vitamin E level, was evaluated and found to be slightly raised (20.10 mg/L, reference range 5–18 mg/L).\n\n【32】Ultrasound examination of the abdomen was normal. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed few gastroduodenal erosions with no active bleeding. Urinalysis did not show any abnormality. The stool was negative for occult blood.\n\n【33】Chest X-Ray and X-Rays of the lumbosacral spine were normal. The patient was further evaluated for ankylosing spondylitis, in view of the history of backache, to identify the association of any collagen-vascular disease with his bleeding complaint, and was found to be negative for HLA-B27.\n\n【34】Given the patient’s history, presenting complaints, and investigation findings, a final diagnosis of vitamin E toxicity-related coagulopathy was made. Exogenous vitamin E supplementation was stopped. The patient received intravenous fluids, pantoprazole, vitamin K, vitamin C, multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and other supportive treatments.\n\n【35】The patient’s complaints were alleviated with the treatment and the coagulation parameters normalized. The patient was discharged with complete resolution of symptoms and remained asymptomatic during the follow-up for 6 months.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】This male patient presented with oral bleeding, melena, and bruising over his back. He was taking NSAIDs infrequently for low backache, and vitamin E for hair loss. Investigations suggested the deficiency of multiple coagulation factors due to acquired vitamin K deficiency. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed gastroduodenal erosions. On the basis of normal serum phylloquinone, increased PIVKA-II levels, and slightly raised serum alpha-tocopherol, the patient was diagnosed as having vitamin E toxicity-related coagulopathy, which responded well to pantoprazole, vitamin K supplementation, fresh frozen plasma transfusions, and other supportive treatment besides the discontinuation of exogenous vitamin E administration. As such, this case documents the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors with coagulopathy at only marginally increased levels of serum vitamin E, while vitamin E toxicity-related coagulopathy has been reported earlier at much higher levels of serum vitamin E \\[ 5 , 8 \\].\n\n【38】The extent of vitamin E excess-induced vitamin K suppression varies as per the dose consumed. Any preexisting subclinical deficiency may be unmasked by any level of vitamin E excess, thereby implying that there may be considerable interpersonal variability reflecting the inhibitory effects of vitamin E on individuals with a poor vitamin K status \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【39】Though serum alpha-tocopherol level was only marginally increased and did not confirm the vitamin E-related toxicity convincingly, it is possible that the actual level of vitamin E may be higher than measured, as alpha-tocopherol may not measure the circulating vitamin E accurately.\n\n【40】Vitamin E may compete for the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, which converts the precursors of vitamin K into the active form of vitamin K \\[ 3 \\]. As a result, the activation of inactive vitamin K may be inhibited, thereby preventing the gamma-carboxylation, and thus activation, of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The inability to activate the clotting cascade via these factors may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n【41】Moreover, vitamin E excess decreases the availability of factor IX as it reduces the production of glutamate, which is required for factor IX production \\[ 3 \\]. Platelet aggregation is also decreased in patients receiving vitamin E and may be in part due to a mechanism linked to protein kinase C inhibition \\[ 10 \\]. The bleeding risk due to a marginally elevated level of vitamin E was also aggravated by NSAIDs in our patient.\n\n【42】Normal serum phylloquinone and increased PIVKA-II levels negate the possibility that this patient had vitamin K deficiency leading to gastrointestinal bleeding/skin changes. Moreover, our subject was a young adult and there was no evidence of any of the causes of vitamin K deficiency in adults, such as malnutrition, lipid malabsorption, malignancy, or renal disease \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【43】Prolongation of both PT and APTT, and a normal TT in our patient were suggestive of coagulation factor deficiency in the common pathway (factors II, V, VII, and X), along with factor IX deficiency or presence of inhibitors of prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor V, or factor X. Full correction of the abnormal APTT and PT by pooled normal plasma ruled out factor inhibitors and suggested a deficiency of coagulation factors. The absence of correction of abnormal PT on mixing aged plasma with the patient’s plasma suggested factor V deficiency. The absence of correction of PT on mixing adsorbed plasma with the patient’s plasma was suggestive of factor II, VII, and X deficiency. Moreover, selected assays showed normal factor VIII and raised factor I (fibrinogen) levels, but deficient factor IX levels.\n\n【44】Inherited factor deficiency was not likely because of the absence of any abnormal bleeding until the current episode. Acquired factor deficiency due to liver disease was unlikely in view of normal liver function tests and a normal ultrasound scan of the liver. The absence of thrombocytopenia and a raised serum fibrinogen level excluded the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation causing factor deficiency. A raised fibrinogen level may be due to low serum iron concentrations, caused by blood loss, as a negative correlation was observed between total fibrinogen and serum iron concentrations in a large-scale epidemiological study \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【45】Anticoagulant-induced factor deficiency was ruled out as the patient was not receiving any anticoagulants. The presence of combined factor deficiencies generally implies severe vitamin K deficiency, but it would be reasonable to assume that a secondary factor must exist, as an isolated vitamin K deficiency is rare due to its continual production by the gut microbiome in healthy individuals \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【46】Vitamin E excess potentiated by ill-timed NSAID use could have led to the precipitation of this patient’s complaints \\[ 14 \\]. Vitamin E excess could have inhibited vitamin K-related coagulation factor synthesis and prolonged the BT, while NSAIDs could cause gastroduodenal erosions, besides prolonging the BT, and thus add to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\n【47】Vitamin E toxicity-induced coagulopathy has been described at high levels of serum alpha-tocopherol, but there is a case report of intracranial hemorrhage attributed to vitamin E toxicity occurring at serum alpha-tocopherol level of 23.3 mg/L \\[ 5 \\]. Bleeding manifestations occurred in our case at an even lower level of serum alpha-tocopherol. Our case report highlights the often underscored bleeding risks with vitamin E consumption and that this coagulopathy can also occur at marginally increased levels of vitamin E.\n\n【48】Vitamin E has been lauded for its various dermatological and cardiovascular benefits, all of which are exceptional \\[ 15 \\]. However, the same stellar reputation leads to indiscriminate use by prescription, as well as without prescription, by patients. Though the bleeding risk may be hemodynamically relevant in patients already receiving anticoagulants, our case report reveals that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding could also be increased in patients taking both NSAIDs and vitamin E. Moreover, bleeding from gums, ecchymotic patches over the back, normal serum phylloquinone level, and deficiency of multiple coagulation factors, in the presence of increased PIVKA-II level, were highly suggestive of coagulopathy due to marginally increased vitamin E-related inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors.\n\n【49】As the patient recovered readily with vitamin K supplementation and FFP transfusions, a final diagnosis of vitamin E toxicity-related coagulopathy was reaffirmed, although NSAID intake might have been an aggravating factor.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【51】Vitamin E-related inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors with coagulopathy may occur even at slightly raised levels of vitamin E. This risk is augmented in presence of other drugs that have the potential to cause bleeding.\n\n【52】Thus, patients must be discouraged from taking medications without proper medical consultation. Physicians too must be wary of the potential interactions of substances generally considered harmless.\n\n【53】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This report presents two cases of primary hydatid cysts located subcutaneously: one in the medial thigh and one in the left palm between the index and middle fingers.\n\n【3】### Case presentations\n\n【4】A 64-year-old male farmer visited our hospital because a swelling on the right medial thigh had grown during the last year. Superficial ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a lesion resembling a hydatid cyst. A germinative membrane was encountered during surgical excision. Pathological examination was compatible with a hydatid cyst. The second case involved a 67-year-old male farmer who complained of a swelling that had grown in his left palm in the last year. The preliminary diagnosis was a lipoma. However, a hydatid cyst was diagnosed during surgical excision and after the pathological examination. The patient did not have a history of hydatid cyst disease and hydatid cysts were not detected in other organs. There has been no disease recurrence after following both patients for 3 years.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】A hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cystic lesions in regions where hydatid cysts are endemic, and should be excised totally, with an intact wall, to avoid recurrence.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】A hydatid cyst is a parasitosis caused by the larval form of _Echinococcus granulosus_ or rarely _Echinococcus alveolaris_ . The main hosts for _E_ . _granulosus_ are predators such as dogs, wolves, and foxes, while intermediate hosts include sheep, goats, and cattle. Humans are a coincidental intermediate host. The disease is more frequent in the Middle East, Central Europe, Australia, and South America, where the intermediate hosts are common. The organs affected most often are the liver (70%) and lungs (10–15%). Other locations are extremely rare \\[ 1 \\]. Primary subcutaneous hydatid cyst is very rare and the incidence is unknown. In this report, we present two cases of primary hydatid cysts located subcutaneously: one in the medial thigh and one in the hand.\n\n【10】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【11】A 64-year-old male farmer visited our clinic because of a swelling on the medial thigh that had grown during the last year. On physical examination, a mobile, painless, fluctuant, 8 × 9 cm mass was palpated. The overlying skin was normal. The only abnormality in the pre-operative laboratory examination was an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR 60 mm/hour). The patient had no history of surgery for a hydatid cyst in another organ. Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed a lesion resembling a hydatid cyst (Fig. 1 ). During surgical exploration under spinal anesthesia, the skin and subcutaneous layers were incised and the cyst was reached. Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) was injected into the cyst and after waiting for 10 min, the cyst was completely excised. A germinative membrane was seen during excision (Fig. 2 ). We thought that the cyst was fertile as it contained daughter cysts. The surgical site was irrigated with 40% povidone iodine (Betadine <sup>® </sup> ) and hypertonic saline. The subcutaneous layers and skin were closed in the standard manner.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Subcutaneous hydatid cyst in the right medial thigh, displacing the muscles laterally.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Subcutaneous hydatid cyst in the right medial thigh.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Histopathological examination revealed a hydatid cyst, but no additional hydatid cysts were observed on US or CT of the abdomen and thorax; the indirect hemagglutination test for hydatid cysts was negative. The patient was started on albendazole for 3 months (15 mg/kg/day). No findings associated with local or systemic hydatid cysts were detected during a 3-year follow-up period.\n\n【21】The other case involved a 67-year-old male farmer who complained of a subcutaneous swelling inside the left palm between the index and middle fingers. Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous immobile 2 × 3 cm mass on the palmar side of the left hand between the thumb and index fingers. Surgical excision was planned with a pre-operative diagnosis of lipoma. A hydatid cyst was considered when a germinative membrane was seen during excision under local anesthesia (Fig. 3 ). We also thought that the cyst was fertile as it contained daughter cysts as in the previous patient. The cyst space was irrigated with 40% povidone iodine (Betadine <sup>® </sup> ) and hypertonic saline. Total cyst excision and primary closure were performed, and histopathological examination revealed a hydatid cyst. The only abnormality in the pre-operative laboratory examination was an increased ESR (60 mm/hour). The patient had no history of surgery for a hydatid cyst in another organ, and no additional cysts were observed on US and CT of the abdomen and thorax. The indirect hemagglutination test for hydatid cysts was negative, and the patient was placed on albendazole for 3 months (15 mg/kg/day). No findings associated with local or systemic hydatid cysts were detected during a 3-year follow-up period.\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Germinative membrane of cyst localized in the palmar site of the hand.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Here we report two cases of primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts both treated surgically. In a large series, the distribution of hydatid cysts outside the liver and lungs was reported as 9% of cases \\[ 2 \\]. Chevalier _et al_ . reported that the incidence of subcutaneous hydatid cysts was 2%, but some of the patients had hydatid cysts in other organs too \\[ 3 \\]. Subcutaneous hydatid cyst may be secondary or primary. In secondary cysts, there is a primary location of hydatid disease like liver, lung, or spleen that is operated or not operated. Reports of primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts are very rare \\[ 4 – 6 \\], and we were unable to find a case of a palmar hydatid cyst in a literature review. In our cases, the hydatid cysts were located subcutaneously, the patients had not undergone previous surgery for hydatid cysts, and no hydatid cysts were found in other organs. Therefore, our patients were diagnosed as having primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts.\n\n【28】The mechanism of primary subcutaneous localization is unclear. After being ingested orally, under the action of gastric and intestinal enzymes, the oncosphere is released; it penetrates the intestinal wall, joins the portal system and reaches the liver. If the eggs attach to the liver, an hepatic hydatid cyst takes shape. Parasite eggs can pass to the systemic circulation and cause disease in other end organs. Larvae must pass through two filters (liver and lung) to form a solitary hydatid cyst, but that is very difficult. It is very possible that systemic dissemination via the lymphatic route accounts for cases with solitary cysts in uncommon sites \\[ 4 \\]. Direct spread from adjacent sites may be another mechanism of infection provided a microrupture has occurred \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【29】Diagnosing hydatid cysts is very difficult in patients living outside the endemic regions. Because exposure to the contents of the cyst can cause problems such as anaphylactic reaction and local recurrence, making the diagnosis pre-operatively is important. The diagnosis of a palmar hydatid cyst was not considered in our second patient pre-operatively since the mass was very small and this localization is very rare. When the cyst contents were seen during excision, the possibility of a hydatid cyst was then considered. No anaphylactic reaction developed in either patient.\n\n【30】The radiological findings of a thick cyst wall, calcification, daughter cysts, and a germinative membrane separate from the cyst wall are findings specific to hydatid cysts \\[ 8 \\]. Our first case was diagnosed according to the appearance of the mass on superficial US and CT.\n\n【31】Serology is a useful tool for the diagnosis. The indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test is positive in more than 80% of liver hydatid cysts. However, false negative IHA results can be higher in other located hydatid cyst. In those cases, more specific serologic tests are mandatory. A positive indirect hemagglutination test for hydatid cysts is significant, although negative test results do not indicate the absence of the disease, as in our patients. Therefore, the most important diagnostic tool is the awareness of the physician, particularly for the unusual presentation of the disease.\n\n【32】The best treatment option is total surgical excision without opening the cyst. If the cyst cannot be excised without opening, the fluid contents should be removed, the laminated membrane should be totally excised, and the cyst pouch should be irrigated with protoscolicidal solutions \\[ 9 \\]. Subcutaneous located cysts are more prone to rupture since they have not been diagnosed pre-operatively. We performed total cyst excision in both cases and irrigated the surgical areas with protoscolicidal agents. Identifying postoperative recurrence of the cyst in endemic regions is very difficult because the probability of formation of a new cyst is high. However, since our patients were still free of disease in the third postoperative year, any subsequent hydatid cyst formation may be considered to be a new infestation.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】Hydatid cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cysts in regions where hydatid cysts are endemic. Total excision of the cyst with an intact wall is the best treatment.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before publication of this case series and any accompanying images.

Evidence of myocardial inflammation and necrosis from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging supported the diagnosis of recent myocarditis. Laboratory results and imaging findings were consistent with thyroiditis. After 3 weeks of symptomatic treatment, her symptom and blood tests had returned to normal.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case demonstrates that the adenoviral vector coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine could possibly cause myocarditis and painless thyroiditis. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and promptly evaluate these conditions, despite minimal symptoms.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, effective vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed \\[ 1 \\]. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 \\[recombinant\\], AZD1222), a replication-deficient adenoviral vector vaccine that contains the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene, triggers the immune system to generate an immune response against the coronavirus and retain that information in memory immune cells \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. This vaccine was used for mass vaccination nationally and globally. In Thailand, more than 40 million doses have already been given. The most well-publicized adverse reactions are vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia \\[ 4 \\]. However, there are a few published reports regarding thyroiditis and myocarditis following exposure to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【10】We report the case of a patient who developed concomitant myocarditis and painless thyroiditis after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 55-year-old Thai woman presented with palpitation 14 days after receiving the second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination. She had no history of fever, dyspnea, chest pain, neck pain, or weight loss. Her past medical histories were essential hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She had no history of thyroid disease. On admission, she had tachycardia with a heart rate of 120/min. Other examinations including respiratory rate, body temperature, and thyroid gland were unremarkable. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia without evidence of ST–T segment change. Plain chest radiography showed a normal cardiothoracic ratio and pulmonary vasculature. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was 2007.5 ng/L (normal < 15.6 ng/L). Thyroid function tests showed elevated serum free triiodothyronine of 7.37 pg/mL (normal 1.60–4.00 pg/mL), normal serum free thyroxine of 1.08 ng/dL (normal 0.70–1.48 ng/dL) with suppressed serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 0.113 uIU/mL (normal 0.350–4.940 uIU/mL). Thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and TSH receptor antibodies were negative (Table 1 ). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (4.09 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (11 mm/h) were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses including COVID-19 were negative. Thyroid ultrasound revealed normal thyroid gland size, homogeneous parenchyma without increased Doppler flow. Iodine-131 uptake study showed very low thyroid uptake (3.95% and 4.39% at 3 and 4 hours, respectively), consistent with thyroiditis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal biventricular size and function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) demonstrated basal inferoseptal segment hypokinesia on steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine images (see Additional file 1 ) with evidence of myocardial edema on T2 mapping (64 ms, normal myocardium 41 ms), myocardial hyperemia on early gadolinium enhancement images, as well as myocardial necrosis on delayed gadolinium enhancement images, native T1 mapping (1511 ms, normal myocardium 1229 ms), and postcontrast T1 mapping (320 ms, normal myocardium 536 ms) (Figs. 1 , 2 ). CMR findings were suggestive of recent myocarditis according to the Lake Louise criteria. Endomyocardial biopsy was omitted because of mild symptoms. After 3 weeks of symptomatic treatment with low-dose beta-blocker (propranolol 30 mg/day) and exercise restriction, her symptom and blood tests had returned to normal (Table 1 ).\n\n【13】**Table 1 Blood test results at baseline and follow-up at third week**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with conventional techniques showed multiple signs of acute focal myocarditis at the basal inferoseptal segment of the left ventricle (arrows). **A** Steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine image in basal short-axis (SAX) view demonstrating regional wall motion abnormality. **B** Early gadolinium enhancement image in basal SAX view revealing hyperenhancement, a sign of myocardial hyperemia. **C** , **D** Delayed gadolinium enhancement images in basal SAX and modified four-chamber views depicting hyperenhancement, a sign of myocardial necrosis and fibrosis\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with parametric mapping techniques showed **A** myocardial edema in T2 mapping image, **B** increased T1 relaxation time in native T1 mapping, and **C** , **D** shortened T1 relaxation time in post-contrast T1 mapping\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Myocarditis and pericarditis are well-known potential adverse reactions after mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccine administration \\[ 5 \\]. They are not widely recognized as possible adverse reactions of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, though the incidence of suspected myocarditis–pericarditis following mRNA and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from the vaccine adverse event reporting system was similar (1.6–5.0 versus 2.0–3.7 per million doses, respectively) \\[ 6 \\]. To date, only a few cases of myocarditis following exposure to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have been published \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Our patient age was not common for mRNA-induced myocarditis, but the typical age of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis has not previously been concluded. Vaccine-related myocarditis usually presented with mild symptoms, which resolved spontaneously with conservative treatment \\[ 7 , 9 \\]. A severe form presented with cardiogenic shock and need for hemodynamic support had been scarcely reported \\[ 8 , 10 \\]. Chest pain is the most common presentation; unlike other reports, our case presented with palpitation, which could be a manifestation of myocarditis, thyroiditis, or both \\[ 9 \\]. CMR is recommended, in addition to ECG, cardiac markers, and TTE, for myocarditis with minimal symptoms due to noninvasiveness and trustworthy tissue characterization ability \\[ 11 \\]. This case highlights the significance of CMR for diagnosis of myocarditis, particularly when the presentation is mild and TTE findings are negative.\n\n【25】Post-vaccination thyroiditis, a well-knwon autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), has been reported after various types of vaccine, including all COVID-19 vaccine platforms. This condition predominantly affects women in an age range from 26 to 75 years \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. Symptoms, typically mild and self-resolving without specific treatment, can occur 4–21 days after vaccination. Most patients have neck pain at the onset, while only one case of painless thyroiditis, as in our patient, has been reported \\[ 13 \\]. At the onset of presentation, patients can have hyperthyroid (most common), hypothyroid, or euthyroid status \\[ 13 \\]. Differential diagnoses of post-vaccination thyrotoxicosis included Graves’ disease, and co-occurrence of subacute thyroiditis and Graves’ disease was also reported \\[ 15 \\]. Thyroid antibodies and iodine-131 uptake should be investigated to clarify the etiology of thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【26】AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine contains recombinant replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the SARS CoV-2 spike protein. Possible mechanisms for post-vaccination myocarditis and thyroiditis are molecular mimicry between SARS CoV-2 spike protein and self-antigens (myocyte protein and thyroid peroxidase) as well as triggering of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways \\[ 9 , 16 , 17 \\]. However, the entire mechanism is unclear.\n\n【27】To our knowledge, this is the first case report of concomitant myocarditis and painless thyroiditis following AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine administration. The true association cannot be established, although we demonstrate the temporal relationships between vaccine and these conditions.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】This case demonstrates that the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine could possibly cause myocarditis and painless thyroiditis. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and promptly evaluate these conditions. Given a low incidence and minimal symptoms in most cases, the COVID-19 vaccine is recommended in the pandemic situation because the benefit from the vaccine greatly outweighs the risks.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】The data for this case report are located at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】CMR:\n\n【34】Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【35】COVID-19:\n\n【36】Coronavirus disease 2019\n\n【37】ECG:\n\n【38】Electrocardiography\n\n【39】GRE:\n\n【40】Spoiled gradient echo\n\n【41】SAX:\n\n【42】Short-axis\n\n【43】SSFP:\n\n【44】Steady-state free precession\n\n【45】TTE:\n\n【46】Transthoracic echocardiography\n\n【47】TSH:\n\n【48】Thyroid stimulating hormone", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Severely growth-restricted fetuses (far below 500 g) are thought to be nonviable. Since there have not been effective treatments for such fetal patients, obstetricians have simply tried to identify the optimal timing for their delivery. There are a few reports suggesting that the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil has some limited beneficial effects on fetal growth, but there are no such reports on tadalafil, another derivative phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor which has a much longer half-life than sildenafil. Here we present a case in which the administration of tadalafil to the mother revived the arrested growth and severe oligohydramnios of the very prematurely growth-restricted fetus.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We describe a case of early-onset fetal growth restriction with oligohydramnios in a 41-year-old primigravida Japanese woman who was treated with tadalafil (20-mg tablet daily) from 22 weeks’ gestational age. Ten days after the initiation of the tadalafil therapy, the amniotic fluid level rose and the weight of the fetus began to increase. A 1024-g baby boy was delivered by cesarean at 32 weeks’ gestation. The z-score for fetal head circumference had increased from −2.2 to −1.2, whereas the z-score of the femur legth was decreased to −4.3, indicating that tadalafil preferentially increased the blood flow to important organs.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We achieved two positive results by administering tadalafil to the mother carrying a severely growth-restricted fetus with oligohydramnios. First, the z-scores of head circumference and abdominal circumference had at first declined but started to rise after the tadalafil administration. Second, the amniotic fluid, which was emptied before the tadalafil treatment, recovered to normal range with this treatment. Tadalafil administration to mothers could be a promising therapy to reverse severe fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The management of fetal growth restriction is based on the prolongation of gestation long enough for fetal organs to mature while simultaneously preventing irreversible deterioration of the fetus’ well-being. This policy is used because there has been no treatment to reverse fetal growth _in utero_ until now. The administration of aspirin or oxygen to the mother and in-patient bed rest for the mother were all found to have no beneficial effects on fetal growth in randomized control studies \\[ 1 – 3 \\]. Several promising therapies are currently under development to reverse fetal growth restriction \\[ 4 \\]. One of these therapies is sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor that is used to treat both pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction. In an open-label pilot study, treatment with the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil seemed to be effective in increasing fetal abdominal circumference (AC) of patients with early-onset fetal growth restriction \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【10】The PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil was developed as a medication that was longer acting than sildenafil (the biological half-life of tadalafil is 14 to 15 hours versus sildenafil’s 3 hours) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, erectile dysfunction, and prostatic hypertrophy. We used tadalafil successfully in the following single case of early-onset severe fetal growth restriction.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】At a 19-weeks gestational checkup of a post- _in vitro_ fertilization pre-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) pregnancy of a 41-year-old primigravida Japanese woman, the result of a fetal chromosomal test was normal, and normal amniotic fluid was observed. At 22 weeks and 4 days, severe oligohydramnios was observed (the amniotic fluid index decreased to nearly 0) with the fetal bladder emptied. The estimated fetal weight was 309 g: −2.6 standard deviation (SD). As judged by the biparietal diameter (BPD), the growth of the fetus had been arrested by nearly 4 weeks.\n\n【13】Our patient started to take a 20-mg tablet of tadalafil per day after getting permission from our hospital’s Institutional Review Board (Mie University Hospital approval #135-392), and informed consent for this treatment was obtained from our patient and her husband. Four days after the start of the daily tadalafil therapy, the fetal bladder started to dilate, and at 10 days of treatment the amniotic fluid level was increased (Fig. 1 ). The weight of the fetus started to rise, and the increase in the well-being of the fetus was confirmed by the biophysical score. The mother reported no side effects, including hypotension and headache. She did not develop pregnancy-induced hypertension at any time during the pregnancy.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】The estimated weight of the fetus increased, the fetal bladder dilated, and the amniotic fluid level increased after tadalafil therapy. _EFW_ estimated fetal weight, _MVP_ mean vertical pocket of amniotic fluid, _W_ week\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】The weight of the fetus increased by approximately 50 to 100 g per week. The amniotic fluid maximum vertical distance increased from 0.9 cm to 4.4 cm at 27 weeks’ gestational age, then decreased to <2 cm at 32 week’s gestation. At this time, fetal heart rate monitoring showed many variable decelerations, and the fetus was in the breech position. We informed our patient about this situation, and after careful consideration she and her husband chose to continue to the delivery. At 32 weeks 2 days, we performed a cesarean because the weight of the fetus had reached >1000 g, which is generally thought to guarantee intact survival \\[ 6 \\]. At the moment of the cesarean delivery, the umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) was 0.97, the middle cerebral artery PI was 1.48, and the ductus venosus wave was negative. A 1024-g baby boy was delivered without acidemia, with Apgar scores of 5 and 7 at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. The baby boy is now on an uneventful course at 3-months old.\n\n【19】Figure 2 shows the changes in z-scores of the size parameters of the fetus estimated by ultrasonography. Before the start of tadalafil therapy, the z-scores of head circumference (HC), AC, and femur length (FL) decreased to −2.5. After the completion of the 10-week tadalafil therapy, the HC z-score increased significantly to over −1.5 after 30 weeks’ gestation. The AC z-score kept up with the standard curve, remaining between −1.8 and −2.5. On the other hand, the FL z-score decreased consistently down to −4.3 at 31 gestational weeks.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Change in the z-scores in head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length from before to after tadalafil therapy. _AC_ abdominal circumference, _FL_ femur length, _HC_ head circumference, _SD_ standard deviation, _W_ week\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Figure 3 shows the changes in the Doppler parameters of the fetal arteries and veins. The umbilical artery PI decreased after the tadalafil treatment (from 1.11 to 0.69), although it was within the normal range throughout our patient’s pregnancy. The PI of the middle cerebral artery showed a spearing effect at first (1.15) and decreased temporarily (1.05) for 1 week after the initiation of the tadalafil treatment, then gradually increased to 1.5 at 32 weeks’ gestation. Fluctuations of the PI of the umbilical vein were observed before the tadalafil therapy, but were not seen 7 days after the completion of the therapy. The reverse flow of the ductus venosus seen before the therapy disappeared temporarily, but it appeared intermittently during the treatment course. As for the uterine artery velocimetry, the PI value was not significantly different before or after tadalafil treatment (0.79 and 0.62 respectively), and notching was not observed at any time.\n\n【25】**Fig. 3**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】The parameters of the Doppler examination for fetal arteries and veins. _DV-a_ ( _rev_ ) reverse flow of ductus venosus a-wave, _MCA-PI_ middle cerebral artery pulsatility index, _PI_ pulsatility index, _UA-PI_ umbilical artery pulsatility index, _UV_ umbilical vein, _W_ week\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】A pathological examination of the placenta revealed excessive torsion of the cord, chorangiosis, and infarction, which suggested that placental hypoperfusion may have contributed to the growth of the fetus. There was no funisitis or chorioamnionitis.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】This is the first report of tadalafil being used for the treatment of early-onset fetal growth restriction, to the best of our knowledge. Twenty mg per day of tadalafil — which is the same dosage as that used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension — not only restarted the growth of the fetus but also improved the condition of the fetus, increasing fetal urine and amniotic fluid levels.\n\n【32】Tadalafil was developed in 2009 as a new PDE-5 inhibitor with a longer biological half-life than sildenafil, and it has recently become more widely used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, erectile dysfunction, and prostate hypertrophy. Tadalafil has an advantage in that it can be taken even on a full stomach, unlike sildenafil. To-date, case reports \\[ 7 , 8 \\] and a small pilot trial study \\[ 5 \\] demonstrated that sildenafil had a beneficial effect on early-onset fetal growth restriction. von Dadelszen _et al_ . \\[ 5 \\] reported that their group ( _n_ \\= 10) of cases of fetal growth restriction treated with sildenafil showed significantly increased ACs compared with a group of retrospectively gathered cases of fetal growth restriction ( _n_ \\= 17). Theoretically, tadalafil seems to be a better choice than sildenafil because it can achieve a steadier blood concentration and effects.\n\n【33】The rationale for the use of tadalafil therapy in the present case – the reason why the fetus would have died without life-saving intervention – is twofold. First, early-onset fetal growth restriction that shows umbilical venous fluctuation and reverse ductus venosus flow, which were observed in this case, is the strongest predictive factor for intrauterine fetal death \\[ 9 \\]. Second, almost one-half of the reported cases of early-onset fetal growth restriction were complicated with severe oligohydramnios and destined to die \\[ 10 \\]. We believe that in the present case the tadalafil therapy contributed to the improved intrauterine environment and to the extension of the pregnancy to 32 week’s gestation, and finally to the uncomplicated post-delivery course.\n\n【34】It is interesting to note the different rates of the growth curves of the HC, AC, and FL z-scores in our patient (Fig. 2 ). The HC z-score increased significantly after the initiation of tadalafil therapy and finally became within normal range, whereas the FL z-score progressively worsened to −4.3. The AC z-score remained between −1.8 and −2.5. These findings indicate that tadalafil preferentially dilates the fetal arteries and distributes blood flow to more important organs such as the brain. In contrast, tadalafil might have increased the placental circulation through the internal iliac arteries at the expense of the blood flow of the external iliac arteries to inferior extremities.\n\n【35】The umbilical artery PI decreased after the initiation of tadalafil treatment in the present case, as Dastjerdi _et al_ . reported for sildenafil \\[ 11 \\], whereas the middle cerebral artery PI temporarily decreased for 1 week after the initiation of tadalafil treatment in our patient, unlike the Dastjerdi report. This result indicates that tadalafil was transferred through the placenta and dilated the cerebral arteries as well as placental arteries, even as its brain-sparing effect had already been exerted.\n\n【36】Another interesting finding in the present case was that the reverse flow of the ductus venosus appeared intermittently after the normalization that was induced by tadalafil therapy. This indicates that tadalafil dilated not only arteries but also veins of the placenta, which led to an increase in the venous flow to the heart, manifested as a reverse return of the ductus venosus.\n\n【37】A limitation of this case report is that it involves only one case, and thus no conclusions can be made regarding the best timing for tadalafil treatment or its potential maternal and fetal adverse effects (including long-term effects), or the evolution of Doppler parameters.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【39】Tadalafil administration to mothers could be a promising therapy to reverse severe fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios. However, the present case highlights the need for further research about this use of tadalafil, with animal models and clinical studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Pneumorrhachis is the rare finding of gas within the spinal canal, most commonly reported in the context of cerebrospinal fluid leakage secondary to trauma or spinal instrumentation. To our knowledge there is only one other reported case of pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous cystitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This is a single case report of pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous cystitis. An 82-year-old Asian female patient originally from East Asia, with no prior medical history besides hypertension, presented to hospital with a chief complaint of acute on chronic neck pain and functional decline. Examination revealed nonspecific neurosensory deficits and suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory investigations demonstrated leukocytosis and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase containing _Escherichia coli_ bacteremia and bacteriuria. Computed tomography showed emphysematous cystitis with widespread gas within the cervical and lumbar spinal canal, as well as multiple gas-containing soft tissue collections in the bilateral psoas muscles and paraspinal soft tissues. Despite prompt antimicrobial therapy the patient passed away within 48 hours from septic shock.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our case adds to a growing body of literature showing that the spread of air to distant sites, including the spine, may be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with gangrenous intraabdominal infections. This report highlights the importance of recognizing the causes and presentation of pneumorrhachis to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening and treatable causes.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Emphysematous cystitis is a life threatening, necrotizing infection of the bladder characterized by air within the bladder wall. It is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes and is caused by gas forming bacterial or fungal infections \\[ 1 \\]. Pneumorrhachis is the rare finding of gas within the spinal canal. Most commonly, pneumorrhachis is due to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak secondary to trauma or spinal instrumentation; however, it can occur rarely in the context of gangrenous intraabdominal infection \\[ 2 \\]. We describe a case of an elderly female patient who presented with concurrent emphysematous cystitis, iliopsoas, and paraspinal abscesses, and pneumorrhachis. We present theories regarding the origin and spread of air to distant sites, such as the spine, in our patient.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 82-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic neck pain, weakness, and functional decline. Two months prior to her presentation, she developed worsening neck pain and lower extremity weakness, which quickly progressed to near paralysis, resulting in her becoming bed-bound. Her neck pain was described as a posterior sharp, stabbing-like pain, which progressed in intensity over 2 months and limited her ability to mobilize in the week preceding presentation. She also reported paresthesias and numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally. She denied a history of fevers, chills, or other focal neurologic deficits such as photosensitivity or headaches. She also reported intermittent lower abdominal pain and discomfort over the preceding month, but denied further genitourinary symptoms such as dysuria or urinary frequency. Prior to the onset of these symptoms, she had been entirely functionally independent and previously worked as a pharmacist. The patient’s medical history was notable only for hypertension. She had no recent history of trauma or injury. She had no history of diabetes mellitus. Her only medication was an angiotensin receptor blocker. The patient had immigrated to Canada from East Asia approximately ten years prior to this presentation and had minimal contact with the healthcare system since immigrating to Canada. She was a lifetime nonsmoker and did not consume alcohol or illicit drugs.\n\n【12】Clinical findings\n-----------------\n\n【13】On initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed and diaphoretic. Her temperature was 37.4 °C. The remainder of the vital signs were within normal ranges. Axial rotation of the neck was limited to 20° left and right due to pain. There was marked tenderness to palpation along the cervical spine. She also had weakness, with 1/5 power on flexion and extension of the lower extremities bilaterally. Plantar reflexes were up-going bilaterally, and there was diminished sensation to light touch bilaterally, below L2 dermatome. Upper extremity strength was normal. Jolt accentuation, Kernig, and Brudzinski signs were all negative. Abdominal examination revealed suprapubic tenderness, without guarding, rebound tenderness, or rigidity. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n\n【14】Diagnostic assessment and interventions\n---------------------------------------\n\n【15】Initial laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis of 17.3 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /L with neutrophil predominance and lactate of 4.7 mmol/L, platelet count of 44 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and urinalysis showing 3+ proteinuria with positive nitrites and leukocytes. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1 . An initial computed tomography (CT) of the head and cervical spine (Fig. 1 ) demonstrated a locule of gas within the upper cervical spinal canal, without a clear source. Further investigation with CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed (Fig. 2 ), which demonstrated multiple gas-containing soft tissue abscesses within the bilateral psoas muscles and thoracic paraspinal soft tissues, as well as emphysematous cystitis. Additional locules of gas were also demonstrated within the lumbar spinal canal (Fig. 3 ). There was no evidence of emphysematous pyelonephritis. Overall, the constellation of findings raised concern for widespread infection with a gas-forming organism. Blood and urine cultures returned positive for Gram-negative bacilli, and the patient was treated empirically with ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously daily. Over the next 24 hours, the patient rapidly deteriorated. Her blood and urine cultures speciated to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive _Escherichia coli_ and her antibiotics were broadened to meropenem 500 mg every 6 hours. She subsequently became hemodynamically unstable with hypotension and bradycardia, with a heart rate in the 30s (beats per minute). An electrocardiogram (ECG) (Fig. 4 ) demonstrated new high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, prompting transfer of the patient to the cardiac critical care unit for cardiac pacing and advanced supportive care. Of note, her initial ECG on admission (Fig. 5 ) demonstrated second degree AV block with 2:1 conduction; there was no prior ECG for comparison. Within the next 12 hours, the patient developed sudden onset slurred speech and decreasing level of consciousness. A code stroke protocol CT demonstrated new bilateral cerebellar infarcts, with proximal basilar artery occlusion (Fig. 6 ). The source of her brainstem stroke was presumed to be from critical illness and an existing clot, which was either embolic or thrombosis _in situ_ due to preexisting atherosclerotic plaque. There was no evidence of vegetation on a transthoracic echocardiogram, and no suggestion of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) on review of peripheral smear. She was not a candidate for endovascular treatment or tissue plasminogen activator. She was intubated for airway protection. Over the subsequent hours the patient developed refractory hypotension, despite vasopressive medications, owing to her ongoing septic shock, and her heart rhythm progressed to asystole.\n\n【16】**Table 1 Laboratory investigations**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】Computed tomography of the cervical spine demonstrating locules of gas within the upper cervical spinal canal (black arrow)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**a** Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrating extensive gas within the bladder wall (white arrows), consistent with emphysematous cystitis, as well as bilateral gas-containing psoas abscesses (black arrows). **b** Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrating a gas-containing paraspinal collection (black arrow)\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrating gas within the lumbar spinal canal (black arrow)\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Fig. 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Electrocardiogram demonstrating complete heart block\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】**Fig. 5**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】Initial electrocardiogram on admission demonstrating second degree atrioventricular block with 2:1 conduction\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Fig. 6**\n\n【39】 \n\n【40】Non-contrast head computed tomography demonstrating a subacute infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere\n\n【41】Full size image\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】There are simultaneously two rare processes driving this patient’s presentation: pneumorrhachis and emphysematous cystitis.

Most commonly, pneumorrhachis is post-traumatic or iatrogenic in nature, but has also been reported in cases of intraspinal infection, gas-containing synovial cysts, and as a complication of intravenous drug abuse \\[ 2 \\]. Rarely, pneumorrhachis has been described in the setting of a gangrenous intraabdominal infection, as in our case. To our knowledge, there has only been one other reported case of pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous cystitis \\[ 4 \\]. Three other case reports describe emphysematous pyelonephritis and pneumorrhachis \\[ 2 , 5 , 6 \\]. Emphysematous cystitis is the finding of free air in the bladder wall and lumen \\[ 1 \\], typically a consequence of untreated complicated urinary tract infection, especially in elderly women with diabetes mellitus. Mortality rates have been reported to be as high as 90% in medically managed patients \\[ 7 \\], owing to the severity and rapidity of infection spread with gas-producing organisms. Management of emphysematous cystitis consists of prompt antimicrobial therapy, urinary catheterization, glycemic control, and in some cases, percutaneous laparoscopic or even open surgical intervention. Management of pneumorrhachis is largely aimed at treating the underlying cause, but may require surgical intervention for complications such as tension pneumorrhachis with spinal cord compression \\[ 8 \\]. The clinical presentation for both emphysematous cystitis and pneumorrhachis is nonspecific, and a high index of clinical suspicion and radiographic confirmation are required to make the diagnosis. While patients with emphysematous cystitis may present with symptoms of lower urinary tract infection including dysuria, suprapubic pain, and fever, many are diagnosed on imaging alone, without clinical symptoms \\[ 9 \\]. Pneumorrhachis is usually asymptomatic but can present with pain and discomfort in conjunction with nonspecific neurologic sensorimotor deficits, as in our patient \\[ 3 , 10 \\].\n\n【44】Both emphysematous cystitis and pneumorrhachis are inherently image-dependent diagnoses, requiring the visualization of air within the bladder wall and thecal sac, respectively. Most commonly, they are diagnosed on CT or ultrasound, often performed to rule out other causes of the patient’s symptoms \\[ 5 \\]. Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) may be a helpful adjunct investigation, especially in evaluating for spondylodiscitis or spinal and soft tissue abscesses.\n\n【45】There are several theories regarding the origin and route of infection and the route of spread in our patient. The first possibility, which we favor, is that the infection began within the bladder, and subsequently tracked into the bilateral iliopsoas muscles, paraspinal muscles, and eventually traversed into the spinal canal. There was a high likelihood the patient also had discitis and/or epidural abscess, given the distribution of disease; however, this was not confirmed as the patient was too medically unstable to safely perform MRT of the spine. The second theory is that the disease process began within the spine and subsequently proceeded to the bladder. Lastly, given that the patient was bacteremic, hematologic dissemination of infection is another possibility. Nevertheless, determining the precise route of infection would not have impacted the management or the outcome of the patient.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【47】Our case adds to the growing body of literature describing pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous intraabdominal infections. In our patient, pneumorrhachis presented with a chief complaint of neck pain and was discovered incidentally on a noncontrast CT of the cervical spine, prompting further investigation and leading to the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis. This highlights neck pain as an important presenting clinical symptom of pneumorrhachis. Given the rapidity of disease progression in our patient, we argue that the spread of air to distant sites, including the spine, should be considered a poor prognostic indicator in gangrenous intraabdominal conditions, such as emphysematous cystitis.\n\n【48】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】All data acquired for this case report are included in the submitted article and its additional information files.\n\n【50】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【51】CSF:\n\n【52】Cerebrospinal fluid\n\n【53】CT:\n\n【54】Computed tomography\n\n【55】ECG:\n\n【56】Electrocardiogram\n\n【57】MRI:\n\n【58】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【59】ESBL:\n\n【60】Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase\n\n【61】DIC:\n\n【62】Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\n【63】AV:\n\n【64】Atrioventricular", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis was assisted by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 44-year-old Han Chinese inmate was transferred to the emergency department because of dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The patient’s body temperature rose to 39.3 °C following empirical cephalosporin treatment for 1 week. The blood CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 0.7, suggesting immunodeficiency. Routine microbiological tests were performed, and tuberculosis interferon gamma release assays were positive. _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ polymerase chain reaction was also positive. Chest computed tomography scan revealed miliary nodules and ground-glass opacifications, which were in accordance with tuberculosis. To fully examine the etiology, we performed routine laboratory tests and metagenomic sequencing, the results of which indicated the presence of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _Tropheryma whipplei._ We administered anti-tuberculosis regimen in combination with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient recovered, with chest computed tomography scan showing absorption of lesions.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Compared with traditional diagnostic methods such as culture and serology, metagenomic next-generation sequencing has the advantage of detecting a wide array of microorganisms in a single test and therefore can be used for clinical diagnosis of rare pathogens and microbial coinfections. It is particularly useful for immunocompromised patients as they are more prone to infection by opportunistic microorganisms.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Here we review a case of community-acquired pneumonia caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (MTB) and _Tropheryma whipplei_ (TW). MTB is a species of pathogenic bacteria in the family _Mycobacteriaceae_ and the causative agent of tuberculosis \\[ 1 \\]. TW is a Gram-positive _Actinobacteria_ and the causative agent of Whipple’s disease \\[ 2 \\]. TW is commonly found in the environment and can be carried by 1.5–7% of healthy individuals without causing symptoms \\[ 3 \\]. MTB may occur concomitantly with other infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \\[ 4 \\]. However, clinical reports of MTB and TW coinfection are scarce.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 44-year-old male patient (Han Chinese ethnicity) experienced dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath for 2 weeks and was transferred to the emergency department at Shuguang Hospital. The patient has been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis C and had a history of intravenous drug use. Upon admission, we conducted a physical examination that showed a body temperature of 39.3 °C, pulse of 117 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22–30 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 120/84 mmHg. The patient had normal development and body shape, and was conscious but showed signs of malnutrition. Skin was normal without yellow dye, erythema, rash, or pigmentation. Lymph glands were not enlarged. Chest auscultation indicated rough breath sounds and moist rales in both lungs. Furthermore, bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed miliary nodules and ground-glass opacifications in both lungs (Fig. 1 a, b).\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Bronchoscopy and chest computed tomography image. **a** . Images taken during bronchoscopy showing miliary nodules. **b** . Chest computed tomography image showing ground-glass opacifications in both lungs\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Next, we carried out routine laboratory tests, and the results were as follows: SpO <sub>2 </sub> 90% (breath via facial mask, FiO2 50%), PaO <sub>2 </sub> 52 mmHg, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 26 mmHg, pH 7.5, Base Excess (BE) 0.6 mmol/L, Lactate concentration (Lac) 2.1 mmol/L, Oxygenation Index (OI) 101 mmHg, white blood cell count (WBC) 7.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, Neutrophil (N) 89%, C-reactive protein (CRP) 111.7 mg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) 0.67 ng/ml, total bilirubin (TBiL) 31.8 μmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 59 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 135 U/L, albumin (Alb) 24 g/L, and CD4+/CD8+ 0.7. The microbiological culture of sputum reported Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci and _Candida albicans_ . Acid-fast stain, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ tests were negative. Bacterial and fungal culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were negative. Galactomannan test (GM test) using BALF was negative. Blood culture was negative. Serum β- d \\-Glucan test (G test) was negative. Tuberculosis immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) tests were negative. However, the interferon alpha release assays including T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) were positive. As a result, we performed metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) tests on BALF (DNA sequencing), which reported one read of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and 43 reads of _Tropheryma whipplei_ . To further confirm the presence of MTB, we carried out MTB fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which was positive for MTB with no detection of rifampicin and isoniazid antibiotic resistance (Table 1 ).\n\n【17】**Table 1. Results of MTB fluorescent PCR**\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】Combining clinical manifestation and above-mentioned microbiological data, we diagnosed the patient with community-acquired pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that was caused by coinfection of MTB and TW. We then performed endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 1.44 g three times per day orally, isoniazid 0.3 g once per day orally, rifapentine 0.6 g twice per week orally, amikacin 0.6 once per day intravenous guttae (ivgtt), and ethambutol 0.75 g once per day orally.\n\n【20】After 14 days of treatment, the patient’s body temperature returned to normal with improvement of blood oxygen saturation. Chest CT scan displayed absorption of ground-glass opacifications (Fig. 2 a). Ventilator was removed, and the patient was given high-flow nasal cannula. At 21 days posttreatment, chest CT scan showed significant absorption of miliary nodules (Fig. 2 b).\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Chest computed tomography images after treatment. **a** .

TW could cause both acute and chronic infections and can colonize healthy individuals. On the other hand, TW is known to cause acute pneumonia, which was previously reported to be associated with aspiration pneumonia as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \\[ 6 \\]. TW infection may initially lead to fever and idiopathic or migratory arthritis and progress to cause steatorrhea, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites. Notably, approximately 30% of TW infection affects the lung, resulting in respiratory symptoms including dry cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and pleural adhesion. There are at least 11 clinical reports involving TW and interstitial lung disease \\[ 7 \\]. In a study using mNGS and BALF samples collected from 210 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with pneumonia, six (3%) contained sequencing reads specifically aligned to TW \\[ 8 \\]. In addition, TW is commonly found in HIV patients, who have poses a higher risk of pulmonary infection \\[ 9 \\]. Considering that pulmonary alveoli contain macrophages, which TW mainly targets, they may serve as primary sites of TW colonization or infection.\n\n【27】Diagnosis of TW is usually difficult owing to the paucity of microbiological tests. The antibody titer is low in serum, making a serology test ineffective at diagnosing TW infection \\[ 10 \\]. Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain has been a traditional and primary diagnostic method for TW. However, the presence of other pathogens including _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ and _Mycobacterium avium_ may produce false-positive results \\[ 11 \\]. Moreover, TW is auxotrophic and takes ~18 hours for one proliferation cycle, making bacterial culture impractical. However, with the development of nucleic acid tests, PCR-based and sequencing-based molecular assays have proven to be effective for TW detection and, hence, have become the main diagnostic choice \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【28】Guidelines for treating TW infection are currently lacking. Literature suggests a variety of antimicrobial regimen, including penicillin 12,000 units/day \\[ 13 \\], tetracycline 600 mg/day \\[ 14 \\], TMP/SMX 160/800 mg/day \\[ 15 \\], TMP/SMX 160/800 mg/day with ceftriaxone 2 g/day or meropenem 3 g/day \\[ 16 \\], and doxycycline 200 mg/day with hydroxychloroquine 600 mg/day \\[ 15 \\]. In our case, the patient has type 2 diabetes and has been serving a sentence in prison. According to one study, the incidence rate of MTB infection in prison (657/100,000) is 3.75-fold higher than in the general population \\[ 17 \\]. The malnutrition state, positive for blood T-SPOT.TB and QFT-G tests, as well as miliary nodules seen on chest CT were all consistent with tuberculosis. The diagnosis was further corroborated by mNGS and PCR. The low read number may be due to difficulties in nucleic acid extraction, as the cell walls of MTB are rich in lipid and hard to break by either chemical or physical means. In addition to miliary nodules, ground-glass opacifications were also evident on chest CT that indicate infection of additional pathogens. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ was less than 1, suggesting an immunodeficient state of the patient. We initially did not administer anti-TB treatment but were able to observe some absorption of exudation around miliary nodules after use of antibiotics. By adding anti-TB therapy, most pulmonary lesions were absorbed within 3 weeks (Fig. 2 b). Moreover, we ruled out pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage and proteinosis because of the following evidence: (1) blood was not present in BALF; (2) the patient has been diagnosed with hepatitis C, which was classified as Child–Pugh class A with normal international normalized ratio (INR); (3) BALF was clear, and no precipitates were seen after centrifugation; and (4) PAS stain was negative. As a result, combining these clinical observations with presence of MTB and TW sequencing reads by mNGS, we concluded that the patient had a pulmonary coinfection of MTB and TW.\n\n【29】In summary, TW is less commonly detected in the general population than in immunocompromised individuals. Opportunistic infection and coinfection of TW is possible. Pulmonary TW infection is usually indistinguishable from other bacterial infections. As a result, nucleic acid tests such as mNGS are especially valuable for identification and differential diagnosis of TW infection. We also confirmed in our case that oral administration of TMP/SMX was effective in treating pulmonary TW infection.\n\n【30】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】All pertinent data are presented in this case report.\n\n【32】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【33】mNGS:\n\n【34】Metagenomic next-generation sequencing\n\n【35】MTB:\n\n【36】_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_\n\n【37】TW:\n\n【38】_Tropheryma whipplei_\n\n【39】ARDS:\n\n【40】Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【41】TMP/SMX:\n\n【42】Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\n\n【43】BALF:\n\n【44】Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The most common sites of osteoid osteoma are the subcortical shaft and metaphyses of long bones, but any other skeletal bone site can be involved. The acetabulum is a rare site according to past reports. This site presents challenges to optimal management because it is anatomically difficult to approach, and because its rarity leads to limited experience with therapeutic procedures. Here, we report for the first time a rare case of osteoid osteoma in the acetabulum that was successfully treated via resection of the nidus and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator under computed tomographic guidance.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 9-year-old Japanese girl presented at a clinic with left hip pain without apparent cause for 1 month. She was diagnosed as having coxitis simplex. However, her pain did not change for 1 year and she was admitted to another hospital where osteoid osteoma in her left acetabulum was suspected. She was then referred to our hospital approximately 1 year after first symptom presentation, where she presented with severe left hip pain and was completely unable to walk. Computed tomography examinations revealed a well-demarcated 5 mm mass with bone sclerosis in her left acetabulum. The mass was characterized by low intensity on T1 and high intensity on T2 magnetic resonance images. These findings were consistent with osteoid osteoma of left acetabulum. She underwent computed tomography-guided resection of nidus and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator. A histological examination confirmed acetabular osteoid osteoma. Complete pain relief was achieved after the procedure and she experienced no complications. She could walk without any pain at the final follow-up 1 year post-treatment and no local recurrence was observed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We successfully treated acetabulum osteoid osteoma without any symptom recurrence by computed tomography-guided resection and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator. In addition, we preserved our patient’s sciatic nerve and triradiate cartilage. Our report provides evidence that a computed tomography-guided procedure should be considered the treatment of choice for osteoid osteoma of the acetabulum because it is a less invasive alternative to _en bloc_ resection.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Osteoid osteoma (OO) is a benign bone tumor characterized by a nidus with a maximum growth potential of 2 cm and surrounded by reactive sclerotic bone \\[ 1 \\]. Pain is the presenting symptom. The pain is often nocturnal and usually responds to anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin. OO selectively develops in adolescents and young adults \\[ 2 \\]. OO accounts for approximately 10% of all benign bone tumors. The most common sites are the subcortical shaft and metaphyses of long bones, such as the femur \\[ 3 \\], but any other skeletal bone can be involved. The acetabulum is a rare site according to past reports, accounting for approximately 1% of OO lesions \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. The rarity of acetabular OO is a challenge to optimal management because of limited surgeon experience with therapeutic procedures. Another challenge to an approach is presented by its difficult anatomical location proximal to the sciatic nerve and triradiate cartilage. Over the past two decades, less invasive computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous surgical methods, including resection, drilling, and ablation, have superseded open _en bloc_ resection for OO \\[ 6 \\]. However, these procedures are technically challenging, with the acetabulum positioned near neurologic structures as well as juxta-articular and intra-articular localizations \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. In this report, we present a rare case of OO arising from the acetabulum that was successfully treated with CT-guided resection and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator. In addition, we preserved the sciatic nerve, by making a small incision, and the triradiate cartilage using intraoperative images. No local recurrence or symptoms were observed at the latest follow-up 1 year post-treatment.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A healthy 9-year-old Japanese girl presented to a clinic with left hip joint pain without apparent cause for 1 month. She was diagnosed as having coxitis simplex. Although she had taken anti-inflammatory drugs, her pain did not change for 1 year. She was then sent to another hospital, where OO in her left acetabulum was suspected. As a result, she was referred to our hospital approximately 1 year after her first symptom presentation, where she presented with severe left hip pain and was completely unable to walk. Radiographs of her left hip showed no obvious osseous abnormality (Fig. 1 ). In contrast, CT examinations revealed a well-demarcated 5 mm mass with limited bone sclerosis in her left acetabulum (Fig. 2 ). The mass was characterized by low intensity on T1 and high intensity on T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. MRI also revealed joint effusion (Fig. 3 ). Clinical and radiological findings were consistent with OO of the left acetabulum. She underwent CT-guided resection of the nidus and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator at a power output of 15 W for 60-seconds duration (Fig. 4 ). This procedure was performed under total anesthesia and in the prone position. We identified the positional relationship between the nidus, triradiate cartilage, and sciatic nerve using a CT marker. After making a small 3-cm long incision while avoiding her sciatic nerve, a guide pin was inserted. A 5.0 mm cannulated drill was inserted over the guide pin to remove the nidus, which was then sent for histological examination. Next, ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator was performed to completely destroy any residual tumors. To preserve her triradiate cartilage, the position of the electrode tip was confirmed on intraoperative images during each step. The technical tips and pearls of CT-guided resection are summarized in Table 1 . A histological examination confirmed the characteristic appearance of OO (Fig. 5 ). Complete pain relief was achieved beginning on the first postoperative day. Our patient could walk without any pain at the final follow-up 1 year post-treatment, and no local recurrence was observed.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Patient radiographs on admission.

In order to resect and ablate the nidus, a computed tomography-guided procedure was selected to minimize the invasiveness of surgery. First, the positional relationship between the nidus, triradiate cartilage, and sciatic nerve was identified using a computed tomography marker ( _left_ ). After making a small incision to avoid the sciatic nerve, a guide pin was inserted toward the nidus. A 5.0 mm cannulated drill was inserted over the guide pin to remove the lesion and the specimen which resided in the cannulated drill was sent for histological study. Subsequently, heat ablation was performed using a standard electrosurgical generator to destroy any residual tumors ( _middle_ ).

Histological findings showing random reticular osteoid formation within a fibrovascular stroma, consistent with osteoid osteoma\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】The acetabulum is a rare OO site. According to prior reports \\[ 4 , 9 , 10 \\], OO in the acetabulum accounts for only 0.67 to 4.85% of all OO sites. An OO diagnosis can be confirmed by a combination of images \\[ 5 \\]. Plain radiographs can detect an oval, radiolucent central nidus surrounded by a dense, reactive sclerotic mass, specifically for cortical lesions. However, OO detection by plain radiography alone is difficult for intramedullary lesions or a location on the spine, pelvis, hands, or feet \\[ 11 \\]. These locations are frequently associated with a delayed diagnosis, as was seen in our case. CT scans are the most accurate imaging technique for observing the nidus in complex anatomic sites such as the pelvis and spine.\n\n【36】OO is characterized by local pain that is more frequent and severe at night. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, are justified nonsurgical palliative treatments. For cases of severe pain with little to no response to pharmacologic treatment, surgical treatment is recommended to prevent developmental complications, such as growth disturbances \\[ 12 \\].\n\n【37】Surgical treatment for acetabular OO is challenging because of limited surgeon experience with therapeutic procedures and the complex anatomical location proximal to the sciatic nerve and triradiate cartilage. Although numerous surgical approaches to acetabulum OO have been described, including open surgical hip arthroscopy and CT-guided approaches \\[ 5 , 10 \\], optimal management for acetabular OO has not been established.\n\n【38】In 1990, Voto _et al._ reported the successful treatment of OO by percutaneous CT-guided resection \\[ 13 \\]. Over the past two decades, several CT-guided percutaneous treatments have been described, including drilling, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), ethanol injection, and a combination of these methods. These procedures are less invasive than open _en bloc_ resection and have superseded open procedures \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【39】Of these CT-guided procedures, CT-guided RFA has become the preferred method owing to its low morbidity rate, minimal postoperative complications, minimal tissue exposure, rapid recovery, and lack of restriction to weight-bearing activities. The healing rate is 76 to 100%, with a major complication rate of 0 to 5%. However, there are reports of articular cartilage damage in weight-bearing joints after CT-guided RFA: one patient experienced articular cartilage damage to the talus and another had damage to the acetabulum \\[ 5 , 14 \\]. In addition, because the system is expensive, percutaneous RFA is performed in only a few hospitals worldwide \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【40】It was reported that CT-guided ablation for OO using a standard electrosurgical generator instead of an RFA system produced efficacy and safety results similar to those achieved with a RFA \\[ 15 \\]. A standard electrosurgical generator is available in nearly all hospitals and can be more conveniently obtained than RFA systems.\n\n【41】The most severe complication following ablation of the acetabulum is a burn of the normal surrounding soft tissue, including the sciatic nerve and the triradiate cartilage. However, it was reported that the size of the ablated diameter using a standard electrosurgical generator at 15 W was only 5 mm, and that at 30 and 50 W it was only 9 mm. In addition, the duration of heat applied (30 to 120 seconds) did not make a difference to the size of the ablated lesion. Furthermore, an electrode of standard electrosurgical diameter did not protrude from the hole in the bone, and the temperature around the hole did not exceed 50 °C \\[ 15 \\]. Therefore, in the present case, we performed ablation at a power output of 15 W for 60-seconds duration. In addition, we made a small incision to avoid our patient’s sciatic nerve, thus preventing its damage and burning during the procedure. Also, the position of the tip of the electrode in each step was confirmed by intraoperative images to prevent damage to her triradiate cartilage. Such images were also useful for decreasing her exposure dose. To the best of our knowledge, our patient is the first treated with CT-guided resection and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator, a small incision, and intraoperative images. Complete pain relief was achieved beginning on the first postoperative day. She could walk without any pain at the final follow-up visit 1 year post-treatment, and no local recurrence was observed.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【43】In conclusion, we successfully treated acetabular OO without any symptom recurrence using CT-guided resection and ablation using a standard electrosurgical generator. In addition, we preserved the sciatic nerve and triradiate cartilage by making a small incision and using intraoperative images. A CT-guided procedure should be considered the treatment of choice for OO of the acetabulum because it is a less invasive alternative to _en bloc_ resection.\n\n【44】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【45】CT:\n\n【46】Computed tomography\n\n【47】MRI:\n\n【48】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【49】OO:\n\n【50】Osteoid osteoma\n\n【51】RFA:\n\n【52】Radiofrequency ablation", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The assessment of cutaneous metastatic disease can be perplexing because the clinical presentation appears similar to other skin malignancies like angiosarcoma or melanoma, or benign diseases like cellulitis and lymphedema. To date, only a limited number of dermoscopic images of cutaneous metastatic solid tumors, especially breast cancer, have been published.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The authors report two Moroccan cases highlighting dermoscopy as a quick tool to recognize skin metastasis of breast cancer in two different clinical presentations. A 51-year-old Moroccan woman presented with nodules of various sizes on and around a mastectomy scar, and a 65-year-old Moroccan woman presented with cellulitis-like lesions on her chest wall and her back. Dermoscopic features were similar in the two cases with findings of yellow central areas, polymorphic vessels, whitish bright lines, whitish structureless areas, and linear irregular fissure-like depressions on a pink-orange background.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The recognition of dermoscopic patterns of cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer is not only useful to facilitate diagnosis at an early stage and to rule out other differentials, especially in difficult presentations such as cellulitis-like lesions or lymphedema, but it may also be used by physicians in monitoring mastectomy scars.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Metastatic cutaneous lesions are seen more commonly in breast cancer than in any other malignancy in women, exceeding 20% of all cutaneous metastases \\[ 1 \\]. The presence of skin metastases signifies widespread systemic disease and a poor prognosis \\[ 2 \\]. Patients present with a variety of symptoms ranging from non-painful, single or multiple, hard, firm, indurated skin to tiny seed-like solid papules and large egg-sized lesions, with sometimes an edema of the skin of the breast, known as the orange peel sign, without any specific clinical diagnostic criteria. The chest wall, the abdomen, the back, and the upper extremities are common sites \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】Assessment of cutaneous metastatic disease after mastectomy can be perplexing because the clinical presentation appears similar to other skin diseases such as cellulitis or lymphedema \\[ 1 \\]. Although dermoscopy may provide a useful method for the differentiation between the diagnosis of metastasis to the skin and non-neoplastic dermatological diseases or other malignancies, the dermoscopic patterns of breast cancer metastases have not been well described.\n\n【11】We report two cases of breast cancer metastases with an emphasis on the dermoscopic patterns of the disease.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】The authors report two Moroccan cases of dermoscopy in skin metastasis of breast cancer with two different clinical presentations; the dermoscopic examination was performed using a Dermatoscope Delta® 20 (Heine; Herrsching, Germany) with polarized light and without immersion.\n\n【14】Case 1 was a 51-year-old Moroccan woman diagnosed as having infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast. Case 2 was a 65-year-old Moroccan woman diagnosed as having infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast. They underwent mastectomy and axillary node dissection followed with adjuvant hormone and chemotherapy. After a remission period of 14 months (Case 1) and 10 months (Case 2), they were referred to our hospital for painful lesions on the surface of their trunk, chest, and back.\n\n【15】For Case 1, a physical examination revealed irregularly distributed pink nodules of various sizes with a large firm, indurated skin on and around the mastectomy scar of her left chest (Fig. 1 ). For Case 2, a physical examination revealed a diffuse well-demarcated erythema and edematous cellulitis-like skin on the right side of her chest wall and her back, with a central ulceration on her abdominal wall (Fig. 2 ) and palpable lymphadenopathy in her bilateral anterior cervical and supraclavicular chains. Dermoscopic examination of the two cases revealed a pink-orange background, yellow central areas, linear irregular and polymorphic vessels, whitish bright lines, whitish structureless areas, and linear irregular fissure-like depressions. A recurrence of ductal carcinoma was confirmed with skin biopsies, and the patients were referred to the oncology department for further investigations and appropriate management (Figs. 3 and 4 ).\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Case 1: Clinical presentation. Multiple irregularly distributed pink nodules around the indurated mastectomy scar on the left chest wall\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Case 2: Clinical presentation. Diffusely swollen, erythematous, indurated, and ulcerated skin with a cellulitis-like appearance of the right chest wall and the back\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Case 1: Dermoscopy of the skin metastases. Linear, irregular, arborizing and polymorphic vessels at the periphery of purples lesions ( _blue circle_ ), structureless yellow areas ( _red star_ ), bright white lines at the periphery of yellow areas ( _orange arrow_ ), white structureless areas ( _violet star_ ), linear skin depressions as fissure-like structures ( _green arrow_ )\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】Case 2: Dermoscopic image of the skin metastases. Linear, irregular, arborizing and polymorphic vessels ( _blue circle_ ), structureless yellow or yellow-orange areas ( _red star_ ), white lines ( _orange arrow_ ), white structureless areas or around yellow structures ( _violet star_ ), linear skin depressions as fissure-like structures ( _green arrow_ ), and pink structureless areas ( _blue arrow_ )\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】All types of cancer may metastasize to the skin, with the frequency of occurrence ranging from 0.2 to 9% among autopsies carried out on patients with cancer. Skin metastases may occur synchronously or metachronously with the diagnosis of the primary tumor. Occasionally, skin metastases may represent an initial manifestation of an occult internal carcinoma. Breast and lung cancer are the most common primary types of cancer that metastasize to the skin \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【34】Patients with breast cancer require differentiation between skin metastasis and benign dermatological disease. Differences between cutaneous metastases and cellulitis or lymphedema were found most definitively on the histologic study of tissue biopsy \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【35】Advanced metastatic breast cancer is difficult to cure, and an eventual resistance to cytotoxic treatment is expected, progression of cutaneous metastases may lead to a fungating mass that would require skin and wound management \\[ 5 \\]. Fungating wounds can decrease quality of life by negatively impacting psychological well-being and increasing social isolation \\[ 6 \\]. This is why the recognition of cutaneous metastasis at an early stage is very important for the therapeutic approach, because surgery of limited lesions may be performed, which is not possible for advanced stages. For this reason, we think that dermoscopy may be of great help in recognizing these types of cutaneous metastasis.\n\n【36】To date, only a limited number of dermoscopic images of cutaneous metastatic solid tumors have been published \\[ 4 \\]. Cutaneous metastatic breast cancer dermoscopy was recently described in two papers of three case reports; the first case reported nodular hyperpigmented metastatic breast cancer, with features of peripheral globules and blue–white veil mimicking a melanoma \\[ 7 \\]; recently, in two other cases, findings of polymorphous vascular structures, whitish depigmentation, umbilicated pits with a tendency for forming linear fissure-like structures with small, lateral depressions were reported. These last features were also noticed in our two cases. As a result, a characterization of metastatic breast cancer may be performed based on these patterns; yellow areas were an additional feature in our cases.\n\n【37】Polymorphous and atypical vessels are the most frequent vascular structures characterizing malignancy \\[ 8 \\]; they were also observed in these cases of cutaneous breast metastasis. However, these structures may be misdiagnosed as an angiosarcoma or a lymphangiosarcoma in Stewart–Treves syndrome after mastectomy where we can also find white lines as another sign of malignancy \\[ 9 \\], the other dermoscopic signs would be of great help, like the yellow-orange color and the fissure-like depressions that were described in our two cases.\n\n【38】These polymorphic vessels may also have a prognostic value: the greater the density of the vessels, the more the disease is invasive, which was observed in our second case where the vascularization is abundant and it was concordant with an advanced clinical stage; this deserves further investigation in prospective studies.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【40】This is the second dermoscopic description of non-pigmented cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer in two different clinical presentations with similar dermoscopic features. This may facilitate the monitoring and the recognition of these tumors at an early stage by dermoscopic examination of the mastectomy scar before the stage of widespread nodules or cellulitis-like erythema.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

A urinary endoscopic examination and pelvic multi-slice computed tomography imaging increased the suspicion of a speared renal mass in the right urinary tract. The patient was treated for renal cancer. After nephrectomy and ureterctomy, the histopathology of the resected mass confirmed the diagnosis of UTTB and interstitial nephritis.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case should serve to increase the attention of clinicians to perform an accurate diagnosis step by step. This is especially important if they have a patient similar to the case described here who presents with a renal mass, to avoid serious results such as the loss of an essential organ system.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The bacillus _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ causes tuberculosis (TB). About one quarter of the world's population is infected with this bacillus, and it is the leading cause of death due to a single infectious agent and among the top ten causes of death worldwide \\[ 1 \\]. There are two types of TB: pulmonary TB, which typically affects the lung, and extrapulmonary TB, which might affect any other organ in the body. Urogenital TB is the third most common form of extrapulmonary TB after lymph node involvement and tuberculous pleural effusion \\[ 2 \\]. Urogenital TB usually remains undiagnosed for years because it is a clinically silent disorder. It occurs with a peak incidence in the 20- to 40-year age group and has male:female ratio of 2:1.\n\n【10】The typical classical presentation of urinary tract TB (UTTB) involves the whole urinary collecting system (including renal pelvis, calyces, ureters, and bladder). However, kidney parenchymal lesions are less common, including interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis \\[ 3 \\]. An atypical manifestation is a pseudotumor, which in extremely rare cases is diagnosed and managed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The clinical manifestations of a pseudotumor are often nonspecific symptoms, such as pyuria and microscopic hematuria, as well as symptoms related to the bladder, including dysuria, urgency, nocturia, gross hematuria, low back pain, fever, and weight loss. Patients with advanced disease may have end-stage kidney disease and, rarely, refractory hypertension \\[ 4 \\]. The diagnosis of urogenital TB depends on the results of urine examination, radiographic imaging studies, tuberculin skin test, interferon-gamma release assay, and histopathology. Depending on the findings of these diagnostic measures, management with anti-TB drugs is usually the treatment choice, but surgery may be the preferred choice in some cases.\n\n【11】Here we present an extremely rare case reported in the literature that revealed a significant medical mistake in the diagnosis of urogenital TB as RCC. Analysis of the case shows a combination of diffuse and interstitial TB in the same patient.\n\n【12】Case report\n-----------\n\n【13】A 76-year-old Syrian man was admitted to the emergency room with a complaint of frequency dysuria and gross hematuria lasting for 6 h. The medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 with no abnormalities. Other medical, family and psychosocial histories were clear. At presentation, the vital signs were stable, and clinical examination revealed that the other organs were normal. Initial hematology tests revealed elevated white blood cell counts (WBCs) (20,000/μL), hemoglobin (HGB) (11 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (MCV; 82 fl), and platelet counts (254,000/μL), as well as moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL; urea: 130 mg/dL). Abdominal echography revealed severe and mild hydronephrosis in the right and left kidney, respectively, with no renal stones or calculus. However, there was a significant thickness in the bladder wall (diameter: 1.5 cm).\n\n【14】A cystoscopy was then performed to obtain a biopsy. The histopathology report showed pathological changes, possibly suggesting denuded cystitis, low-grade dysplasia, and severe interstitial cystitis. No invasive tumor was found in the specimen examined. Abdominal and pelvic contrast-enhancing multi-slice computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of hydronephrosis in the right kidney with a filling defect in the pelvis; this was described as a non-enhancing hypodense area in the pelvis and inferior calyces (Fig. 1 ). Thoracic CT revealed band-like opacities in the right upper lobe.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Chest computed tomography revealed only the presence of band-like opacities in the right upper lobe\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】A primary diagnosis of RCC was made based on the clinical presentation, the laboratory test results, and the imaging investigations. As a result, the patient underwent an open radical right nephrectomy and ureterectomy. The histopathology examination of specimens showed the existence of granulomatous pyelonephritis and necrotizing and caseous centers, which confirmed the correct diagnosis of urinary tract TB (UTTB). The granulomatous inflammation was extended to most of the ureter, pelvis, and calyces. In addition, patchy infiltrations were present in the renal parenchyma accompanied by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The final diagnosis was diffuse interstitial nephritis and UTTB (Figs. 2 , 3 ). Treatment with anti-TB drugs was initiated, with a recommended regular follow-up for 2 years. Unlikely, on day 10 of the follow-up, the patient had an ischemic stroke and died due to stroke complications.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Histopathology examination revealed granulomatous pyelonephritis with necrotizing and caseous centers, raising the suspicion of tuberculosis (First microscopic image)\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Histopathology examination revealed granulomatous pyelonephritis with necrotizing and caseous centers, raising the suspicion of tuberculosis (Second microscopic image)\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】The urogenital system is one of the most common sites of extrapulmonary TB. Urogenital TB is diagnosed in 1.1–1.5% of all TB cases and in 5–6% of cases of extrapulmonary TB \\[ 5 \\]. Any portion of the lower urogenital tract can be involved secondarily through antegrade infection from the infected urine. Genital TB is typically a disease of young and middle-aged adults. Most patients present with local symptoms, such as frequent voiding, dysuria, pyuria presenting as lower back, flank, or abdominal pain \\[ 6 \\], and microscopic or macroscopic hematuria. Infrequently, a renal mass mimicks RCC \\[ 7 \\]. Thus, a high degree of suspicion is warranted with patients from countries with a high prevalence of TB.\n\n【30】The differential diagnosis of enhancing renal mass is an abscess, primary renal tumor-like RCC, and lymphoma or secondary metastasis \\[ 8 \\]. Most of the cases reported in the literature on the pseudotumor presentation of urogenital TB involved the presence of a unilateral mass mimicking RCC, and the diagnosis was always made after radical nephrectomy \\[ 8 \\], as in the case presented here. Patients with this form of renal mass, known as the pseudotumoral type, present variably sized but well-defined parenchymal nodules on cross-sectional images. The lesion may simulate a renal hydatid cyst or pseudotumoral xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. However, genitourinary TB may present as well-defined parenchymal nodules of variable sizes, sparing the collecting system in what is known as the pseudotumoral type. With clinical and radiological findings suggestive of RCC, the patient undergoes surgical removal of the involved kidney, with the subsequent histopathology examination unexpectedly establishing the diagnosis of TB \\[ 8 \\]. In addition to the above, TB-associated diffuse tubulointerstitial nephritis is rare and needs rapid recognition and early treatment. Kidney biopsy should be performed in patients with TB and renal disease to ensure the diagnosis of renal involvement of active TB and establish the correct treatment. The mainstay of treatment for this disease is a regimen of anti-TB therapy consisting of isoniazid and rifampicin for 5 months, supplemented in the first 2 months with pyrazinamide and ethambutol.\n\n【31】In the case described here, a 76-year-old man presented with complaints of frequency dysuria and gross hematuria. Laboratory tests showed elevated creatinine and urea levels. Based on multi-slice CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, we diagnosed RCC as the diffuse mass in the right urinary tract, so the treatment decided upon was open right nephrectomy and urethrotomy. However, based on the histopathology of the specimens taken after the open surgery, the diagnosis was diffuse interstitial nephritis and UTTT. This case is distinctive and rare due to the presence of two forms of diffuse and interstitial TB. This patient was treated with anti-TB therapy consisting of 6 months of isoniazid and rifampicin, supplemented with pyrazinamide and ethambutol in the first 2 months.\n\n【32】In conclusion\n-------------\n\n【33】Diagnosing UTTB as a malignant tumor and treating it with surgical removal is a reality due to TB appearing in the form of a mass. In addition, the detection of two types of TB, namely, diffuse and interstitial TB, in one case increases the rarity of the case. This case illustrates the care required of the radiologist and pathologist to accurately diagnose patients who present with a kidney mass and ensure that they receive standard anti-TB treatment and follow-up.\n\n【34】Data availability\n-----------------\n\n【35】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This case report discusses the localization and revascularization of the necrotic femoral head following rarely experienced traumatic open anterior hip dislocation in children.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Our patient was an 11-year-old Japanese boy who had open anterior hip dislocation sustained in a traffic accident. Reduction of the hip joint was performed in an emergency operation, and he was evaluated using serial gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images showed two bands with low signal intensity in the femoral capital epiphysis on coronal and oblique axial planes, indicating the existence of avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head. We observed gadolinium enhancement in the central region of the epiphysis, where the area between the two bands with low signal intensity was located. Serial assessment with enhanced magnetic resonance images during a non-weight-bearing period of 1.5 years after injury showed revascularization starting from the central region and converging toward the peripheral region. Although the patient had leg-length discrepancy due to the early epiphyseal closure, non-weight-bearing treatment for the avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head achieved a favorable outcome without any hip joint dysfunction, pain, or sign of secondary osteoarthritic change within 4.5 years after injury.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We confirmed the revascularization process of the necrotic lesion in the femoral capital epiphysis in an 11-year-old boy using serial gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Conservative non-weight-bearing treatment achieved a favorable outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Avascular necrosis of the femoral capital epiphysis is the most serious and feared complication after traumatic dislocation of the hip in children; treatment of the severely collapsed femoral head is challenging because it is often unsalvageable \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]. Femoral head collapse causes pain and juvenile end-stage osteoarthritis, which leads to serious hip dysfunction. Therefore, postreduction treatment for ischemic necrosis plays a key role in preventing or minimizing development of femoral head collapse.\n\n【10】Herrera-Soto _et al._ \\[ 11 \\] reported that children younger than age 12 years who develop osteonecrosis after traumatic hip dislocation will develop femoral head changes such as those seen with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Kim _et al_ . \\[ 14 , 15 \\] recently examined immature piglet models of ischemic osteonecrosis involving vascular disruption; furthermore, they evaluated the revascularization process in patients with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They concluded that local non-weight-bearing decreased the femoral head deformity and increased revascularization and resorption of the infarcted epiphysis. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous report has demonstrated evaluations of the necrotic lesion and/or revascularization response following rarely experienced traumatic hip dislocation in children. We present a case of an 11-year-old boy with avascular necrosis of the femoral head and improvement in blood flow during non-weight-bearing according to serial gadolinium-enhanced MRI after traumatic open anterior hip dislocation.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】Our patient was an 11-year-old Japanese boy who was hit by an automobile while walking. He was admitted to our hospital by a rescue team approximately 30 minutes after injury. Physical examination revealed exposure of the right femoral head from the inside of the thigh (Fig. 1 a), presence of ipsilateral dorsalis artery pulsation, and no signs of neurological impairment. Initial radiographs revealed anterior dislocation of the right hip (Fig. 1 b).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**a** Clinical photograph from the front view showing the femoral head protruding from behind the right adductor muscles. **b** Anteroposterior radiograph showing an anterior inferior dislocation of the right hip joint. **c** Clinical photograph during surgery from the front view showing the posterior aspect of proximal femur showing injuries of ligamentum teres ( _black arrow_ ), gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, iliopsoas, quadratus femoris, short external rotators, and capsule ( _green arrow_ ) with avulsion fractures of the greater ( _blue arrow_ ) and lesser trochanters\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The patient was sent to the operating room within 2 hours after admission. Soft tissue injury was found in the ligamentum teres, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, iliopsoas, quadratus femoris, short external rotators, and capsule with avulsion fractures of the greater and lesser trochanters, indicating complete disruption of artery of ligamentum teres (Fig. 1 c). Reduction of the hip joint was performed after thorough irrigation and debridement of the wound. Postoperative radiographs showed a concentrically reduced femoral head (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Postoperative anteroposterior radiograph showing concentric reduction of the right femoral head\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Bone scintigraphy (Symbia T6; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) at 1 week after injury, and immediate surgical reduction demonstrated less accumulation on the metaphysis of the injured femoral head than on the contralateral side, suggesting the existence of reduced bone turnover (Fig. 3 a). T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) (ACHIEVA 1.5 T; Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) images (repetition time/echo time = 500 ms/ 18 ms, field of view = 320 mm, thickness = 5.0 mm) at 2 weeks after injury showed a diffuse area of low signal intensity on the proximal part of the femur compared with the contralateral side (Fig. 4 a). Bone scintigraphy at 2 months showed increased accumulation over the epiphyseal plate that was similar to that on the contralateral side (Fig. 3 b). T1-weighted MR images at 2 months after injury showed two bands with low signal intensity (bandlike pattern) \\[ 16 \\] on both coronal and oblique axial views (Fig. 4 b) and gadolinium enhancement in the area between the two low bands, suggesting the partial disruption of branches of superior and inferior retinacular arteries \\[ 17 , 18 \\] and existence of partial necrosis \\[ 19 , 20 \\] of the femoral capital epiphysis (Fig. 5 ). Three-dimensional proximal femur models including the epiphyseal plate, intact region, and necrotic lesion were reconstructed using Mimics software (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium) \\[ 21 \\] and demonstrated a ring-shaped necrotic lesion adjacent to the growth plate (Fig. 6 ). Serial gadolinium-enhanced MRI at 6 months and 1 year showed a gradually enhanced area spreading from the center of the epiphysis toward the periphery, which indicated revascularization of the necrotic lesion with slight collapse of anterior articular surface of the femoral head (Fig. 5 ). Bone scintigraphy at 1.5 years showed decreased accumulation over the epiphyseal plate and accompanying premature physeal closure (Fig. 3 c).\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**a** Bone scintigraphy at 1 week after injury shows less accumulation on the metaphysis of the injured femoral head than on the contralateral side. **b** Bone scintigraphy at 2 months after injury shows increased accumulation over the epiphyseal plate. **c** Bone scintigraphy at 1.5 years after injury shows decreased accumulation over the epiphyseal plate, indicating early physeal arrest\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】Coronal and oblique axial T1-weighted images at 2 weeks ( **a** ) after injury show diffuse area with low signal intensity in the proximal femur suggesting ischemia.

MRI at 6 months shows gadolinium enhancement spreading from the center toward the lateral and posterior regions of the femoral head ( _blue arrows_ ).

Radiographs at 4 years after injury showed some resultant deformity of the femoral head and shortening of the femoral neck without narrowing of the joint space (Fig. 7 ). Although growth arrest resulted in a limb length discrepancy of 2 cm, the patient did not have any hip joint dysfunction or any signs of early osteoarthritis; he had a Harris Hip Scale score \\[ 24 \\] of 100 points at 4.5 years after injury. He could return to light sports activity without any pain or limited range of motion.\n\n【38】**Fig. 7**\n\n【39】Anteroposterior ( **a** ) and lateral ( **b** ) radiographs at 4 years after injury show some resultant deformity of the femoral head, shortening of the femoral neck, and periarticular ossification without signs of secondary osteoarthritic change\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Traumatic open anterior dislocation of the hip in children is associated with serious complications and could have a very poor prognosis \\[ 1 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 \\]. In our patient’s case, bone scintigraphy after prompt reduction indicated reduced bone turnover on the femoral head due to the severity of the initial trauma \\[ 29 , 30 \\]. T1-weighted MR images at 2 months after injury showed two bands with low signal intensity in the femoral capital epiphysis, suggesting the existence of osteonecrosis. Gadolinium-enhanced MR images at 2 months showed nonenhanced area in the peripheral region of the femoral capital epiphysis, indicating disruption of artery of the ligamentum teres and branches of superior retinacular artery \\[ 17 , 18 \\].\n\n【43】Bohr _et al._ \\[ 31 \\] examined the vascular supply to the femoral head following dislocation of the hip joint in newborn rabbits and showed that revascularization takes place through vessels from the trochanteric region and by vessels perforating the epiphyseal plate from the metaphyseal side. Conway _et al_ . \\[ 32 \\] reported that revascularization of the necrotic proximal femoral epiphysis in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease can occur by rapid recanalization of existing vessels or by prolonged neovascularization through the development of new vessels. Kim _et al._ observed revascularization occurring from the periphery to the central region \\[ 15 \\], which is different from our patient’s case. However, no previous report demonstrated the revascularization process of osteonecrosis after traumatic hip dislocation. In this case, serial MR images showed the gadolinium-enhanced region gradually spreading from the center of the epiphysis toward the peripheral region, indicating appreciable revascularization.\n\n【44】Weight-bearing within 6 weeks without accurately assessing either the necrotic area or revascularization might lead to premature breakdown of the hip joint in children with ischemic necrosis after traumatic hip dislocation \\[ 5 , 9 , 10 , 14 , 33 \\]. Collapse of the necrotic femoral head could occur with earlier weight-bearing during the revascularization process due to the weakness of the affected head resulting from the mechanical stress \\[ 34 \\]. Kim _et al_ . reported that joint loading due to muscle contractions can also contribute to the development of the femoral head deformity, but local non-weight-bearing could provide significantly better preservation of the round shape of the femoral head \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. They reported the gradual revascularization process of the femoral epiphysis in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease using serial perfusion MRI and recommended that the non-weight-bearing period be based on a certain level of normalization of the signal intensity in the revascularized area due to reossification. In our patient’s case, repeated evaluation of the necrotic area and revascularization using gadolinium-enhanced MRI helped in the careful planning of appropriate time for weight-bearing. Although osteonecrosis in the anterior region caused slight collapse of articular surface of the femoral head, conservative treatment with non-weight-bearing for 1.5 years for the affected hip could achieve favorable outcomes within 4.5 years after injury.\n\n【45】Growth disturbances causing damage to the physis in the peripheral region including the perichondral structures, which play an essential role in the growth of the width and length \\[ 35 \\], result in deformity of the proximal femur with leg-length discrepancy \\[ 12 \\]. Although long-term follow-up is necessary for early detection of hip arthritis, our patient returned to performing his normal activities without any limitation at 4.5 years after injury.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【47】We confirmed the revascularization process of the necrotic lesion in the femoral capital epiphysis after traumatic open anterior dislocation of the hip joint in an 11-year-old boy using serial gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Although he had deformity of the proximal femur with leg-length discrepancy, non-weight-bearing treatment using a brace for 1.5 years achieved a favorable outcome without any hip joint dysfunction, pain, or sign of secondary osteoarthritic change within 4.5 years after injury.\n\n【48】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】Medical imaging data will not be shared, because it is not fully anonymous.\n\n【50】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【51】MR:\n\n【52】Magnetic resonance\n\n【53】MRI:\n\n【54】Magnetic resonance imaging", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Pediatric AML commonly has genetic rearrangements which involve chromosome 11q23 in 15–20% of cases, and these genetic abnormalities have been associated with a poorer prognosis (Grimwade _et al._ in Blood 92:2322–2333, 1998; Raimondi _et al._ in Blood 94:3707–3716, 1999; Lie _et al._ in Br J Haematol 122: 217–225). MLL rearrangements in AML have been shown to have multiple different fusion partners (Meyer _et al._ in Leukemia 23:1490–1499). Heterogeneity of these cytogenetic abnormalities makes it difficult to determine how to approach patients from a treatment standpoint. This difficulty is further complicated when patients have more than a single MLL rearrangement.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 10-year-old Caucasian girl presented with easy bruising and was found to have acute myeloid leukemia. Her cytogenetics showed two different MLL rearrangements, t(9;11)(p22;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). At initial presentation she had no other cytogenetic findings. She responded well to initial therapy and achieved remission following the first induction cycle and completed four rounds of chemotherapy. She subsequently had a relapse of her AML, and her cytogenetics were consistent with a single MLL rearrangement, t(9;11)(p22;q23), in addition to monosomy 7. She was treated with reduction therapy and a haplo-identical bone marrow transplant but ultimately succumbed to her disease.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】MLL rearrangements are common in AML, but clinical significance continues to be elusive, and there is conflicting data on the prognostic significance. In the setting of multiple MLL rearrangements, there is concern for reduced survival, although treatment modifications are not currently done in this setting. This report details a case with multiple MLL rearrangements that initially responded to therapy but ultimately had disease progression with a selection of a leukemic clone containing a single MLL rearrangement.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】When considering treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), response to induction therapy and specific cytogenetic abnormalities such as t(8;21), inv(16), NPM, CEBPα, FLT3/ITD+, monosomy 7, monosomy 5, and del5q are the mainstays used to determine risk-directed therapy. The impact on prognosis is known for some cytogenetic abnormalities such as t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17), but other abnormalities are rare and their significance difficult to ascertain \\[ 1 \\]. There are numerous other common cytogenetic findings that are not routinely used for risk stratification, including 11q23 rearrangements, despite their prevalence in pediatric AML. Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements are found in 15–20% of pediatric AML cases \\[ 2 \\]. In general, patients with MLL rearrangements have poorer outcomes compared to non-MLL-rearranged leukemia \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]. There are many defined fusion partners of MLL, although the most common seen in AML is the t(9;11)(p21;q23) fusion \\[ 5 \\]. MLL-AF6, MLL-AF9, MLL-ENLs, MLL-AF10, and the ALL-AF17 fusion proteins are the most commonly encountered translocations in AML \\[ 6 \\]. The significance of multiple MLL rearrangements is unknown, but the concern is that this may lead to reduced survival. This case report details a patient with two MLL rearrangements who progressed to more aggressive disease with emergence of a single MLL rearrangement along with monosomy 7.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】The patient is a 10-year-old Caucasian girl who presented to her pediatrician with a 2-week history of excessive bruising. At presentation she had no significant family history of childhood illnesses or malignancies. On physical exam she had significant bruising and pallor, but without any other exam findings. An initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 36.3k/µL), anemia (hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 31k/µL), and circulating blasts (absolute blast count 22.76k/µL). Peripheral blood flow cytometry was consistent with AML. She had no central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Chromosomal findings at diagnosis were 46,XX,t(11;19)(q23.2;p13.3)\\[18\\]/47, idem, and +6 \\[2\\]. She had a unique cytogenetic findings, which showed two different MLL rearrangements, t(9;11)(p22;q23) in 88.4% of cells and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) in 84.4% of cells, for 18 of 20 metaphases analyzed. The interpretation stated that “interphase nuclei demonstrated an MLL gene rearrangement and a MLLT3/MLL fusion.” Fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) findings indicated that 86% of nuclei had MLL gene fusions associated with both MLLLT3/MLL(KMT2A) and MLL(KMT2A)/MLLT1 (Table 1 ). No other high- or low-risk abnormalities were found on cytogenetics, including negative for monosomy 7, monosomy 5, del5q, inv(16), t(8;21), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, and CEBP. The significance of this combination of MLL rearrangements was unknown, and we opted to treat per the Children’s Oncology Group AAML1031 Arm A regimen. She obtained a negative minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry following her first induction cycle and was classified as low risk, forgoing a bone marrow transplant as part of her upfront therapy. FISH studies following induction I were negative for both the t(9;11)(p22;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) fusion. Her therapy included cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide for induction I and II, cytarabine and etoposide for intensification I, and cytarabine and mitoxantrone for intensification II. Unfortunately, 5 months following the completion of therapy she had an isolated bone marrow relapse. Cytogenetic analysis of 20 metaphases revealed just a single MLL rearrangement, t(9;11)(p22;q23) (MLLT3/MLL fusion as she had at diagnosis), and in addition monosomy 7 in 19 of these metaphases. FISH confirmed that 90% of nuclei had monosomy 7 and MLL(KMT2A)/MLLT1 fusion. She had no other new cytogenetic abnormalities. Relapse therapy goals for her were to proceed in second remission to a bone marrow transplant with the best available donor and conditioning with busulfan and fludarabine. In relapse she was refractory to several re-induction therapies including TVTC (topotecan, vinorelbine, thiotepa, clofarabine) and decitabine with gemtuzumab \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. She subsequently enrolled in a phase I clinical trial after failing these re-induction regimens, and was able to achieve a low MRD and proceed to a haplo-identical stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, she was found to have florid relapse of her disease around day +100 post-transplant and passed away shortly thereafter.\n\n【12】**Table 1 Fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization findings at diagnosis and relapse**\n\n【13】Full size table\n\n【14】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The mixed-lineage leukemia gene, located on chromosome 11q23, is involved in the majority of 11q23 rearrangements seen in AML. The MLL gene plays an important role in fetal hematopoiesis, and many of the MLL gene fusion partners play a role in transcriptional regulation \\[ 9 \\]. Amongst the various rearrangements, t(9;11)(p22;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) are the second and third most common rearrangements involving the MLL gene in pediatric AML, respectively \\[ 9 \\]. Although MLL gene rearrangements are seen in about 15–20% of pediatric patients with AML, there are no known cases in the literature that report two separate MLL gene rearrangements \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Our patient had both abnormalities, and some MLL gene rearrangements have been associated with poor outcomes \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【16】The presence of these abnormalities can cause treatment dilemmas, as there are more than 50 identified MLL fusion partners, each with varying prognostic indications \\[ 8 \\]. To complicate matters further, certain MLL rearrangements are so rare that the risk they carry in regard to relapse, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival is yet to be determined. In addition, the prognosis associated with certain MLL rearrangements differs amongst studies. Conflicting data on prognostic significance makes it difficult to interpret these findings on an individual basis.\n\n【17】While the t(9;11) rearrangement is one of the more prevalent MLL rearrangements identified in AML cases, there is no consensus in the literature on its prognostic indication. Rubnitz _et al._ published that t(9;11) was a favorable prognostic marker (5-year EFS 64.9 ± 11.1%), compared to other cytogenetic markers, including several other MLL rearrangements (24.2 ± 9.4%) \\[ 13 \\]. In particular, favorable outcomes were seen in patients with FAB-M5 AML \\[ 13 \\]. Patients treated on the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) protocols likewise had favorable outcomes when a t(9;11) rearrangement was present (EFS 86 ± 9%) \\[ 12 \\]. In the United States, on the other hand, this specific rearrangement was found to have a poor prognosis, similar to other MLL rearrangements \\[ 14 \\]. It has been proposed that the favorable prognosis seen in the first two studies is a result of administration of cumulative high-dose cytarabine in both protocols. However, Balgobind _et al._ could not confirm the use of cumulative high-dose cytarabine leading to improved outcomes in patients with this translocation \\[ 2 \\]. Favorable outcomes from the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital protocols have been further attributed to the predominance of patients with FAB-M5 AML and the use of epipodophyllotoxins, which have been shown to be effective against M5 AML \\[ 13 \\]. While this does not explain the success of the NOPHO protocols, Balgobind _et al._ also found that patients with FAB-M4 t(9;11) had much better prognosis than other FAB types \\[ 9 \\]. This indicates that FAB type could potentially be used in risk stratification of these patients.\n\n【18】Von Neuhoff _et al._ found patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23) or t(11;19)(q23;p13) had equivocal outcomes to patients without MLL rearrangements, with 5-year overall survival of 51 and 58%, respectively \\[ 4 \\]. Although they found that patients with t(9; 11) alone had equivocal outcomes, patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23) and an additional cytogenetic abnormality had a significant decline in 5-year overall survival rates at just 31% \\[ 4 \\]. Balgobind _et al._ reported that patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23) had a 5-year EFS of 50%, and those with t(11;19)(q23.2p13.3) had a 5-year overall survival rate of 49%, which is similar to the outcomes described by von Neuhoff \\[ 2 \\]. Similar to von Neuhoff, they found that patients with a MLL rearrangement and an additional cytogenetic aberration had worse overall survival rates compared to those with just a single MLL rearrangement \\[ 2 \\]. Since neither group specified what additional cytogenetic abnormalities these patients had, it makes it difficult to know if the finding of two distinct MLL rearrangements in our patient impacted her outcome.\n\n【19】Limitations of this case report include that a single patient report is difficult to generalize to other patients with MLL rearrangements. Further case series and retrospective data would be needed to determine whether multiple MLL rearrangements have clinical significance.\n\n【20】There remains much ambiguity regarding the significance of certain MLL rearrangements with respect to prognosis and best treatment for patients with AML. While there have been several large studies to evaluate the role t(9;11)(p22;q23) plays on prognosis in childhood AML, results are not consistent, perhaps owing to different treatment regiments. While t(11;19)(q23;p13) is the third most common rearrangement involving the MLL gene in pediatric AML, there is very limited data on the effect this translocation has on prognosis. There is even more uncertainty when more than one MLL rearrangement is present. Given the frequency in which MLL gene rearrangements are observed in pediatric AML, it seems imperative that they be included in risk stratification for therapy selection. Since risk stratification in AML many times leads to more aggressive therapies, including consideration of stem cell transplant, the clinical significance of MLL gene rearrangements needs to be better understood to use it for risk stratification. Further research is needed to elucidate the role each MLL rearrangement plays in prognosis in order to improve treatment outcomes.\n\n【21】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【22】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

To avoid immediate implantation of an ICD, wearable cardioverter defibrillator vests (WCD) can be used to protect patients against malignant rhythm disorders, while at the same time drug-based heart failure therapy has to be initiated. This drug therapy can improve left ventricular ejection fraction and primary prophylactic cardioverter defibrillator implantation may not be necessary. However, the recent Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial (VEST) questioned the regular use of the WCD in this setting.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 47-year-old Caucasian man with severely impaired left ventricular function early after myocardial infarction was prescribed a WCD as primary prophylaxis to prevent sudden cardiac death. Seven days after the patient was supplied with a WCD, the patient suffered from an electrical storm with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT), which was successfully terminated 17 times by the WCD. On coronary angiography, the formerly infarct-related right coronary artery had TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial) III flow, and a remaining stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was stented, which did not stop recurrent VT. In the electrophysiology (EP) study, a focus was mapped in the left inferior ventricle, which was ablated. This stopped the VT. A second radio-frequency (RF) ablation in the same area was necessary after 14 days. Finally, a permanent cardioverter defibrillator was implanted.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We report the case of a patient who survived recurrent episodes of VT early after myocardial infarction by effective defibrillation with a WCD. The WCD is a useful device to bridge time until a final decision for implantation of a defibrillator.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】With severely impaired left ventricular function of less than 35%, the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia—ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation—increases, and thus the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) \\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]. In some patients VT episodes occur as “electrical storm\", defined as the recurrence of hemodynamically unstable VT over three or more episodes within 24 hours or incessant ventricular arrhythmia for more than 12 hours. The implantation of defibrillators (ICDs) is an established therapy in the prevention of SCD in patients with systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI) \\[ 1 , 4 \\]. However, the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT) and the Immediate Risk Stratification Improves Survival (IRIS) trial showed that early after MI there is no survival benefit from ICD implantation \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In the long run, by adherence to heart failure medication, an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction can be achieved, so that primary prophylactic cardioverter defibrillator implantation is not necessarily required \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. According to current guidelines, the temporary use of a wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) may be considered < 40 days after MI in selected patients (class IIb), for example patients with incomplete revascularization \\[ 9 \\]. In line with this, a variety of registries show the efficiency in terminating VT by a wearable cardioverter defibrillator \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\], whereas the recent Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial (VEST) did not find a significant survival benefit in patients early after MI protected by a WCD \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【10】This particular case demonstrates the efficacy of the life vest concept. Additionally, we give insight into the management of electrical storm in a patient with a WCD and discuss the current recommendations on the life vest. This will also raise awareness regarding the potentially life-saving option of a WCD in selected patients.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 47-year-old Caucasian man with non-ST-elevation MI was admitted by the emergency doctor to our emergency department. Apart from nicotine abuse (35 pack years), the patient had no medical history (including obsessive consumption of alcohol) or prior medication. Family, social and environmental history was unremarkable. In the emergency department, physical and neurological examination showed the following vital signs: heart rate 112 beats per minute, blood pressure 152/103 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 97% while breathing room air, respiration 15 breaths per minute, auricular temperature 37.8 °C. The patient was awake (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15) and oriented in all respects without any neurological deficits. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia, ST-segment depressions in leads V4 and V5. He was transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory. Three-vessel disease with total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 75% stenosis of the circumflex artery (Cx) was diagnosed. The RCA was stented with subsequent TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial) III flow (Fig. 1 ). Following a “culprit lesion only” strategy, the LAD and Cx were not stented in the acute setting. Post-interventional echocardiography documented a severely reduced systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (15–20%). Besides medical therapy, which included dual antiplatelet and heart failure therapy (Table 1 ), the patient was provided with a WCD (LifeVest <sup>® </sup> , ZOLL Medical Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). He was scheduled for an early follow-up after 4 weeks. Seven days after discharge, the patient developed an electrical storm. At home, the WCD shocked twice in the evening (8:39 p.m. and 8:41 p.m.) (Fig. 2 ) without any prior symptoms of angina or syncope. The patient was transferred to the emergency room by ambulance. On admission, he showed normal vital signs (heart rate 88 beats per minute, blood pressure 117/81 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing room air, respiration 18 breaths per minute, auricular temperature 36.9 °C). He was awake (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15) and oriented in all respects, and no neurological deficits were detected. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, biphasic T waves in III, negative T wave in leads V5 and V6, and three ventricular extrasystoles (VES).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Coronary angiography. **a** Total occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) (left anterior oblique \\[LAO\\] view).

Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is terminated by a shock 36 seconds later and subsequent sinus rhythm\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】During monitoring in the emergency room, recurrent non-sustained VT were documented and the patient received intravenous administration of 5 mg metoprolol. Initial laboratory testing revealed normal values except for increased troponin (91.1 pg/mL), without positive dynamics in a second testing (Table 2 ). Creatinine kinase was in the normal range as well. The patient was transferred to our chest pain unit. At night the WCD shocked again due to VT (2:56 a.m.). At no time the patient complained of angina, and there was no new evidence for recurrent myocardial ischemia in the ECG. The patient received intravenous administration of 10 mg morphine for sedation, 150 mg amiodarone and 5 mg metoprolol to suppress VT. After 4 a.m., several shocks occurred within a very short time (4:19 a.m., 4:37 a.m., 4:49 a.m., 4:51 a.m., 4:53 a.m., 4:56 a.m.), again due to monomorphic VT. The patient was sedated using intravenous 0.5 mg fentanyl, 60 mg propofol, 100 mg rocuronium, and then intubated, mechanically ventilated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where continuous amiodarone infusion (1050 mg/50 mL at 5 mL/hour) was initiated. Corrected QT (QTc) intervals were in the normal range. Within a short period of time, a second electrical storm occurred (shocks at 5:09 a.m., 5:12 a.m., 5:18 a.m., 5:20 a.m., 5:24 a.m., 5:26 a.m., 5:27 a.m., 5:30 a.m.). After additional intravenous administration of 5 mg metoprolol, the VT stopped. In the meantime, due to low battery capacity, the life vest was replaced by external defibrillator patches, and the patient was subsequently shocked another seven times. Coronary angiography was performed and two drug-eluting stents were implanted in the known 80% LAD stenosis. Despite continuous intravenous metoprolol administration (2 mg/hour) and single magnesium infusion (2 g/2 minutes), Torsade de pointes tachycardia persisted and 11 additional external defibrillations were necessary (Fig. 3 ).\n\n【24】**Table 2 Summary of laboratory test results**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】Torsade de pointes\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Following the coronary angiography, an EP study was performed, as the 12-lead ECGs suggested that VT were triggered by ventricular premature beats early in the repolarization phase. The premature beats appeared partly as ventricular bigeminy (Fig. 4 ), which induced VT with polymorphic and partially Torsade des points morphology, in some cases resulting in rapid transition into ventricular fibrillation. The focus of the VT origin/premature beats was localized in the posterior wall of the left ventricle and ablated by radio-frequency (RF) energy.\n\n【30】**Fig. 4**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Twelve lead electrocardiogram demonstrating ventricular bigeminy\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】During the course of the following day, three more VT with similar morphology had to be terminated by external defibrillator shocks. Therefore, the EP procedure was repeated and the same focus was targeted by RF energy ablation. Finally, no additional VT occurred. Two days later, the patient received a dual-chamber ICD implantation for secondary prevention of sudden death. After a VT-free interval of 3 days with continuous metoprolol infusion and saturated amiodarone levels, the patient was extubated and transferred to the chest pain unit. At the end of the hospital stay, an echocardiographic follow-up of the left ventricular ejection fraction showed an improved ejection fraction of 30–35%.\n\n【35】During intensive care treatment, the patient suffered from ventilator-associated pneumonia which was treated with piperacillin and tazobactam intravenously for 8 days.\n\n【36】In a 3-month ICD follow-up by remote monitoring, there were no more shocks, but three non-sustained VT were documented.\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】We report a case of a patient with electrical storm shortly after MI. The patient was protected by a WCD, which terminated 17 episodes of repeated VT. The patient needed 18 further shocks by an external ICD until RF ablation and medical therapy established stable sinus rhythm.\n\n【39】In general, immediate external termination of VT is crucial for survival in the case of hemodynamic instability. The detection and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia by WCDs is as effective as immediate external defibrillation \\[ 10 \\]. WCDs can be considered for patients at risk of SCD and potential but not immediate ICD indication. Furthermore, WCDs offer patients with ICD and indication for system extraction, for example due to an active infection, an effective means of protection until a permanent ICD can be re-implanted. In this particular patient, the decision for a WCD was made because of the large infarcted area, the severely impaired left ventricular function and incomplete revascularization, since recurrent myocardial ischemia may favor ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【40】Regardless of external or internal defibrillation, the relief of distress and pain in conscious patients is very important during an electrical storm. Recurrent shocks may increase sympathetic tone and therefore trigger further arrhythmias by increased levels of catecholamines. Sedation not only reduces the sympathetic activation, but also eliminates discomfort associated with invasive bedside procedures and patient management in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting. Therefore, analgosedation is recommended for all patients in these situations, reducing catecholamine levels and preventing pain and further emotional distress \\[ 14 \\]. In our case, sedation did not have an effect on the occurrence or the frequency of the VT.\n\n【41】As the WCD effectively sensed and terminated the recurrent VT, the vest was not taken off during the initial management of the electrical storm. Due to the automatic detection and termination of the VT, the work load for the ICU team was significantly reduced, as no team member had to be involved in terminating the rhythm disorders by shocks. However, the voice messages before each shock of the WCD were increasingly considered disturbing by the ICU team. Therefore, and due to possible low battery voltage, arrhythmia treatment was changed to external defibrillation. Of note, no burn injuries were detected on the skin.\n\n【42】As a routine, two batteries are given to the patient by the manufacturer. One battery is recommended to be used with the vest, while the second battery stays in the charging station. The total number of effective shocks is dependent on several factors, for example the amount of time that the battery was already in operation or the number of alarm signals. According to the manufacturer, the residual battery capacity after 24 hours is sufficient to deliver five shocks with 150 joules \\[ 15 \\]. Although each fully charged battery provides power for more than 24 hours, our patient followed this advice and changed the battery in the morning. Therefore, our case demonstrates the capability for 17 effective shocks despite 12 hours of operating time. According to the manufacturer, there is one unpublished case of a patient with 30 effective shocks without the battery being discharged. Furthermore, due to the optimal shock vector (anteroposterior position of the patches), the shock energy may be lower in comparison to automated external defibrillators (AED with 150–360 joules) with patches in the anterolateral position \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【43】Guidelines for primary prevention of sudden death recommend a waiting time of 40 days after acute MI and 90 days after coronary revascularization before permanent ICD implantation. Randomized trials have shown no benefit for ICD implantation early after acute MI \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Nevertheless, the risk for SCD remains increased during this waiting period, despite guideline-directed medical therapy and revascularization. Therefore, an intermittent protective device might be a useful option to reduce the SCD risk during this period. However, in an intention-to-treat analysis in the recent VEST trial, the WCD therapy showed no statistically significant reduction of SCD, but indicated a trend towards a lower risk of SCD in the WCD group. Furthermore, WCD treatment was associated with lower total mortality in the first days after MI. Fourteen of 20 patients who received an appropriate shock survived longer than 90 days. In contrast, 14 diseased patients did not wear the WCD despite assignment to the treatment group. The nonadherence to wearing the device may have biased the results \\[ 13 , 16 \\]. Therefore, in an “as treated” analysis (…“if WCD would have been actually worn”…), arrhythmic death and mortality could be significantly reduced \\[ 17 \\]. Focusing on patient comfort, one trial demonstrated an impairment in quality of life by living with a WCD \\[ 18 \\]. Forty-eight percent of patients with a WCD suffer from sleep disturbance and feel disabled in daily routine activities. Despite this, a WCD should be offered to motivated high-risk patients after individual consideration of the risk factors according to the guidelines \\[ 2 , 9 \\]. Additionally, improved and close monitoring of WCD patients by telemedicine might increase acceptance and quality of life in affected patients \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【44】In our demonstrated case, the treatment of the electrical storm was performed according to current guideline recommendations and included a drug therapy: anti-arrhythmic pharmacotherapy was a combination of ß-blocker administration and amiodarone \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. As electrical storm is mostly observed in patients with ischemic heart disease and either is triggered by myocardial ischemia or occurs on the basis of scars as substrate; guidelines also recommend an urgent revascularization \\[ 20 \\]. This, however, did not terminate the VT in our patient. Subsequent catheter ablation as part of our therapeutic approach in accordance with current recommendations finally stopped the recurrent episodes of electrical storm \\[ 9 , 20 , 21 \\]. In theory, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify substrates for catheter ablation may increase ablation success. But despite the growing expertise on design changes for cardiac implants, the WCD is not suitable for MRI procedures \\[ 22 \\].\n\n【45】In patients with an ICD, the termination of VT by antitachycardia pacing may also succeed, but this treatment option is not possible in WCD patients. The implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) and biventricular stimulation may also be an alternative therapeutic strategy \\[ 20 \\]. In heart failure patients, unloading of the left ventricle by mechanical assist devices (for example Impella CP <sup>® </sup> ) may stabilize the rhythm as well. A super-urgent orthotopic heart transplant should be considered as an ultima ratio in the absence of an effect with the other treatment options \\[ 20 \\]. In general, ICD implantation is recommended for patients who survived sudden cardiac death \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【46】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【47】Here we report case of a patient who survived an electrical storm shortly after MI by the use of a WCD that delivered 17 appropriate shocks. Although there was no significant reduction of SCD in the VEST trial, WCD are a feasible option for arrhythmic protection and therefore recommended for high-risk patients until a final evaluation for an ICD is possible. It remains unclear how patients at increased risk of arrhythmic death can be identified in the early period after MI and before permanent ICD implantation is indicated.\n\n【48】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】Data sharing is not applicable to this article because no data sets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【50】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【51】AED:\n\n【52】Automated external defibrillator\n\n【53】CRT-D:\n\n【54】Cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator\n\n【55】EP study:\n\n【56】Electrophysiology study\n\n【57】ICD:\n\n【58】Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator\n\n【59】IRIS:\n\n【60】Immediate Risk Stratification Improves Survival\n\n【61】LAD:\n\n【62】Left anterior descending artery\n\n【63】LAO view:\n\n【64】Left anterior oblique view\n\n【65】MRI:\n\n【66】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【67】SCD:\n\n【68】Sudden cardiac death\n\n【69】RCA:\n\n【70】Right coronary artery\n\n【71】RF:\n\n【72】Radio-frequency\n\n【73】TIMI:\n\n【74】Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial\n\n【75】VES:\n\n【76】Ventricular extrasystole\n\n【77】VEST:\n\n【78】Vest prevention of early sudden death trial\n\n【79】VT:\n\n【80】Ventricular tachycardia\n\n【81】WCD:\n\n【82】Wearable cardioverter defibrillator", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is related to pigmented villonodular synovitis. Giant cell tumor of the synovium or pigmented villonodular synovitis has been described rarely in the axial skeleton especially in the thoracic vertebrae of a child.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A previously healthy 7-year-old Thai girl presented with back pain and progressive paraparesis and was unable to walk for 1 month. She had weakness and hyperreflexia of both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-defined homogeneously and intensely enhanced extradural mass with cord compression at T4 to T7 levels. The patient underwent laminectomy at T4 through to T7 and total tumor removal. Permanent histopathologic sections and immunostains revealed a giant cell tumor of the synovium. Postoperative neurological status recovered to grade V. Magnetic resonance imaging at the 1-year follow-up showed no recurrence and there was no clinical recurrence at the 2-year follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We report an extremely rare case of giant cell tumor in the epidural space that extended from a thoracic facet joint. The tumor was removed successfully through laminectomies. Although giant cell tumor of a facet joint of the thoracic spine is very rare, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis for masses occurring in the epidural space in a child. Total tumor removal is the best treatment. Careful monitoring of recurrence can achieve a good clinical outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath usually originates from the synovial membrane of tendon sheaths, bursa, and joints \\[ 1 \\]. Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), nodular tenosynovitis and giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath are related lesions with common histologic patterns \\[ 2 \\] but different anatomic origins and clinical presentations \\[ 3 \\], so unification of these entities has been suggested \\[ 4 \\]. According to the World Health Organization, tenosynovial or synovial giant cell tumors are subtyped into localized and diffused types \\[ 1 \\]. The localized type (giant cell tumor of the synovium) is encapsulated, extra-articular and commonly found in the tendon sheaths of the fingers whereas the diffuse type is non-encapsulated, intra-articular and commonly found in the knee joint, and is designated as “PVNS”. The main difference between PVNS and giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath is the intra-articular growth in the former group and the extra-articular growth in the latter group.\n\n【10】Synovial-type giant cell tumors or PVNS rarely arise in the region of the axial skeletal system. Most reports of synovial-type giant cell tumors in the axial skeletal system published to date have been designated “PVNS” and are usually involved in the adult lumbar or cervical spine rather than the thoracic spine \\[ 5 – 7 \\]. To date less than 50 examples of synovial-type giant cell tumors or PVNS of the spinal region are documented in the English literature \\[ 8 \\]. Only 11 cases involved the thoracic spine and only two cases were related to children \\[ 6 – 13 \\] (Table 1 ).\n\n【11】**Table 1 **Summary of published data on giant cell tumor of the synovium of the thoracic vertebrae****\n\n【12】Full size table\n\n【13】We describe a case of a 7-year-old Thai girl with giant cell tumor of the synovium with an extremely rare presentation in the thoracic spine.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A previously healthy 7-year-old Thai girl presented with back pain, progressive paraparesis and was unable to walk for 1 month. The physical examination showed no scoliosis, but did show weakness of her lower extremities grade III and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities and hypoalgesia below the T4 dermatome. Plain radiography showed normal alignment and no abnormal bony destruction was seen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine showed a posterior homogeneous extradural mass of approximately 1.0 × 1.4 × 4.0cm along T4 to T7 levels with a hypointense signal on T1-weighted image (T1W), an intermediate signal on T2-weighted image (T2W) and significant enhancement in the post-contrast images (Figures 1 a, 1 b, 1 c). On axial T2W a tumor appeared to originate from her left facet joint at T5 to T6. Abnormal marrow intensity of her left facet joint was found (Figure 2 ). The lesion was well circumscribed and solid. The tumor was located only in the posterior element and did not involve the vertebral body. We performed a T4 through T7 laminectomy and the tumor was totally removed. Intraoperative findings showed that the tumor had adhered to the left lamina and pedicle of T5 to T6 and had penetrated into the neural foramen of T5 and T6. The mass was confirmed to be an extradural mass in the surgical field. The gross specimen consisted of a well-capsulated, firm to hard mass measuring 1.0 × 1.5 × 4.0cm in diameter. Cut surfaces showed white-yellow tissue and a tiny bone component at the capsule (Figure 3 ).\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Preoperative sagittal magnetic resonance imaging. a** .

Cut surfaces showed white-yellow tissue and a tiny bone component at the capsule.\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The pathological study showed that the mass was composed of packed polyhedral stromal cells and numerous multinucleated giant cells. Some areas showed hyalinized stroma. Mitotic figures were rare. The giant cells were large, and ranged from a few to 50 nuclei. There was a lack of papillary or villiform architecture. There were a few tiny fragments of bone at the capsular area near the attached bone (Figures 4 a, 4 b). The findings were compatible with giant cell tumor. A computed tomography (CT) chest scan showed no lung metastasis. The patient’s postoperative course was unremarkable. She did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy. The patient completely recovered from paraparesis 1 month after the operation. The MRI at 1-year follow-up showed no recurrence of the tumor (Figure 5 ).\n\n【29】**Figure 4**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】**Histopathology images of the tumor. a** . Low-power hematoxylin and eosin stain.

The diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the synovium of a facet joint of the spine requires a high index of suspicion. Due to the difficulty of diagnosis, the characteristic of this tumor should be studied. Radiographs of this tumor have varying appearances such as soft-tissue mass, osseous erosion and periosteal elevation. A CT scan of giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath can demonstrate bony involvement such as osseous expansion or sclerotic margin at the facet joint. An MRI commonly identifies a mass that is isointense on T1W images and has variable intensity on T2W images due to the presence of hemosiderin, cystic fluid, and hemorrhage \\[ 5 \\], and it often shows marked enhancement after contrast administration \\[ 12 \\]. Because these characteristics can also be found in other epidural masses such as lymphoma, meningioma, nerve sheath tumor, metastasis, and myeloma, these tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Moreover, involvement of the facet joint is an important clue for the diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the synovium at the axial skeleton. But in cases that present with bony destruction at the facet joint, other primary bone lesions such as aneurysmal bone cyst, osteoblastoma and osteoclastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis for a lesion that involves the posterior vertebral elements.\n\n【39】Malignant transformation of the synovial-type giant cell tumor is uncommon \\[ 14 \\]. To date there is no standard treatment of giant cell tumor of a facet joint at the spine. The best predictor for the final outcome is the type of initial surgery performed \\[ 7 \\]. A complete surgical resection is considered to be the best treatment \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. One of the important complications is the recurrence of the tumor \\[ 15 \\]. Early recurrence occurs when total excision is not achieved. Giannini _et al._ \\[ 6 \\] reported a recurrence rate of 18% of giant cell tumor of the synovium at the spinal region after total tumor removal, which is comparable to PVNS of the appendicular skeleton \\[ 15 \\]. Careful monitoring must be maintained to detect local recurrence. In cases with incomplete resection, chemotherapy with imatinib mesylate has been used recently as adjuvant treatment \\[ 4 \\]. Some patients received radiotherapy after a total tumor removal as adjuvant treatment, but the benefits of radiation are unclear \\[ 10 , 15 \\]. Because of the risks of radiation, such as neurological damage and post-radiation sarcoma, radiation is usually reserved only for inoperable cases.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【41】We reported an extremely rare case of giant cell tumor of the synovium at a thoracic facet joint in a child. Due to the difficulty of diagnosis, it is important to be aware that giant cell tumor of the synovium at a facet joint should be in the differential diagnosis of an epidural mass at the thoracic spine because its clinical and radiological features may mimic neoplastic lesions of this region. The best treatment is total excision. Due to the high recurrence rate, careful monitoring is very important.\n\n【42】Consent\n-------\n\n【43】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The disease usually progresses relentlessly to result in recurrent fractures, short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis, and susceptibility to recurrent respiratory tract infections.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The index child was a male newborn to healthy, nonconsanguineous, Sinhalese parents. The child had multiple contractures involving all large joints with pterigium formation in addition to congenital fractures involving left humerus and ulna at birth. The phenotypic features in this child were highly suggestive of Bruck syndrome. Genetic counseling was offered to the parents, although specific genetic testing could not be undertaken due to lack of resources. Bone and skin biopsy were not performed since only palliative care was possible. Over the course, he developed recurrent severe chest infections due to poor muscle tone, weak cough reflex, and pooling of secretions. Unfortunately, he succumbed at the age of 7 months following severe pneumonia.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The association of arthrogryposis with osteogenesis imperfecta is extremely rare and known as Bruck syndrome. Early diagnosis during the antenatal period is helpful in genetic counseling, assessment of severity, and exploration of therapeutic options\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a symptom complex rather than a diagnosis and associated with many recognizable syndromes \\[ 1 \\]. Chromosomal abnormalities, uterine abnormalities, and disorders of nerves, vessels, muscles, and connective tissues can lead to this symptom complex. AMC presents with congenital joint contractures. Bruck syndrome is identified when congenital joint contractures are associated with bone fragility and fractures \\[ 2 \\]. It has been considered as an autosomal recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta \\[ 3 \\]. This rare disorder has been reported in literature in only 27 patients by 2015 \\[ 4 \\]. Viljoen _et al._ reported five children with congenital joint contractures with fractures in 1989 \\[ 5 \\]. Since the same features were described in 1897 by Dr. Bruck \\[ 6 \\], Viljoen named the condition as Bruck syndrome. The genotype and phenotype of Bruck syndrome are heterogeneous. While the genes coding for collagen 1 chains are unaffected in BS, there is biochemical evidence for a defect in the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen 1 telopeptides \\[ 7 \\]. We reported herein the case of a neonate with congenital joint contractures associated with bone fragility and fractures and meeting clinical criteria for Bruck syndrome \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A male newborn to healthy, nonconsanguineous Sinhalese parents at 37 weeks of gestation was identified to have multiple congenital abnormalities. The mother noted reduced fetal movements during pregnancy. Breech presentation and placenta previa were confirmed by antenatal ultrasound with no evidence of oligo- or polyhydramnios. The antenatal period had been otherwise uncomplicated, and anomaly ultrasound scan did not reveal specific congenital abnormalities. He was delivered by elective lower segment cesarian section, weighing 2.6 kg, at Peradeniya Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Length and occipitofrontal circumference were 48 cm and 34 cm, respectively. Apgar scores were 8, 9, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. Vital parameters soon after birth were heart rate of 114 per minute, respiratory rate of 52 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% in room air.\n\n【12】Physical examination of the newborn revealed facial asymmetry and micrognathia. Neck muscles were thin and atrophied. Contractures involving all large joints were noticed with pterigium formation. Hands and feet were deformed with absent skin creases. Right talipes equinovarus and left calcaneovarus deformity with dislocated hip joints were also noted. The baby had microphallus with bilateral cryptorchidism. Based on these clinical findings, AMC was considered. Additionally, the child was found to have a disproportionately large head, disproportionately short limbs, scoliosis, and multiple fractures involving left humerus and ulna. Cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and abdominal examinations findings were otherwise normal at birth. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D levels were within normal ranges. X-ray of left arm and forearm revealed multiple fractures involving humerus and ulna. Hearing and visual assessments revealed normal findings. Ultrasound abdomen did not reveal any congenital abnormalities of the visceral organs.\n\n【13】Bone and skin biopsy were not performed since only palliative care was possible. Similarly, genetic studies for Bruck syndrome were not done due to limited resources. Establishing of feeding and handling was difficult due to increased fragility of bones and evidence of multiple congenital contractures. The baby was treated with vitamin D, calcium, and bisphosphonates and followed up by the pediatric and orthopedic teams.\n\n【14】He had recurrent chest infections since birth, managed in-patient with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care. He had a severe chest infection at the age of 5 months, needing management in the intensive care unit. He was intubated and provided with ventilatory care for 3 days. Intravenous cefotaxime was given for 10 days, and oral clarithromycin for 5 days. The chest infections were largely attributed to weak cough reflex, pooling of secretions, and poor muscle tone, including that of respiration muscles. He remained bed-ridden as he had severe and predominant gross motor developmental delay, which was further complicated by presence of multiple long-bone fractures. He received chest physiotherapy and gentle limb physiotherapy by the multidisciplinary team. Unfortunately, the child succumbed due to respiratory failure following severe pneumonia at age 7 months (Figs. 1 , 2 ).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Multiple congenital contractures\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Healing intrauterine fractures\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】The second child born to the same parents also had clinical features suggestive of Bruck syndrome. He is currently 6 years of age and doing well with multidisciplinary follow-up. Further, he has normal intellectual functions. He is able to use his hands reasonably well in writing. The main concern of the parents is his limited mobility, and the parents carry him from place to place but his weight is becoming an issue. His current weight is 23 kg. He is toilet trained and suffers from infrequent chest infections, which are managed aggressively. However, he has not been hospitalized, except for once during the last 3 years. Perhaps COVID-19 had a positive effect as his younger sibling was not schooling, thus cross-infections were low. The parents are exploring the possibility of getting a wheelchair for him.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Bruck syndrome is characterized by congenital contractures with pterygia, onset of fractures in infancy or early childhood, severe limb deformity, and progressive scoliosis \\[ 8 \\]. It has been classified into two forms—Bruck syndrome type 1 and type 2; however, both variants share common phenotypic features \\[ 9 \\]. Bruck syndrome 2 is caused by homozygous mutation in the _PLOD2_ gene on chromosome 3q24. The syndrome has also been reported secondary to insertion/deletion mutation in the _FKBP10_ gene \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. Phenotypic features such as short stature and progressive kyphoscoliosis have been suggested to be more associated with Bruck syndrome type 2 \\[ 12 \\]. However, given that the index child succumbed early following a severe respiratory tract infection and respiratory failure, determination of the type of Bruck syndrome based on phenotypic features was difficult.\n\n【26】Bruck syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although there was no previous family history, presence of similar clinical features in both children supports the already known pattern of inheritance in this family. Consanguinity can be absent in some families \\[ 13 \\]. Many centers in developing countries, at present, do not have facilities for molecular diagnosis. However, it is of little help to prognosticate and assess the clinical severity of Bruck syndrome. Therefore, good clinical evaluation remains the key to delineate the basic abnormalities associated with this disorder.\n\n【27】In addition to multiple bone fractures and congenital joint contractures, patients with Bruck syndrome commonly have short stature, Wormian bones in the skull, clubfoot, and kyphoscoliosis. They mostly have white sclera as in the patient described herein, and normal hearing and vision. Individual case reports \\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 \\] have described additional dysmorphic features, as reported in this child. The clinical outcomes and prognosis have been variable in reported cases, with some reported children dying soon after birth \\[ 19 \\] while other patients have reportedly lived up to the third \\[ 20 \\] or fourth \\[ 21 \\] decade in life.\n\n【28】The molecular defect underlying Bruck syndrome is a deficiency of bone-specific telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase, which results in aberrant crosslinking of bone collagen \\[ 22 \\]. Lysine residues within the telopeptides of type I collagen in bone are underhydroxylated, leading to aberrant crosslinking. In contrast to bone, cartilage and ligament show unaltered telopeptide hydroxylation in Bruck syndrome, as evidenced by normal patterns of crosslinking. These underlying biochemical derangements give rise to predominant changes in bone that include congenital fractures and contractures, and increased fragility. Brenner _et al._ \\[ 23 \\] performed electron microscopy of a bone specimen of a patient with Bruck syndrome and found osteoblasts with swollen mitochondria and dilated endoplasmic reticulum. A decrease in the diameter of the collagen fibrils was also noted, along with low mineral content and increased pepsin extraction of collagen 1.\n\n【29】It is important to rule out osteogenesis imperfecta in newborns with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Radiological imaging should therefore be performed early so that the affected child can be better looked after by measures such as padding of beds and gentle handling to prevent further fractures \\[ 19 \\]. The mainstay of pharmacological management of Bruck syndrome is bisphosphonate infusions and vitamin supplementation, and the condition is treated similarly to most children with osteogenesis imperfecta \\[ 24 \\]. However, prognosis is worse in children with Bruck syndrome given its association with joint contractures \\[ 25 \\].\n\n【30】The disease progresses relentlessly in all patients, leading to complications such as severe limb deformities, short stature, progressive kyphoscoliosis, and multiple fractures \\[ 3 \\]. Most children with Bruck syndrome treated with pamidronate had good to fair response. Therefore, pamidronate therapy with the same doses used in osteogenesis imperfecta is currently recommended for these patients. Early orthopedic consultation would be routinely required for most of these patients to help them in rehabilitation and recovery.\n\n【31】Arthrogryposis can be picked up antenatally on ultrasound from the second trimester onward. Severe variants of Bruck syndrome diagnosed during the antenatal period can be offered genetic counseling and the option of termination of pregnancy \\[ 26 \\].\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】The association of arthrogryposis with osteogenesis imperfecta is extremely rare and known as Bruck syndrome. Early diagnosis during the antenatal period is helpful in genetic counseling, assessment of severity, and exploration of the option of therapeutic termination.\n\n【34】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【35】The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request\n\n【36】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【37】AMC:\n\n【38】Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone therapy has been reported as a less neurotoxic, highly effective therapy for patients with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes syndrome who are ineligible for transplant or whose syndrome is relapsed/refractory, but no reports have provided data from untreated transplant-eligible patients.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 34-year-old Japanese woman displayed weakness, pain and edema in the lower limbs, decreased grip strength, amenorrhea, and abdominal distention. She was unable to walk independently. The patient was diagnosed with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes syndrome and performed four courses of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone therapy, which enabled her to walk independently and did not exacerbate the neuropathy. Hematopoietic stem cells were collected using plerixafor and filgrastim in combination. Autologous stem cell transplantation was performed with high-dose melphalan.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites (grade 2), and multiple osteosclerosis (Fig. 1 ), and she was referred to our department on suspicion of a hematological disease.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Computed tomography before treatment. **a** Cervical lymphadenopathy (reddish brown arrows); **b** hepatosplenomegaly; **c** right external iliac lymphadenopathy (reddish brown arrow) and ascites; **d** osteosclerosis of the ilium (blue arrow)\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】On admission, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 2. Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) score was 2 for the arm grade and 3 for the leg grade (total score, 5). She was unable to walk independently and had to take a leave of absence. Peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral motor neuropathy were classified as grade 3. Nerve conduction velocity testing showed demyelinating polyneuropathy with a lower-extremity predominance. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation showed a level of 1.81 g/dL for immunoglobulin A λ-type monoclonal protein. Bone marrow examination showed 3% plasma cells, and flow cytometry showed a λ bias. Human herpesvirus-8 deoxyribonucleic acid quantification in plasma was negative, and cervical lymph node biopsy revealed multicentric mixed-type Castleman disease (Fig. 2 ). Positron emission tomography–CT showed abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulations and a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) of 6.91, consistent with cervical, axillary, para-aortic, and pelvic lymphadenopathy and sclerotic lesions of the humerus, lumbar spine, ilium, and femur (Fig. 3 ). The serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was 5000 pg/mL. Endocrine examination revealed central amenorrhea and subclinical hypothyroidism. Hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, and glomerular hemangiomas were observed. Papilledema (grade 1) and thrombocytosis were also observed. Platelet count was 447,000/μL. Respiratory function testing showed a diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide of 53%.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Cervical lymph node histopathology; multicentric mixed-type Castleman disease.

FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; SUV <sub>max </sub> , maximum standardized uptake value.\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is confirmed when both of the mandatory major criteria, one of the other three major criteria, and one of the six minor criteria are met \\[ 6 \\]. Polyneuropathy (typically demyelinating) and monoclonal plasma cell-proliferative disorder (almost always λ) are mandatory major criteria. Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, and VEGF elevation are other major criteria. Organomegaly (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or lymphadenopathy), extravascular volume overload (edema, pleural effusion, or ascites), endocrinopathy (adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid, pancreatic), skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, glomeruloid hemangiomata, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing, white nails), papilledema, and thrombocytosis/polycythemia are minor criteria. All mandatory major, other major, and minor criteria were present \\[ 6 \\], so she was diagnosed with POEMS syndrome. After the patient provided written informed consent and approval was obtained from our institutional review board, 28-day cycles of DLd therapy (intravenous daratumumab at 16 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during cycles 1 and 2, on days 1 and 15 during cycles 3 and 4; oral lenalidomide at 25 mg/day on days 1–21; and dexamethasone at 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15 and 22) were started. Symptoms began to improve during the first course and continued to improve over time. The only adverse events were diarrhea (grade 3) and a decrease in the white blood cell count (grade 1). Serum VEGF decreased to 1850 pg/mL and 826 pg/mL after one and four courses of DLd therapy, respectively. After four courses of DLd therapy, ONLS scores were 0 for the arm grade and 1 for the leg grade (total score, 1), allowing the patient to walk independently. All clinical symptoms and test results also improved (Table 1 ). Peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 2) and peripheral motor neuropathy (grade 2) remained in the lower limbs.\n\n【26】**Table 1 Laboratory values and clinical symptoms**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】Hematopoietic stem cells were collected using plerixafor and filgrastim in combination (subcutaneous plerixafor at 0.24 mg/kg on days 3–4; subcutaneous filgrastim at 400 μg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–5) at a dose of 3.7 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> cells/kg of CD34-positive cells. ASCT was performed with high-dose melphalan (intravenous melphalan at 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days −3 and −2). As soon as neutrophils engrafted on day 10, fever of 40 °C with no identifiable infectious etiology, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring oxygen administration at 2 L/minute by nasal cannula, and weight gain more than 2.5% of baseline body weight were identified. Engraftment syndrome was diagnosed, and steroid (intravenous methylprednisolone at 125 mg/day on days 10–12) was administered. Engraftment syndrome was quickly relieved, and the patient was discharged home on day 25. At 3-month post-transplantation follow-up, serum VEGF had decreased to 212 pg/mL and total ONLS score was 0. All clinical symptoms except central amenorrhea had disappeared, and all test results were improved (Table 1 ). The only residual neurological deficits were peripheral motor neuropathy (grade 1) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (grade 1) of the lower extremities. Peripheral neuropathies have continued to improve over time, and the patient is negotiating job conditions with her employer to return to work approximately 1 year after ASCT.\n\n【29】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【30】The mainstay of induction is doublet therapy, such as Td therapy \\[ 1 \\] and Ld therapy \\[ 2 , 3 \\]. However, in studies of ASCT after conventional induction therapy, the 5-year progression-free survival rate was only about 60% \\[ 1 , 3 \\]. Furthermore, only 50% of patients were able to walk independently at 24 months after ASCT \\[ 3 \\]. Since the patient in our case was young and desired to return to work, we chose a triplet regimen that would be more effective than doublet therapy for achieving independent ambulation and long-term progression-free survival. Bortezomib \\[ 7 \\] and thalidomide were avoided owing to the risks of neuropathy. DLd therapy was selected on the basis of the efficacy in patients with POEMS syndrome who are ineligible for or those with relapsed/refractory POEMS syndrome \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In this case, the adverse events of DLd therapy were minor and four courses of DLd therapy enabled her to walk independently. DLd therapy did not exacerbate the neuropathy. Her symptoms continued to improve for a year after ASCT, and she was eventually able to return to work.\n\n【31】Lowering the serum level of VEGF below 1000 pg/mL before ASCT results in better 5-year clinical progression-free survival (90.9% versus 47.4%) and 5-year overall survival (100% versus 84.8%). On the other hand, hematological response before ASCT did not differ significantly in patients with relapse/progression after ASCT compared with those without relapse/progression \\[ 3 \\]. These facts suggest that VEGF plays a central role in the pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome, and VEGF response, not hematological response, should be considered when selecting induction therapy. In the present case, serum VEGF was reduced to below 1000 pg/mL before ASCT, and a favorable prognosis was expected.\n\n【32】In transplant-eligible patients with POEMS syndrome, there is concern that daratumumab and lenalidomide may cause poor mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. In the present case, a sufficient amount of autologous peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells was collected with the combination of plerixafor and filgrastim.\n\n【33】Daratumumab is an antibody against CD38 that is predominantly expressed on plasma cells. CD38 is also expressed on immunosuppressive cells that suppress T cells, such as regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[ 10 \\]. Daratumumab not only directly injured tumor cells, but also might have resulted in indirect attacks on tumor cells by activating the T cells by killing CD38-positive immunosuppressive cells. Lenalidomide might be highly effective against POEMS syndrome, not only inhibiting the growth of tumor cells, but also regulating the production of VEGF \\[ 11 \\]. Furthermore, lenalidomide induces CD38 expression in plasma cells and immunosuppressive cells and might have enhanced the effects of daratumumab \\[ 12 \\]. These mechanisms may be responsible for the favorable therapeutic effect of DLd therapy.\n\n【34】In this case, lymph node biopsy revealed Castleman disease. It has been reported that 11–30% of patients with POEMS syndrome have Castleman disease or Castleman disease-like tissue, and Castleman disease has been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for POEMS syndrome \\[ 6 \\]. In POEMS syndrome, cytokines secreted by monoclonal plasma cells are thought to cause Castleman disease, which is a polyclonal lymphoproliferative disease \\[ 13 \\]. In POEMS syndrome with Castleman disease, treatment for POEMS syndrome has been performed with relatively good results \\[ 14 \\]. In the present case, good treatment response was achieved with DLd therapy.\n\n【35】In conclusion, DLd therapy followed by ASCT may be more effective than conventional therapy for newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome. Although there were concerns that DLd therapy might lead to poor mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells, this was overcome with the combination of plerixafor and filgrastim. The benefit of DLd as induction therapy prior to ASCT should be confirmed in future clinical trials.\n\n【36】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】The data that support the findings of this study are not publicly available owing to the presence of information that could compromise the privacy of the research participant, but are available from the corresponding author, Ryutaro Taenaka, upon reasonable request.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】POEMS:\n\n【40】Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes\n\n【41】ASCT:\n\n【42】Autologous stem cell transplantation\n\n【43】DLd:\n\n【44】Daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone\n\n【45】Td:\n\n【46】Thalidomide and dexamethasone\n\n【47】Ld:\n\n【48】Lenalidomide and dexamethasone\n\n【49】CT:\n\n【50】Computed tomography\n\n【51】ONLS:\n\n【52】Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale\n\n【53】VEGF:\n\n【54】Vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【55】FDG:\n\n【56】Fluorodeoxyglucose\n\n【57】SUV <sub>max </sub> :\n\n【58】Maximum standardized uptake value", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Myocarditis as an immune-related adverse event is rare but highly fatal, suggesting that its frequency may be higher than reported. This paper describes a case of myocarditis that developed asymptomatically following ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 71-year-old Asian man who presented to hospital with fever, fatigue, and weight loss of approximately 10 kg within 2 months was diagnosed with Xp.11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma. Computed tomography revealed multiple lung masses, mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and a level II tumor thrombus reaching the inferior vena cava (cT3bN0M1; International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, poor risk). Ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy was started as induction therapy. The patient experienced acute interstitial nephritis as an immune-related adverse event after treatment initiation; however, a good response to steroid therapy was observed. The antitumor effect of the immunotherapy was notable. Although he experienced pulmonary embolism, it seemed asymptomatic and harmless; thus, a second infusion was introduced. From the eighth day, he demonstrated rapidly worsening cardiogenic shock with asymptomatic electrocardiographic changes and drastic drop in cardiac biomarkers, and a diagnosis of myocarditis as an immune-related adverse event was made. Although immediate methylprednisolone mini-pulse therapy followed by tapered prednisolone prevented mortality, extensive myocardial fibrosis with marked ejection fraction decline persisted as a sequela. Consequently, follow-up without treatment was instituted; however, much of the tumor response initially observed was maintained over several months.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Physicians treating patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors should be aware of their potentially life-threatening cardiotoxic effects. This study emphasized the importance of a high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early intervention in patients who present with cardiac abnormalities and possible myocarditis after receiving immunotherapy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The combination of the anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, “ipilimumab,” and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, “nivolumab,” is a revolutionary therapeutic approach and improves outcomes in patients with advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma \\[ 1 \\]. However, this approach is associated with a wide spectrum of side effects known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which involve the damage of nontarget organs and are thought to arise from the aberrant activation of autoreactive T cells \\[ 2 \\]. In recent years, with the increased use of these agents for a wide range of malignancies, myocarditis has been reported as a rare but important irAE and is associated with high mortality if not detected and treated early \\[ 3 \\]. Herein, we present a case of advanced renal cell carcinoma in which drug-induced myocarditis rapidly worsened after immunotherapy. The myocarditis was asymptomatic and was successfully treated.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 71-year-old Asian man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperuricemia was admitted to the hospital with fever, fatigue, and weight loss of approximately 10 kg in 2 months. The patient’s family history was unremarkable, and he had a history of smoking for about 40 years and did not have a drinking habit. Computed tomography (CT) showed a left renal mass, multiple lung masses, and mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a level II tumor thrombus reaching the inferior vena cava. The patient was referred to our department for multidisciplinary treatment (Fig. 1 ). Renal tumor biopsy revealed a diagnosis of Xp.11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma (cT3bN0M1; International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium; poor risk), and the patient received ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) and nivolumab (240 mg) as initial therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Primary and metastatic lesion suggestive of renal cell carcinoma at the first visit. Computed tomography shows a left renal mass ( **a** ), multiple lung masses ( **b** ), and mediastinal lymph node enlargement ( **c** ). Magnetic resonance imaging shows a level II tumor thrombus reaching the inferior vena cava ( **d** )\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Although renal function was normal at the start of the immunotherapy, the serum creatinine level was gradually elevated to 1.98 mg/dL from the seventh day of the first infusion. The patient was not taking nephrotoxic drugs and was otherwise asymptomatic. A non-contrast CT scan confirmed the absence of any obstacle in the urinary tract, while marked regression was observed in all lesions. Urine biochemistry examination showed acute tubular disorder ( _N_ \\-acetyl glucosaminidase, 24.8 U/L; β2-microglobulin, 23,488 µg/L) and a negative immunological examination led to the clinical suspicion of acute interstitial nephritis as an irAE. This renal injury was treated with intravenous prednisolone at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg, followed by oral prednisolone. Serum creatinine level and urinary biochemistry findings were also rapidly normalized with good response to steroid therapy (Fig. 2 ). The dose of corticosteroids was progressively tapered to 5 mg daily as maintenance. After 50 days of the first cycle, CT revealed that the primary tumor and lung metastasis showed partial response, while the mediastinal lymph node and inferior vena cava tumor thrombus demonstrated complete response. However, pulmonary embolism was noted simultaneously, and the patient was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. Because the respiratory and circulatory dynamics were stable and considering the achieved cancer control, a second cycle of ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy was started.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Details of the first cycle of ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy including kidney injury as immune-related adverse events management\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Four days after the second infusion, the patient experienced an asymptomatic but sustainable mild rise in serum creatine phosphokinase. From the evening of the seventh day to the morning of the eighth day, ST-segment elevation was observed in the cardiac monitor despite the absence of any complaint. Hence 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was performed, and ST-segment elevation was seen in all leads (Fig. 3 a). Laboratory analysis revealed a high level of inflammatory reaction and elevation of myocardial biomarkers (creatine kinase MB-isozyme, 23, 488 U/L; troponin-I, 100,680 pg/mL; NT-proBNP, 15,964 pg/mL), and the patient was immediately referred to cardiovascular internal medicine. Echocardiography showed an akinetic apex, a hypokinetic septum, and an ejection fraction of 50% (baseline 2 months previously was 72%). Emergency cardiac catheterization excluded relevant coronary disease, and left ventriculography showed that the left ventricular apex was nearly akinetic and the remaining left ventricle was hyperkinetic (Fig. 3 b). The differential diagnoses at this point included Takotsubo cardiomyopathy triggered by viral infection and myocarditis due to autoimmunological causes. To monitor for hemodynamic failure, the patient was admitted to the coronary care unit. Twelve hours after admission to the care unit, he complained of chest tightness and shortness of breath. His hemodynamics rapidly worsened due to cardiogenic shock, and echocardiography revealed widespread cardiac akinesis except for the back wall. To maintain and improve cardiorespiratory function, dopamine, dobutamine, and noradrenaline were infused, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted, and adaptive servo ventilation therapy was initiated. The clinical oncology unit was consulted, and they noted that the clinical presentation was suggestive of myocarditis as an irAE. Momentarily, right heart catheterization was performed and myocardial biopsy was also performed for histological analysis. Thereafter, a 3-day methylprednisolone mini-pulse (500 mg/day) therapy was administered followed by prednisolone administration at 1 mg/kg. Nevertheless, the patient’s condition worsened, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit for percutaneous cardiopulmonary support. Although he experienced notable arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation, his hemodynamics gradually improved with troponin I decrease, and he returned to the general ward after treatment in the high care unit for 18 days (Fig. 4 ). Serological analysis of paired serum samples for cardiotropic viruses was negative. The myocardial biopsy sample taken during the acute phase demonstrated marked lymphocytic infiltration with a predominance of CD4-positive cells (Fig. 5 a). Additionally, on the 32nd day after starting steroid treatment, myocardial repeat biopsy revealed an admixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and many histiocytes/macrophages within the myocardial inflammation suggested chronic smoldering myocarditis (Fig. 5 b). Because of the persisting inflammation, the patient was placed under long-term prednisone therapy (15 mg/day). Cardiac MRI showed that the left ventricular wall was extensively fibrotic, and myocardial scintigraphy revealed that the ejection fraction had dropped to 20% (Fig. 6 ). The tumor reduction tendency of immunotherapy continued in both the remaining primary lesion and multiple lung metastases (Fig. 7 ). Since the patient’s performance status remained limited due to the chronic heart failure and many of these tumor responses were sustained over months, we decided to observe and not to reintroduce immunotherapy. Figure 8 shows a summary of his clinical course.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】Electrocardiography findings ( **a** ) and ventriculogram during diastole ( **b-1** ) and systole ( **b-2** ) from immune checkpoint inhibitors-associated myocarditis.

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represents a shifting paradigm in the management of patients with advanced malignancies. As the clinical use of ICI therapy rapidly increases globally, the management of irAEs is becoming important. The growing clinical use of ICIs for different cancers has been accompanied by case reports and series of patients experiencing severe cardiac side effects. ICI-associated cardiac adverse reactions are rare but may present as severe myocarditis, with mortality rates ranging from 22.5% to 39.7% \\[ 2 , 3 \\].\n\n【47】In a pharmacovigilance study that ended in April 2016, myocarditis was noted in 0.09% of patients on a single ICI and in 0.27% of patients receiving combination therapy \\[ 4 \\]. Additionally, in a recent pharmacovigilance study that ended in January 2018, 0.41% of patients that were prescribed anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy developed myocarditis compared with those prescribed anti-CTLA-4 monotherapies (0.07%) and combination ICIs (1.33%) \\[ 5 \\]. In contrast, in a small registry of ICI-related myocarditis, the prevalence was lowest with anti-PD-1 agent (0.5%); however, it was higher with anti-PD-L1 (2.4%) and anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy (3.3%). Moreover, the prevalence of myocarditis was 2.4% with combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy compared with 1.0% with combined anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy \\[ 6 \\]. The true incidence of ICI-associated myocarditis is possibly underestimated given the lack of routine cardiac monitoring during treatment in most immunotherapy trials.\n\n【48】Many patients have no symptoms, while others may develop nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and chest pain, or present with acute heart failure or sudden death. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of irAEs with ICI therapy have not been fully elucidated. One possible pathophysiologic mechanism is that cardiac myocytes may share targeted antigens with the tumor, consequently becoming the targets of activated T cells, and resulting in lymphocytic infiltration with downstream heart failure and conduction abnormalities \\[ 4 \\]. Nevertheless, the risk factors for ICI-associated myocarditis are not well understood \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【49】The diagnosis of myocarditis can be challenging and requires a very high index of clinical suspicion. If a patient has symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, ECG and troponin level assessment should be immediately performed as initial diagnostic tests \\[ 8 \\]. Additional testing, including coronary angiography and a viral serology panel, may be considered to exclude other causes. Endomyocardial biopsy is currently considered to be the standard diagnostic procedure for ICI-associated myocarditis. However, the test may not be performed as first line because of its invasive nature, risk of cardiac perforation, and localized nature of the biopsy sample, which could result in false-negative results \\[ 9 \\]. A cardiac MRI can achieve a diagnosis in the early course of the disease when biopsy is not feasible, as it can show signs of myocardial inflammation \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【50】High-dose glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day for the first 3 days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg) are recommended as first-line therapy in the acute phase \\[ 9 \\], but several reports have suggested that corticosteroids alone might not be sufficient to resolve the immune-mediated side effects \\[ 3 \\]. For stable patients, immunosuppression therapy such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and infliximab may be considered, and anti-thymocyte globulin or intravenous immunoglobulin may be used in the management of toxicities for steroid-refractory or unstable patients \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【51】Of 40 notable cases that developed myocarditis with ICI therapy for various malignancies, this case is the second report of myocarditis related to the treatment of urological cancer including renal cell carcinoma \\[ 3 \\]. Therefore, this phenomenon may not be well known among urologists. Knowledge of this adverse event is crucial because of the notably high risk of mortality. Our experience highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early intervention for patients who present with cardiac abnormalities and possible myocarditis after receiving immunotherapy.\n\n【52】In conclusion, ICIs are approved for a wide range of malignancies. Cardiotoxicity is a rare event but is considered to be more frequent than previously known, and can become life-threatening, making it an important consideration for cardiologists, oncologists, and urologists. It is important for providers across specialties to be aware of both common and rare adverse effects associated with these agents.\n\n【53】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】Not applicable.\n\n【55】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【56】irAEs:\n\n【57】Immune-related adverse events\n\n【58】CT:\n\n【59】Computed tomography\n\n【60】MRI:\n\n【61】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【62】ECG:\n\n【63】Electrocardiogram\n\n【64】ICIs:\n\n【65】Immune checkpoint inhibitors", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Removal of the ectopic pregnancy mass could cause intractable hemorrhage and/or organ injury because of deep trophoblastic invasion into the surrounding tissue.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 23-year-old Gravida-II, Ectopic-I Ethiopian woman was referred from a district Hospital as a case of failed medication abortion at gestational age of 24 weeks plus 6 days from a reliable date. She presented with a history of vaginal bleeding of 3 days duration. She had no history of abdominal pain, nor fever, nor bowel habit changes, nor vomiting. She also had no history of urinary symptoms. Her past surgical, medical, and family history was unremarkable.\n\n【13】Before referral, she was provided repeated cycles of 5 dose regimen misoprostol 200 mg vaginally with a diagnosis of second trimester missed abortion. She was refereed for possible dilatation and evacuation procedure once the medication abortion failed.\n\n【14】Her first pregnancy was an ectopic tubal pregnancy for which right salpingectomy was done after a ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed with pelvic ultrasound on background of classic clinical presentation—amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding. The intra-operative findings at that time was a ruptured right ampullary pregnancy with significant hemoperitonium.\n\n【15】Up on her arrival to our Hospital, she was immediately evaluated by a senior Ob-Gyn consultant and a diagnosis of abdominal ectopic pregnancy was made based on ultrasound findings of an empty uterus with a well formed demised fetus in the abdominen with femoral length that corresponded 24 weeks of gestation. With full preparation made for possible need of massive blood transfusion, patient underwent a laparotomy surgery with a generalist Ob-Gyn consultant and a gynecology oncology fellow in attendance.\n\n【16】The intra-operative finding was 10 by 9 cm sized abdominal ectopic pregnancy buried in a dense adhesion, covered with loops of the large bowel that was adherent to it’s surface. The right ovary was invisible due to firm adhesion. The left tube and ovary were healthy looking. There was no any finding suggestive of uteroperitoneal fistula.\n\n【17】Carefully, the mass was dissected from surrounding organs but there was inadvertent serosal sigmoid colon injury. Intra-operative consultation was made to a general surgeon. The whole colon was inspected, injury site identified, and adhesion lysis was done successfully. A 200 g weighing macerated fetus along the placenta was extracted without any difficulty. End-to-end anastomosis was done for the sigmoid colon injury.\n\n【18】Our patient didn’t require any blood transfusion and was discharged after 5 days of post-operative recovery in good condition. She was reevaluated on subsequent follow ups, after a week and 2 weeks respectively. She had no any complaint and her clinical profile didn’t document any abnormality during the two follow-up visits.\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】Abdominal pregnancy has been defined as an embryonic implantation in the peritoneal cavity, exclusive of tubal, ovarian, or intraligamentary implantations \\[ 1 \\]. It accounts for 0.6 to 4% of all ectopic pregnancies and 1 in 3372 to 1 in 21,439 live births \\[ 2 \\]. Abdominal gestations are usually secondary to early tubal rupture with subsequent implantation onto the peritoneal surfaces \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【21】High index of suspicion is important to diagnose abdominal pregnancy. In contrast to tubal ectopic pregnancies, abdominal pregnancies may go undetected until an advanced gestational age. As a result, it is associated with a high rate of maternal complications \\[ 4 \\]. The maternal mortality rate can be as high as 20%. This is primarily because of the risk of massive hemorrhage from partial or total placental separation. The placenta can be attached to the uterine wall, bowel, mesentery, liver, spleen, bladder and ligaments \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【22】It is noted that the classical signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are usually present in those cases generally regarded as secondary abdominal ectopic pregnancies, but the symptoms are quite variable in regard to those cases recognized as primary \\[ 6 \\]. The clinical presentation in our case was vaginal bleeding of three days duration and it was initially mis-diagnosed as a missed second trimester abortion.\n\n【23】With ultrasound examination, an empty uterus coupled with the presence of a gestational sac or mass separated from the uterus, adnexa and ovaries should always raise suspicion of an abdominal pregnancy. A mass seen in the abdomen away from the pelvis, especially with features of pregnancy (gestational and yolk sac, fetal heart beat) is diagnostic but it is not usually possible to differentiate a pelvic mass from the adnexa with ultrasound \\[ 7 \\]. In our case, there was a clearly visible well-formed demised fetus out of the uterine cavity (Figs. 1 , 2 ).\n\n【24】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Pelvic ultrasound findings. **a** Demonstrates an empty uterus and **b** depicts a well-formed embryo in close proximity to the anterior abdomen al wall with the placenta positioned in the posterior abdominal cavity\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【29】   \n\n【30】The whole surgery captured in real time photos\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】The mainstay of management for abdominal pregnancy is surgery. Removal of the ectopic pregnancy mass could cause intractable hemorrhage and/or organ injury because of deep trophoblastic invasion into the surrounding tissue \\[ 8 \\]. Management of the placenta presents the greatest problem \\[ 9 \\]. Immediate operation should be done once a diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy is entertained and an adequate supply of compatible Rh suitable blood has to be prepared \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【33】The surgeon rarely encounters difficulty in opening the sac and removing the fetus, but management of the sac, the adhesions, and more especially of the placenta, and control of hemorrhage present surgical problems of the first magnitude. The ideal procedure, of course, is to remove the sac in toto: fetus, membranes and placenta. The surgeon should be prepared to deal with profuse bleeding because as soon as he or she begins to strip off the placenta he may encounter violent hemorrhage which cannot be controlled by clamps, stitches or packing. If the placenta is adherent to the intestines, liver or spleen, separation is likely to produce uncontrollable bleeding; the placenta should be left _in situ_ and the abdomen closed without drainage \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【34】In our case, there was no difficulty in removing the fetus and placenta but there was inadvertent injury to the sigmoid colon while an attempt was made to release the dense adhesion between the ectopic mass and the large bowel.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】Most of the recommendations for the management of abdominal ectopic pregnancy focus on the precautions that has to be taken in making a sound surgical examination to examine the extent of placental attachment to the surrounding tissue, after entry to the abdominal cavity. This aims to avoid massive hemorrhage and organ injury by making a good clinical judgment whether to leave the placenta _in situ_ or remove it. What is equally important and can result in potential organ injury if the necessary precautions are not taken, like the sigmoid colon injury which occurred in our case, is safe entry to the abdomen.\n\n【37】We recommend that the possibility of bowel injury during entry to the abdominal cavity at laparotomy should always be considered and an experienced general surgeon should always be in attendance before opening the abdomen, to prevent it from happening. We also recommend that a differential diagnosis of abdominal ectopic pregnancy should be considered and a repeat ultrasound examination should be done in any case of second trimester failed medication abortion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, complications developing around the site proximal to the occlusion by resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta have almost never been studied.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 50-year-old Japanese woman fell from a height of approximately 10 m. At initial arrival, her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute, her blood oxygen saturation was 95% under 10 L/minute oxygenation, her pulse rate was 90 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg. Mild lung contusion, hemopneumothorax, unstable pelvic fracture, and retroperitoneal bleeding with extravasation of contrast media were observed in initial computed tomography. As her vital signs had deteriorated during computed tomography, a 7-French aortic occlusion catheter (RESCUE BALLOON®, Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan) was inserted and inflated for aortic occlusion at the first lumbar vertebra level and transcatheter arterial embolization was performed for the pelvic fracture. Her bilateral internal iliac arteries were embolized with a gelatin sponge; however, the embolized sites presented recanalization as coagulopathy appeared. Her bilateral internal iliac arteries were re-embolized by n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The balloon was deflated 18 minutes later. After embolization, repeat computed tomography was performed and a massive hemothorax, which had not been captured on arrival, had appeared in her left pleural cavity. Thoracotomy hemostasis was performed and a hemothorax of approximately 2500 ml was aspirated to search for the source of bleeding. However, clear active bleeding was not captured; resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta may have been the cause of the increased bleeding of the thoracic injury at the proximal site of the aorta occlusion.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】It is necessary to note that the use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta may increase bleeding in sites proximal to occlusions, even in the case of minor injuries without active bleeding at the initial diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Temporary aortic occlusion may be performed prior to definitive hemostasis for trunk injury accompanied by hemorrhagic shock in which bleeding control is difficult. Aortic occlusion was conventionally performed by cross-clamping the aorta after resuscitative thoracotomy. In recent years, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has been widely used to treat patients with severe torso trauma. It has been reported that invasion by REBOA is much lower than that in the case of cross-clamping, and although there are no significant differences in the time required for occlusion, the use of REBOA correlates with higher survival rates \\[ 1 \\]. Therefore, cross-clamping after thoracotomy has been replaced with the aortic occlusion technique because of the latter’s greater efficacy and feasibility.\n\n【10】Although great benefits are expected as described above, complications related to catheter insertion are known as common complications accompanying REBOA: vascular injury, aorta dissection, aberration of the catheter, and organ ischemia of the site distal to the occlusion accompanied by prolonged occlusion. However, complications developing around the site proximal to the occlusion, such as the possibility of increase in bleeding in the site proximal to the occlusion and the side effects of hyperperfusion, have hardly been studied to date. A systematic review \\[ 2 \\] of REBOA, which included 61 articles and 1355 patients, showed that complications of the site proximal to the occlusion occurred only in one patient (0.07%) \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【11】We experienced a case of severe multiple trauma with impending cardiac arrest, in which REBOA was used to avoid cardiac arrest, where REBOA possibly caused major bleeding from a thoracic injury that had been diagnosed as mild at initial arrival.\n\n【12】Here we report this case to raise a concern that the use of REBOA may cause unclarified bleeding complications at sites proximal to an occlusion.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 50-year-old Japanese woman fell from a height of approximately 10 m and was brought to our hospital by an ambulance. She had no remarkable medical and family history, was a social drinker, and a non-smoker of tobacco. Her marital status was stable with her husband. Her consciousness levels were 14 points (E4, V4, M6) according to the Glasgow Coma Scale at initial arrival. She complained of respiratory discomfort and low back pain, and was in an unrestful state. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/minute, blood oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) was 95% under 10 L/minute oxygenation, subcutaneous emphysema was recognized in the left side of her chest, and her breathing sounded weak. A hemoperitoneum was not detected on focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma. Her pulse rate was 90 beats per minute (bpm) and her blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg as measured by an automatic blood pressure monitor. However, her capillary refill time was 3 seconds and radial artery pulsation was feeble with cold sweat in her extremities; hence, she was recognized as being in a state of shock. Her face swelled, and bleeding from her nasal and the oral cavities continued. A subcutaneous hematoma was found in her lumbar and her left femoral region. Her left elbow was deformed and swollen. Because she was in a restless state, accurate neurological assessments were difficult, but coarse paralysis of limbs was not observed.\n\n【15】First, a 28-French chest drain was inserted in her left thoracic cavity for the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hemothorax was not recognized. A pelvis X-ray showed unstable pelvic fracture and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) pan scan was additionally performed. In the contrast CT, retroperitoneal bleeding with the extravasation of contrast media was recognized (Fig. 1 ). Other injuries and laboratory data on initial arrival are shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Pelvis X-ray ( **a** ) and contrast computed tomography ( **b** and **c** ) at the initial arrival. a Fractures of pubic bones, hipbones on both sides, and sacral bones are seen and there are unstable pelvic fractures. A massive retroperitoneal hematoma and extravasation of the contrast media on the anterior of sacrum ( **b** ; arrow) and right perineum ( **c** ; arrow) are recognized\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Table 1 Injury site and diagnosis of this case along with Abbreviated Injury Scale coding**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】**Table 2 Laboratory data on initial arrival**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】The injury severity score in this case was 66 and the probability of survival was calculated as 59.3%. Multiple rib fractures were seen, even though active bleeding from intercostal artery injury and pulmonary laceration were not noted at the initial visit. She had deteriorated during CT (blood pressure 67/42 mmHg, pulse rate 75 bpm), and blood transfusion was therefore started and intubation was performed. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed for hemorrhagic shock with the pelvic fracture as the main bleeding source. While starting angiography, she did not respond to the massive blood transfusion and her systolic blood pressure was maintained at around 60 mmHg. Therefore, first, a 7-French aortic occlusion catheter (RESCUE BALLOON®, Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan) was inserted from her left femoral artery. Her hemodynamics had improved and her systolic blood pressure was 90 mmHg due to REBOA (30 mL saline inflation into the balloon) at the first lumbar vertebra level. Next, transcatheter arterial embolization was started using the sheath inserted in her right femoral artery. Her bilateral internal iliac arteries were embolized from the origin portion with a gelatin sponge. Furthermore, we embolized the extravasation of contrast media of her middle sacral artery and lumbar artery with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Her blood pressure had been monitored by continuous invasive arterial measurement from her upper right brachial artery during interventional radiology. The systolic blood pressure under REBOA was intended to be controlled under 100 mmHg (so called permissive hypotension); however, it was actually in the range of 90 to 160 mmHg. After 18 minutes of occlusion, the balloon was deflated and the aortic occlusion catheter was removed. However, she was still hemodynamically unstable. The internal iliac artery angiography was performed again, and the site that had just been embolized, as described above, presented recanalization. Since coagulopathy was recognized as a complication, we interpreted that it would be difficult to restrain the hemorrhage with the gelatin sponge. Therefore, it was re-embolized from the origin portion of her bilateral internal iliac arteries by n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Fig. 2 ). After embolization, retroperitoneal gauze packing and pelvic external skeletal fixation were additionally performed. Further, a repeat CT pan scan was performed, and a massive hemothorax had appeared in her left pleural cavity, which had not been captured at the first arrival (Fig. 3 ). As the inserted chest drain at the first arrival was detained between lobes, the amount of bleeding in the pleural cavity had not been reflected precisely. Thoracotomy hemostasis was performed and a hemothorax of approximately 2500 ml was aspirated to search for the source of the bleeding. However, clear active bleeding was not captured and only extremely minute bleeding from the rib fracture site, chest wall, and pulmonary contusion area was detected. Therefore, special hemostasis treatment was not needed. After a massive hematoma was removed, a chest drain was placed again and her chest was closed. Continuous blood transfusion was not needed before or after the operation and her postoperative hemodynamics became stable. The timeline of the initial treatment in our emergency department is shown in Table 3 .\n\n【25】**Fig. 2**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Transcatheter arterial embolization for the pelvic fracture. The contrast media extravasation ofthe internal iliac artery area is clear in computed tomography. First, the aortic occlusion catheter was inserted from the left femoral artery (arrowheads) and was embolized with a gelatin sponge from the origin portion of the bilateral internal iliac artery while the aorta was occluded at the first lumbar vertebra level. **a** Embolization of the lumbar artery and middle sacral artery was additionally performed and angiography from the sheath reinserted to the left femoral artery presented re-bleeding (arrow). **b** As it was difficult to arrest hemorrhage with a gelatin sponge, hemorrhage was arrested by embolizing additionally with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate ( **c** and **d** )\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 3**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Comparison of the chest computed tomography images at initial arrival ( **a1** and **a2** ) and post-embolization ( **b1** and **b2** ). Pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema were recognized at the initial diagnosis by computed tomography and, therefore, a chest drain was inserted. Pulmonary contusion was extremely minor and active bleeding such as the intercostal artery injury was not captured ( **a1** and **a2** ). A large hemothorax appeared on reexamination by computed tomography after transcatheter arterial embolization ( **b1** and **b2** ). Similar active bleeding was not observed at the initial diagnosis computed tomography. A large hemothorax of 2500 ml was observed in thoracotomy hemostasis. However, active bleeding requiring hemostasis treatment was not recognized. The inserted chest drain was occluded by blood clots\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Table 3 The timeline of initial treatment in our emergency department**\n\n【34】Full size table\n\n【35】The retroperitoneal packing gauze was removed on day 3. On day 24, the chest drain was removed without increasing the hemothorax. Complications accompanied by internal iliac artery occlusion, such as gluteal muscle necrosis, did not appear. She regained the ability to walk, and was moved to another hospital on day 154 for rehabilitation. She was discharged from the rehabilitation hospital 6 months after the injury, and her activities of daily living were almost independent.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】This case was in a state of threatened cardiac arrest from hemorrhagic shock due to pelvic fracture, but cardiac arrest was avoided by REBOA. However, bleeding of the thoracic injury proximal to the occlusion increased over time, and additional thoracotomy hemostasis was required. The CT at the initial arrival had presented only mild lung contusion. Arterial hemorrhage that resulted in massive hemothorax in a short time was not shown. It is known that delayed massive hemothorax develops in 7.4% of blunt thoracic injuries with rib fracture, even if it is a minor injury in the initial diagnosis \\[ 4 \\]. It usually develops from 18 hours to 6 days (3 days on an average) after injury \\[ 5 \\]. Moreover, its cause is bleeding from the intercostal artery in most cases, but diaphragm injuries can also be the cause in some cases. In this study, the findings obtained by CT and open thoracotomy after the removal of the aortic occlusion did not show active bleeding, and intercostal aneurysms and diaphragm injuries were not confirmed. In a head and pelvic injury case treated by REBOA, Uchino _et al_ . reported that a complication developed in the site proximal to the occlusion by REBOA in which minor intracranial bleeding was seen in the head CT at the initial diagnosis, wherein the bleeding suddenly increased and a cerebral hernia developed and the patient died \\[ 3 \\]. In this case, REBOA excessively raised the perfusion pressure in the chest area proximal to the occlusion, and coagulopathy occurred, induced by trauma shock and trauma itself. Therefore, we considered that bleeding accompanied by extremely minor thoracic injury had increased unexpectedly.\n\n【38】Several methods to avoid complications while performing insertions have been reported, such as the insertion method with ultrasonography \\[ 6 , 7 \\], insertion training with a cadaver \\[ 8 \\], and the use of smaller introducer sheaths for REBOA \\[ 9 \\]. In fact, it has also been reported that a good outcome was obtained by REBOA in the course of prehospital care for severe pelvic fracture as it can be inserted safely without fluoroscopy \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【39】However, only a few studies have focused on blood flow evaluation at the site proximal to the occlusion in an aortic occlusion, or discussed perfusion pressure in detail. Therefore, a clear standard does not exist for the best occlusion rate, or for bleeding control at a site distal from the occlusion without increasing bleeding at a site proximal to the occlusion. Furthermore, it has been reported that in an analysis of data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank, the use of REBOA increased mortality compared with that of cases without REBOA \\[ 11 \\]. REBOA is a revival treatment required in an emergency situation, where there is no other way but to employ REBOA, and it is used at a stage when, it is assumed, detailed information about the lesion and the severity has not yet been grasped. Furthermore, since the frequency of its use is expected to rise in various situations both in and out of hospital for trauma and endogenous diseases in the future, it is necessary to study the evaluation of blood flow at the site proximal to occlusions, the optimal methods of monitoring such blood flow, and the optimal occlusion rates.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】A method for the evaluation of blood flow has not been established for sites proximal to occlusions by REBOA. We report this case to call attention to the use of REBOA which may increase bleeding in sites proximal to occlusions unexpectedly in multiple trauma with head or thoracic injuries, even in the case of minor injuries without active bleeding at the initial diagnosis.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】Bpm:\n\n【44】Beats per minute\n\n【45】CT:\n\n【46】Computed tomography\n\n【47】REBOA:\n\n【48】Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Currently, MTX-LPD has become widely recognized, but its mechanism and prognostic factors remain unclear.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the first case of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated MTX-LPD of the breast. A 63-year-old Asian woman with long-term rheumatoid arthritis presented to our facility with intermittent fever. A physical examination revealed a 3-cm lump in her left breast. She had been taking MTX for the past 15 years. Laboratory studies revealed slightly elevated levels of EBV-viral capsid antigen antibody immunoglobulin G and EBV nuclear antibody. Contrast-enhanced computer tomography revealed a mass in the left breast, a subcutaneous nodule in the abdomen, a mass in the left lung, and a nodule in the left retroperitoneum. The definitive diagnosis was consistent with MTX-LPD merging into an EBV-positive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Six months following the withdrawal of MTX, the breast mass had markedly shrunk and the patient remained in good health for 1 year with no evidence of relapse of LPD.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】MTX-LPD rarely occurs in the breast, and it is difficult to diagnose because there have only been six reported cases of breast MTX-LPD reported in the literature. EBV-positive MTX-LPD tends to regress spontaneously after MTX withdrawal, and our case also had similar results. It is important to make an appropriate diagnosis of MTX-LPD of the breast based on imaging and pathology to determine the appropriate treatment protocol for this rare disorder.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) has been shown to occur in some patients who are immunosuppressed due to treatment with methotrexate (MTX), hence the name MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD). It is known that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have a high risk of developing malignant lymphoma, but epidemiological evidence of an association between the use of MTX and development of lymphoma is still unclear \\[ 1 \\]. At present, LPD that arises in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs, including biologic drugs for autoimmune diseases, is categorized as “other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (OIIA-LPD)”, other than in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, 4th edition (2008).\n\n【10】Unlike usual malignant lymphomas, MTX-LPDs are relatively common in extranodal sites such as the skin, lungs, and oral and pharyngeal cavities; genetic factors and accumulated inflammation are characteristic of MTX-LPD \\[ 1 \\]. Moreover, the relationship between Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection and MTX-LPD has been previously indicated by the WHO classification \\[ 2 \\]. In some cases, MTX-LPD has shown partial regression in response to drug withdrawal alone, and the majority of this response has occurred in EBV-positive cases \\[ 3 \\]. Currently, MTX-LPD has become widely recognized, and MTX is more often discontinued when MTX-LPD is suspected. However, MTX-LPDs of the breast are very rare and difficult to diagnose, because only six cases have been reported thus far \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on EBV-positive LPD in the mammary gland, which disappeared spontaneously after MTX was discontinued.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 63-year-old Asian woman presented with intermittent fever of approximately 38.0 °C, which had lasted for 2 weeks and did respond to antipyretics. She had no night sweating or weight loss. She had been suffering from RA for 37 years and had been taking MTX for more than 15 years. The latest medication doses were 14 mg/week of MTX, 5 mg/day of prednisolone, and 1 mg/day of tacrolimus. She did not receive any other immunosuppressive medication. Other medical history included diabetes, atypical mycobacteriosis, and hepatitis B and there was no family history of lymphoproliferative disorders or malignancies. The patient did not smoke or drink alcohol.\n\n【13】At the time of admission, she had fever of 38.0 °C. Physical examination showed a 3-cm palpable mass in the left breast. There were no visible skin changes and no palpable lymph nodes. Laboratory studies (Table 1 ) revealed slightly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R). EBV-viral capsid antigen antibody immunoglobulin G and EBV nuclear antibody (EBNA) were also increased. We performed contrast-enhanced computer tomography of her chest and abdomen for general evaluation. Results revealed a mass in the left breast, a subcutaneous nodule in the abdomen, a mass in the left lung, and a nodule in the left retroperitoneum (Fig. 1 ). We suspected that these tumors were associated with administration of MTX; thus, MTX was discontinued immediately, and the patient was hospitalized for medical examination.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Summary of the laboratory data of the patient on admission**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan imaging **a** a mass in the breast (arrow), **b** a subcutaneous nodule in the abdomen (arrow), **c** a mass in the left lung (arrow), **d** a nodule in the left retroperitoneum (arrow)\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】One week after MTX withdrawal, imaging evaluation was performed. Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique mammography showed a high-density mass with undefined margins in the internal lower left breast quadrant (Fig. 2 ). Ultrasonography (US) showed a 4.5-cm heterogeneous hyperechoic mass in the internal region of the left breast, which had a low echo area spread like a cord, and blood flow was partially observed along the low echo area (Fig. 3 ). Contrast-enhanced bilateral breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined mass in the same area. The contrast effect appeared only on margins and part of the interior, and the non-imaged mass showed a high signal in fat suppressed T2 weighted image (Fig. 4 ).\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Craniocaudal mammography imaging.

Biopsies from the breast mass were primarily composed of necrotic tissue and revealed the proliferation of atypical lymphocytes with enlarged nuclei around the blood vessel. On immunohistochemical staining, lymphoid cells were positive for CD20, CD79a, and BCL-2, but negative for CD3, CD7, and CD10. EBV-encoded RNA1 (EBER1), latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), and EBV-nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) were positive, and the tumor was thus categorized as latency type III EBV infection (Fig. 5 ).\n\n【34】**Fig. 5**\n\n【35】 \n\n【36】Pathological results from ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the left breast mass.

Based on these clinical course and pathological findings, the definitive diagnosis was consistent with MTX-LPD merging into an EBV-positive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). One month following withdrawal of MTX, the breast mass had become smaller, about 2-cm in diameter on US. Six months later, the mass had markedly shrunk like a scar (Fig. 6 ), and the patient remained in good health for 1 year after the withdrawal of MTX with no evidence of relapse of LPD. To treat the patient’s RA, iguratimod, salazosulfapyridine, and bucillamine were prescribed instead of MTX, and they provided adequate RA control. The patient is currently on a follow-up plan involving core laboratory studies, including sIL-2R every 3 months, and breast US every 6 months to 1 year.\n\n【39】**Fig. 6**\n\n【40】 \n\n【41】Ultrasonography (US) of the left breast. Six months after withdrawal of methotrexate, the mass had markedly shrunk like a scar\n\n【42】Full size image\n\n【43】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【44】MTX has generally become the first-line drug for the treatment of RA since its adoption in the 1980s. It provides benefits for a considerable number of RA patients but is unfortunately associated with several adverse side effects \\[ 10 \\]. The first association between MTX and lymphoma was reported in 1991 when Ellman _et al._ uncovered lymphoma developing in an RA patient who was administered MTX \\[ 11 \\]. After similar cases had been reported, this condition became known as MTX-LPD.\n\n【45】In rare cases, MTX-LPD occurs in the breast, and we reviewed only seven such cases, including the present case \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\] (Table 2 ). All patients had a history of RA treated with MTX, and two patients received other anti-rheumatoid agents in combination with MTX. All patients were female. One case occurred in the nipple-ring complex, and another case occurred independently in the mammary gland. At the time of lymphoma diagnosis, the median age was 69 years (range, 63–79 years). The majority of patients had long-standing RA (median duration 20 years; range, 14–37 years). The periods of MTX administration varied from 7 months to 17 years. Six patients had DLBCL, and one patient had small B-cell lymphoma (marginal zone lymphoma). Only the present case was positive for EBV infection detected by _in situ_ hybridization (EBER-ISH). All patients ceased MTX treatment at the time of MTX-LPD diagnosis. Two patients had confirmed remission with only discontinuation of MTX. One case relapsed after MTX withdrawal and initiation of chemotherapy. Finally, all patients had reduced pattern or regression, and no deaths were reported.\n\n【46】**Table 2 Clinical and pathological findings in 7 cases of MTX-LPD occurring in the breast in RA**\n\n【47】Full size table\n\n【48】To our knowledge, this is the first case of EBV-positive MTX-LPD occurring in the breast. The relationship between EBV infection and MTX-LPD has been previously indicated, and it is conceivable that EBV is reactivated in the lesions \\[ 2 \\]. In addition, 30–50% of MTX-LPD cases in RA patients have EBV positivity \\[ 12 \\]. It has been suggested that this is due to the immunosuppressive effects of MTX, which leads to the reduced function of cytotoxic T cells, thereby resulting in the latent proliferation of EBV-infected B cells \\[ 13 \\]. Sometimes, MTX-LPD has shown partial regression in response to drug withdrawal alone, and the majority of this response has occurred in EBV-positive cases \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【49】According to the immunohistochemical expression patterns of EBV latent RNA and proteins, EBV-associated malignancies are categorized into three groups \\[ 14 \\]: latency type I (EBER +, LMP1 −, and EBNA2 −), including Burkitt lymphoma; latency type II (EBER +, LMP1 +, and EBNA2 −), including Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and latency type III (EBER +, LMP1 +, and EBNA2 +), including LPD arising in immunocompromised patients. However, the relationship between MTX-LPD and the types of EBV latency is unclear, as only a few cases of EBV latency in MTX-LPD have been reported. The present case showed EBER +, LMP1 +, and EBNA2 + and was categorized as latency type III. Miyazaki _et al._ reported that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma type MTX-LPD, especially in the latency type III group, showed regression, and that analysis of EBV latency is useful for deciding an optimal therapeutic strategy \\[ 15 \\]. This patient with latency type III tumor also had similar regression results. On the contrary, Ishida _et al._ interestingly reported EBV-positive MTX-LPD diagnosed in a swollen tonsil biopsy \\[ 16 \\]. It spontaneously regressed after withdrawal of MTX, and the follow-up specimens from the tonsil became EBV-negative and free of LPD. LPD regression led to negative EBER-ISH, suggesting the possibility that previously negative cases may have once been positive, depending on the time of diagnosis. Thus, it may be difficult to consider prognosis with EBER-ISH of the tissue. Currently, peripheral blood EBV-DNA is being used for examination \\[ 17 \\]. Au _et al._ reported that plasma-derived EBV-DNA is valuable both as a tumor marker and prognostic biomarker in EBV-positive lymphomas \\[ 18 \\]. Unfortunately, EBV-DNA was not measured in this case, but it will be used for further studies in the future.\n\n【50】As breast tissue is on the body surface, it can be easily evaluated by US, and US is relatively common for observing breast tissue. Primary breast lymphoma usually displays a very low echo with a well-demarcated mass, which reflects its high cell density \\[ 19 \\]. In contrast, this case revealed mainly hyperechoic mass, and the tumor had a low echo area spread like a cord and blood flow along the low echo area, 1 week after withdrawal of MTX. In the pathology specimens of the breast, which were performed at the same time, there were mostly necrotic areas and partially viable lymphoid cells around the blood vessels. Because the low echo area indicates uneven cell density, in contrast with the ultrasound and pathological findings, the majority of the high echo area reflects the wide necrotic area, and the cord-like low echo area with blood flow reflects the blood vessels and lymphoid cells. This is supported by the MRI findings, which showed a contrast effect only on the margins and part of the interior of the non-imaged mass. Moreover, the non-imaged mass revealed high signal in fat-suppressed T2 weighted image, which indicates that the inside of the tumor is necrotic. On the other hand, the previous six patients with MTX-LPD of the breast had heterogeneous hypoechoic masses. Unfortunately, in this case, the image could not be evaluated before MTX discontinuation, and the previous six reports did not describe the temporal context between image evaluation and MTX discontinuation in detail. However, presuming that the withdrawal of MTX leads to tumor necrosis and changes a hypoechoic mass into a hyperechoic mass, image evaluation before and after MTX discontinuation may serve as a predictor and determinant of therapeutic efficacy.\n\n【51】Finally, here are two interesting reports from Japan. Shimizu _et al._ reported that two cases of MTX-LPD of the lung with an EBER-negative pattern showed improvement before discontinuation of MTX \\[ 20 \\]. Both lung diagnostic specimens were mainly composed of “necrosis.” Ejima-Yamada _et al._ also reported that EBV infection is associated with the hypermethylation of apoptosis-related genes, which leads to tumor regression after the withdrawal of MTX \\[ 1 , 21 \\]. The disease progression, resolution, or recurrence may occur regardless of MTX continuation or discontinuation. Prognostic factors remain unclear, and it is not certain how EBV and necrosis are involved. However, we believe that imaging and pathological findings of necrosis early in the course of the disease are among the prognostic factors to consider. In particular, when MTX-LPD is suspected, it is crucial to screen for EBV infection and repeat image evaluation in order to avoid undetected necrosis.\n\n【52】We have reported the first case of EBV-positive MTX-LPD of the breast. MTX-LPD rarely occurs in the breast and is difficult to diagnose. EBV-positive MTX-LPD tends to regress spontaneously after withdrawal of MTX, and our case also had similar results. It is important to make an appropriate diagnosis based on images and pathology in order to determine appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n【53】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】Not applicable.\n\n【55】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【56】LPD:\n\n【57】Lymphoproliferative disorder\n\n【58】MTX:\n\n【59】Methotrexate\n\n【60】EBV:\n\n【61】Epstein–Barr virus\n\n【62】OIIA-LPD:\n\n【63】Other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders\n\n【64】RA:\n\n【65】Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【66】WHO:\n\n【67】World Health Organization\n\n【68】sIL-2R:\n\n【69】Soluble interleukin-2 receptor\n\n【70】EBNA:\n\n【71】EBV nuclear antibody\n\n【72】US:\n\n【73】Ultrasonography\n\n【74】MRI:\n\n【75】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【76】EBER1:\n\n【77】EBV-encoded RNA1\n\n【78】EBNA2:\n\n【79】EBV-nuclear antigen 2\n\n【80】DLBCL:\n\n【81】Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Solitary splenic metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer is rare in patients with post-treatment ovarian cancer with long disease-free intervals.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a 62-year-old Japanese woman who presented with elevated serum cancer antigen 125 due to a solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer. She underwent primary open cytoreduction including resection of the right ovarian cancer and postoperative chemotherapy, followed by secondary open cytoreduction and additional postoperative chemotherapy. The disease-free interval was more than 5 years after the additional postoperative chemotherapy. She did not complain of any symptoms and there were no abnormal findings except for elevated cancer antigen 125. However, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor of 6.5 × 4.5 cm in her spleen, and <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed no other metastatic lesions. Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed as tertiary cytoreduction with a diagnosis of a solitary splenic metastasis. Her elevated cancer antigen 125 immediately decreased to within the normal range after the splenectomy. On microscopic examination, the tumor was grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma localized in the spleen, consistent with the previous grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma ovarian cancer.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Elevated cancer antigen 125 is useful for early detection of metastasis of ovarian cancer. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography are useful to evaluate whether splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer is solitary, and laparoscopic splenectomy is safe and feasible for a solitary splenic metastasis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】According to the literature, metastasis in the spleen occurs in approximately 1% of malignant tumors \\[ 1 \\], and colorectal and ovarian cancer are known to metastasize to the spleen more frequently than other malignant tumors \\[ 2 \\]. Epithelial ovarian cancer is known to metastasize throughout the peritoneum to cause visceral spreading, including to the capsule of the spleen. Therefore, splenic metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer is usually found in patients at the terminal stage. A solitary splenic metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer is very rare and considered to have metastasized hematogenously. Although the role of cytoreduction in the metastasis of ovarian cancer is not well established, cytoreduction can improve the oncological outcome in platinum-sensitive patients with solitary metastasis to the tissues or organs, including the spleen \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\n【10】We present a rare case of a solitary splenic metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer, which occurred after a 5-year disease-free interval, and laparoscopic splenectomy as tertiary cytoreduction for the metastatic tumor.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 62-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital because of a pelvic tumor with massive ascites, which was diagnosed as an ovarian tumor by pelvic examination, vaginal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her blood cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level was as high as 578.6 U/mL (reference range, 0–35 U/mL). First, she underwent probe laparotomy, including resection of the right ovarian tumor and partial resection of her omentum in July 2010 because of the massive adhesion similar to a frozen pelvis. Pathological examination revealed grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. A tumor > 2 cm with the same pathological diagnosis was confirmed in the resected omentum. She was diagnosed as having abdominal and pelvic cavity metastases of ovarian cancer, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIC, and received six cycles of systemic chemotherapy: paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) scheme. She received 175 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> TC, according to an area under the curve (AUC) of 5, for 21 days in each cycle. During the chemotherapy, her CA125 level decreased from 578.6 U/mL to 10.7 U/mL. Follow-up MRI demonstrated that the solid tumor and ascites had disappeared completely. Thus, the post-chemotherapy evaluation was complete remission.\n\n【13】Subsequently, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of the residual omentum in February 2011. The pathology of the left ovarian tumor was also grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. However, no residual adenocarcinoma was found in her pelvic cavity or her omentum. Therefore, the second cytoreduction was considered the optimal surgery. Another six cycles of systemic TC chemotherapy were administered after the second operation. Our patient received the last cycle of chemotherapy in July 2011.\n\n【14】She did well with no complaints and had a normal CA125 level until November 2016, when she was found to have an elevated CA125 level of 65.4 U/mL. However, a pelvic examination with vaginal ultrasonography did not show any abnormal findings. After 1 month, her CA125 level was still high, at 67.8 U/mL. In November 2016, her liver enzymes, such as glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), were within normal range, and each value was 22, 12, and 12 IU/L, respectively. A month later, GOT, GPT, and GGT were still within normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of her abdomen and pelvic cavity revealed a pale hypodense area in the spleen (Fig. 1a ).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】 \n\n【17】Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examination. **a** Computed tomography performed in December 2016 shows a pale homogenous tumor in the spleen. **b** Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging performed in January 2017 shows a tumor with internal heterogeneity and irregular margin in the spleen.

Therefore, we diagnosed the splenic tumor as an isolated splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】<sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography examination. **a** <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography performed in February 2017 shows neither abnormal hypermetabolic lesions nor lymph node swelling in the whole body except for the left upper abdominal lesion. **b** Axial <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography view shows a solitary hypermetabolic lesion in the spleen\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Our patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy in March 2017. Under a right lateral position, 12 mm ports were inserted at her navel after minimal laparotomy. Three ports (5 mm in diameter) were added from the left upper quadrant area. The tumor did not invade outside the spleen, and no peritoneal dissemination was observed. We divided the splenocolic ligament, the lienorenal ligament, and the splenogastric ligament, and mobilized her spleen. The hilum of her spleen was exposed and the tail of her pancreas was identified. Her splenic artery and vein were dissected and divided using an Echelon stapler. The spleen was extracted from the extended 12-mm port site.\n\n【25】Pathological examination revealed grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma localized in the spleen, consistent with the previous grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma ovarian cancer (Fig. 3a, b ). Her postoperative CA125 level decreased to 18.1 U/mL. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and her liver function and kidney function were within normal range 1 month after laparoscopic splenectomy. She received 175 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> paclitaxel, AUC 5 carboplatin, and 15 mg/kg bevacizumab as postoperative chemotherapy. Carboplatin was omitted in the third to sixth courses of chemotherapy because of an allergy to carboplatin in the second course. After the sixth course of chemotherapy she underwent a clinical examination, CA125 assessment, abdominal ultrasonography, and abdominal CT. All tests showed no recurrence of ovarian cancer.\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Macroscopic findings and histopathological examination. **a** There was no macroscopic invasion of the splenic capsule. **b** The gross specimen included a single, oval, yellow-white, solid tumor. **c** Histopathological examination of the splenic tumor at laparoscopic tertiary cytoreduction in 2017 indicated grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar features to the primary ovarian tumor (hematoxylin and eosin, × 200 original magnification). **d** Microscopic features of the ovarian tumor at primary cytoreduction in 2010 indicated grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (hematoxylin and eosin, × 200 original magnification)\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】We experienced a solitary splenic metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer occurring after a 5-year disease-free interval and successful laparoscopic splenectomy. Generally, splenic metastasis is known to occur from hematological malignant diseases such as malignant lymphoma and leukemia. However, splenic metastasis is sometimes found in patients with end stage cancer as multiorgan metastasis. Colorectal and ovarian cancer are sometimes known to cause splenic metastasis \\[ 2 \\]. Splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer is generally associated with peritoneal spreading with multiorgan involvement. Therefore, solitary splenic metastasis is rare, and metastasis is considered to occur through the hematogenic route. Recently, 35 cases of splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer were reviewed in the literature, 30 of which were solitary metastases \\[ 5 \\]. On pathological examination, 28 cases were serous adenocarcinoma, 1 case was angiosarcoma, and 1 case was carcinosarcoma. According to some studies, including the previously mentioned study, the time to development of postoperative splenic metastasis varies, and eight cases were found after more than 5 years \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. The longest time to development observed thus far is 20 years \\[ 7 \\]. On pathological examination, seven cases were serous adenocarcinoma and one case was grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Our case was also a solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that occurred after a 5-year disease-free interval. Therefore, our results suggest that grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma ovarian cancer is likely to cause solitary splenic metastasis after more than 5 years, even though previous studies have found that the majority of solitary splenic metastases of ovarian cancer with a disease-free interval of longer than 5 years were caused by serous adenocarcinoma. A solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer is treated by open or laparoscopic splenectomy followed by chemotherapy, and the prognosis is generally good. According to PubMed, the first reported laparoscopic splenectomy for solitary splenic metastasis was a hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy in 1998 \\[ 13 \\]. After that, the number of laparoscopic splenectomies has increased, and they have been reported to be safe and feasible \\[ 14 \\]. Although our case involved laparoscopic splenectomy as tertiary cytoreduction, the operation was performed successfully and the postoperative course was uneventful. Recently, another case of laparoscopic splenectomy as quaternary cytoreduction was reported to have been performed successfully \\[ 15 \\].\n\n【32】The majority of solitary splenic metastases of ovarian cancer are asymptomatic. Therefore, it is difficult to diagnose solitary splenic metastasis early. However, serum CA125 is useful to diagnose asymptomatic solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer because the majority of cases show an increase in serum CA125 level \\[ 15 \\]. Our case also showed no symptoms, but the serum CA125 level was elevated before imaging, indicating the presence of the splenic metastasis. In addition, the elevated serum CA125 level decreased to a normal level immediately after the operation. CT or MRI is essential to diagnose solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer, and FDG-PET-CT may add more particular findings about the metastasis of ovarian cancer. We diagnosed the solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer by using CT and MRI, and confirmed our diagnosis with FDG-PET-CT. Therefore, we were able to opt for laparoscopic splenectomy rather than open splenectomy. Finally, we reconfirmed the solitary metastatic tumor of the ovarian cancer pathologically.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【34】We believe that solitary splenic metastasis occurs from ovarian cancer even when the disease-free interval is more than 5 years, and that not only serous adenocarcinoma but also endometrioid adenocarcinoma can cause solitary splenic metastasis. Serum CA125 level may be useful for diagnosing asymptomatic solitary splenic metastasis, and diagnostic imaging tools, especially FDG-PET-CT, may be useful in evaluating whether the splenic metastasis is solitary. Laparoscopic splenectomy as multiple cytoreduction may be safe and feasible for solitary splenic metastasis of ovarian cancer.\n\n【35】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【36】AUC:\n\n【37】Area under the curve\n\n【38】CA125:\n\n【39】Cancer antigen 125\n\n【40】CT:\n\n【41】Computed tomography\n\n【42】FDG-PET:\n\n【43】<sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\n\n【44】GGT:\n\n【45】Gamma-glutamyltransferase\n\n【46】GOT:\n\n【47】Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase\n\n【48】GPT:\n\n【49】Glutamic pyruvic transaminase\n\n【50】MRI:\n\n【51】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【52】TC:\n\n【53】Paclitaxel and carboplatin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This defect can be caused either by developmental failure of the posterolateral foramina to fuse properly, or by traumatic injury of the diaphragm. Left-sided diaphragmatic hernias are more common (80–90%) because the right pleuroperitoneal canal closes earlier and the liver protects the right diaphragm. Diaphragmatic hernias in adults are relatively asymptomatic, but in some cases may lead to incarcerated bowel, intraabdominal organ dysfunction, or severe pulmonary disease. The aim of this report is to enlighten clinical doctors about this rare entity that can have fatal consequences for the patient.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a rare case of a right-sided strangulating diaphragmatic hernia in an adult Caucasian patient without history of trauma. Clinical examination revealed bowel sounds in the right hemithorax, which were confirmed by the presence of loops of small intestine into the right part of the thorax through the right diaphragm, as was shown on chest X-ray and computerized tomography. Deterioration of the clinical status of the patient led to an operation, which revealed strangulated necrotic small bowel. Approximately 1 m of bowel was removed, and laterolateral anastomosis was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged 8 days later.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Surgery is required to replace emerged organs into the abdomen and to repair diaphragmatic lesion. A delayed approach can have catastrophic complications for a patient.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Diaphragmatic hernia is a lesion of the diaphragm, through which loops of small and large bowel, stomach, liver, and spleen may protrude into the thoracic cavity of the involved side. This defect of the diaphragm can be either congenital or acquired, usually after a blunt trauma \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A diaphragmatic hernia usually occurs in the posterolateral portion of the diaphragm (Bochdalek hernia), in 85% of cases \\[ 3 \\]. In contrast, a Morgagni hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm, and this type accounts for approximately 2% of cases \\[ 4 \\]. Left-sided diaphragmatic hernias are more common, because the right pleuroperitoneal canal closes earlier and the liver protects the right diaphragm \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【10】In the vast majority of cases, diaphragmatic hernias are asymptomatic in adults \\[ 6 \\]. In 5–10% of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain \\[ 7 \\]. In some of these cases, a diaphragmatic hernia may lead to fatal complications such as strangulated intestine, intraabdominal organ dysfunction, or severe pulmonary disease \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【11】We report the case of a 50-year-old woman whose right-sided diaphragmatic hernia strangulated loops of small bowel and who was thus treated via urgent laparoscopy.\n\n【12】### Case presentation\n\n【13】We present the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian female patient who was hospitalized for vomiting and pain in the right upper abdomen and the right part of the thorax. She was ill-looking. Her vital signs on admission were temperature 36.8 °C, heart rate 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and blood pressure 120/80 mmHg.\n\n【14】Her body mass index was 20, her tobacco use was 5 pack-years, and she did not consume alcohol. She was married and had two children aged 14 and 19 years. She was employed in a bank in Belgium, where she lived permanently. She was in vacation with her family in Greece at the time of her admission to the hospital.\n\n【15】She was taking no medication and had no other underlying disease. Furthermore, her medical history was unremarkable, without any previous surgical interventions in the abdomen or thorax. There was no history of any previous abdominal or thoracic trauma.\n\n【16】On clinical examination, the abdomen was not tender, even in the right upper abdomen, but the presence of bowel sounds in the right hemithorax was revealed through stethoscope. There were no findings on physical and neurological examination.\n\n【17】The blood tests depicted an elevation of inflammatory markers (white blood cell count 16,900/μL, normal range 3,800–10,500/μL; C-reactive protein 0.1, normal values < 0.05) and a slight deterioration of renal function (Ur 63, normal range 15–50; Cr 1.38, normal range 0.7–1.3). The results of all other markers were within normal range (hemoglobin 13.6, normal range 13.4–17.4; hematocrit 43, normal range 41.0–53.8; platelet count 250.000, normal range 150.000–400.000; serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 30, normal range 5–35; serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 31, normal range 0–55; γ-glutamyl transferase 48, normal range 0–50; sodium 137, normal range 136–145, potassium 4.5, normal range 3.5–5.1). Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.\n\n【18】Chest X-ray revealed a right elevation of the diaphragm with the presence of small bowel into the right thoracic cavity (Fig. 1 ). Computerized tomography of the chest and abdomen was performed and confirmed the presence of loops of small intestine into the right hemithorax through the right diaphragm (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】X-ray, loops of small bowel into the right part of the thorax\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】 \n\n【25】CT scan, right-sided diaphragmatic hernia\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Due to deterioration of her clinical status with increasing pain in the right upper abdomen and right hemithorax, the patient underwent urgent laparoscopy 12 hours after her admission to the hospital. The operation revealed strangulated necrotic small bowel inside the diaphragmatic hernia. The initial laparoscopy was converted into laparotomy. Due to the strangulation, a part of the small bowel was ischemic and necrotic. A total of 80 cm of small bowel and 10 cm of large bowel (cecal) was removed because the necrosis of the intestine was near the ileocecal valve. Laterolateral anastomosis was performed, and the 5-cm wide defect in the diaphragm was repaired with interrupted sutures. During the surgical procedure, a chest tube was inserted.\n\n【28】The postoperative period was without any incident, and the patient was released in good condition 8 days after the operation. After the surgery and during her hospital stay, she was receiving intravenous 3 g cefoxitin/day for 3 days, 1.5 g metronidazole/day for 3 days, and 4 g paracetamol/day for 4 days. The initial postoperative intravenous administration of fluids was followed by oral feeding after 4 days.\n\n【29】The patient lives permanently in Belgium, and after 3 months of the operation, she sent findings of computerized tomography in the chest and abdomen showing no pathological entity.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】We report a rare case of a right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in a 50 year-old woman without previous history of trauma. Clinical examination and imaging of chest and abdomen revealed the presence of loops of small bowel into the right part of the thorax. Urgent laparoscopy revealed the reason for the deterioration of her clinical status, as part of the small bowel inside the hernia was ischemic and necrotic. Abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity can be developed after injury to the chest or due to congenital defect of the diaphragm. Left-sided diaphragmatic hernias are more common, because the right pleuroperitoneal canal closes earlier and the liver protects the right diaphragm \\[ 5 \\]. It is extremely rare to detect a right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in an adult without trauma \\[ 5 \\]. Up to 2004, only ten such cases had been reported \\[ 10 , 11 , 12 \\]. Since 2004, ten more cases have been added \\[ 13 \\].\n\n【32】Most diaphragmatic hernias are diagnosed in children who present with acute pulmonary symptoms \\[ 5 \\]. It occurs in about 1 in 2200–12,500 live births \\[ 5 \\]. In contrast to the acute presentation in infants, diaphragmatic hernias in adults are relatively asymptomatic \\[ 6 \\]. The absence of breath sounds and the presence of bowel sounds in the chest are typical findings associated with diaphragmatic hernia \\[ 6 , 7 \\].\n\n【33】In most of the cases, the disorder is unexpectedly detected on chest X-ray \\[ 1 \\]. Due to the low sensitivity of chest radiography, diaphragmatic hernias may be confused for other thoracic pathologies, including tension pneumothorax, pericardial fat pad, sequestration of the lung, mediastinal lipoma, or anterior mediastinal mass \\[ 1 , 14 \\]. The gold standard technique for diagnosis is computerized tomography, which enables clinical doctors to evaluate the size, location, and type of diaphragmatic hernia \\[ 14 \\]. Two studies revealed that computerized tomography has a sensitivity of 78% for left-sided hernias and 50% for right-sided hernias \\[ 1 , 14 \\].\n\n【34】The most common symptoms in affected adults include chronic dyspnea, chest pain, recurrent abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, and vomiting \\[ 6 , 7 \\]. The lack of specific clinical signs may delay the correct diagnosis, which can have fatal consequences for the patient. An undiagnosed diaphragmatic hernia may lead to strangulated intestine, intraabdominal organ dysfunction, or severe pulmonary disease with a mortality rate of 32% \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【35】Carter _et al._ described the four stages in the development of strangulating diaphragmatic hernia, and they believe that it is important for clinical doctors to recognize each of these four stages in the eventual development of a diaphragmatic hernia \\[ 15 \\]: (1) asymptomatic, (2) minimal symptoms, (3) obstruction, and (4) strangulation. The stage of obstruction is characterized by severe upper abdominal or lower thoracic pain, nausea, and vomiting. In the fourth stage, the tension of the symptoms is increased, and a surgical intervention is necessary. Most of the patients develop the last complication (strangulation) weeks, months, or even years after the first diagnosis of a congenital or posttraumatic diaphragmatic hernia, as reported by Carter _et al_ . \\[ 15 \\]. In cases with diaphragmatic hernia, rapid diagnosis and eventual surgical intervention are important. A delayed approach can have catastrophic complications for a patient \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【36】In our case, the patient was hospitalized for vomiting and pain in the right upper abdomen and the right part of the thorax, which are the main symptoms depicted in literature for strangulating diaphragmatic hernia \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 15 \\]. Computerized tomography enabled us to evaluate the size, location, and type of diaphragmatic hernia. The elevation of the tension of the symptoms led without delay to a surgical intervention, which was lifesaving for the patient.\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】We report a rare case of right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in an adult who was treated via urgent laparoscopy. Despite being rare, this disorder should be recognized, examined, and treated appropriately to avoid fatal complications. However, there is no consensus among surgeons regarding the timing and the absolute indications of a surgical intervention. Early diagnosis is very important for the urgent surgical intervention, which remains the only curative treatment for diaphragmatic hernia associated with strangulated abdominal organ.\n\n【39】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【40】The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

At present, only a few hundreds of cases have been reported worldwide, mainly in Europe and the United States. A case of a Chinese patient is reported here, along with a literature review.\n\n【3】### Case report\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Asian male who complained of hematuria for 20 days was admitted to the hospital. Contrast enhanced Computer Tomography showed that the volume of the right kidney was increased, with a patchy low-density shadow with infiltrative growth inside that had a significantly lower signal intensity than the renal cortex; thus, the possibility of collecting duct carcinoma or lymphoma, was considered. Enlarged perirenal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were also seen, along with bilateral renal cysts. Eight years prior, ultrasonography had shown a complex renal cyst in the right kidney, and no treatment was administered at that time. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy of the right kidney was performed this time, and the postoperative specimens were submitted for pathological examination. Because immunohistochemistry showed the loss of fumarate hydratase protein expression and the possibility of fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma was considered, corresponding molecular pathological tests were performed, and the results showed an FHp.R233H (arginine > histidine) germline mutation (inactivation mutation). The postoperative pathological diagnosis was fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney, T3aN1M0. The patient was treated with sunitinib, and bone and liver metastases developed half a year later. The treatment was then changed to axitinib and toripalimab. At present, the patient is in stable condition, and there has been no progression of the metastases.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma is a very rare renal tumor that is defined on a molecular basis. It is highly malignant and metastasizes early. Therefore, fully understanding the disease, enabling detection and diagnosis and administering treatment are particularly important.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma is a rare pathological subtype caused by a pathogenic mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene located in 1q42.3-q43 and was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO 5th edition) in 2022 \\[ 1 \\]. This type of renal cell carcinoma is highly invasive and can metastasize when the tumor volume is very small \\[ 2 \\]. Due to its rarity and the lack of understanding of its clinical manifestations, the exact incidence of the disease is unknown. The literature shows that the disease occurs all over the world, but it is mainly seen in Europe and the United States \\[ 3 \\]. The incidence of fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma is rare in Asian populations, especially in Chinese populations. Thus, this report presents a case of a rare form of this malignancy, fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma; because of the rarity of this disease, this article can be a valuable source of information for other medical professionals facing similar conditions. Moreover, this is an intriguing case of a very rare renal tumor that was defined on a molecular basis, and its characteristics will be thoroughly discussed below.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 60-year-old Asian male who complained of hematuria for 20 days was admitted to the hospital. Ultrasonography showed an extremely hypoechoic mass at the lower pole of the left kidney, enlargement of the right kidney, and multiple hypoechoic areas of the right kidney (cysts and space-occupying lesions were considered), and further examinations were recommended. Subsequent contrast enhanced Computer Tomography (CT) showed that the volume of the right kidney was increased, with a patchy low-density shadow with infiltrative growth inside that had a significantly lower signal intensity than the renal cortex; the possibility of collecting duct carcinoma or lymphoma was considered. Enlarged perirenal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were also seen (Fig. 1 ), along with bilateral renal cysts, calcification of the left renal cyst wall, and bilateral kidney stones. Eight years prior, ultrasonography showed a complex renal cyst in the right kidney, and no treatment was administered at that time. The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years, and his blood pressure was well controlled by oral enalapril 10 mg daily. He had a healthy son and denied a family history of genetic mutations. The other laboratory tests showed no other abnormal findings. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy of the right kidney was performed at this time, and the postoperative specimens were submitted for pathological examination. Grossly, a mass in the middle and upper poles of the right kidney was seen, with a size of 65 × 35 × 20 mm. The mass broke through the renal capsule and invaded the perirenal adipose tissue. The mass contained cystic and solid regions and was grayish red. The focal area was yellowish, and the texture was moderately hard. Microscopic examination showed that the cystic areas of the tumor were lined by a monolayer of tumor cells (Fig. 2 a). The tumor cells in the solid areas were arranged into papillary shapes, glandular tubes, nests and sheets. The tumor cells were enlarged in size and irregular in shape. The cell boundaries were unclear, and the cytoplasm was eosinophilic or slightly transparent. The nucleus was enlarged and atypical, with a significant eosinophilic nucleolus and peripheral halo (Fig. 2 b). Abnormal mitoses were clearly seen. A small amount of lymphocyte infiltration could be seen in the stroma. There was no definite bleeding or necrosis. Cancer metastasis was observed in 2 renal hilar lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed CK, EMA, PAX8 (+) (Fig. 2 c), CD10 focal (+), CK7, Vim, FH (−) (Fig. 2 d), and Ki-67 80% (+). Due to the negative expression of fumarate hydratase (FH) protein in a renal tumor that was morphologically similar to fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-deficient RCC), corresponding molecular pathological tests were performed, and the results showed an FHp.R233H (arginine > histidine) germline mutation (inactivation mutation). The postoperative pathological diagnosis was fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney, T3aN1M0.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Contrast enhanced Computer Tomography showing that the volume of the right kidney was increased, with a patchy low-density shadow with infiltrative growth inside that had significantly lower signal intensity than that the renal cortex. Enlarged lymph nodes can be seen around the kidney\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Hematoxylin/eosin staining ( **a** ) showing that the cyst wall is lined by a monolayer of cuboidal tumor cells. × 100 magnification.

Immunohistochemistry ( **d** ) showing the absence of Fumarate hydratase protein in the tumor cells; additionally, the nonneoplastic renal cells that served as the internal control showed granular positive expression in the cytoplasm. × 200 magnification\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】FH-deficient RCC is mainly caused by inactivating mutations in the FH gene located in 1q42.3-q43. The inactivation mutation of the FH gene is caused by the germline mutation of one allele and somatic mutation of another allele. The most common type of mutation is missense mutation. Frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, insertion/deletion mutations and splice site mutations have also been reported \\[ 4 \\]. FH catalyzes the conversion of fumaric acid to malic acid in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The functional defect caused by the inactivation mutation of the FH gene leads to the accumulation of FH and a decrease in iron levels in cells, which inhibits hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase and increases the level of intracellular HIF. Thus, the mutation affects the transcription of downstream products, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【22】FH-deficient RCC is highly malignant and can metastasize when the tumor volume is very small. The exact incidence of the disease is unknown, and it is mainly seen in Europe and the United States; conversely, this disease is rare in Asian populations, especially in the Chinese population.\n\n【23】The age of onset of the disease is 10–90 years old, and the average age of onset in Europe and the United States is 20–25 years earlier than that of sporadic RCC in the general population \\[ 6 \\]. The main manifestations of such patients were hematuria, osphyalgia and other nonspecific symptoms. The main symptom of this patient was hematuria for 20 days without osphyalgia, abdominal pain or symptoms of urinary tract irritation.\n\n【24】The pathological features of the tumor are usually invasive growth and invasion into the surrounding tissue. Microscopically, the tumor cells are arranged into papillary, tubular, solid or cystic patterns. The histological structure is diverse, similar to that of type II papillary renal cell carcinoma, collecting duct carcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma and so on \\[ 7 \\]. The tumor cells had a significant eosinophilic nucleolus and peripheral halo. The 2 immunohistochemical biomarkers that show a high correlation with the diagnosis of FH-deficient RCC are FH and S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC). Although the 2SC protein was not detected in this study because there is no such antibody in our laboratory, the possibility of FH-deficient RCC was considered due to the loss of FH protein expression in a renal tumor that was morphologically similar to FH-deficient RCC. Then, corresponding gene mutation detection was performed for the patient in this article.\n\n【25】FH-deficient RCC is a renal tumor newly defined by the WHO (5 <sup>th </sup> edition) in 2022 \\[ 1 \\] and was named hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC)-associated RCC by the WHO (4th edition) in 2016 \\[ 8 \\]. The definitive criterion for the diagnosis of HLRCC is the detection of germline mutations in the FH gene. Hansen _et al._ \\[ 9 \\] also summarized some major and minor criteria for diagnosis. The former includes the following: (1) at least one lesion histologically confirmed as multiple cutaneous leiomyoma (CLM); and (2) a family history of HLRCC and at least one minor criterion. The minor criteria are as follows: 1. single solitary histologically confirmed CLM; (2) multiple uterine leiomyomas with severe symptom onset in a patient < 40 years old; and (3) Onset of type II papillary renal cell carcinoma in a patient < 40 years old. Meeting the major criteria is highly suggestive of HLRCC. Meeting the minor criteria should raise a suspicion for HLRCC. If the patient has CLM, we should confirm whether the patient has HLRCC through further examinations to avoid a missed diagnosis. Although the first finding in most patients is CLM, the first finding of this patient was RCC, and no CLM was found in this patient or his children.\n\n【26】In terms of differential diagnosis, although FH-deficient RCC has a variety of histological structures, it can be distinguished from other types of RCC based on a combination of molecular pathology characteristics and immunohistochemical findings. For example, type II papillary renal cell carcinoma is characterized by the amplification of chromosome 7/17. MiTF/TFE family translocation RCC shows rearrangement of TFE3 and TFEB. Germline mutation of the SDH gene and loss of SDH protein expression have been found in SDH-deficient RCC. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma shows the loss of 3P and strong positive expression of CAIX protein on the tumor cell membrane. Collecting duct carcinoma is a high-grade RCC that invades the renal medulla, with histological findings of an obvious fibrogenic reaction of the tumor stroma and no characteristic molecular pathological changes. FH-deficient RCC shows a pathogenic germline FH mutation, with negative FH and/or positive 2SC protein expression, but other subtypes of renal cell carcinoma show positive expression of the FH protein, with no inactivated mutation of the FH gene.\n\n【27】In terms of treatment, FH-deficient RCC is highly invasive, and metastasis can occur when the tumor is less than 3 cm \\[ 10 \\]. After diagnosis, radical nephrectomy plus lymph node dissection is preferred. Targeted drug therapy or immunotherapy may also bring new breakthroughs in the treatment of these patients. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy of the right kidney was chosen in combination with postoperative targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy for this patient.\n\n【28】In terms of follow-up monitoring, we recommend that family members at risk of the disease undergo the following assessments:\n\n【29】1\\. A thorough dermatological examination every other year starting at 10 years of age to assess the existence and development of CLM.\n\n【30】2\\. Annual gynecological examinations for women starting at 20 years of age to assess the growth of uterine leiomyomas.\n\n【31】3\\. Renal monitoring for patients with FH gene mutations according to the following recommendations:\n\n【32】*   3.1 Yearly MRI scans starting at the age of 8–10 years.\n    \n*   3.2 If renal cysts are detected, closer monitoring is indicated, as follows:\n    \n*   3.2.1 during the 1st year: at 3, 6, and 12 months after the detection of the cysts, if no solid nodules appear.\n    \n*   3.2.2 during the 2nd–4th years: every 6 months, if no solid nodules appear.\n    \n*   3.2.3 from the 5th year and onward: yearly MRI scans.\n    \n*   3.3 If solid nodules are detected, brain MRI and whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PDG-PET) should be for staging (repeat 1 × after 3 months) \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n    \n\n【33】After the patient in this case was diagnosed, his son and grandson were tested for the FH gene, and no mutations were found. The patient was treated with targeted drugs: oral administration of sunitinib 50 mg once a day. The patient took the medicine for 4 weeks and then stopped for 2 weeks. The tumor progressed, and bone and liver metastasis occurred half a year later. The treatment was then changed to oral axitinib 5 mg twice a day and toripalimab 240 mg every 21 days via an intravenous drip. At present, the patient is in stable condition, and there has been no progression of the metastases.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】FH-deficient RCC is a very rare renal tumor, and the definitive criterion for diagnosis is the detection of germline mutations in the FH gene. Early genetic testing and renal surveillance are of significant importance in high-risk family members. Moreover, FH-deficient RCC is highly malignant and metastasizes early. Therefore, fully understanding the disease, enabling detection and diagnosis and providing treatment are particularly important.\n\n【36】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】PubMed was used as a source of information, using the search terms fumarate hydratase AND deficient AND renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】FH:\n\n【40】Fumarate hydratase\n\n【41】RCC:\n\n【42】Renal cell carcinoma\n\n【43】HLRCC:\n\n【44】Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma\n\n【45】HIF:\n\n【46】Hypoxia inducible factor\n\n【47】CLM:\n\n【48】Cutaneous leiomyoma\n\n【49】CT:\n\n【50】Computed tomography\n\n【51】FDG:\n\n【52】Fluorodeoxyglucose\n\n【53】PET:\n\n【54】Positron emission tomography\n\n【55】HE:\n\n【56】Hematoxylin/eosin\n\n【57】IHC:\n\n【58】Immunohistochemistry", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis and management of patients who have anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis may be challenging because of its relative infrequency, variability of clinical expression and changing nomenclature. The spectrum of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis is wide and can be fatal. This case documents a 62-year-old woman who presented with hydralazine-induced anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive renal vasculitis with a puzzling cutaneous rash.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a rare case of hydralazine-induced anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis in a 62-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with a vasculitic syndrome with a sore throat, mouth ulcers and otalgia after several months of constitutional symptoms. She then proceeded to develop a rash over her right lower limb. Clinically, the rash had features to suggest Sweet’s syndrome, but also had some appearances consistent with embolic phenomena and did not have the appearance of palpable purpure usually associated with cutaneous vasculitis. Differential diagnoses were hydralazine-associated Sweet’s syndrome, streptococcal-induced cutaneous eruption or an unrelated contact dermatitis. A midstream urine sample detected glomerular blood cells in the setting of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive renal vasculitis and _Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacteremia. A renal biopsy revealed a pauci-immune, focally necrotizing glomerulonephritis with small crescents. Her skin biopsy revealed a heavy neutrophil infiltrate involving the full thickness of the dermis with no evidence of a leucocytoclastic vasculitis, but was non-specific. She was initially commenced on intravenous lincomycin for her bloodstream infection and subsequently commenced on immunosuppression after cessation of hydralazine. The patient was subsequently discharged from hospital after a rapid clinical improvement.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Hydralazine-induced anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive renal vasculitis is a rare adverse effect and can present with a severe vasculitic syndrome with multiple organ involvement. Features of this association include the presence of high titres of anti-myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody with multi-antigenicity, positive anti-histone antibodies and the lack of immunoglobulin and complement deposition histopathogically. A rash that is characteristic of Sweet’s syndrome has also been described as an association. Prompt cessation of hydralazine may be sufficient to reverse disease activity but immunosuppression may be needed for definite treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Hydralazine is a vasodilator that is often used as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of hypertension. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis has been associated with many drugs such as allopurinol, sulfasalazine and propylthiouracil and is a relatively rare side effect of hydralazine. The etiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is not always clear and this association is less well recognized compared to drug-induced lupus which is well documented in the literature\\[ 1 \\]. The diagnosis and management of patients may be challenging because of its relative infrequency, variability of clinical expression and changing nomenclature. The spectrum of AAV can range from cutaneous rashes and petechiae or single organ involvement to fatal multi-organ involvement with deaths commonly from massive pulmonary hemorrhage. A latency of several years can occur before the development of vasculitis with a variable delay in the full clinical manifestations\\[ 2 \\] therefore posing a challenge for clinicians to achieve clear diagnoses and treatment strategies. This case documents a 65-year-old woman who presented with a diagnostic dilemma after developing a lower limb rash and a sore throat with _Streptococcus pyogenes_ bacteremia and highlights the need for early recognition to enable timely cessation of the offending drug or drugs and commencement of appropriate therapy.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 62-year-old Caucasian woman of Anglo-Saxon background with resistant hypertension developed a sore throat, mouth ulcers and otalgia after several months of constitutional symptoms consisting of lethargy, night sweats and significant weight loss. She then proceeded to develop a rash over her right lower limb. Her past medical history consisted of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, rheumatic heart disease, hyperlipidemia and recurrent deep venous thromboses due to the factor V Leiden mutation for which she was on lifelong warfarin. Other medications taken regularly consisted of: hydralazine 100mg in the morning, 50mg at night which she had taken for three years; perindopril 10mg daily; metoprolol 50mg twice daily; clonidine 50mg twice daily; thyroxine 50mcg and 25mcg on alternate days; and rosuvastatin 5mg at night. An examination revealed hypertension (blood pressure 160/70mmHg), a pansystolic murmur, an aphthous ulcer at the base of her tongue and a rash over her right ankle and foot (Figure 1 ). Baseline blood tests revealed a leucocytosis of 19.2×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with a neutrophilia of 16.85×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 123mm/hour. Blood cultures taken on admission yielded _S. pyogenes_ and she was immediately treated with intravenous lincomycin because of a previous penicillin allergy. A transesophageal echo was carried out which excluded infectious endocarditis. Blood tests revealed impaired kidney function, a serum creatinine concentration of 102μmol/L, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 48mL/min/1.73m <sup>2 </sup> which is at her baseline renal function. Her urine revealed microscopic hematuria with 360×106/L red blood cells without any urinary tract infection and she only had mild proteinuria of 460mg/L, and a protein:creatinine ratio of 48g/mol. Further investigations revealed an anti-nuclear antibody >2560, double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) antibody elevated at 14 (<7), perinuclear (P)-ANCA >2560 and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody >100μ/mL with positive anti-histone antibodies. Because of glomerular blood cells in a repeat midstream urine sample taken on day 17 after presentation, acute kidney injury with a serum creatinine of now 195μmol/L, eGFR 23mL/min/1.73m <sup>2 </sup> , worsening proteinuria (810mg/L), normal serum complement levels and high titres of vasculitic markers, a drug-associated ANCA vasculitis was suspected. However, due to the temporal relation of two weeks between a streptococcal bloodstream infection and the development of an acute nephritic syndrome, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis was also considered. The associated skin rash (Figures 1 and 2 ) did not have a clear role in her presentation but was initially thought to be early Sweet’s syndrome associated with a drug-associated vasculitis. Hydralazine was withdrawn and the patient underwent a transjugular renal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis (Figure 3 ). The patient was commenced on treatment consisting of three intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone followed by high dose prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil 1g twice daily. Her urine immediately became clear and her skin rash resolved quickly when the mycophenolate mofetil was started and her renal function improved, suggesting that the cause of the rash was immunological in etiology. Serum creatinine concentration on discharge (day 35) was 144μmol/L. The patient attended an out-patient follow-up clinic a fortnight and then a month later to commence prednisone tapering as per the European Vasculitis Study Group protocol and to continue her mycophenolate mofetil for six months. A repeat serum creatinine concentration was 96μmol/L and anti-MPO was 16u/mL.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Photograph of the right ankle and foot showing an erythematous papular rash with ulcerations on presentation.**\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Photomicrograph of the skin biopsy with a hematoxylin and eosin stain ×100 showing a heavy neutrophil infiltrate involving the full thickness of the dermis with no evidence of a leucocytoclastic vasculitis.**\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Figure 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**Photomicrograph of the renal biopsy with a hematoxylin and eosin stain ×400 magnification showing a pauci-immune, focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with one small crescent consistent with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.** Red cell casts are present.

Immunofluorescence staining revealed mild mesangial deposition of immunoglobulin M and traces of mesangial C3.\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Hydralazine-induced ANCA vasculitis is rare and not the first diagnosis that came to mind with our patient who displayed a wide spectrum of disease of drug-induced AAV with severe renal and possible cutaneous manifestations requiring immunosuppression. The presence of high titres of P-ANCA and anti-MPO with multi-antigenicity, the positive anti-histone antibodies and the lack of immunoglobulin and complement deposition histopathogically are features that have been described with drug-induced ANCA vasculitis\\[ 2 , 3 \\] rather than with drug-induced lupus or with primary vasculitis. Therefore we strongly suspect this to be an adverse effect of hydralazine. The histology for the cutaneous rash was not classical for Sweet’s syndrome which would involve a denser neutrophilic infiltration in the dermis; however, the cutaneous rash did have some similarities with this syndrome: a neutrophilic infiltration on histology, a neutrophilia on presentation, fever and a tender papular skin rash. This rash was also in the setting of a _S. pyogenes_ bacteremia which could have resulted in the skin rash. The differential diagnoses for the cutaneous rash were hydralazine associated with early Sweet’s syndrome as described with carbamazepine in the literature\\[ 4 \\], cutaneous vasculitis\\[ 5 \\], erythroderma, streptococcal-induced cutaneous eruption from hematogenous spread, or an unrelated cause such as a contact dermatitis or early cellulitis.\n\n【26】Risk factors that have been identified predisposing to hydralazine-related AAV include a cumulative dose of more than 100g, female sex, and history of thyroid disease\\[ 6 \\] as seen in our patient. Other risk factors include the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 genotype, slow hepatic acetylation and the null gene for C4\\[ 7 \\]. The mechanism or mechanisms for hydralazine-induced AAV is not fully understood but might be multifactorial. Hypotheses of immune system activation by drug metabolites with autoimmunity towards neutrophil proteins (including elastase and lactoferrin) and upregulation of ANCA antigens have been suggested\\[ 5 \\].\n\n【27】A review of the literature revealed 68 patients with hydralazine-induced vasculitis\\[ 1 , 8 , 9 \\] and five cases with ANCA-positive hydralazine-associated immune complex-mediated renal vasculitis with cutaneous involvement. However, there were no cases of ANCA-positive hydralazine-associated renal vasculitis with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and a vasculitic cutaneous rash or Sweet’s syndrome (see Table 1 ). The hydralazine dosage ranged from 50 to 300mg per day, and the treatment duration varied from 0.73 to 120 months. Almost all the patients from the literature were positive for MPO antibodies and all of the patients with anti-histone antibodies checked had positive results. Our patient did not have clear cutaneous involvement with her presentation and the aforementioned renal–cutaneous association syndrome is yet to be published in the literature to date.\n\n【28】**Table 1 **Hydralazine-associated anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis****\n\n【29】Full size table\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】Hydralazine-induced ANCA-positive renal vasculitis is a rare adverse effect and can present with a severe vasculitic syndrome with multiple organ involvement. Early diagnosis and recognition of the clinical patterns of disease will be essential for prompt treatment. Timely cessation of hydralazine may be sufficient to reverse disease activity to prevent progression of disease towards end-stage renal failure\\[ 11 \\]. However, a short course of immunosuppressive therapy and monitoring of serum ANCA may be all that is required without the need for long-term maintenance. Caution should be displayed when using this drug and it may be prudent to refrain from prescribing it to patients with a past history of autoimmune disease and to regularly check for urinary glomerular blood cells.\n\n【32】Consent\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Cultures later grew _Clostridium perfringens_ and _Escherichia coli_ . Hemilaminectomy was done from T10 to T12, and an epidural abscess was removed. She went on to have fusion surgery 6 weeks after the initial operation and subsequently experienced complete pain relief. She was discharged 2 months later, at which time she was able to walk with a cane.

Gas gangrene is one of the most fulminant infectious diseases; it can cause myonecrosis, gas production, and sepsis. Progression of toxemia and shock is often very rapid. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement than with involvement of the extremities, which carries a better prognosis \\[ 2 \\]. Antibiotics alone are not effective because they do not penetrate ischemic muscles sufficiently \\[ 3 \\]. With respect to vertebral involvement, there are few reports in the literature \\[ 4 \\- 10 \\]. The purpose of this paper is to report a very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 78-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to our institution with a 1-week history of back pain and a 1-day history of paralysis of both legs. She had been bedridden for a week prior to admission in another hospital. There was no history of trauma. No gastrointestinal symptoms were present. Her temperature was 36.8°C, blood pressure was 100/70mmHg, and pulse was 103 beats per minute. On physical examination, her patellar tendon reflexes were present, but Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. All sensory modalities were absent below the inguinal level. Her leg muscles were completely paralyzed bilaterally. There was no anal wink. Anal tone was diminished, and there was no voluntary contraction of the external sphincter.\n\n【12】Admission laboratory values included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 18,800 per mm <sup>3 </sup> , her hemoglobin was 9.4g/dL, and her hematocrit was 30%. Her Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80mm/hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 30.02mg/dL. Initial radiographic examination of her lumbar spine at admission showed only spondylotic change. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed soft tissue swelling anterolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 and a gas-containing epidural abscess that compressed her spinal cord (Figure 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging showed involvement of the T11/12 disc space and adjacent vertebral body with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images with a gas-containing epidural abscess (Figure 2 ).\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Computed tomography sagittal and axial images on initial admission. ( **a** ) Soft tissue swelling anterolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 ( **b** ) and a gas-containing epidural abscess are seen.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Magnetic resonance imaging sagittal and axial images on initial admission. Involvement of the T11/12 disc space and adjacent vertebral body with decreased signal intensity on the T1-weighted images ( **a** and **c** ) and increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images ( **b** and **d** ) with a gas-containing epidural abscess are seen.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】The patient was urgently admitted to our hospital and taken to the operating room for decompression and disc debridement. Hemilaminectomy was done from T10 to T12, and the epidural abscess was removed, followed by T11/12 disc debridement. The epidural abscess was yellow and turbid. Cultures later grew _C. perfringens_ and _Escherichia coli_ . The wound was closed over subfascial drains.\n\n【22】On the second postoperative day, she was confused, and hydrothorax appeared. Thoracic drainage was then performed by a surgeon. Intravenous antibiotic treatment was begun with imipenem/cilastatin at 0.5g every 8 hours for 2 weeks, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for 2 weeks, and then ampicillin-sulbactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for 2 weeks.\n\n【23】Postoperatively, she experienced some sensory and motor return in her legs, but back pain and left chest pain in the sitting position continued. A CT scan 6 weeks after the operation showed T12 vertebral bone destruction (Figure 3 ); her WBC count and CRP were 8800 per mm <sup>3 </sup> and 0.26mg/dL, respectively. She went on to have fusion surgery with instrumentation and subsequently experienced complete relief of her pain. She was discharged 2 months later, at which time she was able to walk with a cane. Examination 18 months after surgery showed normal gait without a cane. Plain radiograph at 18 months after operation showed complete union between the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies (Figure 4 ).\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Computed tomography at 6 weeks after operation.

( **a** ) Anteroposterior radiograph, ( **b** ) Lateral radiograph.\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】Gas gangrene is divided into the following three types: posttraumatic, postoperative, and spontaneous \\[ 11 \\]. A literature review reported that the spontaneous type accounts for 16% of cases \\[ 11 \\]. Spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis is caused by _C. perfringens_ and _Clostridium septicum_ in 60% and 30% of cases, respectively \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Clostridial species are commonly found in soil, dust, water, and the intestines of humans and various animals \\[ 2 , 14 , 15 \\]. Without treatment, there is a 100% mortality rate within 24 hours of onset of systemic symptoms \\[ 14 \\]. If properly treated, the overall mortality rate is 20 to 30% \\[ 2 , 3 , 16 \\]. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement (50%) than with involvement of the extremities (24%), which carries a better prognosis \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【34】With respect to vertebral involvement, favorable outcomes after discitis caused by _C. perfringens_ are obtained if the infection occurs only within the disc \\[ 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 \\]. However, with surgical site infection (SSI) after lumbar spine surgery, one patient died, and one needed multiple operations \\[ 4 , 7 \\]. The differences in outcomes may be related to the amount of ischemic tissue. Although the disc itself has a small amount of ischemic tissue and a favorable outcome, the amount of ischemic tissue with SSI is larger and is associated with a terrible outcome. The present case with discitis and an epidural abscess survived because the amount of ischemic tissue was small, and emergency debridement and antibiotic therapy were effective.\n\n【35】Fusion surgery is needed if instability remains \\[ 17 \\]. Stabilization with instrumentation is a safe and effective treatment for pyogenic osteomyelitis \\[ 18 \\- 21 \\]. In this case, even after her CRP level decreased, the patient could not sit because of her left lateral chest pain. On CT, vertebral bone destruction had appeared, and instability was considered the main reason for her lateral chest pain. We managed this patient with posterior fixation with instrumentation. She was treated successfully, and she was ambulatory and showed complete bone union on X-ray at 18-month follow-up.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】A very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene that was successfully treated by immediate debridement and subsequent fusion surgery combined with antibiotics was described.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The condition is self-limiting, yet commonly misdiagnosed. Here we report a case of a patient with severe neck pain and odynophagia initially misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess before establishing the correct diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Caucasian man presented to an outside emergency department with a 5-day history of neck pain and odynophagia. The neck pain was severe and aggravated by movement. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Computed tomography of his neck soft tissues was initially interpreted as a retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary care center for further evaluation and treatment. On physical examination, the patient’s neck range of motion was significantly diminished, and bilateral neck tenderness was present. An otolaryngologist performed an examination with laryngoscopy, the result of which was unremarkable. A radiologist at our facility interpreted his outside magnetic resonance imaging as showing “calcification in the prevertebral muscles at C1-C2, inflammation with edema of the prevertebral muscles, and retropharyngeal space edema/effusion,” consistent with acute calcific longus colli tendinitis. His antibiotics were discontinued, and he was started on intravenous ketorolac. He had significant improvement in his neck range of motion, and his pain diminished greatly. He was discharged on a 10-day course of diclofenac (50 mg three times daily). At 1-week follow-up, the patient was doing well; he had returned to work, and his pain was well controlled.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case report details the presentation, characteristic radiographic findings, and management of a patient with an extremely rare condition of neck pain and odynophagia that could be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is a noninfectious inflammatory process secondary to the “deposition of amorphous calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the tendons of the longus colli muscle,” most commonly anterior to the C1–C2 vertebral level \\[ 1 \\]. Symptoms commonly include neck pain, limited cervical range of motion with neck stiffness, and odynophagia. The condition is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.50 cases per 100,000 person-years \\[ 2 \\]. Due to its rarity, acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is often misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess, herniation, neck tumor, or associated with trauma \\[ 3 \\]. Here, we report a case of severe neck pain and odynophagia initially misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess at an outside hospital before the correct diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis was established.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 60-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tobacco use, solitary pulmonary nodule, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department as a transfer from an outside facility for further evaluation of neck pain concerning for retropharyngeal abscess based on imaging and clinical presentation. He presented with a 5-day history of sudden-onset neck and postauricular pain that occurred at rest. The pain was constant and was rated 9 on a 10-point numeric pain scale (0 = no pain; 10 = most severe possible pain). His pain intensity was amplified by neck movement. He also endorsed a 4-day history of sore throat and odynophagia associated with a change in voice quality. Two days prior to his presentation, he was evaluated at his local primary care clinic and was diagnosed with “right neck strain and spasm with probable cervical radiculopathy” and suspected bacterial pharyngitis. He was treated with rest, ice, ibuprofen, and cyclobenzaprine. For the suspected bacterial pharyngitis, he was prescribed a 10-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.\n\n【12】The following day, he presented to an outside emergency department due to progression of symptoms. Laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis of 13,000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> and elevated C-reactive protein of 44.3 mg/L. The results of his basic metabolic panel (including sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels) and lactate measurement were normal. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ culture, and rapid group A _Streptococcus_ test results were all negative. Blood cultures were drawn. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed no acute intracranial findings. CT of the neck soft tissue was initially interpreted as showing a 1.1 × 5.6–cm retropharyngeal abscess with enlarged palatine tonsils, and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) initially confirmed a 1 × 7.1 × 3.2–cm prevertebral abscess. He was started on piperacillin/tazobactam and was administered 6 mg of morphine intravenously, followed 2 hours later by 100 μg of fentanyl intravenously. This reduced his pain from 9/10 to a 5/10. The patient was transferred to our tertiary referral center for formal otolaryngology evaluation and possible surgical intervention.\n\n【13】Following transfer to our facility’s emergency department, laryngoscopy was performed by an otolaryngologist, and the findings were unremarkable. The otolaryngologist reviewed the imaging and felt that the retropharyngeal fluid collection was unlikely to be infectious, owing to the lack of rim enhancement. The diagnostic images were also reviewed by members of the spine surgery service, who felt the findings were not consistent with an epidural abscess or infection involving the spine. However, given the lack of diagnostic clarity, intravenous antibiotics were continued, and the patient was admitted to the general medical service.\n\n【14】On admission, the patient’s physical examination was notable for significantly diminished range of motion of his neck in all directions, and there was tenderness to palpation of his neck laterally. Oropharyngeal examination was difficult secondary to body habitus (Mallampati class IV); however, no abnormalities were detected.\n\n【15】His outside images (Figs. 1 and 2 ) were reviewed by the radiology team at our facility. They stated that CT of the patient’s neck soft tissue exhibited a “retropharyngeal effusion, less likely abscess given \\[the\\] lack of \\[a\\] thick wall or rim enhancement.” The patient’s MRI scan was reviewed as exhibiting “acute calcific longus colli tendinitis with 1 cm calcification in the prevertebral muscles at C1-C2, inflammation with edema of the prevertebral muscles, and retropharyngeal space edema/effusion.”\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】CT of soft tissues of the neck shows a hyperdensity from calcium deposition in the longus colli muscle at the level of C2 (blue arrow)\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】MRI T2 Fat Saturated sequence of cervical spine shows high-signal intensity in the soft tissues representing inflammatory edema of the prevertebral muscles and elongated retropharyngeal effusion (blue rectangle)\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Following diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis, the medical team discontinued antibiotics and dexamethasone and started the patient on intravenous ketorolac while he remained an inpatient. After starting the ketorolac, he had significant improvement in neck range of motion in all directions, and his pain diminished greatly. He was discharged on a 10-day course of oral diclofenac 50 mg three times daily. His blood culture results remained negative after 5 days of inoculation.\n\n【25】At one-week follow-up, he was able to return to work, and minimal neck stiffness was reported. His pain was adequately controlled with the oral diclofenac.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is a rare, noninfectious inflammatory condition that involves deposition of calcium crystals in the longus colli \\[ 1 \\]. The mechanism of calcium deposition is largely unknown; however, it may be secondary to repetitive trauma, recent injury, tissue necrosis, or ischemia \\[ 4 \\]. Patients with acute calcific longus colli tendinitis typically have severe neck pain with limited neck range of motion that is accompanied by odynophagia and headache. In a recent case series published in 2017, the majority (62.5%) of patients were males in their fifth decade of life \\[ 5 \\]. However, in a separate case analysis of ten patients, only three were male \\[ 6 \\]. The age range was 26–68 years, with a mean age of 46.6 years \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【28】CT findings of calcium deposition in the longus colli muscle with retropharyngeal edema are sufficient to diagnose acute calcific longus colli tendinitis \\[ 7 \\]. MRI examination can also make the diagnosis with findings of calcium deposition, edema, and nonenhancing retropharyngeal effusion \\[ 7 \\]. The diagnosis is usually made by CT of the neck soft tissue, which is ordered with the clinical presumption of pharyngitis to rule out abscess \\[ 8 \\]. In the setting of retropharyngeal abscess, the fluid will rim enhance and be rounded in shape. In noninfectious retropharyngeal effusion, the fluid will not enhance and will be elongated. In the setting of infectious spondylodiscitis/osteomyelitis, the disc will enhance, the vertebral body endplates will have erosions, and there may be an epidural abscess. Early diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis and distinction from these other pathologies may prevent unnecessary antibiotic administration and surgery.\n\n【29】This case report presents the radiographic findings associated with the condition in order for physicians to be more comfortable in establishing its diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are thought to be effective in treating acute calcific longus colli tendinitis; however, there are no formal treatment guidelines \\[ 9 \\]. Acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is a self-limiting condition that will resolve in 1–2 weeks and does not require follow-up imaging after initial diagnosis \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】This case report details the presentation, radiographic findings, and management of a patient with an extremely rare condition of neck pain and odynophagia. Despite the lack of formal treatment guidelines for this condition, NSAIDs are known to help decrease the inflammatory process seen in acute calcific longus colli tendinitis.\n\n【32】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Not applicable.\n\n【34】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【35】CT:\n\n【36】Computed tomography\n\n【37】MRI:\n\n【38】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【39】NSAID:\n\n【40】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "36a8f561-29b1-4e81-8860-a4a31b103684", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Purpose\n\n【2】We present the case of a patient with cerebellar ataxia who was treated with walking practice using a split-belt treadmill with disturbance stimulation. The treatment effects were evaluated for improvements in standing postural balance and walking ability.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The patient was a 60-year-old Japanese male who developed ataxia after cerebellar hemorrhage. Assessment was performed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, Berg Balance Scale, and Timed Up-and-Go tests. A 10 m walking speed and walking rate were also assessed longitudinally. The obtained values were fit into a linear equation ( _y_ \\= _ax_ \\+ _b_ ), and the slope was calculated. This slope was then used as the predicted value for each period relative to the pre-intervention value. After removing the trend of the value for each period relative to the pre-intervention value, the amount of pre- to post-intervention change for each period was calculated to verify the intervention effect. Furthermore, to verify the changes in gait over time, a three-dimensional motion analyzer was used to analyze the pre- and post-intervention gait five times, and the results were kinematically compared.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】No significant pre- to post-intervention changes were observed in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia scores. Conversely, the Berg Balance Scale score, walking rate, and 10 m walking speed increased, and the Timed Up-and-Go score decreased in the B1 period, indicating a marked improvement from the predicted results based on the linear equation. For changes in gait determined using three-dimensional motion analysis, an increase in stride length was observed in each period.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The present case findings suggest that walking practice with disturbance stimulation using a split-belt treadmill does not improve inter-limb coordination, but contributes to improving standing posture balance, 10 m walking speed, and walking rate.\n\n【9】Peer Review reports\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】Smooth and stable walking is achieved by coordinated control of multiple limbs and numerous muscle activities. The coordinated movements of both lower limbs that enable walking are output via the central pattern generator (CPG), a neural circuit that generates the gait rhythm in the spinal cord. However, controlling only the CPG when the external environment changes, such as uneven terrain or slopes, is difficult. The cerebellum plays a role in regulating locomotion while adapting to the environment, thus enabling humans to adapt to a variable environment and continue walking. This adaptation requires immediate postural responses to changes in the external environment, internal somatosensory perceptions, and anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) functions that precede the target movement.\n\n【12】The cerebellum plays an important role in postural control and motor coordination in response to error signals based on changes in the external environment. When the cerebellum is damaged, it is difficult to respond to disturbances based on environmental variables \\[ 1 \\], thereby impairing predictive postural control \\[ 2 \\], resulting in decreased standing postural balance and difficulty in stable walking \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【13】The tied-belt treadmill intervention, with equal left and right belt speeds, has been developed to improve gait disturbance in patients with cerebellar injury \\[ 4 , 5 \\]. In particular, interventions such as stepping targets for visual obstacle avoidance, and projecting obstacles on a treadmill belt, have shown improvements in obstacle avoidance ability, and dynamic stability during obstacle avoidance. However, the effect of these interventions on improvements in standing postural balance and basic walking ability remain unclear.\n\n【14】Recently, a split-belt treadmill has been developed, which can change the environment and is expected to artificially create walking adaptation in humans. The split-belt treadmill, which allows independent modulation of the left and right belt velocities, is used clinically as a means of improving gait in stroke patients. In addition, it has shown to improve gait asymmetry in patients with hemiplegic stroke \\[ 6 \\]. Asymmetrical movements of the left and right limbs become apparent in many patients with hemiplegic stroke. In particular, temporal asymmetry has been found to be strongly related to walking speed, affecting walking propulsion and walking efficiency \\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\].\n\n【15】Alternately, the split-belt treadmill can generate an error (perturbation) by changing the speed of the left and right belts. To adapt to the error, two processes are required: reactive adjustment, which is an immediate response, and predictive adjustment, which predicts and adapts to the subsequent error. It has been confirmed that the split-belt treadmill increases error signals, and increases the frequency of excitation of cerebellar Purkinje cells, while walking in an artificially altered environment \\[ 11 \\]. In addition, a study using a split-belt treadmill in patients with cerebellar injury showed that reactive adjustment was possible \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 \\]. Therefore, we hypothesized that walking practice using a split-belt treadmill, which can generate errors using disturbance stimuli, would contribute to the improvement of standing posture balance and walking ability. Thus, in this case study, a patient with ataxia after cerebellar injury underwent gait training using a split-belt treadmill, and the effectiveness of the training was examined using the ABAB design method. The novelty of this case study is the longitudinal evaluation of the effects of walking exercise using split treadmill training on a patient with ataxia.\n\n【16】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【17】### Case\n\n【18】A 65-year-old Japanese man was receiving rehabilitation medicine such as physiotherapy for ataxia of the right upper and lower limbs and trunk due to cerebellar hemorrhage in the right hemisphere. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.\n\n【19】### Course\n\n【20】The patient was diagnosed with hypertensive cerebellar hemorrhage (Fig. 1 ) by a medical doctor in May 2019 using computerized tomography (CT) imaging, and underwent endoscopic hematoma removal on the day of onset. Diagnostic considerations were reviewed and agreed upon with the patient and his family before deciding whether or not to proceed with the examination. The main symptom was ataxia of the right upper and lower limbs and trunk. Acute physical therapy was started the next day, the patient was transferred to the recovery ward on the 34th day after surgery, and intervention with a split-belt treadmill was started on the 103rd day.\n\n【21】**Fig. 1**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】CT image of the head at onset. Hemorrhage in the right cerebellar peduncle and hemisphere (hemorrhage volume 37 mL). _CT_ computed tomography\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Prior to the intervention, objective assessment revealed that the Ueda 12-step hemiplegia function test was V-3 for the right lower extremity, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) total score was 21.5, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) total score was 25 points, Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG) was 25 seconds, 10 m comfortable walking speed was 1.1 km per hour, and walking rate (steps per minute) was 106. For walking ability, walking with a walker required light to moderate assistance, while walking alone required constant trunk support and heavy assistance from a physical therapist. In addition, we examined eye movements using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) sub-item “evaluation of abnormal eye movements” \\[ 15 \\]. The results showed that gaze-induced nystagmus was scored at 2 points; abnormal gaze movement, 1 point; and measurement disorder in eye movement, 2 points, indicating clear eye movement disorder. The Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) was 20 points on admission and 28 points on discharge. There was no medical history and no falls during hospitalization.\n\n【26】Intervention\n------------\n\n【27】Split-belt treadmill gait practice was conducted using a synchronous/asynchronous low-floor dual treadmill DLF-55 (Otake Root Factory, Morioka, Japan) (Fig. 2 A). The belt speed in each period was the average of two measurements of the 10 m comfortable walking speed on level ground during each intervention period. The tied-belt treadmill intervention (A1 and A2) was conducted at 100% of the comfortable walking speed on level ground, and the split-belt treadmill intervention (B1 and B2) was conducted by increasing or decreasing the belt speed, within the speed range of 50–150% of the comfortable walking speed on level ground, and by providing disturbance stimuli that unexpectedly disturbed the posture. Exercises were conducted for a total of 30 minutes, with three sets of 5 minutes each, and a rest period between each set to recover from subjective fatigue. The disturbance stimulus of the split-belt treadmill was provided within a set speed range using an operating personal computer. Intervention involved randomly modulating belt velocity on the non-paralyzed side from the start until 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and then the belt velocity on the paralyzed side was randomly modulated for a subsequent 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Simultaneously, the opposite side without disturbance stimulus was set at 100% of the comfortable walking speed on level ground (constant speed). Duration of the disturbance stimulus was set to between 2 and 10 seconds, and this duration varied with each new stimulus (Fig. 2 B). Intervention period for the tide-belt treadmill intervention and the split-belt treadmill intervention was 2 weeks each, and the interventions were conducted twice alternately for a total of 8 weeks. The amount of assistance was maintained at a minimum to prevent falling. In addition, muscle strengthening exercises for the trunk and lower limbs were performed as exercise therapy for 50 minutes a day, with appropriate breaks, as well as assisted walking exercises on level ground wearing a fall prevention belt in a room with a road surface.\n\n【28】**Fig. 2**\n\n【29】Intervention environment and methods. **a** Synchronous and asynchronous low-floor dual treadmill. The height and width of the handrails can be adjusted to appropriate positions, and the speed can be adjusted from 0.1 km at low-speed drive using an operating PC. The disturbance stimulus of the split-belt treadmill intervention modulates the belt speed on one side during walking and provides an unexpectedly disturbing stimulus to the posture. **b** Practice settings for tied-belt treadmill intervention and split-belt treadmill intervention. No disturbance stimuli were provided in the tied-belt treadmill intervention. In the split-belt treadmill intervention, the disturbance stimulus was given to one side at a speed within the range of 50–150% of the flatland walking speed. Upper extremity function training involved task-oriented exercises that combined joint movements such as shoulder flexion, elbow extension, and forearm rotation\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Measurements\n------------\n\n【32】The following items were measured a total of five times: once at the start of the intervention and four times at the end of each 2 week period during the 8 week study duration. SARA was used to assess ataxia. BBS, TUG, walking rate, and 10 m comfortable walking speed were used to assess standing postural balance and walking ability. For TUG, a 40-cm-high chair was used and the starting posture was sitting in the chair, leaning lightly on the backrest, with hands on the thighs. The patient was asked to rise from the chair at a signal, walk around a target 3 m away at the maximum walking speed, and sit on the chair again. The time required to walk around the target was measured.\n\n【33】In the 10 m walking test, the time required to walk at a comfortable walking speed along a 10 m walking path was measured. Measurements were recorded twice, and the average value was calculated as the walking speed. The values of BBS, TUG, walking rate, and 10 m comfortable walking speed, which were calculated before the intervention and at the end of each period, were fit to a linear function equation of _y_ \\= _ax_ \\+ _b_ , and the slope was calculated. This slope is shown as the predicted value for each measurement item; from this predicted value, we first removed the trend of each period’s value relative to the pre-intervention value. From the trend-eliminated values, the amount of change before and after the intervention for each period was further calculated, and the value was shown as the effect of the intervention for each period.\n\n【34】For the three-dimensional motion measurement, reflective markers were attached to the patient’s body at a total of 12 locations: the center of the acromion on both sides, the iliac crest, the one-third position from the greater trochanter on the straight line connecting the superior anterior iliac spine and the greater trochanter, the midpoint of the anterior–posterior diameter of the lateral femoral epicondyle, lateral malleolus, and the fifth metatarsal head. A three-dimensional motion analysis system, Kinema Tracer (Kissei Comtec Co., Ltd.), and four small Charge Coupled Device cameras were synchronized to record treadmill walking, with one handrail grasped, for 20 seconds at a sampling frequency of 60 Hz. The speed of the treadmill walking during the measurement was set by measuring the 10 m comfortable walking speed twice on level ground, and the average of the two speeds was calculated as the comfortable walking speed on level ground. These movement measurements were performed a total of five times: once at the start of the intervention, and four times at the end of each 2-week period of the intervention. The walking rate was calculated from the number of steps taken during 20 seconds of measurement.\n\n【35】A fall prevention belt was worn during the measurement, and the amount of assistance was minimized to the extent that the patient did not fall. The walking rate and time factors were calculated as the percentage of time spent in the stance phase, swing phase, and bipedal support phase, and the distance factors were calculated as stride length, step length, and stride distance.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】SARA and BBS scores are presented in Table 1 . In the subordinate items of SARA, the standing position improved from 5 points before the intervention, to 4 points in the A1 period, and 3 points in the B1 period. The sitting position improved from 2 points before the intervention to 1 point in the A1 period. No other changes were observed in gait, speech disturbance, or limb ataxia. In the B1 period, the BBS showed improvement in “transfer, closed-leg stance, forward reach of upper limbs, picking up objects from the floor, turning back over the right and left shoulders, 360° rotation, standing in the joint position, and one-legged stance.”\n\n【38】**Table 1 Changes in SARA and BBS sub-items over time**\n\n【39】Full size table\n\n【40】Measured values and predicted equations for the BBS, TUG, walking rate, and 10 m comfortable walking speed are shown in Fig. 3 . For the amount of change before and after each intervention period, the following items showed significant changes after trend removal: BBS increased to 5.3 from A1 to the end of B1, TUG decreased to −2.9 from A1 to the end of B1, walking rate increased to 5.8 from A1 to the end of B1, and 10 m comfortable walking speed increased to 0.11 km/hour from A1 to the end of B1. Alternately, no characteristic changes were found from pre-intervention to the end of A1, B2 to the end of A2, and A2 to end of B2.\n\n【41】**Fig. 3**\n\n【42】Measured values and prediction equations for walking rate, BBS, TUG, and 10 m comfortable walking speed. The dotted line graph shows the predicted values for each intervention period obtained by fitting the actual values for each intervention period into a linear function equation, and the line graph shows the actual values. Walking rate, BBS, and 10 m comfortable walking speed increased significantly from A1 to the end of B1 in each measurement item, and decreased in TUG. In addition, pre-intervention to the end of A1, B2 to the end of A2, and A2 to the end of B2 periods showed only a slight increase or decrease and no characteristic changes. _BBS_ Berg Balance Scale, _TUG_ Timed Get-Up and Go\n\n【43】Full size image\n\n【44】Results of the three-dimensional motion analysis are presented in Fig. 4 . In terms of the time factor of the gait cycle, the difference between the right and left sides of the two legs was larger in the B1 and B2 phases than in the A1 and A2 phases. For the distance factor, the stride length was shortened only in the B1 period and extended after A2 period. In terms of step length, only the right lower extremity showed extension over time from stage A1 onward, and the stride distance increased in stages B1 and A2.\n\n【45】**Fig. 4**\n\n【46】Results of changes in time and time factor proportions. In terms of the time factor of the gait cycle, the difference between the right and left sides of the B1 and B2 phases of the gait cycle was larger than the difference between that in the A1 and A2 phases of the bilateral leg support phase. In the distance factor, stride length was shortened only in the B1 period and extended in the A2 period and later. The step length of the right lower extremity increased over time only after the A1 period, and the stride distance increased in the B1 and A2 periods\n\n【47】Full size image\n\n【48】Regarding oculomotor disturbance, gaze-induced nystagmus on the ICARS showed improvement from 2 points to 1 point; however, the scores of abnormalities in pursuit eye movements, and measurement disturbance in eye movements, did not change; the oculomotor disturbance persisted.\n\n【49】In terms of walking ability, walking with a walker improved to light assistance, and walking alone improved to light or moderate assistance, where the physical therapist needed to support the trunk to prevent a fall. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 165. Indoor mobility was independent in a wheelchair, and walking with a walker required monitoring and light assistance. This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation, as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.\n\n【50】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【51】A patient with cerebellar ataxia was treated with treadmill walking with disturbance stimulation using a split-belt treadmill. The results based on the single-case design method showed improvements in the BBS, TUG, walking rate, and walking speed.\n\n【52】Based on the overall SARA score, the patient had moderate to mild ataxia. Previous studies have shown that moderate to mild cases can adapt to disturbances and that people with cerebellar injury have residual reactive coordination to disturbances \\[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 \\]. Therefore, it is considered that patients with moderate to mild ataxia can respond to disturbances; thus, the treatment was sufficiently adaptable in this case. In addition, the present results suggest that the split-belt treadmill intervention may improve reactive postural coordination and contribute to the improvement of postural balance and walking ability, even in the presence of residual impairments in anticipatory postural control and ataxia.\n\n【53】Another study confirms that walking with an artificially altered environment using a split-belt treadmill increased the error signal and frequency of excitation of cerebellar Purkinje cells \\[ 11 \\]. Postural responses are necessary to maintain body stability when disturbances are applied during exercise \\[ 17 \\]. While walking on a split-belt treadmill, reactive postural adjustment is required because of the addition of disturbances based on velocity changes. Therefore, we believe that the BBS scores increased, which contributed to the improvement of postural balance ability. Given the improvement in walking speed, we speculate that the improvement of postural balance using a split-belt treadmill combined with high-sped repetitions contributed to the increase in walking rate. In addition, TUG has been shown to correlate with walking speed, walking rate, and BBS \\[ 18 , 19 \\]; thus, we infer that the improvements in postural balance and walking ability were also related in our results.\n\n【54】The functional recovery curve of motor function in hemiplegic stroke patients generally shows a significant improvement within 3 months after the onset of stroke \\[ 20 \\], and is similar for patients with cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction \\[ 21 \\]. In this case, the intervention was performed more than 3 months after the onset of the disease, and significant improvements in balance and walking ability were observed in the B2 phase. Therefore, the confounding effect of spontaneous recovery was minimized.\n\n【55】Given the amount of change shown by the linear function equation and the results over time, the effects of the split-belt treadmill on postural balance and walking ability were not significant after the A2 period. Gait speed is strongly related to temporal asymmetry \\[ 8 \\]. In this case, the temporal asymmetry did not improve according to the time and distance factors by the three-dimensional motion analysis, and the inter-limb coordination disorder persisted as evaluated using the SARA. In other words, the degree of improvement in walking speed may have been affected by the left–right asymmetry in the gait cycle and residual inter-limb coordination disorder due to ataxia. Moreover, previous studies have shown that the walking rate of men aged 65–69 years is 112.8 steps per minute \\[ 22 \\]. In the present case, the walking speed was higher than the average walking speed of men of the same age at the end of the B1 period, so it is possible that the ceiling effect occurred at the end of the B1 period in this case only, and that the effect of the disturbance stimulus did not appear after that. In contrast, TUG includes motor elements of standing up from, or sitting down in, a chair and walking in a straight line towards a target object, and changing direction. Previous studies have shown that vision plays a role in gait, perceiving distant information, and fine-tuning gait in a predictive manner \\[ 23 \\]. Therefore, we infer that this case did not show any effect after the A2 period due to diplopia.\n\n【56】The lack of significant improvements in the BBS and SARA sub-items, such as climbing stairs, standing in the joint position, standing on one leg, and walking on one leg, can be attributed to the fact that this study focused on improving postural balance and walking ability only during walking. Thus, there may have been a discrepancy between the expected effects of the split-belt treadmill intervention and the present study, and it remains unclear whether split-belt treadmill gait is transferable to other sub-items of the BBS and SARA—there is scope for future studies to explore this further.\n\n【57】In terms of stride length, it was shortened in stage B1, and extended in stage A2 and later. This may be due to the control of increasing the number of rotations (pitch) of the lower limbs in the B1 period, and the change to greater mechanical control using the lower limbs after the A2 period. However, in terms of step length, only the right lower limb was prolonged after the A2 stage. The prolonged stance phase time on the left side may be due to the compensatory reliance on the left lower limb, which was non-ataxic, and to obtain forward propulsion, resulting in greater left–right asymmetry. As the patient also had diplopia and limb ataxia, we hypothesized that the enlargement of the gait interval was compensatory in order to ensure stability of the standing posture balance during walking.\n\n【58】This case study suggests that the clinical intervention of split-treadmill may contribute to the improvement of standing postural balance disorder in cerebellar disease. However, we were not able to examine predictive postural control (anticipatory postural adjustments, etc.) in gait, and we could not determine whether the split-belt treadmill could contribute more to improving either reactive or predictive adjustment, due to the occurrence of errors (perturbations). Furthermore, the effect of the split-belt treadmill may depend on the ability to perceive changes in the speed of the belt \\[ 24 , 25 \\]. Therefore, the effects may differ depending on the degree of sensory disturbance. The above is a limitation of this case report, and it needs to be examined with a larger population.\n\n【59】A patient with moderate to mild ataxia due to cerebellar injury was provided gait training using a split-belt treadmill, and its effects were evaluated. Post-intervention, standing postural balance and walking ability improved; however, there was no clear improvement in the inter-limb coordination disorder. These results suggest that gait training with a split-belt treadmill may contribute to the improvement of walking ability by improving postural balance in patients with residual ataxia.\n\n【60】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【61】All data used were obtained from the patient’s medical records in our hospital archives.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

An enhanced computed tomography scan showed a hypervascular mass 30 mm in diameter, but the origin of the tumor, either the duodenum or the head of the pancreas, was unclear. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed bulging accompanied by erosion and redness in part of the duodenal bulb. Mucosal biopsy was not diagnostic. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration was difficult to perform because a pulsating blood vessel was present in the region to be punctured. These findings led to a diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor invasion to the duodenum. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histologically, the tumor was made up of spindle-shaped cells immunohistochemically positive for c-Kit and CD34. The tumor was ultimately diagnosed as a duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Extraluminal duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare and mimic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration is useful for preoperative diagnosis, but it is not possible in some cases. Intraoperative diagnosis based on a completely resected specimen of the tumor may be useful for modifying the surgical technique.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (dGISTs) are extremely rare, and account for < 5% of all gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cases \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. A biopsy is considered essential for the diagnosis of GIST, but endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) may not be possible in some situations. dGISTs may develop extramurally, extensively, in a stem-like fashion, or may be embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma, complicating the distinction from duodenal or pancreatic primary hypervascularized enhancing tumors on computed tomography (CT) and the selection of the appropriate surgical technique. We present a case of pancreaticoduodenectomy for a dGIST that was difficult to differentiate from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET).\n\n【10】Case presentation\n\n【11】A 44-year-old Japanese woman had anemia identified by a medical examination in the workplace. Six months later, she was hospitalized with lightheadedness. Laboratory data revealed a hemoglobin level of 4.1 g/dL. She was admitted to our hospital after receiving a transfusion and ferrotherapy. Results of all other laboratory studies were within the normal range (Table 1 ). She had no pregnancies or children. Her father had died of pancreatic cancer. She had no significant past medical history and no smoking history, and she did not consume alcohol. On admission, her heart rate was 60 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, and her temperature was 37.1 °C. There were no other findings on physical and neurological examination. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 30-mm mass that was heterogeneously enhanced at the margins, and the origin of the tumor, either the duodenum or the head of the pancreas, was unclear (Fig. 1 a, b). Positron emission tomography (PET) showed a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 16.7 in the tumor (Fig. 2 a, b). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed bulging accompanied by erosion and redness in part of the duodenal bulb (Fig. 3 a). A mucosal biopsy was not diagnostic. EUS demonstrated a 40 × 35 mm <sup>2 </sup> mass with cystic and solid components in the head of the pancreas (Fig. 3 b). EUS-FNA was difficult to perform because a pulsating blood vessel was present in the region to be punctured (Fig. 3 c). These findings led to the diagnosis of pNET invasion to the duodenum. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Macroscopic findings were a 4.0 × 2.3 × 3.9 cm <sup>3 </sup> mass that occupied the first part of the duodenum, that broke down on the mucosal surface to form an ulcer, and that developed extrusive growth toward the pancreatic head (Fig. 4 ). Microscopic findings were that the tumor was made up of spindle-shaped cells, including nine mitotic figures per 50 high-power fields, immunohistochemically positive for c-Kit and CD34 (Fig. 5 ). The tumor was diagnosed as a high-risk dGIST on the basis of the Fletcher classification or modified Fletcher classification. The patient was treated with adjuvant imatinib, and she has not developed a recurrence over a 2-year period.\n\n【12】**Table 1 Laboratory da﻿ta**\n\n【13】Full size table\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**a** , **b** CT showing a 30-mm mass heterogeneously stained at the margins, with the border between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas unclear (Arrows)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】PET showing tumor SUVmax of 16.7\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**a** Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealing bulging accompanied by erosion and redness in part of the duodenal bulb. **b** EUS demonstrating a 40 × 35 mm <sup>2 </sup> mass with cystic and solid components in the head of the pancreas. **c** EUS fine-needle aspiration (FNA) considered, but was difficult to perform, because of a pulsating blood vessel present in the region to be punctured\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】 \n\n【28】Macroscopic findings included a 4.0 × 2.3 × 3.9 cm <sup>3 </sup> mass occupying the first part of the duodenum that broke down on the mucosal surface, forming an ulcer, and developing extrusive growth toward the pancreatic head\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】**Fig. 5**\n\n【31】 \n\n【32】Microscopic findings included the tumor being made up of spindle-shaped cells, including nine mitotic figures per 50 high-power fields, immunohistochemically positive for vimentin, C-kit, and DOG-1. The tumor was diagnosed as a high risk dGIST on the basis of the Fletcher classification or the modified Fletcher classification\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Discussion\n----------\n\n【35】In this case, a hypervascularized tumor in the pancreatic head region was discovered owing to anemia, but biopsy was difficult, and a pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection was performed on the basis of suspicion of pNET on CT. Postoperative pathological examination revealed a primary dGIST, and radical surgery with partial resection could be considered.\n\n【36】GISTs are relatively common mesenchymal tumors that occur predominantly in the stomach (60–70%) and small intestine (25–35%) \\[ 3 \\]. dGISTs are rare lesions, constituting 30% of primary duodenal tumors and less than 5% of all GISTs \\[ 4 \\]. On CT, dGISTs appear as heterogeneously enhanced hypervascularized masses \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. When extraluminal dGIST growth extends to the head of the pancreas, the tumor is difficult to differentiate from other well-vascularized tumors. pNETs appear as circumscribed solid masses that displace surrounding structures and are often hyperattenuating on arterial and venous phase images \\[ 7 \\]. Since dGISTs and pNETs may have similar features on imaging, these two lesions may be misdiagnosed. After searching the PubMed database with the search terms “duodenal GIST” and “pancreas tumor,” we found 13 cases of dGIST that were difficult to differentiate from pancreatic tumors preoperatively, including our case \\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 \\]. In four cases, EUS-FNA was performed, three of which were diagnosed as GIST \\[ 10 , 14 , 15 , 17 \\]. EUS-FNA is the only way to obtain a preoperative pathological diagnosis. Generally, the specificity of EUS-FNA is reported to be 100%, and the sensitivity is 84% \\[ 20 , 21 , 22 \\]. However, the rate of adverse events related to the EUS-FNA procedure is reportedly 0.98–3.4%, with events including acute pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, and duodenal perforation \\[ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 \\]. Among the previous reports, 6 of the 13 cases had symptoms associated with gastrointestinal bleeding \\[ 8 , 11 , 13 , 18 \\]. These included the cases for which EUS-FNA was not performed because of concerns about possible recurrent bleeding \\[ 8 \\], and surgery was performed immediately after blood transfusion \\[ 19 \\].\n\n【37】In our case, the tumor contained a pulsatile artery, and the risk of bleeding from EUS-FNA was high. Popivanov _et al._ \\[ 27 \\] reported 549 cases of resected dGIST, and their analysis revealed that in contrast to the other localizations, dGIST has upper gastrointestinal bleeding as the most frequent manifestation. In such cases, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed in an emergency setting due to life-threatening bleeding. For GISTs, R0 resection with 1–2 cm clear margins is a sufficient treatment, and lymph node dissection is not recommended owing to the low incidence of lymphatic metastases \\[ 28 \\]. On the other hand, surgical resection with regional lymph node dissection is the only curative treatment for pNETs \\[ 29 \\]. Thus, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis before surgery. There was one case report in which the diagnosis of dGIST was made from intraoperative frozen tissue \\[ 11 \\]. Although biopsy of the intraperitoneal cavity has a high risk of peritoneal dissemination and is contraindicated, intraoperative histology was assessed after complete tumor resection in this report. This method may be useful when a change in surgical technique is considered. Yanming _et al._ reported that the postoperative prognosis of dGIST is promising and is affected mainly by tumor factors, and the choice of surgical approach should depend on the anatomical location and tumor size \\[ 30 \\]. If a case shows detachment around the tumor, partial resection of the duodenum and intraoperative histological diagnosis is considered possible. In our case, the tumor was misdiagnosed as a pNET preoperatively, and the patient therefore underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection. Even if a dGIST had been diagnosed before surgery, because detachment of the boundary between the dGIST in the first portion of the duodenum and the pancreas head had a higher risk of pancreatic juice leakage and peritoneal dissemination, pancreaticoduodenectomy would have been considered appropriate. However, lymph node dissection would not have been necessary.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】Extraluminal dGISTs are rare and mimic pNETs. EUS-FNA is useful for preoperative diagnosis, but it is not applicable in some cases. When resecting a mass in the pancreatic head region, intraoperative diagnosis based on a completely resected specimen of the tumor may be useful for modifying the surgical technique, considering the possibility of dGIST.\n\n【40】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】Not applicable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Conservative measures may be considered in properly selected patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Ectopic pelvic kidneys occur with a reported incidence of between 1 in 500 to 1 in 1200. Although pelvic kidneys are associated with anomalies including hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux, most are clinically asymptomatic \\[ 1 \\]. Pelvic kidneys are, however, more prone to blunt trauma injury \\[ 2 \\]. Little literature exists regarding the optimal management of blunt trauma injury in ectopic pelvic kidneys. We report a case of a grade V renal injury to an ectopic pelvic kidney managed successfully with conservative measures.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 21 year-old African-American male presented to the emergency room with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain and gross hematuria following blunt trauma to the abdomen. The patient had been kneed in the right lower quadrant. The physical examination revealed a hemodynamically stable male in acute distress, with marked tenderness in the right lower quadrant. A foley catheter was placed with return of gross hematuria. Laboratory examination revealed a hemoglobin of 12 g/dL as well as a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrated a normally positioned left kidney, multiple deep lacerations to an ectopic pelvic kidney suggestive of a grade V injury, and a large retroperitoneal hematoma (Figure 1 ). Both kidneys appeared equal in size, measuring approximately 11 cm in length and 5 cm in width. The main arterial supply to the ectopic kidney appeared intact, with a right renal artery originating from the right common iliac artery (Figure 2 ).\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrating an ectopic pelvic kidney with multiple deep lacerations (indicated by arrows), and a large retroperitoneal hematoma displacing the kidney to the left lower abdomen** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showing an intact right renal artery originating from the right common iliac artery (indicated by an arrow)** .\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】In light of the patient's hemodynamic stability, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated conservatively with aggressive fluid resuscitation, serial hemoglobin levels, and bed rest. The patient experienced a prolonged hospital course secondary to hematuria, hospitalized for a total of nineteen days. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospitalization with a serum creatinine within normal limits, but required six total units of packed red blood cells for anemia with hemoglobins near 8 g/dL. The patient's hematuria resolved on hospital day sixteen, and the patient was then ambulated with no further hematuria or anemia noted.\n\n【21】Three months following the trauma, imaging revealed resolution of the retroperitoneal hematoma, return of the pelvic kidney to its anatomical position in the right pelvis, and perfusion defects in the lower pole, likely representing persistent renal injury (Figure 3 ). At follow-up, serum creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL.\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast demonstrating resolution of the retroperitoneal hematoma, return of the pelvic kidney to its anatomical position in the right pelvis, as well as persistent perfusion defects in the lower pole (indicated by an arrow)** .\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Kidney injuries occur in approximately 10% of blunt abdominal trauma cases. Abnormal kidneys, including ectopic kidneys, may be more predisposed to injury as they are often located in a less-protected anatomical position in the retroperitoneum. In a meta-analysis by Schmidlin _et al_ ., ectopic kidneys constituted 7% of cases involving abnormal kidneys. Abnormal kidneys in total represented 7% of all blunt renal trauma cases, and included such conditions as renal cysts, hydronephrosis, and renal tumors. Furthermore, it was found that trauma to abnormal kidneys, including ectopic kidneys, is more frequently caused by low velocity impacts and has a lower rate of associated trauma to other abdominal organs \\[ 2 \\].\n\n【28】High-grade renal injuries including grade IV and V injuries comprise the minority of renal trauma cases, with grade V injuries representing only 5% of blunt renal trauma cases. Grade IV injuries can be defined as deep parenchyma lacerations involving the collecting system, as well as vascular injuries to a segmental renal arterial branch. Grade V injuries can be defined as multiple deep lacerations into the renal parenchyma resulting in a shattered kidney, as well as devascularizing injuries to the renal pedicle, or avulsion of the main renal artery \\[ 3 \\]. In this case the patient presented with multiple deep lacerations to the parenchyma of the ectopic pelvic kidney consistent with a grade V injury.\n\n【29】While classically grade V renal injuries have been managed surgically, the conservative management of grade IV injuries in the setting of blunt trauma has been well established. In a meta-analysis of 16 published reports, 90% of 324 grade IV blunt renal injuries could be managed conservatively, with 12.6% requiring delayed surgical intervention and 4.6% requiring nephrectomy \\[ 4 \\]. Despite the traditional standard of operative intervention in grade V injuries, current literature suggests that many of these injuries may be managed conservatively, particularly in those who remain hemodynamically stable upon presentation. Altman _et al_ . reported a series of 13 patients with grade V renal injuries, of whom six were treated conservatively with fewer intensive care unit days (4.3 versus 9.0), significantly fewer transfusion units (2.7 versus 25.2), and fewer complications versus those undergoing operative management \\[ 5 \\]. Proponents of conservative measures in an effort to avoid a trauma nephrectomy note a lower creatinine clearance in the peri-injury period among those undergoing trauma nephrectomies versus those with no renal injury, as well as an increase in mortality (8% to 16%) and acute renal failure (7% versus 11%) \\[ 6 \\]. However, some attribute these differences to associated injuries and age, rather then renal removal itself.\n\n【30】Despite efforts to manage select high-grade blunt renal injuries nonoperatively, there are many clinical scenarios representing absolute indications for operative intervention. These include shock secondary to renal bleeding, expanding retroperitoneal hematoma, transfusion requirements exceeding 3 U/day of packed red blood cells associated with hemodynamic instability, renal pelvic or ureteral injury, and certain renovascular conditions such as renal artery stenosis. In addition, active extravasation of contrast-enhanced blood on CT may represent a subset of patients who may warrant operative intervention, as it likely represents brisk bleeding in a patient who may not yet be hemodynamically-stable \\[ 7 \\]. Jeffrey _et al_ . found that among 18 patients with active extravasation, 50% required open surgery, 28% angiography, and 22% bled to death or required multiple blood transfusions \\[ 8 \\]. Criticisms of conservative management for high-grade renal injuries have also focused on the delayed complications which may theoretically be avoided with nephrectomy or renorrhaphy. Chief among these is urinary extravasation, although most (74% to 87%) will resolve spontaneously with conservative measures. Additional potential complications include hypertension, whose incidence varies widely from 0.25% to 55%, as well as arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysm, both considered rare complications. Finally delayed bleeding must be considered, present in up to 20% of cases\\[ 7 \\].\n\n【31】Although ectopic kidneys are more susceptible to blunt trauma injuries, there is little current literature on the management of Grade V injuries to an ectopic kidney. Schmidlin _et al_ . report two cases of blunt renal trauma to a ectopic kidneys, of which one required operative intervention. This study did not, however, describe the extent of the injuries, nor the indication for surgical intervention in that individual case \\[ 2 \\]. Our patient represents an interesting case of an isolated Grade V renal injury who responded favorably to conservative measures.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】We present an interesting case of a grade V injury to an ectopic pelvic kidney, and suggest that management of these high-grade injuries to ectopic kidneys can be treated similarly to that of kidneys in a normal anatomic position. Specifically, these injuries can be managed successfully with nonoperative intervention in properly selected patients.\n\n【34】Consent\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The respiratory infection developed twice at intervals of two months in patient one, and nine times at almost monthly intervals in patient two. Thereafter, they were given _qing fei tang_ . After administration of _qing fei tang_ , the respiratory infection reoccurred only once; after 5.5 months for patient one, and six months for patient two. Both of our patients clearly showed a reduced incidence of respiratory infection.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Both of our patients clearly showed a reduced incidence of respiratory infection after the administration of _qing fei tang. Qing fei tang_ could be useful for the prevention of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia frequently occur in patients with Parkinson’s syndrome in their later stage, mainly by dysphagia. The prevention of relapsing aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia is unsatisfactory in Parkinson’s syndrome.\n\n【10】_Qing fei tang_ , which is a Chinese traditional medical mixture called _seihai-to_ in Japan, has been used for the treatment of productive cough, acute and chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pharyngitis, bronchial asthma, and pneumonia. A main component of _qing fei tang_ is powdered extract composed of the following 16 herbs: Angelicae Radix, Ophiopogonis Tuber, Hoelen, Scutellariae Radix, Platycodi Radix, Armeniacae Semen, Gardeniae Fructus, Mori Cortex, Zizyphi Fructus, Aurantii Nobilis Pericarpium, Caulis Bambusae in Taeniis, Asparagi Radix, Fritillariae Bulbus, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Schisandrae Fructus, and Zingiberis Siccatum Rhizoma \\[ 1 \\]. It is reported that _qing fei tang_ is effective for reducing the relapse rate of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in patients with stroke or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy \\[ 1 \\]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of Parkinson’s syndrome with recurrent aspiration pneumonia successfully treated by _qing fei tang_ .\n\n【11】In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia frequently occurs, and often is refractory. We considered whether _qing fei tang_ would be effective for the prevention of relapsing aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in PSP as well as stroke. If so, then _qing fei tang_ could be a new treatment for recurrent and refractory respiratory infection in PSP.\n\n【12】We present two cases of Japanese patients with PSP and relapsing aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia despite receiving total enteral feeding and conventional medication. We describe the successful treatment of their recurrent respiratory infections by _qing fei tang_ .\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】### Patient one\n\n【15】A 63-year-old Japanese man presented with speech difficulty, standing instability, drinking difficulty, and slow movement at first. At 12 months after his initial presentation, his neurological examination revealed cognitive decline, masked face, vertical oculomotor disturbance, dysarthria, bradykinesia, trunk-dominant muscular rigidity, and a tendency to fall. Magnetic resonance imaging of his head showed mild atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum. Probable PSP was diagnosed according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Society for PSP (NINDS-SPSP) diagnostic criteria \\[ 2 \\]. At 10 months after the diagnosis, he was confined to a wheelchair, and aspiration pneumonia occurred three times at monthly intervals. Although a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was performed immediately after his last pneumonia, pneumonia reoccurred twice at 18 and 20 months after his PEG regardless of treatment with clarithromycin and amantadine (Figure 1 ). A daily dose of 9g of _qing fei tang_ (Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan) was started, and aspiration pneumonia reoccurred only once, at 5.5 months after the start of treatment (Figure 1 ). The bacteria in his sputum were the same as before starting _qing fei tang_ ( _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA)), except for _Streptococcus agalactiae_ .\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**The clinical course of patient one.** The incidence of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, which are shown by black triangles was exhibited before and after administration of _qing fei tang_ at X month in patient one.\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】### Patient two\n\n【21】A 74-year-old Japanese man presented to us with a three-year history of difficulty in moving his upper limbs, a tendency to fall, and slow movements. His neurological examination revealed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, dysarthria, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflex. Magnetic resonance imaging of his head demonstrated severe atrophy of his midbrain tegmentum. These clinical manifestations led to a diagnosis of probable PSP according to NINDS-SPSP criteria \\[ 2 \\]. A PEG was performed in a bedridden condition because of progressive dysphagia 23 months after the diagnosis, but then aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia developed nine times during 10 months, at intervals of about one month, with medication including ambroxol, L-carbocysteine, clarithromycin, bromhexine, and amantadine (Figure 2 ). _Qing fei tang_ was given daily at a dose of 9g, and then aspiration pneumonia occurred only once, six months after starting the treatment (Figure 2 ). The types of bacteria in his sputum did not change compared with before starting _qing fei tang_ ( _P. aeruginosa_ , MRSA and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ ).\n\n【22】**Figure 2**\n\n【23】 \n\n【24】**The clinical course of patient two.** The incidence of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, which are shown by black triangles was shown before and after the administration of _qing fei tang_ at X month in patient two.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】We present two cases of Japanese patients with PSP who experienced recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia regardless of receipt of total enteral feeding and conventional therapy. Patient one experienced recurrence twice at intervals of two months and patient two experienced recurrence nine times at almost monthly intervals. The respiratory infection developed only once, at 5.5 months (patient one) and six months (patient two) after the administration of _qing fei tang_ .\n\n【28】After administration of _qing fei tang_ , the incidence of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia fell in both of our patients, and the interval until onset of respiratory infection was prolonged. No adverse effects induced by _qing fei tang_ were found in either of our patients.\n\n【29】Aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia is the leading cause of death in patients with Parkinson’s syndrome, including dementia with diffuse Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, PSP, and multiple system atrophy \\[ 3 \\]. Onset of dysphagia deteriorates the prognosis of Parkinson’s syndrome \\[ 3 \\], and may cause subsequent silent aspiration \\[ 4 \\]. Good control of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia is important to improve the prognosis in Parkinson’s syndrome. To date, conventional treatment including clarithromycin and amantadine has been unsatisfactory. Furthermore, total enteral feeding is not completely safe because aspiration pneumonia can develop due to silent aspiration, even if patients do not feed orally. In our patient one, although no aspiration pneumonia occurred after PEG for a while, afterwards respiratory infection reoccurred twice in a relatively short period. It has been reported that _qing fei tang_ was effective for relapsing aspiration pneumonia in seven patients with stroke treated with _qing fei tang_ including four patients without oral intake, compared with eight patients with stroke treated with conventional therapy including six patients without oral intake \\[ 1 \\]. Both of our patients were without oral intake, and we also found that _qing fei tang_ could reduce relapse of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia.\n\n【30】The preventive effects of _qing fei tang_ against aspiration pneumonia are considered to occur by a mechanism other than the improvement of dysphagia, because the swallowing reflex could not be improved by _qing fei tang_ \\[ 1 \\]. In a previous report, xanthine oxidase activity was elevated in the lung tissues of aspiration pneumonia-model mice, but the activation was markedly inhibited by _qing fei tang_ \\[ 5 \\]. Pretreatment with _qing fei tang_ is considered to reduce oxygen radicals produced by inflammation in the lungs, and to reduce the mortality rate of mice with aspiration pneumonia \\[ 5 \\]. In our two patients, while _qing fei tang_ could inhibit the respiratory infection effectively, the types of bacteria detected in their sputum were almost the same both before and after administration of _qing fei tang_ . The effects of _qing fei tang_ could not be explained by the change in the types of bacteria, but could partially be explained by the above-mentioned defense mechanism, namely, the reduction of oxygen radicals.\n\n【31】In our case series, it was a new finding that administration of _qing fei tang_ could lead to a reduction in the incidence of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, and prolong the interval until the onset of respiratory infection in PSP. _Qing fei tang_ may be a safe available option for preventive therapy of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia by a different mechanism from conventional medication. The reduction of respiratory infection may prolong the survival time in PSP. _Qing fei tang_ should be considered when aspiration pneumonia cannot be kept under control in patients with PSP using conventional therapy and total enteral feeding. Further large-scale, ideally mechanistic, studies may better clarify whether _qing fei tang_ can reduce the relapse rate of aspiration pneumonia in patients with PSP, compared to a control.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】We report two cases of patients with PSP and recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, the latter of which was successfully treated by _qing fei tang. Qing fei tang_ could prevent recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in patients with PSP, and may be an option for treatment in addition to conventional therapy.\n\n【34】Consent\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case series.

While the majority of injuries produce minimal symptoms, scotoma and permanent central vision loss have occurred in some patients. Retinal edema is typically discernable a few days after exposure, while prominent pigmentary changes of the fundus are not apparent prior to two to three weeks after exposure. The recent advent of high-definition ocular coherence computed tomography can help clinicians in analyzing the level and degree of retinal damage after photic damage induced by surgical microscope.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A healthy 76-year-old Caucasian man underwent phacoemulsification under retrobulbar anesthesia in his right eye with torn posterior capsule at the completion of cortex aspiration. Anterior vitrectomy was performed and a 5 × 6 mm intra-ocular lens was implanted in the sulcus. A coaxial illuminated microscope (OPMI CS-XY; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used for surgery that lasted 45 minutes. At six weeks postoperatively, his best corrected visual acuity was 0.5. His main complaint was a paracentral scotoma confirmed by perimetry (Figure 1 ). Fundoscopy revealed a well circumscribed flat yellowish retinal lesion, approximately double the disc diameter in size, inferotemporal to the fovea (Figure 2 ). The retinal lesion was prominent by autofluorescence (Figure 3 ) stained with fluorescein dye with speckled blockage of fluorescence (Figure 4 ). Spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed thinning of the retinal lesion with loss of the inner/outer photoreceptor layer and retinal pigment epithelium (Figure 5 ). At nine months after surgery, repeat OCT revealed cystoid macular edema induced by topical travoprost initiated over the past month to control ocular hypertension (Figure 6 ). There was persistent disruption of the inner/outer photoreceptor layer and retinal pigment epithelium.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Automated central 22 field testing of the right eye shows the right blind spot corresponding to the optic disc and the superotemporal paracentral scotoma** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】**The fundus photograph shows a well demarcated, elliptical, yellowish, mottled retinal pigment epithelium alteration approximately twice the size of the optic disk, and encroaching on the fovea** .\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Figure 3**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**Autofluorescence image of the posterior pole of the right eye shows a dendritiform pattern of autofluorescence at the inferotemporal macula (BluePeak Blue Laser Autofluorescence, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)** .\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Figure 4**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】**Fluorescein angiography shows an irregular fluorescein transmission pattern without leakage** .\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Figure 5**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】**At six weeks after surgery, a spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (OCT) scan (scan angle 45°, 0.25 mm spacing, 6 mm scan length) showed thinning of the juxta-foveal temporal retinal lesion with effacement of the photoreceptor layer, and retinal pigment epithelium layer (Cirrus, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany)** .\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】**Figure 6**\n\n【33】 \n\n【34】**At nine months after surgery, there is disruption of the photoreceptor layer and retinal pigment epithelium layer with intact Bruch's membrane, as seen on spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the temporal macula (Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)** .\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】Most mild phototoxic retinal injuries probably remain undiagnosed in routine postoperative examination \\[ 1 – 5 \\]. Retinal phototoxic lesions first appear a few days after exposure as well circumscribed outer retinal whitening with mild disturbances of the retinal pigment epithelium, often with a light border. After the first week, lesions are characterized by coarse alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium layer with fluorescein angiography demonstrating sharply demarcated characteristic early discrete mottled hyperfluorescence with late staining. Historically, these lesions are typically located inferior to the fovea as a result of the slight down gaze during extracapsular cataract surgery. The shape of the lesion often matches the shape of the illuminating source of the particular operating microscope used. Such lesions were noted in 3% of the most recent cataract surgery series \\[ 4 \\], even in phacoemulsification of short duration. While the majority of injuries produce minimal symptoms, scotoma and permanent central vision loss have occurred in some patients \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Risk factors for retinal photic injuries have included angle of light incidence, light intensity, exposure time, and intensity of the blue light component \\[ 1 – 5 \\]. It is recommended to use the minimal light intensity needed to perform surgery, use oblique light or filters or pupil shields. Implantation of an intra-ocular lens, including multi-focal lenses, is an important factor in the production of maculopathy \\[ 2 \\], on account of its light-focusing effect on the retina.\n\n【38】Acute histological changes in photic injuries have included localized necrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium, extensive disruption of the outer lamellae of the photoreceptors, and edema of the inner segments \\[ 1 \\]. Rodriguez-Marco _et al._ \\[ 5 \\] presented late OCT findings in a 39-year-old patient who underwent two consecutive pterygium surgeries lasting 1.5 hours. Visual acuity was 0.4 with metamorphopsia. The fundus exhibited a hypo-pigmented rounded lesion in the macular area with early hyperfluorescent foveal area on fluorescein angiography. OCT revealed a detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【40】We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of high-definition OCT findings in the healing stage (six weeks and nine months after surgery) of photic post-cataract retinopathy, showing atrophy of the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium layers.\n\n【41】Consent\n-------\n\n【42】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

She was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and blood transfusion. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed swelling in the first part of the duodenum, the initial appearance of which suggested that it was an abnormally placed or accessory papilla. There was a small, <3–mm opening on the lesion that resembled the biliary or pancreatic orifice.

Although the endoscopic diagnostic criteria for a Dieulafoy’s lesion have been described in great detail, there is a paucity of literature describing a Dieulafoy’s lesion or a similar lesion resembling the duodenal papilla.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Dieulafoy’s lesion (DL) is an uncommon but important cause of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Although the great majority of DLs are located in the stomach within 6cm of the gastroesophageal junction, DLs in other parts of the GI tract are rare. DLs rarely are the cause of small-bowel hemorrhage. They are rarely seen in teenagers. In this report, we describe a teenage patient with an unusual presentation of a bleeding duodenal Dieulafoy’s-like lesion that resembled the duodenal papilla.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 18-year-old Pakistani woman presented to our emergency department with hematemesis of 6 hours’ duration. She did not have any past medical history of GI bleeding, chronic liver disease, peptic ulcer disease or use of alcohol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was taking no medications prior to this presentation and denied use of any herbal or dietary supplements. Her family history was significant for hypertension in her father. Her family had no history of liver disease, colon cancer or any other GI malignancy. Her physical examination was significant for tachycardia and lethargy. Her pulse rate was 122 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 100/60mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and her body temperature was 37.6°C. She had no abdominal pain or any stigmata of chronic liver disease. A nasogastric aspirate was negative for blood. Her laboratory values were as follows: hemoglobin, 4g/dl (normal range, 12.3 to 15.3g/dl); mean corpuscular volume, 77.2 fl (normal range, 80.0 to 96.0 fl); white blood cell count, 9000/mm <sup>3 </sup> (normal range, 4.8 to 10.8×10 <sup>4 </sup> mm <sup>3 </sup> ); platelets, 238,000/μl (normal range, 145,000 to 445,000/μl); urea, 26mg/dl (normal range, 5 to 22mg/dl); creatinine, 0.8mg/dl (normal range, 0.6 to 1.3mg/dl); serum sodium, 136mmol/L (normal range, 134 to 142mmol/L); serum potassium, 3.2mmol/L (normal range, 3.5 to 5.0mmol/L); total bilirubin, 0.6mg/dl (normal range, 0.2 to 1.2mg/dl); aspartate transaminase, 32IU/L (normal range, 5 to 34IU/L); alanine transaminase, 40IU/L (normal range, 5 to 55 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase, 87IU/L (normal range, 42 to 140IU/L); international normalized ratio, 0.9 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1); and prothrombin time, 12.9 seconds (normal range, 11.8 to 14.3 seconds). She was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and 4U of packed red blood cells. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed swelling in the first part of the duodenum (Figure 1 ). The initial appearance of the swelling suggested that it was an abnormally placed or accessory papilla. There was a small, <3-mm opening on the lesion that resembled the biliary or pancreatic orifice. On gentle manipulation with a catheter, blood spurted from the swelling area, and a vessel was visible (Figures 2 and 3 ). Adrenaline was used for hemostasis. After hemostasis was achieved, it became clear that the lesion was most consistent with a Dieulafoy’s-like lesion and not a papilla. Band ligation was then performed (Figure 4 ), and the patient did not develop any complications and did not have any further episodes of bleeding. The patient was eventually discharged to home in stable condition.

DLs that resemble the papilla make endoscopic detection challenging, are uncommonly recognized in teenagers and are mostly commonly seen in patients between 50 and 70 years of age \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【31】The endoscopic criteria for diagnosing DLs include any one of the following three abnormalities: (1) active arterial spurting or micropulsatile streaming from a mucosal defect <3mm or through normal surrounding mucosa; (2) visualization of a protruding vessel with or without bleeding, within a minute mucosal defect or through normal surrounding mucosa; and/or (3) the appearance of a fresh, densely adherent clot with a narrow point of attachment to a minute mucosal defect \\[ 7 \\]. Our patient met two of the three criteria for diagnosing a DL endoscopically. Specifically, she had a mucosal defect <3mm in size with active bleeding surrounding normal mucosa (Figure 1 ). Additionally, a vessel was visualized once bleeding started (Figure 2 ). Differential diagnostic possibilities considered included hemosuccus pancreaticus or hemobilia, if the lesion was an abnormally placed papilla. However, the patient did not develop jaundice or pancreatitis after band ligation of the lesion, thus making these entities less likely. One other differential diagnostic consideration would be bleeding from a submucosal tumor. However, endoscopic manipulation demonstrated a soft lesion inconsistent with a GI stromal tumor or carcinoid tumor. A bleeding submucosal lipoma was a possibility, as lipomas are soft; however, the lesion lacked the characteristic yellow hue seen in lipomas. As such, the endoscopic findings were most consistent with a lesion similar to a DL. The lesion was thus identified as a Dieulafoy’s-like lesion. In our patient, the appearance of the lesion mimicked an accessory or abnormally placed papilla. When considering therapy for such lesions, it is important to ensure that the lesion is not the actual papilla, because accidental band ligation of the papilla can lead to complications such as acute pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice.\n\n【32】Present-day options for treatment of DL include endoscopic therapy in the form of endoscopic clipping or dual therapy of four-quadrant diluted epinephrine injection (1:10,000) with thermal coaptive coagulation \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【33】Although there is no consensus regarding treatment of DL, endoscopic treatment has evolved over the years as the first-line therapy for DL \\[ 8 \\]. Endoscopic treatment has been further classified into regional injections, mechanical therapy and thermal therapy \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【34】Regional injection therapy consists mainly of local epinephrine injections and sclerotherapy. Studies have shown that use of epinephrine alone in management of DLs has a higher incidence of rebleeding \\[ 10 \\]. Widely used thermal therapies include argon plasma coagulation (APC), electrocoagulation and heat probe coagulation. In one single-center study, researchers reported that use of APC alone is an effective way of managing DLs and that there is less chance of rebleeding \\[ 11 \\]. Mechanical therapy consists of band ligation and hemostatic clips placement. Studies have shown mechanical therapy to be superior to injection therapy for managing DLs, with a significantly lower rebleeding rate with mechanical therapy \\[ 12 \\]. Several studies and case reports have shown band ligation to be an effective modality for treatment of DLs in different locations of the GI tract \\[ 13 \\- 15 \\]. One randomized control trial showed no difference in the efficacy or safety of the use of band ligation versus hemoclip placement for management of bleeding DLs \\[ 8 \\]. Failed attempts at endoscopic therapy include interventional radiology bleed localization and embolization or, rarely, surgery with oversew techniques.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】Although the endoscopic diagnostic criteria for DL have been described in great detail, there is a paucity of literature describing a DL resembling the duodenal papilla. This atypical presentation of a Dieulafoy’s-like lesion, especially in the duodenum, should be borne in mind by endoscopists when searching for a source of bleeding.\n\n【37】Consent\n-------\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Hydroceles in this region are a rare cause of inguinal swelling in females. In addition, endometriosis localized to the canal of Nuck is exceedingly rare.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 44-year-old Japanese woman presented with a painful mass overlying her right pubis. She underwent surgery to completely excise the mass. During surgery, division of the external oblique aponeurosis revealed a cyst that occupied the inguinal canal and it adhered to the transverse fascia, inguinal ligament, and pubic bone. The cyst was dissected from the round ligament, and the defect in the internal inguinal ring was repaired and reinforced with mesh. On macroscopic examination, the cyst had a heterogeneous fibrous aspect with dark brown inclusions. Microscopic examination revealed that the cyst was tortuous, lined by mesothelial-like cells, and accompanied by partial subcapsular hemorrhage. Endometrium-like tissue was observed in the cystic wall. Immunohistochemical staining for podoplanin confirmed the mesothelial origin of the cyst-lining cells. The epithelial cells and stromal cells were positive for estrogen receptors.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In this case of an endometriosis-associated hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, the mesothelial origin of the cyst-lining cells and endometriosis were confirmed by positive immunohistochemical staining for podoplanin and estrogen receptors, respectively. We determined that hydrocele resection and reinforcement of the anterior inguinal canal wall (if necessary) are appropriate treatments for this condition.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】A hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in females is analogous to the encysted hydrocele of the spermatic cord in men \\[ 1 \\]. Inguinal hernia and inguinal endometriosis are possible causes of inguinal masses in females. As diagnoses of these masses by physical examination alone may be inconclusive, further evaluation using ultrasound \\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\] or magnetic resonance (MR) \\[ 3 \\] imaging can help to establish definitive preoperative diagnoses and the extent of lesions. Complete surgical excision of the cyst is the standard treatment for this condition.\n\n【10】Endometriosis is a relatively common condition, although the estimated frequency varies by population. A previous study has reported that endometriosis affects 6 to 10% of reproductive-aged females, 50 to 60% of females (including teenage girls) with pelvic pain, and up to 50% of females with infertility \\[ 5 \\]. Endometriosis may also occur in combination with inguinal hernia \\[ 6 , 7 \\] and hydrocele of the canal of Nuck \\[ 8 , 9 \\], but these cases are very rare. Here, we report a rare case of an endometriosis-associated hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. We also describe the use of immunohistochemical analysis to confirm the association of the hydrocele with endometriosis. This case report may help to increase awareness in general surgeons that inguinal masses in females may not only be due to hernia, but also due to endometriosis-associated hydroceles of the canal of Nuck.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 44-year-old premenopausal Japanese woman was referred to our department for a painful mass overlying her right pubis. She was a homemaker, and had first noticed the mass when she lifted several heavy books. She reported feeling the same symptom before, but did not remember when it had occurred. A review of her medical history showed that she had undergone laparoscopic surgery for intrapelvic endometriosis 10 years ago, but was not given any medication after being discharged. Her menstrual cycle had been irregular, but she denied fluctuation of the mass size in response to her menstrual cycle. She had a normal vaginal delivery 5 years before the present admission. She was a social drinker and a non-smoker of tobacco. Her family history revealed that her father had chronic renal failure and hypertension.\n\n【13】A physical examination found a 3-cm subcutaneous thickening to the right of the midline over her right pubis, and the site was painful on palpation. A laboratory examination showed normal values in standard tests, except for a slightly elevated total bilirubin level of 1.4 mg/dL. Through computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, we identified a subcutaneous, well-defined cystic nodule measuring 2.7 × 2.2 cm in the inguinal canal (Fig. 1 ). There was no evidence of associated pelvic disease. This indicated that the lesion was either a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, endometriosis, or an incarcerated ovary or omentum. She was admitted for surgery 18 days after the initial presentation. At admission, her blood pressure was 112/64 mmHg, pulse was 73/minute, and body temperature was 36.2 °C. A physical and neurological examination revealed no abnormalities except for the painful mass overlying her right pubis.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】Computed tomography scans showing a round cystic lesion ( _arrow_ ) within the right inguinal canal. **a** Transverse image. **b** Sagittal image. **c** Frontal image\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】The mass was completely excised through anterior open surgery. Division of the external oblique aponeurosis revealed a cyst filled with dark brown fluid that occupied the inguinal canal; the cyst adhered to the transverse fascia, inguinal ligament, and pubic bone. No hernia sac was detected. The cyst was dissected from the round ligament (Fig. 2 ), and the defect of the internal inguinal ring was repaired and reinforced with mesh. On macroscopic examination, the cyst measured approximately 5.0 × 3.0 × 2.0 cm, and had a heterogeneous fibrous aspect.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Intraoperative findings showing that the cyst, which contained dark brown fluid, strongly adhered to the round ligament of the uterus\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】A histologic examination showed that the tortuous cyst was lined with mesothelial-like cells, and was accompanied by partial subcapsular hemorrhage (Fig. 3a, b ). Endometrium-like tissue was observed in the cystic wall (Fig. 3b ). No atypical cells were observed. Immunohistochemical analysis using immunoperoxidase stain with hematoxylin counterstain revealed that the cyst-lining cells were positive for podoplanin (D2-40) (Fig. 3c ). In addition, the glandular epithelial cells and stromal cells were positive for estrogen receptors (Fig. 3d ).\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】Histological examination of the excised cyst. **a** The cyst was tortuous (hematoxylin and eosin staining; low magnification). **b** Tissue is evident, but the cyst-lining cells are unclear; endometrium-like tissue is observed in the cystic wall (hematoxylin and eosin staining; high magnification). **c** Podoplanin-positive cyst-lining cells are clearly observed after immunohistochemical staining (immunoperoxidase stain with hematoxylin counterstain; high magnification). **d** Epithelial cells and stromal cells are positive for estrogen receptors after immunohistochemical staining (immunoperoxidase stain with hematoxylin counterstain; high magnification). **b** , **c** , and **d** are magnified images of the area within the frame in ( **a** )\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was eventually discharged on the second postoperative day. She had not experienced any recurrent mass in the inguinal region 17 months after surgery.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】This report describes a rare case of immunohistochemically confirmed endometriosis-associated hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in a 44-year-old Japanese woman. Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent condition that affects 6 to 10% of reproductive-aged females \\[ 5 \\]. While ectopic endometrial tissue may appear anywhere in the body, implants tend to be located in the pelvic region. As a result, extrapelvic endometriosis is relatively rare. Scott and Te Linde \\[ 10 \\] conducted an analysis of 516 endometriosis cases that included only four cases (0.8%) of inguinal endometriosis; among these, three cases involved the inguinal portion of the round ligament and one case involved the canal of Nuck. In addition, Jimenez and Miles \\[ 11 \\] reported the incidence of endometriosis in the extraperitoneal portion of the round ligament to be 0.42%. Some researchers have described the diagnostic difficulty of inguinal endometriosis, and the most common preoperative diagnosis is inguinal hernia \\[ 11 , 12 \\].\n\n【31】To the best of our knowledge, few reports have conducted an immunohistochemical confirmation of endometriosis-associated hydroceles of the canal of Nuck. Usuki _et al_ . \\[ 13 \\] reported that the cyst-lining cells of such hydroceles were positive for calretinin and podoplanin, and that the subepithelial stromal cells were positive for CD10. In our patient, the cyst-lining cells were positive for podoplanin and the stromal cells were positive for estrogen receptors. These findings verified that the hydrocele was associated with endometriosis.\n\n【32】Previous studies have reported the identification of hydroceles of the canal of Nuck through ultrasound \\[ 2 , 3 \\] and MR imaging \\[ 3 , 14 \\]. Ozel _et al_ . \\[ 3 \\] reported that sonography showed a tubular cystic structure with internal septae in the inguinal canal of a female with inguinal swelling, and MR imaging found that the mass was hypointense in T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense in T2-weighted imaging.\n\n【33】Because our patient had previously undergone laparoscopic surgery for intrapelvic endometriosis, we were able to consider the possibility that the inguinal swelling was due to recurrent endometriosis. However, she did not notice that the inguinal swelling was related to her menstrual cycle, and had requested surgical excision for pain relief.\n\n【34】Treatments for a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck include surgical excision of the cyst with closure of the inguinal internal ring defect \\[ 9 \\] and simultaneous inguinal hernia repair if required \\[ 15 \\]. Surgical excision is effective as it is both therapeutic and diagnostic \\[ 16 \\]. When possible, a laparoscopic approach may be considered because of the advantage of a shorter recovery period \\[ 9 \\]. In addition, a laparoscopic approach enables an examination for any associated intra-abdominal endometriosis. However, further studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to verify the superiority and cost-effectiveness of the laparoscopic approach over anterior open procedures.\n\n【35】Patients with inguinal endometriosis often undergo initial surgery by a general surgeon under a diagnosis of hernia \\[ 17 \\]. General surgeons therefore need to be more aware that inguinal masses in females may not only be due to hernia, but also due to endometriosis-associated hydroceles of the canal of Nuck.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】We observed a case with an unusual manifestation of extraperitoneal endometriosis in a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. Although this is a rare condition, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of swelling in the inguinal region in females. Radical surgical excision with simultaneous inguinal hernia repair (if needed) represents the best option among current treatment choices because it allows for precise histological examination of the excised cyst and reduces the risk of relapse.\n\n【38】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【39】MR:\n\n【40】Magnetic resonance", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

A migratory fish bone was suspected, and the foreign body was removed under general anesthetic, combined with a hemithyroidectomy. The injured esophageal mucosa was sutured and closed. Our patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she was allowed oral food intake seven days after the surgery. No evidence of recurrence was seen over the postoperative follow-up period of 42 weeks.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We should be aware that fish bone foreign bodies may migrate out of the upper digestive tract and lodge in the thyroid gland.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Fish bones are one of the commonest foreign bodies occurring in the pharynx or cervical esophagus. Fish bone foreign bodies located outside the aerodigestive tract are relatively rare. Here, we present an extremely rare case of a migratory fish bone penetrating through the thyroid gland with a cutaneous fistula in the anterior neck one year after swallowing the foreign body.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 56-year-old Japanese woman had visited a local clinic, complaining of a two-month history of a painless cutaneous fistula in her anterior neck with pus discharge. She was diagnosed with a pyogenic granuloma \\[ 1 \\] by her previous doctor. The pus discharge temporarily subsided after antibiotic treatment, but the cutaneous fistula persisted. She was then referred to our department for further advice. On physical examination, a non-tender reddish lesion with a fistula and granulation was seen on her anterior cervical skin. Our patient reported that she had suffered from the sensation of a foreign body in her throat after eating fish approximately one year prior to the present onset, but the symptom had spontaneously improved after a few days. Taking her anamnesis into account, a fish bone foreign body was suspected.\n\n【12】Endoscopic examinations of her laryngopharynx and esophagus showed no abnormality. However, computed tomography (CT) revealed a bone-density needle-shaped foreign body sticking out anteroinferior from the esophageal wall, penetrating through the superior pole of her left thyroid lobe, and extending nearly to the anterior cervical skin (Figure 1 ). The foreign body was surrounded by a low density area, suggesting abscess formation (Figure 1 ). The results of a blood examination were unremarkable, with normal thyroid and parathyroid functions.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】**Preoperative computed tomography findings.** Contrast-enhanced **(A)** axial and **(B)** sagittal computed tomography reveal a bone-density needle-shaped foreign body sticking out anteroinferior from the esophageal wall, penetrating through the superior pole of the left thyroid lobe, and extending nearly to the anterior cervical skin. The foreign body is surrounded by a low density area, suggesting abscess formation.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Our patient underwent the removal of the foreign body combined with left hemithyroidectomy under general anesthesia 20 days after her initial visit to our department. A horizontal cervical incision with the spindle-shaped excision of the orifice of the fistula was made, and the skin flap was elevated. Considerable cicatricial adhesion was seen around the fistula. The fistula passed through the infrahyoid muscles and was connected to her left thyroid gland. The tip of the fish bone was exposed by cutting her infrahyoid muscles open. As seen in the preoperative imaging, the fish bone penetrated through her thyroid gland, reaching the esophageal wall. The fish bone, fistula, left thyroid lobe and an abscess were totally removed with preservation of her recurrent laryngeal nerve. The injured esophageal mucosa was sutured and closed. Figure 2 shows the removed fish bone, measuring 28mm in length.\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Removed fish bone.** The removed fish bone is 28mm in length.\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Our patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. No esophageal leakage was observed during an esophagography, and she was allowed oral food intake seven days after the surgery. She was discharged nine days after surgery, and no evidence of recurrence was seen over the postoperative follow-up period of 42 weeks.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Migratory fish bone foreign bodies in the thyroid gland are extremely rare, and only five other cases of this event have been reported in the English language literature since 1990 \\[ 2 – 6 \\]. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no previous report has documented the formation of a cutaneous fistula in the anterior neck caused by a fish bone foreign body penetrating the thyroid gland. It is known that fish bones may pass through the pharyngeal or esophageal wall spontaneously or during endoscopic manipulation. Even if the fish bone does not migrate out of the pharyngeal or esophageal lumen, the puncture wound created by the foreign body may cause a thyroid abscess \\[ 7 – 9 \\]. In the present case, it is most likely that the fish bone stuck in her cervical esophagus spontaneously migrated out of the lumen anteriorly, penetrated through her esophageal wall and thyroid gland, and reached her anterior cervical hypodermis in the course of one year after she swallowed the fish bone.\n\n【25】Considering that extrapharyngeal and extraesophageal foreign bodies often cause severe complications, such as deep neck infection or abscesses, mediastinitis and even sepsis, the early diagnosis and prompt removal of the foreign body are very important. The definitive diagnosis of a fish bone foreign body is successfully made by CT, which can locate and depict an extrapharyngeal or extraesophageal fish bone as a very high density needle-shaped material. Ultrasonography is also a useful diagnostic tool because most solid foreign bodies show acoustic shadows \\[ 4 \\]. In contrast, cervical plain film radiography is less useful, because fish bones on this imaging usually exhibit only faint shadows, and often overlap with the thyroid and cricoid cartilages and vertebrae. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that a fish bone foreign body is present, even if it is not visible on plain film radiography \\[ 2 \\]. Endoscopic examination is often useless as well for the diagnosis or exclusion of migratory foreign bodies. In the present case, endoscopic examination of the laryngopharynx and esophagus did not reveal any mucosal damage, but CT of her neck performed at the first presentation clearly depicted an extrapharyngeal or extraesophageal fish bone.\n\n【26】The only radical treatment for an extrapharyngeal or extraesophageal fish bone is complete removal of the foreign body. If the fish bone is stuck in the thyroid gland, hemithyroidectomy may be included. Any abscess lesion formed in the surrounding tissue must be drained or resected simultaneously \\[ 3 \\]. In the present case, hemithyroidectomy and the resection of an abscess were performed in addition to the removal of the foreign body to prevent the exacerbation of infection. Because a previous report documented that more than 10 % of patients who had undergone hemithyroidectomy manifested hypothyroidism \\[ 10 \\], we should monitor the patient’s thyroid function.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】We experienced an extremely rare case of an extrapharyngeal and extraesophageal migratory fish bone foreign body with a cutaneous fistula, removed one year after swallowing the fish bone. We should be aware that fish bone foreign bodies may migrate out of the upper digestive tract, lodge in the thyroid gland and reach the cervical skin.\n\n【29】Consent\n-------\n\n【30】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. Filamin A, encoded by the _FLNA_ gene, is a widely expressed protein that regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes, and second messengers, thus mutations in the gene encoding filamin A ( _FLNA_ ) lead to diseases with high phenotypic diversity including the following: periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), skeletal dysplasia, otopalatodigital spectrum disorders such as Melnick-Needles syndrome and frontometaphyseal dysplasia \\[ 1 – 5 \\], cardiovascular abnormalities that include patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), valvular disease, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-like phenotype \\[ 6 – 8 \\], and coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia \\[ 9 \\]. Recently, Masurel-Paulet _et al_ . \\[ 1 \\], de Wit and colleagues \\[ 10 \\], and Lord _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\] reported associations between pulmonary diseases in both sexes with substantial heterogeneity in manifestations and lethality. Here, we report the case of a female child with a novel _FLNA_ gene mutation who developed significant lung disease and unique angiogenesis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient is a 1-year-old Saudi female child who was referred from another hospital after PDA ligation, left inguinal hernia repair, accidental fracture of her right ulna and radius, and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was sent to our hospital for further evaluation due to ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Our patient was the third child of nonconsanguineous Saudi parents and was born via cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation due to fetal distress. The child was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 5 days because of respiratory distress and was ventilated for 36 hours. The mother has epilepsy and the father has been diagnosed with Behcet's disease. Since the age of 2 months, the child had multiple lengthy admissions in different hospitals (for 1 to 3 months at a time) for recurrent cyanotic events, respiratory distress, frequent choking with feeding, and significant vomiting. The child had accumulated the following diagnoses: severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), failure to thrive requiring prolonged nasogastric tube feeding, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, anoxic convulsions, chronic lung disease with prolonged oxygen dependency, reversible bronchospasm, left external iliac vein thrombosis, and developmental delay. She had two prior prolonged stays at our institution.\n\n【12】The first admission was due to rhinovirus infection and clinically diagnosed recurrent aspiration secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery (dysphagia lusoria) with prolonged oxygen therapy. The second admission was for respiratory failure that required prolonged intubation including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation complicated by recurrent lung atelectasis and right lung pneumothorax. She failed multiple trials of extubation and unfortunately died of cardiac arrest due to sepsis while receiving maximal supportive therapy. An initial physical examination during the first admission revealed a baby girl in poor health with the following clinical values: moderate respiratory distress and a respiratory rate of 70/min, heart rate of 144/min, blood pressure of 101/47 with saturation of 95% on 1.5 L/min, body weight of 5.9 kg (below the third percentile), and height of 69 cm (at the tenth percentile).The child had diminished breath sounds bilaterally with a prolonged expiratory phase, wheezing, and scattered crackles posteriorly, mild hypotonia, and significant hyperlaxity. Investigations showed normal sweat chloride level, and immune function testing was normal. A chest X-ray (Fig. 1 ) showed multiple subsegmental atelectasis and areas of air trapping. Computed tomography and angiography of her chest (Fig. 2 ) revealed bilateral lower lobe airspace disease, hyperinflation of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe including the lingual, and an enlarged main pulmonary artery. The sagittal view (Fig. 3 ) showed a right aberrant subclavian artery causing posterior compression to the esophagus at the level of the T4 vertebra and minimal compression in the posterior trachea. An echocardiogram showed no residual PDA or significant evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Barium administration (Fig. 4 ) showed external compression along the posterior wall of the proximal third of the esophagus, which was causing significant narrowing of the esophageal lumen. The pH probe showed no significant GERD. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed there was a narrowed and compressed area located 18 cm into the esophagus at T4, and was identified with marked pulsation. The flexible bronchoscopy showed complete ring and narrowing of the lower third of the trachea. A lung biopsy (Fig. 5 ) showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification, in which alveoli do not show age-appropriate normal architecture, compared with the normal alveolar architecture (Fig. 6 ). There was no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain because our patient's condition did not allow it.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Chest X-ray anteroposterior view shows multiple subsegmental atelectasis, areas of air trapping and osteopenia\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】 \n\n【19】Computed tomography angiography axial view below bifurcation of carina shows basal lung atelectasis, lung hyperinflation, and enlarged main pulmonary artery\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】 \n\n【23】Computed tomography angiography sagittal view shows right aberrant subclavian artery posterior compression to the esophagus at level of T4 vertebra and minimal compression in the posterior trachea\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】 \n\n【27】Barium meal shows external compression noted along posterior wall of proximal third of the thoracic esophagus causing significant narrowing of esophageal lumen\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 5**\n\n【30】 \n\n【31】Alveolated lung parenchyma (black arrows) with alveolar simplification. _Small yellow arrow_ : from the microscope that is probably not relevant\n\n【32】Full size image\n\n【33】**Fig. 6**\n\n【34】 \n\n【35】Normal alveolar septation\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】### Gene analysis\n\n【38】Molecular testing for _FLNA_ \\-related disorders in our patient showed a new pathogenic variant of one copy of c.3153dupC in exon 21 in the _FLNA_ gene.

Our patient was a female child who was confirmed to have a pathogenic variant of the _FLNA_ gene c.3153dupC. This mutation has not been reported in individuals with _FLNA_ \\-related disorders but is expected to cause disease. Similar to other reported cases, our child also manifested clinical symptoms at an early age \\[ 10 , 11 \\]. She had respiratory distress at birth and then had recurrent lower respiratory tract infections/bronchiolitis, bilateral lung emphysema with basal atelectasis, bronchospasm, pulmonary artery hypertension, and long oxygen and mechanical ventilatory dependency after 2 months of age. A lung biopsy showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification similar to the finding by Lord _et al_ . \\[ 11 \\]. This child also manifested associated clinical features reported with other filamin gene mutations including patent ductus arteriosis (PDA), hypotonia, joint laxity, and developmental delay \\[ 10 \\]. These clinical and histological features are similar to cases reported with the pulmonary phenotype of _FLNA_ (Table 1 ). However, an unusual clinical manifestation in our case is severe reflux that caused recurrent aspiration symptoms and dysphagia lusoria (secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery that caused significant esophageal compression). This abnormal angiogenesis has been reported only in _FLNA_ \\-null mice, which have vascular endothelial cells that show defective cell–cell contacts and adherens junctions. The result is abnormal angiogenesis with disorganized blood vessels and aberrant branching \\[ 7 , 12 \\]. There are other possible pulmonary phenotypes of _FLNA_ gene mutation suggested due to its role in T cell activation, interleukin production \\[ 13 \\], inflammatory signaling \\[ 14 \\], and interaction with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator \\[ 15 \\]. There has been no specific sensitivity to infections observed in _FLNA_ patients \\[ 10 \\]. However, our patient was noted to have severe prolonged courses of viral or bacterial infections. The pathogenic variant of _FLNA_ gene mutation in our reported case is not confirmed to have association with periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH), and our patient was too ill to complete brain MRI. The patient’s mother has epilepsy beginning in the third decade of life. The patient’s father has Behcet’s disease, which is highly consistent with other reports of PNH \\[ 8 , 16 , 17 \\].\n\n【41】**Table 1 Features of reported cases of filamin A mutation**\n\n【42】Full size table\n\n【43】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【44】In conclusion, we support the three previous reports in the literature, stating that there is an association between _FLNA_ gene mutation and lung disease. The lung disease is a lethal condition likely manifested by early onset of pneumonia and recurrent bronchiolitis, subsequent asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and long-term oxygen dependency with underlying lung emphysema or lung cysts. _FLNA_ mutation is also associated with airway anomalies such as tracheal stenosis (as in our patient) or tracheobronchomalacia. In addition, there are other diverse associated clinical manifestations.\n\n【45】Consent\n-------\n\n【46】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Diagnosis is difficult due to the non-specific presentation and lack of lymphadenopathy, thus leading to frequent instances of autopsy-proven diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of progressive stroke from intravascular lymphoma diagnosed antemortem by random skin biopsy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 42-year-old Thai man presented to our hospital with progressive multifocal cerebral infarction. Despite taking aspirin (300 mg/day), his neurological symptoms worsened. During admission, he developed an unexplained fever and hypoxemia. Magnetic resonance angiography clearly showed patency of all cerebral arteries including the internal carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries. Echocardiography, an antiphospholipid antibody test, cerebrospinal fluid cytology and a bone marrow study were normal. Other laboratory test results showed an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, nephrotic range proteinuria (3.91 g/day), hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dL), a very low high-density lipoprotein level (7 mg/dL) and hypertriglyceridemia (353 mg/dL). Because of suspected vasculitis, pulse methylprednisolone was given with transiently minimal improvement. A random skin biopsy from both thighs revealed intravascular large B cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy was not given due to our patient having ventilator associated pneumonia. He died 10 days after the definite diagnosis was established.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】One etiology of stroke is intravascular lymphoma, in which random skin biopsy can be helpful for antemortem diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is a rare type of extranodal lymphoma with an aggressive clinical course characterized by proliferation of lymphoma cells within the lumina of vessels, particularly the capillaries, with the exception of large arteries and veins \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. Because of its varied clinical symptoms and the absence of lymphadenopathy, a diagnosis of IVL is extremely difficult to make and many of the reported cases were diagnosed postmortem. We report the case of a 42-year-old man with IVL who presented with the clinical features of progressive multifocal cerebral infarction.\n\n【10】### Case presentation\n\n【11】A 42-year-old previously healthy Thai man developed slow ataxia, motor aphasia and frontal lobe releasing signs, gradually progressing over two months. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed multiple hypodensity lesions at bilateral occipito-parieto-frontal and cerebellar regions consistent with cerebral infarction (Figure 1 ). Our patient was treated with aspirin, 300 mg/day. His echocardiography results were unremarkable. A complete blood count (CBC) showed only mild anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) 10.1 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 80 fL, white blood cell count 6270 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelet count 192,000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ; neutrophils 72%, lymphocytes 17%, monocytes 11%). Antiphospholipid antibody (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-B2GP1 antibodies), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests were negative. Other laboratory test results showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 89 mm/hour, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 64 mg/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 873 U/L (normal range 225 to 450 U/L). Within two weeks his neurological condition had deteriorated, as noted by developing left hemiplegia and a worsening level of consciousness. Concurrently, he had developed low-grade fever without an identifiable source of infection and an elevated level of LDH (1203 U/L). A repeat CBC still showed only anemia (Hb 8.5 g/dL, WBC count 8220 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> , platelets 160,000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). He also had unexplained hypoxemia (PaO <sub>2 </sub> 59.5 mmHg, O <sub>2 </sub> saturation 92%, PaCO <sub>2 </sub> 35.9 mmHg). Doppler ultrasound scans of the veins of both legs were normal. Intravascular lymphoma was suspected. A bone marrow study showed normal marrow with no evidence of hemophagocytosis and lymphoma involvement on both hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. Because a bone marrow study and cerebrospinal fluid cytology showed unremarkable results, we decided to perform a random skin biopsy on both thighs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed diffuse multistage intraparenchymal infarctions and hemorrhages in the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 2 ). However, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain revealed normal intracranial vasculature (Figure 3 ). Vasculitis was considered, so our patient was treated with pulse methylprednisolone (1 g/day for five days), with his clinical symptoms partially improving as a result. Interestingly, the pathological findings of the random skin biopsies showed intravascular large B cell lymphoma (IVBL, positive for CD20) (Figure 4 ). He also had nephrotic range proteinuria (24-hour urine protein was 3.91 g), hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dL), hypertriglyceridemia (353 mg/dL) and very low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (7 mg/dL). We planned to start our patient on chemotherapy but he developed septic shock from ventilator associated pneumonia and died on the 10th day after the definitive diagnosis.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】**Computed tomography scan of the brain (with contrast) showing ill-defined hypodensity lesion with multiple hypodensity spots at bilateral parieto-occipito-temporal regions** .

Reproduced with permission.\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】The clinical presentation of IVBL is variable, but the disease has a fulminant course that confers a poor prognosis. Patients may present with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from pyrexia and non-specific constitutional symptoms to multi-organ failure \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. The most common clinical manifestations involve the nervous system and the skin, with at least 68% of patients having involvement of at least one of these organs \\[ 4 \\]. Other reported clinical manifestations included fever of unknown origin \\[ 4 \\], hypoxemia \\[ 5 \\], nephrotic syndrome \\[ 6 \\], hemophagocytic syndrome \\[ 7 \\], arthritis \\[ 8 \\], and myocardial infarction \\[ 9 \\]. Anemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were the most common laboratory findings \\[ 3 \\]. The clinical diagnosis of IVL is challenging and often difficult to diagnose antemortem, and the poor prognosis for these patients reflects delays in diagnosis and the institution of chemotherapy. Use of random skin biopsy was reported to help diagnose IVL antemortem \\[ 10 – 12 \\].\n\n【30】Our patient presented with neurological manifestations but did not have cutaneous involvement of IVBL. Initial laboratory abnormalities included mild anemia and elevated LDH, which were non-specific for IVL. Other laboratory test results related to IVL, such as soluble interleukin 2 receptor level \\[ 12 \\] and serum ferritin level tests, were not performed. There was no evidence of hemophagocytic syndrome from a bone marrow study. However, histological evidence of IVBL in skin biopsies taken from apparently normal skin has been documented previously. A skin biopsy enabled diagnosis of IVBL in our patient.\n\n【31】The neurological manifestations of IVBL are varied, ranging from focal ischemic events to dementia \\[ 3 \\]. Ischemic stroke is a common disease worldwide and is mostly caused by atherosclerotic arterial disease. However, our patient showed some symptoms that guided us to consider IVL as more likely than atherosclerotic arterial disease: our patient had no apparent atherosclerotic risk factor and there was no evidence of a cardiac source of emboli and antiphospholipid syndrome, aspirin did not retard the progression of stroke, he developed an unexplained fever in the second week of hospitalization without an identifiable source of infection and the fever did not respond to empirical antibiotics, he developed unexplained hypoxemia, his serum LDH was elevated to 1203 U/L, he had unexplained nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and finally, MRA showed normal intracranial arteries.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】Even though intravascular lymphoma is uncommon, the disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological manifestations or fever of unknown origin with elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase. Our patient's case shows that a random skin biopsy from normal skin can help a physician to diagnose IVBL. We recommend random skin biopsy, a safe bedside procedure, be used in the evaluation of patients in whom the diagnosis of IVL is doubtful, particularly before other invasive investigations are used.\n\n【34】Consent\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's next of kin for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

It is a rare tumor at this age and has a bad prognosis at this localization.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We describe the case of a 22-year-old African man admitted for a perineal mass that had evolved over 6 months. He complained of tenesmus, obstinate constipation, and dysuria. A clinical examination revealed perineal swelling spread over his anus, scrotum, penis, testicles, and inguinal lymph nodes. A perineal ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed a large mass driving his testicles forward with regional lymph node metastases. An ultrasound-guided biopsy showed embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma on histology and immunohistochemistry, with strong positivity of neural cell adhesion molecule and myogenin while results for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cluster of differentiation 45, synaptophysin, and chromogranin were negative. Our patient was classified T2N1M1. Outcome was quickly marked by occlusive syndrome and colostomy. Our patient did not opt for chemotherapy and died after 6 months of follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The embryonic RMS of the adult is a rare disease. Despite the sensitivity to chemotherapy and surgery. Localization to perineum remains poor prognosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is a rare type of soft tissue tumor \\[ 1 \\]. It predominates in children less than 7 years old while a second peak is observed in adolescence; the two subtypes that affect both child and adult are embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. A third subtype, the pleomorphic RMS occurs almost exclusively in adults \\[ 2 \\]. The most common sites are cervical-cephalic and genitourinary \\[ 3 \\]. Perineal and anal localizations are rarer and have worse prognosis \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【10】We report the case of a 22-year-old patient with ERMS of the perineum extended at the scrotum and penis with inguinal lymph node involvement.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 22-year-old African man without specific medical history was admitted for a perineal mass evolving over 6 months, which was painful, and had appeared spontaneously. An examination found tenesmus, obstinate constipation, and dysuria. It revealed a dry perineal swelling, which was painless, and extended back to his anus, scrotum and penis. His testicles were mobile, and there were enlarged and fixed lymphadenopathies (Fig. 1 ).\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Dry whole perineal swelling with inguinal node involvement\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】A pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan found a large mass on his perineum, fairly limited, driving his testicles forward, with regional lymphadenopathies without secondary lesion.\n\n【18】A pathological examination of the biopsy fragments taken under ultrasound showed a tumor proliferation composed of small-sized cell nuclei with an increase in the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, with a fairly monomorphic appearance and associated with mitotic figures. These cells were disposed around slots. Some cells had an eosinophilic cytoplasm appearance (Fig. 2 ).\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】 \n\n【21】Increase in the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, monomorphic appearance, and eosinophilic cytoplasm appearance\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】At immune marking, NCAM and myogenin (Figs. 3 and 4 ) were strongly positive, while CKAE1/AE3 antibody, CD45, synaptophysin, and chromogranin were negative. Our patient was classified T2N1M0 and then considered as stage III.\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】 \n\n【26】NCAM- and myogenin-positive coloration - low magnification\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】 \n\n【30】NCAM- and myogenin-positive coloration - high magnification\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Outcome was quickly marked by anal obstruction and colostomy. He died after 6 months of follow-up with only supportive care.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor with an estimated incidence of 0.45 to 0.69 cases per 100,000. This case is the first case in more than 20,000 patients in our practice. The incidence of RMS in general, and embryonic RMS especially, has a peak in young children between 0 and 4 years. The incidence decreases followed by another smaller peak between 15 and 19 years. After 19 years, the incidence decreases rapidly from 0.16 per 100,000 population between 20 and 24 years to 0.08 per 100,000 in the class of 25–29 years \\[ 1 \\]. Definitive diagnosis is based on histological examination. A surgical biopsy is recommended. The needle biopsy is usually reserved for small lesions located in areas to be treated with radiation or chemotherapy or metastatic lesions \\[ 4 \\]. The site of the lesion led us to a biopsy. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphological examinations are the most used in the expansion of the RMS balance sheet. A CT scan is advantageous for evaluation of bone lesions and abdominal lymphadenopathies. A MRI scan provides a better definition of the primary tumor and its relations with neighboring organs \\[ 4 \\]. In our patient, CT was sufficient to characterize the lesion and examine the locoregional extension.\n\n【35】Embryonal RMS generally has an intermediate prognosis \\[ 2 \\]. However, perineal locations have the worst predictions because they are usually diagnosed at a late stage \\[ 4 \\]. The best prognostic factors in the perineal location are stage I with small size, less than 5 cm, absence of nodal involvement, and young age, less than 10 years \\[ 4 \\]. The histological type in this location does not seem to impact overall survival \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【36】The metastatic testicular damage in the ERMS has been rarely described. Gow _et al._ \\[ 5 \\] reported two cases of metastatic testicular damage in ERMS in two young subjects \\[ 5 \\]. In the case of our patient it is unclear whether the testicular damage was the result of contiguity or rather the metastatic disease.\n\n【37】For our patient, a temporary colostomy was indicated; it is often necessary in case of anal obstruction \\[ 4 \\].\n\n【38】The oncological surgical treatment includes a complete resection of the original site with a circumferential margin of at least 0.5 cm \\[ 4 \\]. In the anal and perineal locations, difficulties stem from the vicinity of the anal sphincter, urethra, and genitalia. In the case of our patient surgical resection was not considered because of the anal, penile, and scrotal involvement. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy seemed to be the best alternative.\n\n【39】Nowadays, almost all patients with ERMS receive chemotherapy \\[ 4 \\]. The most widely used protocol combines vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). New protocols based on ifosfamide and etoposide were used in combination with VAC in therapeutic trials with greater local control and better survival at 3 years than VAC only. These results suggest that the combination of ifosfamide-etoposide and VAC could be beneficial for advanced ERMS \\[ 6 \\]. Other molecules such as irinotecan appear to be useful in the treatment of advanced ERMS \\[ 7 \\]. After resection or biopsy, patients requiring radiotherapy are those having a microscopic or macroscopic residue. For many patients, radiation seems to be important to local disease control and survival \\[ 4 \\]. At this localization, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma seems to have better outcome than alveolar cases. Anal infiltration and lymph node involvement, as in our patient, are the main prognosis factors \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】We reported a case of embryonal RMS extended to the perineum, scrotum, and penis with lymph node and testicular metastasis in 22-old-year African man. This is a rare condition. Treatment is based on surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and prognosis depends on location and regional extension. Death occurs in the case of extended and nonresectable disease.\n\n【42】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【43】CD45:\n\n【44】cluster of differentiation 45\n\n【45】CK AE1/AE3:\n\n【46】cytokeratin AE1/AE3\n\n【47】CT:\n\n【48】computed tomography\n\n【49】ERMS:\n\n【50】embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma\n\n【51】MRI:\n\n【52】magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【53】NCAM:\n\n【54】neural cell adhesion molecule\n\n【55】VAC:\n\n【56】vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Suprachoroidal haemorrhage can occur as an unusual complication. We report a pseudophakic man who had early surgical intervention for this complication. This intervention may have contributed to the good recovery of his visual acuity and the minimum changes to his visual fields.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 79-year-old pseudophakic man with chronic open angle glaucoma presented with further deterioration of his right visual field despite maximum medical therapy and a previous trabeculectomy. The right visual acuity was 6/9 with an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 16 mmHg. Bleb needling with 5-fluouracil was performed in a standard manner. His postoperative IOP was 6 mmHg. Thirty-six hours later the visual acuity was reduced to hand movements and two large choroidal detachments where observed clinically, which progressed to suprachoroidal haemorrhages. Five days after the initial needling, the patient had complex surgery involving anterior chamber reformation, a bleb compression suture and drainage of the haemorrhagic suprachoroidal detachments. Subsequently, the patient had a right vitrectomy with endolaser following a vitreous haemorrhage. The final visual acuity was 6/9 with an intraocular pressure of 8 mmHg on travoprost and brinzolamide. The final visual field showed little change when compared with the pre-suprachoroidal haemorrhage visual field.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】It is important to consider the possibility of delayed suprachoroidal haemorrhage as a complication in bleb needling, and early surgical intervention may be beneficial.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The needling of filtering blebs is a recognised procedure for improving the aqueous flow in failing trabeculectomies. This is considered a relatively safe and effective procedure, although suprachoroidal haemorrhage can occur as an unusual complication \\[ 1 – 3 \\].\n\n【10】We report a pseudophakic man on clopidogrel therapy who had a good recovery of visual acuity and little change to visual fields following early surgical intervention for this complication. To the best of our knowledge such a recovery following this complication has not been previously reported and may be due to the early surgical intervention.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 79-year-old myopic man with chronic open angle glaucoma presented with deterioration of his right central visual field. Fifteen years earlier he had bilateral trabeculectomies and was currently requiring brimonidine, brinzolamide and travoprost to control his intraocular pressure (IOP). The patient was pseudophakic with a posteriorly placed intraocular lens. The right visual acuity was 6/9 and the IOP was 16 mmHg. Examination revealed end stage optic discs. In view of the progressive visual field deterioration, needling of the filtering bleb was offered.\n\n【13】The needling was carried out in theatre. A subtenon anaesthesia of 2% lignocaine, which was uncomplicated, was used. Under aseptic technique Healon GV was injected with a 32-guage needle into the conjunctiva adjacent to the bleb to form a diffuse bleb; this enables the adhesions in the conjunctiva to be broken down and allows the 5-fluouracil to remain peripheral to the bleb where it is required to prevent conjunctival scarring and adhesions. Three subconjunctival injections of 2.5 mg 5-fluouracil were then injected around the bleb. This technique has been previously described \\[ 4 \\]. Postoperatively the anterior chamber was formed with an IOP of 6 mmHg and the patient was discharged. Two days later the patient represented with pain and right visual acuity reduced to hand movements. Clinically the patient had a formed anterior chamber and two large choroidal detachments. The IOP was 5 mmHg. The following day, the choroidal detachments had progressed to suprachoroidal haemorrhages. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed a dense non-mobile echogenic shadow consist with a suprachoroidal haemorrhage (Figure 1 ). Ultrasound also showed an attached posterior pole with no significant submacular haemorrhage. Five days after the initial needling the patient had complex surgery to reverse the hypotony, deepen the shallow anterior chamber and manage the suprachoroidal haemorrhages. This involved anterior chamber reformation, a bleb compression suture and drainage of the haemorrhagic suprachoroidal detachments via long posterior sclerotomies. Postoperatively the IOP was 15 mmHg. Fundal examination showed a substantial reduction in the choroidal detachment with some persistent areas of detachment superiorly and inferiorly.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**Dense echogenic shadow due to suprachoroidal haemorrhage on ultrasonography of the right eye (B scan,10 Hz).**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Six days later the patient presented with a visual acuity of light perception and increased ocular pain. The IOP was 33 mmHg. Examination revealed a shallow anterior chamber and a dense vitreous haemorrhage, which was secondary to the suprachoroidal haemorrhage. B-scan ultrasonography showed no retinal detachment and the peripheral choroidal detachments were reduced. The IOP was 16 mmHg on removing the compression suture. The following week, the patient had a right vitrectomy which revealed no retinal tears or holes and the patient had ninety-degree cyclodiode endolaser.\n\n【19】One week later the visual acuity was counting fingers and the IOP was 20 mmHg. The bleb had some drainage, the anterior chamber was formed and the retina was flat. The final visual acuity was 6/12 with an IOP of 13 mmHg on travoprost and brinzolamide. The final visual field showed only slight change when compared with the visual field before the suprachoroidal haemorrhage (Figure 2 ).\n\n【20】**Figure 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】**Comparison of visual fields of the right eye prior to the suprachoroidal haemorrhage (left) and following recovery (right).**\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Mardelli et al reported an incidence of suprachoroidal haemorrhage following bleb needling as high as 1 in 118 patients and the incidence reported following glaucoma filtration procedures is 2.9%, although these studies looked at intraocular procedures \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Histopatholgical studies have suggested that suprachoroidal haemorrhages are caused by rupture of the posterior ciliary arteries \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【26】Suprachoroidal haemorrhages present with sudden painful loss of vision and elevated IOP. Clinically the patient can have a shallow and/or flat anterior chamber. The fundal appearance is a dark nonserous choroidal detachment, confirmed by B-scan ultrasonography. The risk factors for delayed suprachoroidal haemorrhage after glaucoma surgery include white race, anticoagulation, severe postoperative hypotony and aphakia or anterior chamber intraocular lens \\[ 5 \\].\n\n【27】Clopidogrel blocks platelet aggregation by inhibiting the adenosine diphosphate induced pathway. It has gained popularity in the management of many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The CURE study found that adding clopidogrel to patients already taking aspirin increased the risk of intraocular haemorrhage from 0.03% to 0.05% \\[ 7 \\]. Cobb et al investigated the effect of aspirin and warfarin therapy in trabeculectomy \\[ 8 \\]. They found that it was safe to continue aspirin during trabeculectomy, however they had no patients on clopidogrel.\n\n【28】There is no consensus on the appropriate timing for surgical intervention in managing suprachoroidal haemorrhages. Meier and Wiedemann recommend operating not later than 14 days after the onset of suprachoroidal haemorrhage \\[ 9 \\]. They advise against early drainage by posterior sclerotomies except in situations where there is a closed system with a constant intraocular pressure, such as in primary vitrectomy or, as in our case, where the eye was not entered during the initial bleb needling procedure. They do recommend anterior chamber reformation at the same time to reduce the risk of hypotony. Reynolds et al give similar advise \\[ 10 \\].\n\n【29】Despite surgical intervention, visual outcomes for delayed suprachoroidal haemorrhage remain poor as demonstrated in one case report with a drop from 0.72 LogMar to 1.36 \\[ 5 \\]. Howe and Bloom managed a case conservatively where the visual acuity remained at hand movements \\[ 1 \\]. Meier and Wiedemann reported a visual acuity of light perception in all 10 patients they studied \\[ 9 \\].

Omental torsion can be divided into primary and secondary. Owing to its nonspecific abdominal pain, preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Ultrasound sonography and abdominal computed tomography scans do not have a major role in preoperative diagnosis. The definite diagnosis is usually made during operation.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 7-year-old Persian boy was referred with right lower quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Laboratory blood tests and urinalysis were requested that revealed normal values. Ultrasonography was performed, revealing inflammatory changes with mild free fluid collection in the interloop. The patient underwent an open appendectomy, confirming a normal appendix with omental torsion. Two days later, he was discharged home without postoperative complications.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In patients with acute abdomen, particularly those with acute appendicitis symptoms, omental torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Omental torsion is a rare cause of acute abdomen \\[ 1 \\] that results from omental rotation on its long axis, leading to a decreased blood supply and tissue infarction. Omental torsion mainly affects adults more than children, but its incidence has increased recently because of the widespread prevalence of obesity \\[ 2 \\]. As Eitel had described for the first time in 1899, preoperative diagnosis of omental torsion is challenging because clinical symptoms and signs mimic other causes of abdominal pain, especially acute appendicitis. Omental torsion complications include intraperitoneal abscess, peritonitis, intraperitoneal bleeding, and rupture \\[ 3 \\]. Surgical exploration is the gold-standard method for diagnosis \\[ 4 \\]. In this case report, we describe a case of omental torsion in a 7-year-old boy presenting with symptoms of acute appendicitis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 7-year-old Persian boy was referred to the emergency room with complaint of abdominal pain. His symptoms had started 2 days ago in the right lower quadrant and gradually increased, accompanied with nausea and vomiting.\n\n【12】He was fully vaccinated, had no significant family, social, or environmental history and had normal growth and development with no history of previous illness.\n\n【13】The child was not ill, and his vital signs included blood pressure of 111/720 mmHg, pulse rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37 °C. Abdominal examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness and rebound tenderness, while other parts of the abdomen had no pain or tenderness. There were no other findings on physical and neurological examination.\n\n【14】Laboratory tests such as complete blood count and liver function tests revealed normal values as follows: white blood cells 6.7 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (4.5–11 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL) (neutrophils 58%, lymphocytes 31%); red blood cells 4.77 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /µL (4.7–6.1 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> /µL); hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (11.2–14.5 g/dL); hematocrit 33% (39–50%); mean corpuscular volume 69.2 fL (80–100 fL); red cell distribution width 17% (11.5–15%); platelets 294 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL (150–450 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL); aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L (8–33 U/L); alanine transaminase 27 U/L (7–55 U/L).\n\n【15】Ultrasonography revealed enhanced pericecal fat echogenicity due to the inflammatory changes with mild free fluid collection in the interloop (Fig. 1 ). The patient underwent a diagnostic laparotomy with suspicious of acute appendicitis with a Lanz incision. The laparotomy, however, revealed a normal-appearing appendix, and greater omentum torsion was visually determined (Fig. 2 ). The incision was not extended, and laparotomic appendectomy and omentectomy were done through Lanz incision. The pathology report noted a creamy normal appendix, measuring 6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. Omentum pathology was reported as fibroconnective tissue with congestion.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Ultrasonography showing hyperechogenicity of pericecal fat with mild free fluid in the interloop at the site of tenderness in the right lower quadrant\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】 \n\n【22】Intraoperative findings of omental torsion, before resection. The sudden color change is evident in the image (arrow)\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】The patient was nil per os (NPO) after hospitalization.We hydrated the patient with stat 300 cc lactate Ringer and 600 cc dextrose 5% in 0.9% sodium chloride once every 8 hours. Antibiotic therapy include ceftriaxone 750 mg twice a day, metronidazole 300 mg every 8 hours, and analgesic \\[Apotel as needed (PRN)\\] was prescribed intravenously. After surgery, the patient’s symptoms were ameliorated and he was discharged from the hospital 2 days later. Oral medication including metronidazole, cefixime, and analgesic was prescribed.He had no complications on follow-up office visits after surgery for 6 months.\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】The omentum is a four-layer sheet of the peritoneum that descends from the stomach and binds to the transverse colon. It is capable of sequestrating inflamed organs owing to its mobility \\[ 2 \\] 4 .\n\n【27】Omental torsion can be primary or secondary. Primary omental torsion is more prevalent in obese children and may occur in the absence of intraabdominal pathology. In contrast, secondary omental torsion, which is uncommon in children, is due to hernias, cyst or omental tumor, foreign body, adhesions, and postsurgical scarring. Risk factors for torsion include trauma, increased intraabdominal variations, pressure of fat deposits (particularly in obese patients), hyperperistalsis, omental anatomic variations, overeating, overexertion, and sudden changes in body position.\n\n【28】Increased omental weight due to fat deposits leads to decreased blood supply to the omentum in obese children and causes traction or torsion to the distal part. It occurs in 0.1–0.5% of children with presumptive appendicitis undergoing operations. Omental torsion occurs in adults more than children and is more common in males between 40 and 50 years (66%). With similar body weight, omental fat accumulation is higher in males compared with females of similar body weight, which may explain the higher prevalence in males \\[ 2 \\] 5 6 .\n\n【29】Pain is the main clinical presentation of omental torsion, and it can be located in the right upper or lower quadrants, depending on the omentum affected site. The pain is nonradiating and constant, with sudden onset \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Most patients with omental torsion present only one episode of pain, and recurrent abdominal pain may suggest intermittent torsions \\[ 7 \\]. Body movements may induce pain and can be associated with rebound and localized tenderness \\[ 6 \\]. Patients can also present gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Fifty percent of patients present leukocytosis and low-grade fever. A mass under examination may be palpable if a large omental segment is involved. The palpable mass can be found in 50% of patients \\[ 4 , 9 \\].\n\n【30】Clinical presentation simulates other acute abdominal conditions. Differential diagnoses include cholecystitis, acute appendicitis, cecal diverticulitis, abdominal wall hematoma, perforated duodenal ulcer, and intestinal obstruction. In women of reproductive age, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst torsion, and salpingitis should also be included. In children, mesenteric adenitis and Meckel diverticulum should also be considered. Another diagnostic possibility is torsion of an accessory spleen when it presents, which is usually located inside the omentum \\[ 10 \\]. The duration of omental torsion is longer than acute appendicitis, and patients are less systematically unwell \\[ 9 \\].\n\n【31】In our experience, radiological studies, have usually been nonspecific. However, recent studies have outlined specific findings on ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\[ 6 \\]. The characteristic ultrasound finding in omental torsion is a noncompressible, hyperechoic oval mass adherent to the abdominal wall with a hypoechoic rim \\[ 3 , 11 \\]. CT scan is crucial in diagnosing omental torsion because it can differentiate omental torsion from appendicitis and acute cholecystitis by showing a normal, noninflamed appendix and gallbladder, respectively. Also, a paracolic abscess and bowel wall thickening on CT scan may suggest diverticulitis \\[ 12 \\]. CT scan findings in omental torsion include a large cake-shaped or ovoid dense fatty mass with hyperattenuating streaks associated with the thick anterior abdominal wall. There is often a typical whirling pattern of the mesentery, with serosanguinous fluid accumulation within the peritoneum. However, these findings can also appear in other conditions, such as liposarcoma, lipoma, angiomyolipoma, mesenteric lipodystrophy, teratoma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, intestinal volvulus, and segmental infarction of the omentum \\[ 11 \\] 13 . In our case, clinical signs and examinations were conclusive of acute appendicitis, so there was no need for a CT scan. CT scan advantages outweigh ultrasonography on omental torsion evaluation when the mass can be identified in a specific location; in addition, ultrasonography is operator-dependent. Combining physical examination and real-time imaging may help focus on the maximal tenderness point by sonographic examination and less exposure to radiation \\[ 11 \\]. MRI is also helpful, even with complications, such as abscess development or bleeding. However, the need for MRI is uncommon \\[ 7 \\].\n\n【32】The treatment of omental torsion is controversial. Most patients recover with conservative treatment since imaging techniques can diagnose it early and lead to self-limiting and benign disease. Moreover, the total resolve of the inflammation, fibrosis, and retraction often occurs within 2 weeks \\[ 14 \\] 15 . However, some patients may require surgery because of an omental abscess, uncertain diagnosis, worsening of symptoms despite conservative treatment such as anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotic therapy, and oral analgesics \\[ 14 \\] 16 . Surgical treatment includes laparoscopic resection of the affected segment of the omentum \\[ 17 \\].\n\n【33】Furthermore, laparoscopic advantages are (1) facilitation of peritoneal aspiration and washing, (2) complete examination of the abdomen to confirm the diagnosis, and (3) reduction of the postoperative adhesion, wound-related complications, and postoperative pain \\[ 14 \\].\n\n【34】In conclusion, omental torsion is a rare cause of acute abdomen. This case was treated successfully with omental resection. Most patients recover conservatively; however, because of the limitations in definitive diagnosis and prolonged hospital admission in conservative management, we suggest that surgical resection should be performed as soon as possible when the diagnosis is suspected.\n\n【35】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【36】The datasets used during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【37】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【38】CT:\n\n【39】Computed tomography\n\n【40】MRI:\n\n【41】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【42】NPO:\n\n【43】Nil per os", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The patient underwent a 24-week neuropsychological rehabilitation program directed to favor attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning together. After the cognitive intervention, we observed a better patient's performance in tasks requiring sustained, selective, and divided attention, improvement of encoding and retrieval memory problems, use of spatial relationships, planning, and organization of behavior skills. We also observed generalization effects on other domains, such as learning, mental flexibility, inhibition functions, and language.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In conclusion, our results suggest that neuropsychological rehabilitation programs favoring multiple domains together are useful in reestablishing cognitive deficits in patients with severe DAI.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Cognitive deficits caused by diffuse axonal injury (DAI) contribute to disability observed after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Memory, executive functioning, and speed-of-processing are the main domains affected by DAI, due to alteration of important white matter structures which disrupts brain connectivity \\[ 1 \\]. Cognitive rehabilitation aims to favor recovery and compensation of affected functions based on the principles of brain neuroplasticity \\[ 2 \\]. Nonetheless, the beneficial effects of cognitive interventions for DAI are controversial \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. These controversies are, in part, due to an incomplete understanding of the impact of different patients' characteristics on rehabilitation effectiveness. Furthermore, the most beneficial components of cognitive interventions for DAI and the effect of domain-specific vs. multidomain training approaches on general cognitive functioning remain unclear.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】We conducted a single-case study to evaluate the effectiveness of a neuropsychological rehabilitation program directed to favor attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning together, in a patient with severe TBI-associated DAI, using a pretest-posttest design.\n\n【12】A 26-year-old Hispanic woman attended to our center complaining of memory problems, dysarthria, and difficulty in planning. Nine months earlier, she suffered a severe TBI after a car crash requiring intensive medical care at another hospital. A non-contrasted brain CT scan at admission showed Fisher IV subarachnoid hemorrhage affecting right frontal and parietal sulci, ambiens cisterna, anterior midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, and a proximal portion of the spinal cord at the level of the foramen magnum. The patient progressively recovered her neurological functioning and was discharged four weeks after injury without a sensitive and motor sequel. A control brain MRI scan revealed multiple non-hemorrhagic focal lesions compatible with DAI of grade III (Fig. 1 ). However, the patient did not receive any medical follow-up nor neuropsychological rehabilitation during the following months before attending our center. During such a period, she tried to return to her usual professional activities but noticed a diminished performance in tasks that did not represent a challenge before the trauma.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】 \n\n【15】Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with diffuse axonal injury. Axial T2-weighted ( **a** ) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images of the brain ( **b** – **e** ) showing multifocal hyperintensities (red circles) located at the gray-white matter interface compatible with diffuse axonal injury of grade III\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Besides the recent TBI, her past medical history was no relevant. She had a high level of education (master of forensic science). On admission, the patient was evaluated by a clinical neurologist and a neurosurgeon, which did not detect any physical examination abnormality. Then, she was assessed for deficits in several cognitive domains using various neuropsychological tests (Table **1** ). During the pre-intervention assessment, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Evaluation of impressive and expressive language revealed dysarthria. Dysfunction in sustained, selective, and divided attention and a decrease in attentional volume and speed-of-processing were found. She presented alterations in memory explained by difficulties in encoding due to attentional deficits aforementioned and showed problems in memory retrieval due to low usage of organizational strategies for learning. We found alterations in the planning and organization of executive behavior, as well as in auditory working memory in its central executive component, which were more evident during tasks demanding a higher level of concentration. Finally, difficulties in managing spatial relationships and coordinates were also observed.\n\n【18】**Table 1 Neuropsychological test battery employed for cognitive assessment after diffuse axonal injury**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】Then, the patient underwent a two-phase 24-session cognitive intervention program (Fig. **2** ). Phase 1, which had a duration of 12 weeks, was directed to sustained selective auditory and visual attention through tasks of cancelation and counting of different verbal and visual elements. Briefly, the patient had to select among different proposed strategies of verbalization and organization of such elements in order to complete each task correctly. This phase also favored visuospatial and visuoconstructive skills using tasks of copying symmetrical drawings, mosaics, tangram, and copying drawings in grids. Phase 2, which lasted another 12 weeks, favored memory, specifically in the encoding stage, through tasks requiring recall of stories, learning of word lists, taking errands, and reading news. Different strategies were proposed to improve the organization of information to be encoded. These included the division of a story into paragraphs or the classification of written information by semantic groups. We trained selective memory by asking the patient to write a sentence consisting of a pronoun, noun, and adjective summarizing the content of each paragraph of a text. Phase 2 also focused on executive functions such as planning and organizing using labyrinth tasks. Also, we used cards with questions like \"what do I have to do?\" and \"how am I going to do it?\" which had to be answered by the patient before executing certain activities.\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】A multidomain cognitive rehabilitation program for a patient with severe traumatic brain injury-associated diffuse axonal injury\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】The patient was able to complete all phases and sessions of the intervention program after 24 weeks of follow-up (15 months after trauma). We found a general improvement of the patient's performance during the postintervention cognitive assessment (Table 2 ). Specifically, we observed better performance in tasks requiring sustained, selective, and divided attention. Moreover, the attention volume increased, allowing the patient to record all the information presented to her. The encoding and retrieval memory problems significatively improved, and the patient used strategies for organizing information that promoted learning. She also improved her usage of spatial relationships and coordinates, allowing constructive task solving. We found a modest improvement in the planning and organization of behavior skills. Improvement in visual-spatial working memory was observed; however, in terms of auditory working memory, differences in patient performance were discrete.\n\n【25】**Table 2 Effects of the cognitive intervention program**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Finally, we scheduled a follow-up appointment at our outpatient clinic to evaluate the general condition of the patient six months after the end of the cognitive intervention. During such an evaluation, the patient scored average in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Also, she reported the recovery of her independence and return to her professional activities. The patient provided written informed consent for publication of the case.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Cognitive decline is one of the most critical factors contributing to the disability observed among patients that suffered a TBI after hospital discharge \\[ 5 \\]. As such, neuropsychological interventions aimed to recover the affected cognitive functions or promote compensatory mechanisms have increasingly become part of the medical care for patients with TBI. Thus far, neuropsychological rehabilitation programs for patients with TBI-associated DAI have been directed to individual cognitive domains, showing controversial effects and minimal generalization to other domains. For instance, some investigations have proven the effectiveness of attention training in TBI patients, whereas others showed no improvement of attention after rehabilitation \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. Likewise, poor support exists for memory and speed-of-processing training after TBI \\[ 3 \\]. Despite no apparent results, recent data suggest that cognitive rehabilitation significantly modify cerebral activation in patients with TBI \\[ 6 \\]. Furthermore, factors like age, cognitive reserve, severity and time postinjury, neurological sequelae, and the approach of intervention influence the neuropsychological rehabilitation effectiveness \\[ 4 , 7 , 8 \\].\n\n【30】In this context, a previous study has shown that training of multiple cognitive domains together, rather than individually, might be beneficial for the recovery of specific and generalized cognitive functions in young patients with mild-to-moderate TBI-associated DAI \\[ 9 \\]. Here, we demonstrated that the benefits of this approach might extend to young patients with severe injury. Indeed, although our program focused on attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning, we also observed an improvement in learning, mental flexibility, inhibition functions, and language deficits. The young age and high cognitive reserve of the patient could have contributed to our intervention's effectiveness, as reported before \\[ 10 \\]. However, a significant limitation of our study is the absence of a control group. This caveat did not allow us to discriminate between our rehabilitation program's effects and those attributed to a natural recovery process. This limitation is fundamental, as it is expected that patients that suffered a TBI will recover a certain degree of cognitive functioning over time without any intervention \\[ 8 \\].\n\n【31】Despite this, we should note that some facts make us believe that the improvements observed here are not likely attributed to a natural recovery process. First, our cognitive intervention started nine months after the TBI. During the intermediate period, the patient did not notice any improvement in her cognitive functioning, which is why she looked for medical care. This contrasts with the dynamics of the natural recovery process of cognitive functions after a TBI, as most patients recover particular abilities early during the first few weeks \\[ 11 \\].\n\n【32】Secondly, the cognitive recovery pattern observed in our patient also differed from the natural longitudinal trajectories of neuropsychological functions described after TBI. For instance, visuospatial and executive functioning have shown a linear improvement during the first 15 months after injury in patients with moderate to severe TBI \\[ 8 \\]. Conversely, as aforementioned, our patient did not report any improvement of these functions during the first nine months after the trauma. Also, she presented severe impairment in planning, organization of executive behavior, and difficulties in managing spatial relationships and coordinates immediately before receiving cognitive rehabilitation. These cognitive deficits greatly improved after we implemented our multidomain cognitive intervention program.\n\n【33】On the other hand, the literature shows that the overall cognitive functioning recovers most rapidly in patients with mild TBI, returning to baseline within 12 weeks. Cognitive functioning slightly improves after moderate-severe TBI but remains impaired even two years after injury \\[ 11 \\]. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that our cognitive rehabilitation program was useful for recovering several cognitive functions even when our patient suffered from a severe injury, and despite our intervention was not delivered immediately after the trauma. Thus, it is highly likely that the patient's cognitive functioning at the end of the rehabilitation (15 months after TBI) was much better than if no intervention would have been provided. However, it is also possible that the delay in establishing our cognitive intervention could ameliorate its effectiveness. In other words, our patient could have obtained a more significant benefit if the rehabilitation would have been provided earlier. Future studies should compare the effectiveness of our rehabilitation program administered early and late after TBI.\n\n【34】Finally, another study limitation is that, due to our single-case design, we cannot affirm that our program is adequate and useful for other TBI groups, such as older patients. Despite these, our findings reinforce the notion that neuropsychological rehabilitation programs directed to multiple, rather than individual cognitive domains, are useful in reestablishing cognitive deficits in young patients with TBI-associated DAI.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】In conclusion, our study describes a novel cognitive rehabilitation program directed to train multiple cognitive domains together in patients with DAI. Although this program is designed to train attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning in a period of 24 weeks, the results obtained here demonstrated generalization effects to other domains, such as learning, mental flexibility, inhibition functions, and language. Thus, our study adds evidence in favor of training multiple cognitive domains together, rather than individually, in young patients with cognitive sequel after TBI-associated DAI.\n\n【37】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【38】The clinical data from the case presented here are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【39】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【40】Bt:\n\n【41】Barcelona test\n\n【42】CT:\n\n【43】Computed tomography\n\n【44】DAI:\n\n【45】Diffuse axonal injury\n\n【46】MRI:\n\n【47】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【48】Np:\n\n【49】NEUROPSI\n\n【50】PASAT:\n\n【51】Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test\n\n【52】TBI:\n\n【53】Traumatic brain injury\n\n【54】TOL DX:\n\n【55】Tower of London Drexel University version\n\n【56】WCST:\n\n【57】Wisconsin Card Sorting Test", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Their etiology may include genetic mutations, estrogen-associated changes after childbirth, and mechanical factors such as a history of abdominal surgery. However, there are cases of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors that develop in the absence of such causes. Since they are rare, diagnosis is often difficult based on clinical findings. We encountered two cases of patients with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors with a very unusual onset and contrasting features.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The first patient was a 51-year-old asian man who presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain. He was referred to our department because of a giant tumor detected on abdominal ultrasonography. Imaging revealed a 19-cm tumor with internal tumoral hemorrhage; however, no definitive diagnosis was made. Tumor resection was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The second patient was a 41-year-old asian man, and right hydronephrosis was detected on abdominal ultrasonography during a periodic medical checkup. We diagnosed invasion of the primary mesenteric tumor into the right ureter using diagnostic imaging and performed ileocecal resection with partial right ureteral resection for a definitive diagnosis and therapeutic purposes. Although the tumors of both patients had developed from the ileal mesentery, the tumors were substantially different from each other based on their imaging findings, macroscopic morphology, and progression pattern. Meanwhile, they showed similar pathological characteristics. Both consisted of bundles of collagen fibrils of spindle-shaped fibroblasts with low cell atypia. Moreover, they were diagnosed as desmoid tumors using positive immunohistochemical staining for β-catenin.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Neither patient had susceptibility factors for desmoid tumors, and to our knowledge, there have been very few reports to date of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors that were diagnosed because of acute abdominal pain caused by tumoral hemorrhage or asymptomatic obstructive uropathy. Furthermore, it is clinically interesting that the two patients showed contrasting progression patterns and imaging findings. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are rare and may present with various symptoms and findings similar to those observed in our patients. Diagnosis therefore requires experience and knowledge that is not bound by preconceptions.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Desmoid tumors, whose name is derived from the Greek _desmos_ , which means “band- or tendon-like,” are stromal tumors that develop from fibrous connective tissue and were first described in 1838 \\[ 1 \\]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines describe this type of tumor as an aggressive fibromatosis, which does not metastasize but grows locally aggressive and has a very high local recurrence rate even after complete resection \\[ 2 \\]. Their etiology is thought to be multifactorial. Moreover, it is widely known that germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( _APC_ ) gene, which cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), are associated with the development of desmoid tumors, and it has been reported that the risk of onset of desmoid tumors in FAP patients is 800 times that in a healthy person \\[ 3 \\]. In addition to the _APC_ gene, somatic mutations of the catenin beta-1 ( _CTNNB1_ ) gene are involved in the development of sporadic desmoid tumors, and it has been reported that _CTNNB1_ gene mutations are found in approximately 50–85% of cases \\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. Both genes are involved in important signal transduction pathways that play roles in regulating the cellular level of β-catenin, which acts on cell–cell junctions. Therefore, when a mutation occurs in either _APC_ or _CTNNB1_ , β-catenin accumulates in cells, forming tumors \\[ 7 \\]. It has also been reported that estrogen is involved in the development and growth of desmoid tumors; hence, they often occur in women, particularly in multiparous women. Estrogen receptors are highly expressed in a large number of desmoid tumors, and tamoxifen has recently been reported to be effective as a treatment \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. A history of trauma or surgery is also considered to be a factor in the development of desmoid tumors, and mutations in genes involved in the wound healing process of tissues are considered to be a cause of desmoid tumor development \\[ 10 \\]. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are often found mainly as abdominal distensions or bowel obstructions associated with tumor growth or invasion \\[ 11 , 12 \\]. It is often difficult to differentiate them from other mesenchymal tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and sarcomas by diagnostic imaging. Here, we report two cases of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors without any causative factors. Sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are relatively rare, and both of our cases had an unusual onset. We believe that these two cases of desmoid tumors, which showed contrasting characteristics in terms of imaging findings and progression patterns, are useful for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in clinical practice.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Case 1 involved a 51-year-old asian man who presented to the clinic with sudden left abdominal pain. Ultrasonography revealed a smooth and solid intra-abdominal mass with a maximum diameter of approximately 19 cm, which contained cystic components (Fig. 1 a). He was referred to our hospital for further examination. He had been healthy and had no history of hospitalization or abdominal surgery. A tender and mobile infant-head-sized mass in the left abdomen was detected by palpation. On enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT), the tumor appeared as a well-circumscribed mass with scattered density, which appeared to arise from the small intestine (Fig. 1 b). Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a region with a high signal on T1-weighted images (T1WI) in a segment of the tumor, suggesting intratumoral hemorrhage (Fig. 1 c). Cyst components were displayed on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) (Fig. 1 d). Small intestine endoscopy demonstrated ischemic mucosal changes 20 cm from the ileocecal valve, and gastrointestinal imaging displayed slight stenosis due to exclusion from the external intestinal wall. Based on the above findings, GIST was first considered in the differential diagnosis, and surgery was performed for therapeutic diagnosis. The tumor was in the mesentery and it involved a part of the proximal ileum, 20 cm from the terminal ileum. Therefore, a small intestinal resection was performed. The tumor measured 19 × 16.5 × 9 cm with a capsule that originated from the ileum mesentery. Moreover, cystic components and hematoma were observed on the split surface (Fig. 2 ). Histopathological findings showed that the proliferation of bland spindle-shaped cells with minimal mitotic activity caused the formation of a broad bundle of stromal fibrosis (Fig. 3 a). The tumor was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor based on positive immunohistochemical staining for β-catenin (Fig. 3 b) and negative staining for c-kit, CD34, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFRα), and Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG-1). The Ki-67 labeling index, which is an index of cell proliferation, was approximately 6% (Fig. 3 c). The surgical margin was pathologically negative, indicating complete resection of the desmoid tumor. The patient is still being followed up with CT imaging every 6 months postoperatively, and has survived for 3 years without any recurrence.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】 \n\n【14】Diagnostic findings in Case 1. **a** Abdominal ultrasonography displaying a large solid mass with cystic degeneration, and an irregular echoic pattern with vascular signals inside. **b** Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography displaying a large, well-defined circular tumor with a heterogeneous interior, which appears to be partially continuous with the small intestine. **c** Magnetic resonance imaging displaying some high-intensity signals (white arrow) on T1-weighted image. **d** Cyst components are scattered on T2-weighted image\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】 \n\n【18】Macroscopic characteristics of the tumor in Case 1.

He was referred to our hospital for urological examination. He had no history of abdominal trauma, surgery, or genetic disease. Physical examination, serum biochemistry analysis, and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy did not reveal any abnormal findings. However, drip infusion pyelography revealed narrowing of the right ureter (Fig. 4 a), and abdominal pelvic CT revealed a 3.5-cm tumor that had uniform contrast with the dilated ureter (Fig. 4 b). MRI T2WI showed a low signal mainly at the center of the tumor (Fig. 4 c). On <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), mild accumulation of FDG in the late phase was observed at the site of the tumor (Fig. 4 d). This slight increase in the overall accumulation was proven by the change in the maximum standardized uptake value in the early (3.50 seconds) to late (4.51 seconds) phase. Based on the diagnostic findings, the tumor was suspected of being a desmoid tumor, since it was a low-grade but strongly invasive tumor. Surgery was performed to establish a definite diagnosis and treatment for the patient. The 4-cm hard mass located at the ileum mesentery had grown and infiltrated its surrounding tissue. Because the dorsal side of the tumor was invading the ureter and hence could not be dissected, ileocecal resection along with a portion of the right ureter (5 cm in the major axis) was performed. Histological analysis showed that the 3.7 × 3.5 × 3.2-cm tumor (Fig. 5 ) had invaded the adventitia of the ureter. Based on pathological findings, the tumor comprised infiltrating and proliferating spindle-shaped fibroblasts with low cell atypia, characterized by a keloid-like eosinophilic collagen fiber bundle (Fig. 6 a). Immunostaining demonstrated that the tumor cells were negative for c-kit, CD34, PDGFRα, and DOG-1. However, a strong positive result for β-catenin was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 6 b). These findings led to the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. The Ki-67 labeling index was less than 1% (Fig. 6 c). The lesion was completely excised with clear margins.

Approximately 10–20% of all desmoid tumors occur in the abdominal cavity \\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\], most of which occur due to FAP, pregnancy and childbirth, or history of abdominal surgery. Therefore, sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, such as ours, are extremely rare.\n\n【41】In our first patient, sudden left abdominal pain led us to the diagnosis. MRI revealed an intratumoral hemorrhage, suggesting that the abdominal pain was due to the rapid tumor capsule extension. To date, there has been only one reported case of a desmoid tumor that was discovered due to intratumoral hemorrhage \\[ 16 \\]. In our second patient, right hydronephrosis was detected using abdominal ultrasonography. There are relatively many reports of desmoid tumors that cause ureteral obstruction. However, most of these are found in advanced cases at the time of diagnosis \\[ 17 \\]. As seen in our second patient, the tumor arose near the right ureter on the proximal side of the ileum mesentery. This caused the right hydronephrosis when the tumor was still small.\n\n【42】Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is a non-organ-specific mesenchymal tumor that can occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity. Therefore, it is necessary to differentiate it from GIST, sarcoma, lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, and so on. However, preoperative histological diagnosis is often difficult because, unlike cancer, desmoid tumors do not originate from the epithelium, making it difficult to perform biopsies using endoscopes. Needle biopsy is sometimes used, but desmoid tumors consisting of fibrous connective tissue are often difficult to collect in sufficient quantities \\[ 12 \\]. In addition, it is not useful because of the difficulty and the possibility of dissemination. In our cases, we did not perform needle biopsy because we suspected GIST in our first case and were concerned about the possibility of dissemination. Moreover, it was difficult to perform the procedure in our second case.\n\n【43】Regarding the diagnostic imaging of desmoid tumors, Huss _et al_ . reported that the preoperative accuracy of detecting intra-abdominal desmoid was approximately 40%, and that it was difficult to discriminate it from GISTs. The differences between desmoid tumors and GISTs in diagnostic imaging include their site of occurrence, shape, contrast effects, and tumor content. GISTs originate from the gastrointestinal tract and are characterized mainly as well-defined circular or lobulated tumors with a heterogeneous contrast effect, sometimes with necrotic vessels and cysts inside. On the other hand, desmoid tumors, originating from outside the gastrointestinal tract, often have a morphologically invasive form, relatively uniform contrast effects, and rarely have necrosis or cysts inside \\[ 18 \\]. In the imaging analyses of our first patient, the tumor had a well-defined circular shape. The inside of the tumor was heterogeneous on imaging, accompanied by necrosis and cyst formation, which were very different from the previously reported imaging characteristics of desmoid tumors and were characteristic findings of GISTs. In contrast, in our second patient, the mesenteric tumor had a uniform contrast effect, an irregular rim shape, and invasive growth, which was consistent with the characteristics of desmoid tumors. Hauli _et al_ . reported the correlation between CT features and the Ki-67 index in GISTs \\[ 19 \\]. According to their report, the mean tumor size was significantly greater in the group with Ki-67 > 5% than in the group with Ki-67 ≤ 5%, and features of necrosis or cystic degeneration were often observed in the group with Ki-67 index > 5%. It seems that the same reasoning can be applied to the desmoid tumor in our first patient. In the first patient, the Ki-67 index was 6%, which is much higher than the 1% in the second patient. That is, in the first patient, it can be inferred that necrosis inside the tumor occurred due to rapid tumor growth. In our second patient, FDG-PET was performed to rule out other primary lesions. It also displayed slight FDG accumulation in the main lesion, indicating no sign of malignancy. FDG accumulation is generally low in desmoid tumors \\[ 20 \\] because it reflects tumor burden and cell proliferation, and hence is useful in differentiating different types of malignancies. Based on the above findings, our first patient was initially diagnosed with GIST, while our second patient was suspected of having a desmoid tumor.\n\n【44】The treatment options for desmoid tumors are diverse. We performed surgery in both patients since it was determined that surgical resection was necessary and possible. In our first patient, we diagnosed GIST preoperatively, so we tried to perform complete resection and protective operation to avoid the possibility of recurrence and dissemination. In our second patient, we planned a combined ureteral resection preoperatively, assuming that it would be difficult to resect the tumor from the ureter. The NCCN guidelines suggest that careful observation of histologically confirmed desmoid tumors is a treatment option only for slow-growing cases without functional restriction. Fiore _et al_ . reported that half of the cases of “wait and see” were free of recurrence for 5 years \\[ 21 \\] However, there are no precise treatment guidelines specific to intra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Surgery may be the first choice for patients with rapidly growing tumors or those at risk of losing organ function due to tumor invasion of other organs. As in our second patient, intra-abdominal desmoids with obstructive uropathy often require ureteral resection. If desmoid tumors are suspected before surgery, a treatment strategy that includes ureteral resection is necessary \\[ 22 \\]. Additionally, the NCCN guidelines state that if surgical resection significantly impairs function or if the tumor is difficult to resect, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal therapy, and systemic therapy based mainly on chemotherapy and molecular-targeted agents should be used. Radiation therapy may also be indicated if remnants are suspected after resection. However, radiation therapy for intra-abdominal desmoids carries the risk of radiation enteritis, and hence is not recommended by the NCCN guidelines. Even though complete surgical resection was achieved in our patients, the above-stated systemic therapies should have been considered if macroscopic residuals were suspected. However, it should be noted that treatments other than surgical resection for desmoid tumors have not been established and are still in the experimental stage.\n\n【45】Macroscopically, the appearance of the tumors was completely different between our two patients. In our first patient, the tumor grew expansively and showed necrosis, cysts, and hematoma, which are rare in desmoid tumors. In contrast, in our second patient, the tumor was hard like a stone and showed highly invasive growth. On the other hand, histologically, both tumors showed similar characteristics. Desmoid tumors are characterized by the ordered arrangement of spindle-shaped fibroblasts with low cell atypia and mitosis, and more abundant collagen fibrils than GISTs, which are also mesenchymal tumors \\[ 23 \\]. Positive immunostaining for β-catenin contributed in the diagnosis of desmoid tumors \\[ 24 \\], and negative immunostaining for c-kit, CD34, PDGFRα, and DOG-1 contributed in clearly distinguishing them from GISTs. The tumors from our patients had all of the mentioned characteristics. Ki-67, an indicator included in the diagnostic criteria, is a risk factor for malignancy and recurrence in GISTs as well as other neoplastic diseases, which suggests that the tumor in our first patient had higher malignancy than that in our second patient. However, Ki-67 is not well documented as a prognostic or risk factor for recurrence in desmoid tumors \\[ 25 , 26 \\]. This is thought to be because desmoid tumors do not have metastatic potential, even when cell proliferation is rapid. Complete resection without pathological remnants is considered important to achieve a low risk of recurrence and a favorable prognosis \\[ 27 , 28 \\]. Thus, complete resection was performed in both patients.\n\n【46】There is still no clear guideline for postoperative surveillance of desmoid tumors. Regarding the recurrence of desmoid tumors, it has been reported that the number of patients with FAP is significantly higher than that of patients with sporadic desmoids. It was also found that more than 80% of them occurred in the intra-abdominal cavity after colon surgery. This is because the tumor diameter tends to be large in FAP-related recurrence, making complete resection difficult to achieve. He _et al_ . reported that incomplete resection (marginal status R1 or close to R1), large tumor diameters, tumors in the extremities, and younger age at onset are risk factors for recurrence \\[ 28 \\]. In our first patient, the tumor size was very large, which is considered a risk factor for recurrence. Currently, we are conducting surveillance using CT images every 6 months. Even if the desmoid tumors were completely resected, the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate is very low (14), so careful follow-up will be necessary in the future.\n\n【47】We encountered two patients with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors with unusual onset. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors can cause various symptoms and conditions depending on the site of occurrence. Moreover, radiographic study findings are also diverse, which makes diagnosis difficult. Therefore, diagnosis may require knowledge and experience that is not limited by preconceptions. In our patients, complete resection was possible. However, the local recurrence rate is extremely high, so careful follow-up is required.\n\n【48】Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------\n\n【49】Not applicable.\n\n【50】Abbreviations\n-------------\n\n【51】GIST:\n\n【52】Gastrointestinal stromal tumors\n\n【53】CT:\n\n【54】Computed tomography\n\n【55】NCCN:\n\n【56】National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\n【57】MRI:\n\n【58】Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【59】FAP:\n\n【60】Familial adenomatous polyposis\n\n【61】T1WI:\n\n【62】T1-weighted image\n\n【63】FDG-PET:\n\n【64】<sup>18 </sup> F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\n\n【65】APC:\n\n【66】Adenomatous polyposis coli\n\n【67】HE:\n\n【68】Hematoxylin and eosin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

At presentation, her visual acuity was light perception. Slit-lamp examination showed diffuse corneal epithelial defects, stromal edema, and localized Descemet’s folds. Despite administration of topical and systemic steroids, she developed symblepharon after 3 months as well as superficial and deep corneal neovascularization with visual acuity 0.5 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution. A subconjunctival bevacizumab injection (dose 1.25mg/0.05ml) was administered. After 1 week, the vessels appeared thinner and corneal opacity was clearer. Her visual acuity improved to 0.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution. Three weeks later her visual acuity had not changed, and the vessels had started to perfuse again. A second subconjunctival bevacizumab injection was given. After 2 weeks, her vision had improved to 0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, vessel regression was observed, and corneal opacity was significantly reduced. Three months after the second injection her vision was unchanged, and the neovascularization remained stable. During the next months, the patient’s condition was well-controlled, and, at the end of follow-up 24 months later, her visual acuity and clinical condition were unaltered.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Subconjunctival bevacizumab injection may be considered as a second-line treatment of corneal neovascularization caused by chemical injury that is unresponsive to conventional steroid therapy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Ocular chemical and thermal burns are a devastating cause of corneal blindness characterized by limbal stem cell deficiency, stromal opacification, ocular surface keratinization, corneal and/or conjunctival or ocular surface neovascularization, and high corneal graft failure rates. Persistent corneal epithelial defects may lead to tissue thinning or melting, perforation, and secondary infections. The deepithelialized conjunctival surfaces tend to fuse and form symblepharon bands. The severity of the injury depends on the type of offending agent, its concentration, the duration of exposure, and the extent of contact \\[ 1 \\]. Conventional medical therapies include steroids, ascorbate, citrates, tetracyclines, lubricants, and surgical procedures such as the application of a contact lens and amniotic membrane transplantation \\[ 2 \\]. Recently, the use of subconjunctival bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been proposed \\[ 3 – 5 \\]. A recent case report described the use of bevacizumab in a child with Stevens-Johnson syndrome \\[ 3 \\].\n\n【10】We report the case of a patient with ocular chemical injury, symblepharon, and corneal neovascularization in whom subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab caused regression of corneal opacification and neovascularization with resulting visual improvement.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】In this report, we describe a retrospective, interventional case of a 54-year-old Caucasian woman who presented at our eye emergency department following a splash injury of the left eye with sodium hydroxide. This report was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the University of Rome “La Sapienza.”\n\n【13】At the first examination, her visual acuity (VA) was light perception in the left eye. Her eyelids and conjunctiva were congested. A slit-lamp examination showed a diffuse corneal epithelial defect, stromal edema, and localized Descemet’s folds. She was treated with 1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate drops six times daily, 1% atropine drops three times daily, and tobramycin six times daily. The corticosteroid prednisone 50mg was administered daily for the first 10 days, then the daily dose was gradually tapered by 5mg every 15 days. Three months later, despite the frequent use of topical steroids a symblepharon with superficial and deep corneal neovascularization was observed (Figure 1 ). The patient’s VA was 0.5 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). We suggested administering a subconjunctival bevacizumab injection in the left eye with the aim of reducing corneal neovascularization. Written, informed consent was obtained from the patient after explaining the off-label use of bevacizumab on the basis of two case reports \\[ 3 , 4 \\]. A subconjunctival injection of 0.05ml (1.25mg) of sterile, undiluted, commercially available bevacizumab (Avastin®; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) was administered with topical anesthesia in the subconjunctival space close to the corneal limbus and adjacent to the pathological blood vessels. After the procedure, the patient was advised to use 0.3% ofloxacin and 1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate drops three times daily for one week. One week after the subconjunctival bevacizumab injection, the vessels appeared thinner and the corneal opacity was clearer. The patient’s VA improved to 0.3LogMAR after one week. Three weeks later her VA had not changed, and the vessels started to perfuse again. A second subconjunctival bevacizumab injection was then given. Two weeks after the second injection her VA improved to 0.1LogMAR and corneal neovascularization was significantly reduced. Notably, three months later her vision was unchanged and the neovascularization remained stable (Figure 2 ). During the next months, the patient’s condition was well-controlled, and, at the end of follow-up 24 months later, her VA and clinical condition were unaltered.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】 \n\n【16】**Pre-injection examination revealed symblepharon and corneal opacity in the inferior sector with superficial and deep corneal neovascularization (arrows).**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】 \n\n【20】**Examination 3 months after the second injection of bevacizumab (dose 1.25mg/0.05ml) revealed inferior scarring and significant reduction of corneal new vessels in number and size (arrows).**\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】The off-label use of bevacizumab in patients with ophthalmic diseases involving neovascularization as the primary or secondary pathology has improved the management of several diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. Ocular surface neovascularization is a prominent feature of ocular chemical injury that causes visual loss as a result of associated scarring and lipid deposition. Conventional medical therapies include steroids, ascorbate, citrates, tetracyclines, lubricants, and surgical procedures such as application of a contact lens and amniotic membrane transplantation \\[ 2 \\]. Our data indicate that, when conventional approaches fail, treatment with subconjunctival bevacizumab may be effective \\[ 3 – 5 \\]. By giving two subconjunctival bevacizumab injections, we obtained a dramatic improvement of VA, and this effect was magnified by the anti-VEGF treatment that led to a significant reduction of corneal neovascularization. A causal role of the VEGF in promoting ocular surface neovascularization was thus confirmed \\[ 6 \\].\n\n【24】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【25】To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first case reports describing the long-term results of subconjunctival bevacizumab treatment in corneal neovascularization secondary to ocular chemical injury. Subconjunctival bevacizumab injection may be considered as an optional treatment in patients who do not respond to conventional steroid therapy. Future studies will explore this therapy toward a feasible standardization.\n\n【26】Consent\n-------\n\n【27】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.
