We present a unique case of optic neuropathy secondary to hypertrophic pachymeningitis with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, which was suspected to be antithyroid drug related.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 79-year-old Japanese male presented with acute visual loss in the left eye. He had a 24-year history of Graves’ disease and was taking methimazole. Best-corrected visual acuity was 0.8 in the right eye and light perception in the left eye, and relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye was seen. Ocular movement was normal, and there were no findings explaining visual loss in intermediate optic media and fundus in the left eye. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated thickened dura mater. Tests for myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, proteinuria, and hematuria were positive; pulmonary nodule lesions and a blood clot in the left lower leg were also found. After excluding the presence of diseases that could lead to hypertrophic pachymeningitis, we diagnosed optic neuropathy due to hypertrophic pachymeningitis with granulomatosis with polyangiitis—a subtype of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Since he had history of using methimazole, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis was considered as drug related. We started high-dosage steroid pulse therapy followed by 1 mg/kg body weight daily of oral prednisolone, and subsequently tapered. Methimazole was stopped. Best-corrected visual acuity recovered to 0.9, 2 weeks after starting treatment. Though myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody remained negative, the symptom relapsed 6 months after treatment initiation. We gave a second high-dose steroid pulse therapy followed by prednisolone tapered together with methotrexate. Remission remained, and using 4 mg/week methotrexate without prednisolone, myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was kept within the normal limit until now, 4 years after onset.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We present a case of optic neuropathy with hypertrophic pachymeningitis related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, which was suspected to be drug related. The patient had good visual recovery after quitting the drug and receiving immunosuppressive therapy with systemic steroids. Hypertrophic pachymeningitis with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis related to antithyroid drugs should be considered as a differential diagnosis for optic neuropathy in Graves’ patients in whom optic nerve compression is not obvious.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】In patients with Graves’ disease and concurrent optic neuropathy, dysthyroid optic neuropathy caused by either optic nerve compression or stretching is often at the top of the list of differential diagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, other causes of optic neuropathy, such as immunosuppressive drugs, radiation, infections, and inflammation, need to be ruled out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis) is characterized by inflammation of small to medium blood vessels, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a subtype of ANCA-associated vasculitis, is one of the causes of inflammatory optic neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, antithyroid drugs \\[propylthiouracil and methimazole (MMI)\\] are the most frequent causes of drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Positive myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) is reported in 4.1–64% of patients given antithyroid drugs, with many of them being asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is an inflammatory disease characterized by thickening of the dura mater, and can develop in association with ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. ANCA-related HP is the most common form of HP, representing as many as 34.0% of all HP cases in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】There have been few reported cases of optic neuropathy due to HP caused by ANCA-associated vasculitis, suspected to be drug related 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. We present an optic neuropathy caused by HP with ANCA-associated vasculitis in a patient with Graves’ disease, where the patient had a good visual outcome after stopping antithyroid drug use and undergoing immunosuppression therapy.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 79-year-old Japanese man with acute vision loss in the left eye was referred to us in February 2015. He had a 24-year history of Graves’ disease and was taking MMI (starting dose of 30 mg/day in 1991, which was gradually reduced to 5 mg/alternate day by the time of his first visit) and levothyroxine (25 µg/day since 2013). He also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary emphysema. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.8 in the right eye and light perception in the left eye, and he had a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Extraocular muscle movements were normal, and exophthalmometer (Hertel) measurements were 20 mm bilaterally. There were no findings indicative of vision loss in the intermediate optic media or fundus of the left eye 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Although his thyroid-stimulating hormone level was low \\[0.11 µIU/mL (reference value: 0.50–5.00 µIU/mL)\\], his thyroid function was almost normal \\[free T3: 2.55 pg/mL (2.3–4.0 pg/mL), free T4: 1.73 ng/dL (0.9–1.7 ng/dL)\\]. Although plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated mild enlargement of the extraocular muscles in both eyes, there was no compression or stretching of the optic nerve, which would have been suspicious of thyroid optic neuropathy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 A)</u>. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed the left ethmoid sinus to be filled with soft tissue and destruction of the upper ethmoid sinus wall, which included the anterior cranial base 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 B)</u>. A contrast-enhanced MRI revealed thickened mucous membranes in the left ethmoid sinus, enhanced dura from the left orbital apex to the anterior cranial base, and a mild enhancement of the optic nerve surrounded by enhancement at the orbital apex 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 C, D)</u>. We suspected optic neuropathy due to HP and infectious rhinogenic optic neuropathy due to infectious sinusitis. Inflammatory markers were high based on the laboratory data: white blood cells 8680/µL (3500–8500/µL) with 76.1% neutrophils (40–70%); C-reactive protein (CRP) 2.40 mg/dL (≤ 0.3 mg/dL); erythrocyte sedimentation rate 31 mm/hour (≤ 10 mm/hour) and 53 mm/2 hours (≤ 25 mm/2 hours); however, markers related to infection did not show a remarkable change \\[procalcitonin: 0.07 ng/mL (≤ 0.49 ng/mL), β- d \\-glucan: < 6.0 pg/mL (0–10.9 pg/mL)\\]. We performed further examinations for suspected HP, and MPO-ANCA was 19.5 U/mL (< 3.5 U/mL), proteinase 3-ANCA was <1.0 U/mL (< 3.5 U/mL), and IgG-4 was 42.1 mg/dL (4.8–105 mg/dL). A whole-body CT scan showed no malignancy, but pulmonary nodule lesions and a blood clot in the left lower leg were detected. Proteinuria and hematuria were both positive, and he had bloody nasal discharge. We consulted rheumatologists and pulmonologists, who indicated that the findings were consistent with ANCA-associated vasculitis. After ruling out diseases that could lead to HP, such as syphilis, aspergillosis, and tuberculosis. Serological tests and interferon gamma release assays established a diagnosis of optic neuropathy secondary to HP with ANCA-associated vasculitis. The clinical findings met the diagnostic criteria for GPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u> involving the upper respiratory tract, respiratory organs, and kidneys. We diagnosed optic neuropathy due to HP secondary to GPA. High-dose steroid pulse therapy (1000 mg of daily methylprednisolone for 3 days) was initiated, followed by 50 mg (1 mg/kg body weight) of daily oral prednisolone (PSL), which was subsequently tapered. MMI was discontinued, since ANCA-associated vasculitis could be induced by antithyroid drugs. Six days into treatment, the patient’s BCVA recovered to 0.03. Nine days into treatment, Goldmann perimetry (GP) showed a central scotoma in the left eye 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 A)</u>. Visual recovery was insufficient, so an endoscopic sinus biopsy was done on the same day to rule out malignancy and confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of the posterior ethmoid sinus mucosa and nasal septal mucosa showed severe infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells, including neutrophils. There were no findings indicative of malignancy. While perivascular hyperplasia of connective tissue was observed, no apparent vasculitis or granuloma was seen. The BCVA of the left eye recovered to 0.5 within 3 weeks after the start of the treatment, and a contrast-enhanced MRI revealed rapid regression of enhanced dura from the left orbital apex to the anterior cranial base and enhancement of the optic nerve became unclear, however, enhancement surrounding the optic nerve remained 通用删除1(英):<u>(Additional file 1 : Figs. A and B)</u>. The BCVA of the left eye recovered to 0.9 within 6 weeks after the start of treatment, and the central scotoma resolved 7 weeks following surgery 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 B)</u>. Thyroid function was stable despite discontinuation of MMI.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Fundus photograph of the left eye at the first visit. There were no findings that demonstrated that the best-corrected visual acuity of this eye was “light perception” in the fundus.

A central scotoma is seen at 6 days after administering systemic steroids ( **A** ). The central scotoma disappeared in the 9 weeks after starting systemic steroids ( **B** ). Scotomas are seen when optic neuropathy relapse occurred at 6 months after starting treatment ( **C** )\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Six months after starting the treatment, when PSL was tapered to 15 mg, the patients BCVA decreased and GP revealed scotomas in the left eye 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 C)</u>. A contrast-enhanced MRI, taken for follow-up 1 week before the patient realized his vision had deteriorated, showed thickened enhanced dura from the left orbital apex to the anterior cranial base, and the optic nerve surrounded by enhancement at the orbital apex 通用删除1(英):<u>(Additional file 1 : Figs. C and D)</u>. Furthermore, mild enhancement of the optic nerve appeared to recur 通用删除1(英):<u>(Additional file 1 : Figs. A and B)</u>. There was no remarkable change in laboratory findings, including MPO-ANCA and CRP levels. We started a second round of high-dose steroid pulse therapy (1000 mg of daily methylprednisolone for 3 days), followed by a PSL taper. We added 4 mg/week of methotrexate (MTX) to the PSL taper and discontinued it after 3.5 years. He had no relapse after the addition of MTX, and MPO-ANCA levels were within normal limits until 4 years after onset. Three months after his 4-year follow-up, he died from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to pulmonary emphysema.\n\n【23】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【24】We herein report a case of optic neuropathy secondary to HP with ANCA-associated vasculitis, which was suspected to be related to MMI. The patient had good visual recovery after immunosuppression therapy and MMI discontinuation. Low-dose MTX was effective to keep the patient in remission.\n\n【25】Although we first suspected thyroid optic neuropathy, suspicious findings of thyroid optic neuropathy were not seen, and the presence of thickened dura from the left orbital apex to the anterior cranial base with the coronal section of a contrast-enhanced MRI pointed to optic neuropathy due to HP. Though cerebrospinal fluid examination could have ruled out infection, the risks outweighed the benefits of the procedure. Since HP and sinusitis could be associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and other causes of HP were ruled out, we diagnosed the current case as optic neuropathy due to ANCA-related HP. More than 80% of MPO-ANCA-positive HP patients were reported to have GPA, an ANCA-associated vasculitis subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. An orbital tissue biopsy when the patient first presented, could have confirmed the diagnosis histologically. However, we started steroid pulse therapy immediately, on a priority basis, after diagnosing optic neuropathy due to noninfectious HP, and could not confirm our diagnosis histologically. Nevertheless, it was possible to diagnose the present case as GPA according to the stepwise algorithm of Watt _et al._ , which was composed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 , 23 \\]</u> and the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definition of vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> to classify ANCA-associated vasculitis and polyarteritis nodosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Even though the histological finding could not be shown, three of the four criteria (nasal inflammation with bloody nasal discharge, abnormal chest radiograph showing nodules, and hematuria) were present in the current case, indicating GPA. Furthermore, the current case also matched the GPA diagnostic criteria from the study group of systemic vascular disorders in Japan; GPA could be diagnosed using the clinical findings of more than three major organs (upper respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, and vessels) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】ANCA-associated vasculitis can be induced by antithyroid drugs, even after several years of use and at low doses. MPO-ANCA is a marker of antithyroid drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 25 \\]</u>. In this case, MMI was taken for 24 years at an initial daily dose of 30 mg; this was gradually reduced to 5 mg/alternate day by the time he presented for examination at our clinic. Noh _et al._ reported that ANCA-associated vasculitis secondary to antithyroid drugs involved single or multiple organs, such as the kidneys, respiratory organs, skin, joints, eyes, muscles, brain, and nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In the current case, the respiratory organs, brain, kidneys, and nerves were involved. Although it is difficult to identify whether the ANCA-associated vasculitis is drug-induced, the possibility must be kept in mind to make a decision about the discontinuation of the drug usage.\n\n【27】We suspected that ANCA-associated vasculitis was antithyroid drug related, and that prognosis could be improved by discontinuation of the drug. Thus, we administered only steroids for immunosuppression and planned to taper the PSL. The following mechanisms of optic nerve damage have been hypothesized: vasculitic infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>, nonvasculitic optic nerve inflammation, or spread of inflammation from the adjacent sinuses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. Moreover, some GPA-related isolated neuropathy cases were suspected to be caused by granulomatous optic neuropathy located within the optic nerve sheath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. As MRI showed mild enhancement of the optic nerve and good visual recovery after treatment in the current case, we considered spread of inflammation and compression due to thickened dura by HP were the main cause.\n\n【28】Upon recurrence of optic neuropathy, we added low-dose MTX to the PSL taper, which proved to be effective against future relapse. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) has also been used as induction therapy for ANCA-associated vasculitis, but a previous clinical trial demonstrated that the efficacy of MTX and CYP were equivalent with regard to the remission rates in patients with early ANCA-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. As MTX has lower toxicity than CYP in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>, we selected MTX in this treatment regimen.\n\n【29】While an ANCA titer was previously reported to be a predictable factor for ANCA-associated vasculitis relapse with renal involvement, but not without renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>, another MPO-ANCA-positive HP case report found that disease activity was related to the MPO-ANCA titer during long-term follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Here, the MPO-ANCA titer was within normal limits at the time of recurrence. An ANCA titer can sometimes predict relapse, but it is not always related to disease activity. Thus, laboratory results and symptoms of ANCA-associated vasculitis-involved organs must be carefully monitored to keep the vasculitis in remission.\n\n【30】In conclusion, HP secondary to ANCA-associated vasculitis, suspected to be antithyroid drug related, needs to be considered in patients with Graves’ disease when optic neuropathy is present but optic nerve compression by extraocular muscles is not obvious. A good visual prognosis can be achieved by discontinuing antithyroid drugs and initiating immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data used in the case report are available on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACR:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The American College of Rheumatology</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ANCA:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BCVA:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Best-corrected visual acuity</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CRP:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>C-reactive protein</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GP:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Goldmann perimetry</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GPA:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HP:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hypertrophic pachymeningitis</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MMI:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Methimazole</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MPO:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Myeloperoxidase</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MTX:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Methotrexate</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PSL:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prednisolone</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, if bleeding unfortunately occurs, the risks and benefits of anticoagulation present a challenge. Management of one hemorrhagic complication, retroperitoneal hematoma, is rare, difficult, and controversial.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 73-year-old white man presented with left lower extremity swelling and dyspnea. He was tachycardic, hypertensive, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on ambient air. A computed tomography angiogram revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion. He was eventually transitioned to enoxaparin. On the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below his hip. A computed tomography of his head was not concerning for stroke, and neurology was consulted. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left psoas hematoma. A computed tomography scan of his pelvis also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. He was transitioned to a low intensity heparin infusion. The following day his left leg exhibited similar symptoms. There was concern of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not drained. Interventional radiology was consulted for drainage. The heparin infusion was paused, drainage was performed, and the heparin infusion was reinitiated 6 hours following the procedure by interventional radiology. His blood counts and neurologic examination stabilized and eventually improved. He was discharged home on a novel anticoagulant.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Management of a retroperitoneal hematoma can commence with recognition of the warning signs of bleeding and neurological impairment, and consulting the appropriate services in case the need for intervention arises. A conservative approach of volume resuscitation and blood transfusion can be used initially, with the need for pausing or reversing anticoagulation being assessed on an individual basis with expert consultation. If intervention becomes necessary, other interventional radiology-based modalities can be used to identify and stop the bleeding source, and interventional radiology-guided drainage can be performed to decrease the hematoma burden and relieve neurological symptoms.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The management of retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of critical anticoagulation is rare, difficult, and controversial. There exists the need to strike a delicate balance. Management can commence with early recognition of the warning signs of occult bleeding and neurological impairment, and consulting the appropriate services in case an imminent need for intervention arises. A conservative approach of volume resuscitation and blood transfusion can be used initially, with the need for pausing or reversing anticoagulation being assessed on a case-by-case basis with expert consultation. If intervention becomes necessary, modalities such as transarterial embolization (TAE) can be used to identify and stop the bleeding source, and interventional radiology (IR)-guided drainage can be performed to decrease the hematoma burden and relieve neurological symptoms. Finally, as with all clinically complex cases, patient awareness and informed consent play a major role in how the plan is implemented. We describe a case in which a patient was admitted to our hospital after sustaining a saddle pulmonary embolus (PE), received appropriate anticoagulation, and subsequently developed bilateral retroperitoneal hematomas as a complication of therapy. This case highlights an unexpected complication of a commonly treated condition, as retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of anticoagulation are rarely reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition, our publication review yielded very few case reports in which retroperitoneal hematomas occurred as a complication of pulmonary embolism treatment specifically.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 73-year-old white man presented to our emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower extremity swelling and acute-onset shortness of breath. On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Computed tomography showing the saddle pulmonary embolus\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.\n\n【16】### Clinical findings\n\n【17】On the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.\n\n【18】### Diagnostic assessment\n\n【19】An emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】Magnetic resonance imaging showing the left psoas hematoma\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Throughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.\n\n【24】### Therapeutic intervention\n\n【25】After speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient’s right flank 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The left psoas hematoma was not found to be amenable to drainage.\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】Computed tomography showing interventional radiology-guided drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】### Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【30】Our patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved to 3/5 bilaterally, and knee flexion and extension improved to 4/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed. His recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions totaling 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Other sources of potential bleeding were evaluated and not found. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u> showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and our patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days. His hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. During this time, he worked with physical therapy, who recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility where his strength began to improve somewhat. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology. On hospital day 18, he was safely discharged.\n\n【31】**Fig. 4**\n\n【32】Repeat abdomen and pelvis computed tomography performed on hospital day 10.

Parenteral anticoagulation should be given to patients with confirmed acute PE. The risk of major bleeding with anticoagulation therapy is less than 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Bleeding is classified as “major” if it is intracranial, retroperitoneal, leads to hospitalization, the need for blood transfusion, or death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In terms of retroperitoneal hematomas, the occurrence rate approaches 0.5–1% in patients on systemic anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>, with retroperitoneal bleeds almost exclusively seen in states of anticoagulation, coagulopathies, and hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In general, risk factors for bleeding are: age > 65 years, previous bleeding, thrombocytopenia, antiplatelet therapy, poor anticoagulant control, recent surgery, frequent falls, reduced functional capacity, previous stroke, diabetes, anemia, cancer, renal failure, liver failure, and alcohol abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In transitioning from unfractionated heparin to low molecular weight heparin, the major bleeding risk appears to decrease from 2% to 1.2%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient’s risk factors included his age, recent administration of tPA, and ongoing anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin due to his PE.\n\n【36】Patients with retroperitoneal hemorrhage can present in a variety of ways. One third of patients will present with Lenk’s triad: severe flank pain, hemodynamic shock, and palpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The remainder of patients can have symptoms consisting of: nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, intestinal obstruction, hypovolemia, anemia, limb swelling, paresthesia, femoral nerve compression causing paralysis of a lower limb, muscle weakness, reduced knee or thigh reflex, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and/or abdominal compartment syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. It is therefore important to be aware of these potential complications when starting patients on anticoagulation. Proposed mechanisms that may precipitate retroperitoneal hemorrhage are: forceful muscle strain, diffuse small vessel arteriosclerosis, heparin-induced immune microangiopathy, and unrecognized minor trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Treatment of spontaneous retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of anticoagulation is difficult. There is lack of Level I evidence for the best management plans, with most evidence based on case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Upon review of selected case reports, there always exists the risk of stopping anticoagulation versus continued bleeding. The general pattern found in the case reports initially begins conservatively, with increasing invasiveness as chronicity and severity increases. In addition, CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed in order to document the type, site, and extent of the suspected hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In a case report by Gurbuz _et al._ , a 41-year-old patient developed femoral nerve palsy due to a retroperitoneal hematoma caused by recent addition of aspirin to his already existing warfarin therapy for a mitral valve prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. His international normalized ratio (INR) was supratherapeutic at 4.1. He was successfully treated by reversing warfarin with 10 mg of vitamin K and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), along with right leg elevation above his heart. His neurologic function recovered and the hematoma remained stable, gradually reabsorbing by 3-week follow-up. Our case differs from theirs as the bleed appears to have been caused by a supratherapeutic INR as well as addition of an antiplatelet medication.\n\n【38】Another modality which could have been considered in our case was the use of TAE in order to target and stop the bleeding source. A case report by Wada _et al._ described bilateral iliopsoas hematomas that developed in an 85-year-old patient undergoing anticoagulation for transient ischemic attack (TIA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Her symptoms consisted of: pain, weakness, and decreased sensation in the groin bilaterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. She underwent aortography and, although no contrast extravasation was seen, underwent TAE in the third and fourth lumbar artery trunk due to the suspected origin at that location. Her symptoms progressively improved by the third week. In another case, Won _et al._ employed both TAE as well as surgical decompression of a spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma in a 48-year-old woman undergoing warfarin and aspirin anticoagulation for an artificial aortic valve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. She presented with hemodynamic instability and an INR of 4.6. Angiography showed right internal iliac artery extravasation, which was embolized with TAE. However, her neurologic symptoms continued to worsen with the development of anuria and abdominal compartment syndrome that necessitated exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【39】Other therapeutic options for our patient included a TAE before the IR-guided drainage in order to stop the bleeding source. This would have reassured us that a repeat bleed would be less likely to occur. However, while TAE may stop the source of the bleed, it does not reduce the hematoma burden on the nerves and, therefore, would not have reversed the neuropathy. In addition, our patient had already developed an acute kidney injury (AKI) and did have a history of kidney transplant in 2006. A contrasted study at that point in time would not have been advisable. There is also the risk of failing to identify the bleed source even with angiography, as was seen in the case presented by Wada _et al. \\[_ 9 _\\]._\n\n【40】In all reported cases where intervention was necessary, anticoagulation was either discontinued or reversed, introducing the risk of thrombosis. However, none of the cases mentioned thrombosis as a complication of their treatment. With our patient, we did not feel comfortable reversing or discontinuing the anticoagulation as, in our case, the patient was recovering from an acute thrombotic event. It would be difficult to predict the risk of hematoma recurrence after drainage, as retroperitoneal hematomas are rare. However, it is logical that, if the source of bleeding were contained with a procedure such as TAE, the risk of rebleeding would be decreased.\n\n【41】The management of retroperitoneal hematomas in the setting of critical anticoagulation is rare, difficult, and controversial. There exists the need to strike a delicate balance. Management can commence with early recognition of the warning signs of occult bleeding and neurological impairment, and consulting the appropriate services in case an imminent need for intervention arises. A conservative approach of volume resuscitation and blood transfusion can be used initially, with the need for pausing or reversing anticoagulation being assessed on a case-by-case basis with expert consultation. If intervention becomes necessary, modalities such as TAE can be used to identify and stop the bleeding source, and IR-guided drainage can be performed to decrease the hematoma burden and relieve neurological symptoms. Finally, as with all clinically complex cases, patient awareness and informed consent play a major role in how the plan is implemented.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【43】1.  1)\n\n【44】    Patients with confirmed PE should be given parenteral anticoagulation, with the risk of major bleeding being less than 3%. There are several risk factors that predispose patients to bleeding.\n\n【45】2.  2)\n\n【46】    Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma is a rare clinical entity seen almost exclusively during anticoagulation, coagulopathies, or dialysis. Early recognition of signs of bleeding is important and advised in the management of patients in this population because it is a serious and potentially lethal complication.\n\n【47】3.  3)\n\n【48】    Intervention has generally consisted of conservative measures first, then progressing to more invasive modalities as the chronicity or severity of the patient’s condition manifests itself. The need for continuing anticoagulation should be reassessed, and risks and benefits should be explained to the patient before proceeding with any plan of action.\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AKI:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute kidney injury</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPAP:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Continuous positive airway pressure</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CTA:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography angiogram</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DVT:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Deep vein thrombosis</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FFP:</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fresh frozen plasma</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ICU:</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intensive care unit</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>INR:</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>International normalized ratio</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IR:</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Interventional radiology</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IVC:</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Inferior vena cava</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance Imaging</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PE:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pulmonary embolus</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRBC:</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Packed red blood cells</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TAE:</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transarterial embolization</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TIA:</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transient ischemic attack</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>tPA:</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Tissue plasminogen activator</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Conservative medical approaches encompass oral, topical, and physical treatment. Only two cases of patients with Peyronie’s disease with complete plaque regression after treatment have been described in literature.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】_Case 1_ : A 50-year-old Caucasian man with penile pain and double penile curvature of 5° (left ventrolateral), palpable nodule, and normal penile rigidity. The patient underwent multimodal therapy (oral antioxidants + topical diclofenac gel). At follow-up after over 4 years of treatment, the patient no longer complained of any penile deformity or pain. Ultrasound examination did not show any plaque. _Case 2_ : A 26-year-old Caucasian man with lateral-right penile curvature of 30° (previous congenital curvature of 15°), palpable nodule, and normal penile rigidity. The patient underwent multimodal therapy (oral antioxidants + topical diclofenac gel + penile injections/pentoxifylline). After 28 months of treatment, the patient presented a lateral right curve of 15° at follow-up, similar to the original congenital penile curvature. Ultrasound examination no longer showed any plaque. _Case 3_ : A 36-year-old Caucasian man with penile pain and a complex penile curvature of 15° and 20° (left dorsolateral), palpable nodule, and normal penile rigidity. The patient underwent multimodal therapy (oral antioxidants + topical diclofenac gel + penile injections/pentoxifylline). At follow-up after 28 months of treatment, the patient presented a dorsal curve (10°) similar to the original congenital curvature. Penile palpation did not detect any nodules, and ultrasound no longer showed any plaque.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This study demonstrates that our multimodal therapy is able to completely regress plaque, as demonstrated in our previously published article. Peyronie’s disease has the potential to be treated conservatively with good results. However, this method of treatment needs to be combined with accurate ultrasound assessment, performed using a sufficiently advanced machine by an experienced operator.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Peyronie’s disease (PD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the corpora cavernosa characterized by the formation of fibrous or calcified plaque in the tunica albuginea, resulting in penile deformity (for example curvature, divots, hourglass deformity). Patients suffering from PD present with penile pain (20–70%), penile deformity (94%), and erectile dysfunction (over 30%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>; depression (48%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although the origin of PD is still not completely understood, trauma—including micro-injuries—is postulated to be its most likely cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As fibrin accumulates in the site of the trauma, it triggers an inflammatory response involving an overproduction of fibrogenic cytokines and free radicals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Conservative approaches encompass oral therapy with colchicine, potassium _para_ \\-aminobenzoate, tamoxifen, antioxidants, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and so on; topical therapy consisting of injections with verapamil, corticosteroids, _Clostridium histolyticum_ collagenase, interferon-α2b (IFNa2b), hyaluronic acid, pentoxifylline (PTX); and physical therapy (vacuum devices and/or penile traction devices, iontophoresis, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), and so on) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. A multimodal treatment combines various therapeutic agents, as well as different forms of administration (for example oral therapy and injections), and does not rule out concurrent use of physical treatment options such as iontophoresis, penile extenders, vacuum devices, and ESWT. A combination of treatment approaches can offer better outcomes than a single substance or therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】This paper presents three cases of PD patients treated with a multimodal antioxidant therapy (including oral antioxidants, topical diclofenac gel + penile-injections/pentoxifylline) at our Peyronie’s Care Center. The three patients achieved complete regression of the area affected by disease. This is the second article describing the complete plaque regression achieved in patients with PD.\n\n【11】Case reports\n------------\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A 50-year-old Caucasian male, non-smoker, with normal body weight, presented to our clinic in July 2014 complaining of mild penile pain during erection and penile curvature with onset about 6 months before. The visual analogue pain score (VAS) was 2 (score from 0 to 10). Subjective assessment of erection, evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, provided a score of 27. When administering the IIEF questionnaire, we took into consideration questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15, which specifically refer to _erectile function_ (normal range from 26 to 30). The penile deformity consisted of both a ventral curvature, with a 5° angle, and a lateral left curvature of 5°. On palpation at the distal third of the penis, physical examination revealed a nodule measuring about 20 mm in length. The patient underwent a physical examination and penile Doppler ultrasound (alprostadil 10 mcg). The volume of the plaque was measured in its three dimensions using the ellipsoid formula (volume = 0.524 × length × width × thickness) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Cavernous artery flow and end-diastolic velocity were normal: peak systolic velocity was 74 cm/seconds (bilaterally); end-diastolic velocity was 0 cm/seconds (bilaterally). The penile plaque was located ventrally and at the distal third of the penis; its ultrasound aspect was iso-hypoechoic and it measured 25.2 × 12.7 × 4.37 mm (volume = 733 mm <sup>3 </sup> ). Within the plaque there was a calcification measuring 15.1 × 4.0 mm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 , see Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Penile ultrasound prior to treatment. **A** Plaque measurement in longitudinal and transverse scan. **B** Calcification measurement in longitudinal scan\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Table 1. Case summaries of three patients with Peyronie’s disease treated by combined multimodal therapy**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】To obtain informed consent, the patient was notified of the necessary length of treatment owing to the presence of a chronic disease. The patient did not consent to the publication of his penis photos, even if anonymized. Beginning in July 2014, after giving his informed consent, the patient underwent the following treatment: Combined therapy with oral antioxidants propolis 600 mg + bilberry 160 mg + silymarin 400 mg + ginkgo biloba 250 mg + L-carnitine 1000 mg +  coenzyme Q10 100 mg + Boswellia 200 mg + vitamin E 30 mg/daily/ + opical diclofenac gel 4%/2 × daily for 12 months.\n\n【21】Oral antioxidants were contained in the following products: Propolifix Plus capsules (propolis + ginkgo biloba), Silifix Plus capsules (silymarin + boswellia + bilberry), Carnitin E Q10 sachets (L-carnitine + coenzyme Q10 + vitamin E).\n\n【22】The patient refused to be treated with penile infiltrations for fear of pain.\n\n【23】Follow-ups were scheduled approximately every 12 months, always confirming the same therapy for each treatment cycle.\n\n【24】After four treatment cycles (each lasting 12 months), the plaque was 99.3% smaller than its initial volume, and the calcification within the plaque was further reduced in size.\n\n【25】Considering the good results, we decided to continue the same treatment for the next 5 months.\n\n【26】After 5 months of antioxidant treatment, and after approximately 4 years and 5 months of multimodal treatment, at follow-up, the IIEF score was 29, penile palpation did not detect any nodule, the two original curvatures were observed to have disappeared, and ultrasound examination no longer showed any plaque 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6 )</u>. The multimodal treatment with antioxidants was therefore suspended. The patient did not report any side effects after the treatment.\n\n【27】The patient shared with us satisfaction for the excellent result of the treatment received.\n\n【28】The same ultrasound machine was used at every examination (Philips HD 15) until the follow-up after the third therapy cycle when the ultrasound system in our clinic had been replaced by a new machine (Philips Affinity 70 G).

At the time of our observation, the patient presented a lateral-right penile curvature of 30°. The patient was therefore asked to fill in the IIEF-questionnaire on erectile function, and underwent physical examination and penile Doppler ultrasound (alprostadil 10 mcg). The IIEF score was 28 (normal range 26–30). On penile palpation during physical examination, no nodules were detected. Cavernous artery flow and end-diastolic velocity were normal: peak systolic velocity = 98 cm/seconds on the right and 96 cm/seconds on the left; end-diastolic velocity = 0 cm/seconds bilaterally. The penile plaque, located at the proximal third of the penis, had an iso-hypoechoic appearance, and its dimensions were 10.1 × 7.65 × 3.02 mm, with a volume of 122 mm <sup>3 </sup> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 7 , see Table 1 at the end of the Case report section)</u>.\n\n【47】**Fig. 7**\n\n【48】Penile ultrasound and plaque measurement prior to treatment (longitudinal and transverse scan).\n\n【49】Full size image\n\n【50】To obtain informed consent, the patient was notified of the necessary length of treatment owing to the presence of a chronic disease. The patient did not consent to the publication of his penis photos, even if anonymized. After receiving the patient’s informed consent, we began the following treatment in July 2019: Combined therapy with oral antioxidants propolis 700 mg + bilberry 180 mg + silymarin 400 mg + ginkgo biloba 240 mg + L-carnitine 1000 mg + coenzyme Q10 100 mg + Boswellia 200 mg + vitamin E 48 mg + vitamin C 50 mg + superoxide dismutase 11,000 IU/g 10 mg/daily + topical diclofenac gel 4%/2 × daily + peri-plaque penile injection of pentoxifylline 100 mg with 30 G needle every month for 12 months.\n\n【51】All oral antioxidants were contained in the following product: Peyflog tablets.\n\n【52】Follow-ups were scheduled approximately every 12 months, always confirming the same therapy for each treatment cycle. Considering the good response to the first multimodal treatment, we decided to schedule a second cycle of oral and topical treatment for 12 months, using the same agents and doses and reducing the frequency of peri-plaque penile injections with pentoxifylline 100 mg to one penile injection every 2 months for 12 months.\n\n【53】At the end of the second cycle of treatment and after 28 months of multimodal treatment, the patient underwent follow-up with physical examination and penile Doppler ultrasound. At follow-up, we observed a further reduction in the angle of the lateral right curve, which measured 15°, similar to the original congenital penile curvature, before the onset of PD. Ultrasound examination no longer showed any plaque 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 9 )</u>.\n\n【54】Our multimodal treatment with antioxidants was therefore suspended.\n\n【55】The patient shared with us satisfaction for the excellent result of the treatment received.\n\n【56】The patient did not report any side effects after the treatment.\n\n【57】The same ultrasound machine was used at initial presentation and in the follow-up examinations (Philips Affinity 70 G), and the ultrasound examination was always performed by the same doctor.\n\n【58】Progressive improvements (plaque volume reduction) after each cycle are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . 通用删除1(英):<u>(See also Table 1 )</u>\n\n【59】**Fig. 8**\n\n【60】Penile ultrasound after the first treatment cycle (longitudinal and transverse scan)\n\n【61】Full size image\n\n【62】**Fig. 9**\n\n【63】Penile ultrasound after the second treatment cycle. **A** longitudinal scan. **B** Transverse scan\n\n【64】Full size image\n\n【65】### Case 3\n\n【66】A 36-year-old Caucasian man with chronic prostatitis, lichen sclerosus, and congenital dorsal penile curvature (10°) presented to our clinic in April 2018, complaining of penile pain during erection within the last 18 months, and new complex penile curvature with onset about 12 months previously. At the time of our observation, the patient presented the penile deformity of both a dorsal curvature with a 15° angle and a lateral left curvature of 20°. The VAS was 5 (score from 0 to 10). The patient was therefore asked to fill in the IIEF-questionnaire on erectile function, and underwent physical examination and penile Doppler ultrasound (alprostadil 10 mcg). The IIEF score was 25 (normal range: 26–30). On palpation, physical examination revealed a nodule measuring about 20 mm in length at the middle third of the penis.\n\n【67】Cavernous artery flow and end-diastolic velocity were normal: peak systolic velocity = 92 cm/seconds (bilaterally), end-diastolic velocity = 0 cm/seconds bilaterally. The penile plaque, located at the middle third of the penis, had a hypo-isohyperechoic appearance and its dimensions were 20.7 × 13.3 × 3.78 mm, with a volume of 543.0 mm <sup>3 </sup> .

All oral antioxidants were contained in the following product: Peyflog tablets.\n\n【72】Considering the good response to the first multimodal treatment, we decided to schedule subsequent treatment cycles of oral and topical treatment for 24 months, using the same agents and doses and reducing the frequency of peri-plaque penile injections with pentoxifylline 100 mg to one penile injection every month for 12 months (second cycle) and subsequently, we further reduced the frequency of penile injections to one injection every 2 months for 12 months (third cycle).\n\n【73】Considering the good response to the the third cycle of multimodal treatment, we decided to schedule a fourth treatment cycle with the oral and topical treatment, using the same agents and doses for 6 months, and to suspend the peri-plaque pentoxifylline injections.\n\n【74】After 6 months of oral and topical treatment, the patient underwent the same follow-up. The IIEF score was 26. We observed a dorsal curvature with a 10° angle, similar to the original congenital penile curvature. Palpation no longer detected the presence of the nodule.

This is the second article describing the complete plaque regression achieved in human patients with PD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. In the literature, there is one experimental study on rats where complete plaque regression has been achieved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【95】Compared with our previous case report, in this article the antioxidant therapy is significantly enhanced, in fact in all three cases new antioxidant substances have been added (L-carnitine, coenzyme Q-10, Boswellia) and specifically in cases 2 and 3, we increased the dosages of two substances (propolis from 600 to 700 mg and bilberry from 160 to 180 mg), and we also added other substances (vitamin C 50 mg + superoxide dismutase 11,000 IU), which allowed us to significantly reduce the dosage of vitamin E.\n\n【96】In addition, in this new article, there is a case report of a patient (Case 2, 26 years old) who had regression of the plaque in a significantly shorter time, most likely due to his younger age. Compared with the older PD patients, younger patients present themselves early to the medical examination, and therefore in an early stage of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【97】In fact, in this case, at the ultrasound study the plaque had an iso-hypoechoic appearance and with smaller dimensions (122 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) than all the other cases treated in this article and in the previous case report.\n\n【98】At our Peyronie’s Care Center, we treat many PD patients with similar “combination” therapies. We decide on the most suitable treatment for each patient, taking into account the size of the plaque, the presence of any associated erectile dysfunction, the age of the patients, and their associated risk factors.\n\n【99】Our indications for conservative treatment with multimodal therapy are that Peyronie’s disease is in the active (not stabilized) phase and that the plaque must not be completely calcified.\n\n【100】The associated risk factors (erectile dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, arterial hypertension, and so on) require longer treatment to obtain a good result.\n\n【101】In our current experience, we are treating about 50 PD patients with similar multimodal therapy. Other patients (about 15), despite the planned follow-up, showed a reduction in plaque and penile curve, but dropped out of treatment because, in their opinion, it was too long. The negative results we have obtained are from some patients (about 10 cases, owing to important associated risk factors), in whom the cure was longer before obtaining the final result.\n\n【102】Despite the limited number of patients, we believe that this experience is very important and suggestive for all Uro-Andrologists. We think disease regression was made possible by the properties of the antioxidants used. These antioxidants are known to be capable of interrupting the inflammatory process by combating oxidative stress, an essential player in PD pathogenesis. All substances in our combined approach (propolis, bilberry, carnitine, coenzyme Q10, silymarin, ginkgo biloba, vitamin C, vitamin E, and diclofenac) are factor NF-kB inhibitors and block production of proinflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 \\]</u>. We believed from the start that topical treatment with diclofenac would be useful in the treatment of PD, for its well-established painkilling and antiinflammatory properties, as well as its free-radical scavenging activity and action against the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, including factor NF-kB production. Diclofenac has also been proven to be capable of being absorbed topically, not just subcutaneously but in subfascial tissues. Radermacher _et al_ . 通用删除7(英):<u>(1991)</u> also proved that topical diclofenac gel is able to penetrate into the articular capsule of the knee, which is much thicker than the tunica albuginea of the penis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>.\n\n【103】Throughout our entire treatment, the oral and topical therapy did not vary. In cases 2 and 3, at each subsequent treatment cycle, the frequency of peri-plaque injections with PTX 100 mg was gradually reduced. This decision was based on the fact that disease progression had already stopped after the first cycle of treatment, and signs of partial regression were observed on physical examination and diagnostic imaging. Furthermore, as trauma is undoubtedly at the origin of PD and even micro-injuries may bear serious consequences in genetically predisposed patients, even injections must be considered a source of microtrauma for the tissues, therefore we made sure to use a very thin needle when performing the injections in the area around the plaque, and we decreased the number of injections at every treatment cycle.\n\n【104】In the literature, ultrasound imaging of PD has been described by many as being incapable of providing accurate plaque measurements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. On the contrary, we believe that an ultrasound examination performed with a cutting-edge ultrasound machine by a highly experienced operator with extensive knowledge of the disease can provide a measurement of the plaque that is very helpful to assess patients at presentation and to accurately evaluate treatment outcome at follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 , 44 \\]</u>.\n\n【105】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【106】Many urologists think that Peyronie’s disease is an incurable disease, as some authors have written. The result is a renunciative therapeutic attitude of many urologists. Despite the limited number of patients, this study shows that a multimodal combined antioxidant treatment can yield good outcomes. Hence, PD can be cured.\n\n【107】In addition to the multimodal treatment, we believe a key element is a correct ultrasound assessment performed with a state-of-the-art ultrasound machine by a highly experienced operator.\n\n【108】We have decided to publish this experience in spite of its limited size, as we think the outcomes achieved with our multimodal therapy with combined antioxidants in these patients may prove useful in urology and andrology practice, and we would welcome randomized controlled studies being carried out in the future to investigate the effectiveness of this treatment in a larger number of PD patients.\n\n【109】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【110】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data presented in this study are available in this article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Tubal migration of an intrauterine device is not well understood and has not been extensively studied in literature.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 34-year-old African woman, para 1, gravida 2, presented with symptoms of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She underwent a laparoscopy where a ruptured left ectopic pregnancy was found with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system inserted 2 years prior embedded within the tube. A left salpingectomy was performed with removal of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. The patient recovered well and proceeded to have an intrauterine pregnancy 3 months later.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Migration of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system into the fallopian tube is a rare occurrence that is not well understood. In the case presented, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was found embedded within the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube, which had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Surgical treatment with laparoscopy is recommended for intraabdominal intrauterine device to prevent complications.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】An intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is a highly effective method of contraception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Types of IUDs include the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS), also commonly referred to as Mirena, and the copper IUD. They have a low failure rate of less than 1%, which is comparable to permanent sterilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The pearl index of the LNG IUS is 0.06 per 100 women years, while that of the copper IUD is 0.52 per 100 women years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Even though the risk of ectopic pregnancy with IUDs is lower than with no contraception, if a pregnancy occurs with an IUD _in situ_ , it is likely to be an ectopic pregnancy. The rate of ectopic pregnancy among LNG IUS users ranges from 0.02 to 0.2 per 100 women years, whereas the rate among copper IUD users ranges from 0.1 to 0.8 per 100 women years. In case of pregnancy, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher in LNG IUS users compared with copper IUD users (27% _versus_ 15% respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Progesterone is known to cause ciliary dysfunction within the fallopian tube, subsequently predisposing LNG IUS users who conceive to ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is therefore important to rule out ectopic pregnancy in women with acute abdomen or positive pregnancy test among LNG IUS users 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>\n\n【10】A correctly positioned IUD is located within 3 mm of the uterine fundus, with both arms extending to the cornua, a vertically oriented stem in the uterine body, and the strings protruding through the cervical os into the vaginal canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Suboptimally placed IUDs are at a higher risk of malposition or expulsion and associated symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Malposition of IUDs is a common complication of this method of contraception, with a reported rate of up to 10% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Malposition of an IUD includes displacement, expulsion, rotation, or embedment. Migration of IUDs is, however, an uncommon occurrence, with most cases of migration reported to the colon and the urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The fallopian tube is an uncommon location for migration and embedment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Having an IUD embedded within a tubal ectopic pregnancy is an even rarer phenomenon.\n\n【11】We describe a case of a patient who presented with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and was found to have a LNG IUS embedded in the fimbrial end of the affected fallopian tube.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 34-year-old African female, para 1, gravida 2, presented to the Accident and Emergency Department, having had symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain for 3 days. The symptoms had worsened on the day of presentation to the hospital. She reported several episodes of vomiting with associated loose stools and abdominal fullness. She also had ongoing vaginal bleeding that had started 5 days prior to presentation.\n\n【14】Two years prior, the patient had an uncomplicated insertion of LNG IUS by an obstetrician/gynecologist at the 8-week visit following a normal vaginal delivery. She had a normal pap smear done at the time of insertion. One year following insertion, she had a desire to conceive and was scheduled for removal of the LNG IUS device. The strings could not be seen, and the device could not be retrieved with alligator forceps. The patient was therefore sent for a pelvic ultrasound to locate the lost IUD. The device was not seen on ultrasound. The patient was, however, lost to follow-up until presentation with symptoms of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had no preexisting conditions or previous surgery.\n\n【15】On physical examination she was in fair general condition and not pale. Her vital signs were a temperature of 37.6 °C, a blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, pulse rate of 99 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. On abdominal examination she had tenderness on the left iliac fossa and suprapubic regions with absent bowel sounds. The rest of the systemic examination was normal. An impression of acute abdomen was made at this point. As initial treatment she was given intravenous fluids (Ringer’s lactate solution) 1-L bolus, as well as intravenous paracetamol and ondansetron for pain and vomiting, respectively.\n\n【16】The initial investigations included a full blood count, which revealed a normal hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dl, slightly elevated white cell count of 12.28 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L, and normal platelet count of 314 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> cells/L. She had a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Hcg) level of 7721 mIU/ml. Urinalysis showed leucocytes 2+, nitrite negative, and blood 2+. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a 2.1 cm × 1.8 cm echogenic mass with central cystic area on the left adnexa. It had no internal or peripheral vascularity. There was marked pelvic echogenic free fluid with low internal echoes extending to the Morrison’s pouch. The uterus was anteverted and normal in size and shape with an endometrial thickness of 5.5 mm. A 1.9 cm cystic lesion was seen in the right ovary, which was likely a corpus luteum cyst. There was no gestational sac or intrauterine device seen within the endometrial cavity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. These features indicated ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】Ultrasound image of an empty uterus. The arrow points to the endometrial lining measuring 5.5 mm\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】The diagnosis at this point was a ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy. The plan was to admit the patient for an emergency laparoscopy with possible left salpingectomy. The diagnosis and plan were explained to the patient, who signed an informed consent for the procedure. Group and cross match of one unit of packed red cells was ordered in case a transfusion would be required.\n\n【21】The laparoscopy was done under general anesthesia in the Lloyd–Davis position. Cohen’s uterine manipulator was placed. Veress insufflation was performed, followed by insertion of a 10-mm primary trocar at the umbilicus. Entry and operating pressures were 20 mmHg and 15 mmHg, respectively. Two secondary ports were inserted under vision, 5 mm in the right iliac fossa and 12 mm in the left iliac fossa. On primary survey, LNG IUS was found embedded at the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. The LNG IUS was retrieved whole under vision through the 12-mm port 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. There was hemoperitoneum of 700 ml 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. A ruptured left ampullary ectopic pregnancy was identified by left salpingectomy using bipolar coagulation and scissors 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. A corpus luteum cyst was found on the right ovary with normal right fallopian tube. Suction and peritoneal lavage were performed, and hemostasis was confirmed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u>. The specimen was retrieved through the 12-mm port and taken for histology. There was no sign of uterus perforation. The pouch of Douglas and rectum appeared normal. All trocars were removed under vision.\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】Body of the embedded LNG IUS (indicated by arrow), which is seen protruding from the left tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 3**\n\n【26】LNG IUS (indicated by arrow) being retrieved from the left tubal pregnancy\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】Left salpingectomy (indicated by arrow) performed using bipolar coagulation\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】Pelvic view after completion of the procedure confirming hemostasis. Arrow points to an empty pouch of Douglas\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】The postoperative recovery of the patient was unremarkable. She was debriefed about the surgery and discharged the following morning. She went home on oral paracetamol and diclofenac for pain relief.\n\n【35】The patient was reviewed in the gynecology outpatient clinic 2 weeks later. She was asymptomatic and doing well. Histology report confirmed left ectopic tubal gestation. She reported that she desired conception. Preconception counseling was done. She was put on daily folic acid (400 µg). The patient was advised to come to the hospital as soon as she missed a period or tested positive for pregnancy for an early pregnancy ultrasound to rule out another ectopic pregnancy. Three months later she presented at the early pregnancy clinic following 5 weeks of amenorrhea. A pelvic ultrasound was done that showed intrauterine pregnancy at 5 weeks gestation.\n\n【36】Discussion\n----------\n\n【37】The above case documents a rare occurrence of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with the LNG IUS embedded within the affected fallopian tube.\n\n【38】Levonorgestrel IUS (Mirena) is a safe, reversible, and highly effective contraceptive method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is known to have other therapeutic benefits such as reduction in menstrual bleeding, anemia, and dysmenorrhea, as well as management of endometrial hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this patient, the use of the LNG IUS was purely for contraception purposes.\n\n【39】Ectopic pregnancies affect approximately 2% of all pregnancies. The most common presentation of an ectopic pregnancy is abdominal pain and abnormal uterine bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Even though the rate of ectopic pregnancy is lower in women using LNG IUS, if a pregnancy occurs while using this IUD, there is a high risk of it being an ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Current IUD use is a known risk factor for ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include pelvic inflammatory disease, previous tubal surgery, previous ectopic pregnancy, and smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. On examination, features of acute abdomen due to hemoperitoneum may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. The patient in this case had a presentation suggestive of ectopic pregnancy with concurrent LNG IUS use as a risk factor. However, she had other unspecific presenting features of diarrhea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. It is important to note that some patients may be asymptomatic without specific risk factors for an ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>\n\n【40】On the other hand, malposition of an IUD is one of its common complications, presenting with pelvic pain and bleeding or no symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Although malposition is associated with reduced contraceptive efficacy, this is mostly true for copper IUDs and not LNG IUS, which has local progesterone effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Malposition is diagnosed by ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. However, compared with copper IUDs, the LNG IUS is more likely to be missed by ultrasonography. LNG IUS is compounded with barium sulfate, which makes it radio opaque for X-ray recognition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. A plain X-ray can therefore be used as an adjunctive imaging modality in the case of a lost LNG IUS not seen on ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The patient in this case had a lost LNG IUS not seen on ultrasound 1 year after insertion but was lost to follow-up for additional imaging.\n\n【41】Uterine perforation is uncommon, with an incidence of 1 in 1000 insertions. It is a serious complication of IUD use and is often asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. There is increased risk of perforation if insertion is done less than 6 months postpartum or while breastfeeding. This period is associated with endometrial atrophy with accelerated uterine involution and hence has a high risk of perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u>. The current patient was asymptomatic for malposition or perforation for 2 years prior to the ectopic pregnancy. The transvaginal ultrasound done at diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy did not visualize the device in the left adnexa. Her LNG IUS was inserted only 2 months postpartum while breastfeeding. This may have been a risk factor for possible unrecognized perforation.\n\n【42】Routine transvaginal ultrasound to monitor IUD position either immediately post insertion or after 6 weeks is not recommended without clinical suspicion of malposition according to de Kroon _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. It has been reported that IUDs take approximately 3 months to settle into their stable position. An initially malpositioned IUD can therefore assume the correct fundal position over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. In asymptomatic women with uncomplicated IUD insertion, routine ultrasound lacks benefit over clinical evaluation with string check at 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The patient in this case was asymptomatic without complications at insertion. One year later, the LNG IUS device could not be seen on clinical examination nor on ultrasound.\n\n【43】The mechanism of device migration is not well understood, especially in the case of tubal migration. The fallopian tube is a rare site for dislocated IUD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. This phenomenon has been described in few case reports. There are theories from case reports about the tubal migration of an IUD. The first possibility is placement of the device at the tubal ostium during insertion with subsequent migration into the tube due to uterine contractions and tubal peristalsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. The other possibility is uterine perforation with migration of the device into the peritoneal cavity and subsequent perforation of a preexisting hydrosalpinx as described by Ozdemir _et al._ in a case report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The patient in this case did not have any hydrosalpinx noted intraoperatively. Perforation can be due to either immediate traumatic perforation at insertion or delayed transmural migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. It is also possible that, following an unrecognized perforation, there was nestling of the IUD close to the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, with the device being enveloped within the fimbria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 19 \\]</u>. This phenomenon could have occurred antecedent to conception of the ectopic pregnancy. In the patient in this case, there was no sign of uterus perforation. The pouch of Douglas and rectum appeared normal.\n\n【44】The presence of an IUD within the fallopian tube is associated with an inflammatory reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> interfering with tubal function and predisposing the patient to ectopic pregnancy. The tubal dysfunction is exacerbated by progesterone in the LNG IUS, which interferes with ciliary beating and tubal contractility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is possible that the embedment of LNG IUS at the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube occurred as a result of displacement from the proximal tube by the growing tubal pregnancy or its rupture.\n\n【45】Once an intraabdominal IUD is diagnosed, it should be removed whether it is symptomatic or not to avoid serious complications such as adhesion formation, bowel obstruction, and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 19 \\]</u>. Laparoscopy is the surgical approach of choice as it is safe and effective. It provides good visualization to locate and remove a lost IUD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In this case, the diagnosis of the LNG IUS within the fallopian tube and its removal were done laparoscopically.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【47】Migration of the LNG IUS into the fallopian tube is a rare occurrence that is not well understood. In the case presented, a LNG IUS was found embedded within the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube that had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Surgical treatment with laparoscopy is recommended for intraabdominal IUD to prevent complications. The patient made a good recovery and proceeded to have an intrauterine pregnancy 3 months later, as desired.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Clinical data and complementary examinations are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IUD:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intrauterine device</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LNG IUS:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Levonorgestrel intrauterine system</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

As compared with PJS, Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps are diagnosed with a lower risk of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and have been regarded as a different disorder from PJS.\n\n【11】We report two cases with a solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp treated by endoscopic mucosal resection.\n\n【12】Case Presentations\n------------------\n\n【13】Case 1 is an 84-year-old Japanese man with previous medical history of hypertension, chronic hepatitis C infection, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and colon polyps (tubular adenoma and tubulovillous adenoma). He had no mucocutaneous pigmentation or family history of PJS. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a lobular polyp measuring 14 mm in diameter, in the superior duodenal angle 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed without complication and histological examination showed findings suggestive of a hamartomatous polyp--branching bundles of smooth muscle fibers covered by hyperplastic duodenal mucosa--with a focus of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. A colonoscopy and small-intestinal follow-through showed no other polyps.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】**A lobular duodenal polyp measuring 14 mm in diameter was detected in the superior duodenal angle** .\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】**Histological examination showed findings suggestive of a hamartoma: branching bundles of smooth muscle fibers covered by hyperplastic duodenal mucosa, with a focus of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma** .

Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed, and histological examination showed findings suggestive of a hamartomatous polyp 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4 )</u>. A colonoscopy and small-intestinal follow-through showed no other polyps. After the endoscopic treatment, concomitant liver and thyroid cancers were found.\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】**Pedunculated duodenal polyp measuring 15 mm in diameter in the second part of the duodenum** .\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Figure 4**\n\n【25】**Histological examination showed findings suggestive of a hamartoma without malignant components** . Hematoxylin and eosin staining (objective 10 ×).\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】As compared with PJS, Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps are diagnosed at a more advanced age, in the absence of mutation of the STK11/LKB-1 gene, and without familial history and mucocutaneous pigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Previous reports showed that polyps due to PJS had 3-6% of neoplastic change, such as adenomas or carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 – 18 \\]</u>. A search of case reports on the MEDLINE database up to July 2010, using the terms \"hamartomatous polyp\" and \"duodenum\", and of reference lists of published articles (including our cases), showed 27 patients with a solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp in the duodenum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Although solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps have been considered to show a lower potential for malignant transformation as compared to PJS, three cases (including ours) of solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps with malignant components have been reported since 2008, and the total malignant transformation rate of solitary Peutz-Jehgher type hamartomatous polyps was four out of 27 (14.8%). There were no significant tendencies of malignant transformation within the age or sex of the patient, or the location, size or endoscopic appearances of the polyp.\n\n【30】**Table 1 Twenty-seven cases of solitary duodenal Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps.**\n\n【31】Full size table\n\n【32】The most serious problem in PJS is an increased risk of cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The occurrence of cancer in the gastrointestinal tract has been reported in 20-25% of patients with PJS, and a risk of cancer in other organs has been also reported, including the ovary, breast, bladder, pancreas and thyroid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 19 – 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of patients with solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps presenting with malignancy in other organs. This is one of the reasons that solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps have been considered as a separate clinical entity from PJS. However, Case 2 in our report had duplicated malignancy in six organs. An overlap between solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps and PJS may need to be re-examined.\n\n【34】Our two cases were diagnosed in patients with an advanced age similar to previous reports, but they differ in the malignant alteration of a hamartomatous polyp and concomitant other cancers. Patients with duodenal Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps should undergo colonoscopy and whole-body screening; duodenal solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyps should preferably be treated by endoscopic or surgical resection.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】We report two cases of duodenal solitary Peutz-Jeghers type hamartomatous polyp. Case 1 was a hamartomatous polyp with a focus of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and Case 2 was a hamartomatous polyp with five cancers in other organs.

He was 167cm in height and weighed 58kg. An analgesic had been administered prior to his visit, but low back pain had persisted. His physical examination showed pressure pain and tapping tenderness at the third lumbar vertebral level, but no sensory or motor disorders of his lower extremities. His blood biochemistry showed no abnormalities and his medical history was non-contributory.\n\n【12】A plain radiography revealed the formation of a vertebral spur or narrowing of the intervertebral disc between L3 and L4 as an age-related change, but no instability was evident between vertebrae and no obvious abnormalities were evident.

Since a benign tumor was suspected, we planned to perform curettage of the tumor and to fill the defect with artificial bone.\n\n【20】The operation was performed under general anesthesia. The third lumbar vertebral arch was exposed, and when an area approximately 1cm × 1cm in the external lamina of the right vertebral arch was opened, a yellow tumorous lesion with a color and elasticity macroscopically similar to those of ordinary fatty tissue was observed. The tumorous lesion was curetted away as much as possible, hydroxyapatite bone filler paste (BIOPEX®; HOYA Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to fill the defect and the external lamina of the vertebral arch was replaced. Intraoperative pathological findings included hyperplasia of adipose cells and blood vessels, a small amount of trabecular bone and adipose cells of different sizes.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious adverse effect in patients treated with metformin. Recent studies noted a correlation between metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis. Continuous renal replacement therapy for the treatment of metformin-associated lactic acidosis has been documented in some case reports; however, there is currently no specific treatment for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 70-year-old Japanese woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to an emergency room with metformin-associated lactic acidosis. She was found to be hypotensive and laboratory examinations revealed severe lactic acidosis: pH 6.618, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood 17.3 mmHg, bicarbonate 1.7 mmol/L, and lactate 18 mmol/L. Severe acidemia persisted despite supportive care including intravenously administered fluids, sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics, and vasopressors. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated in our intensive care unit. After dialysis for 3 days, her lactate level and pH value completely normalized. The concentration of metformin detected was 77.5 mg/L, which is one of the highest in metformin-associated lactic acidosis successfully treated without overdose.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The present case had one of the highest metformin concentrations in metformin-associated lactic acidosis successfully treated with continuous renal replacement therapy, and serum metformin concentrations may be useful for the diagnosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but important etiology of lactic acidosis. Continuous renal replacement therapy is advantageous for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Metformin, a biguanide antihyperglycemic drug, has been widely used as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It inhibits pyruvate carboxylase, which impairs the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, leading to impaired cellular respiration; this results in both lactate production and its impaired metabolism. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious adverse effect in metformin-treated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is less than 1–9 cases/100,000 patient years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The mortality rate is 30–50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Intermittent renal replacement therapy has been suggested as a treatment method for drug removal and the correction of severe acidemia; however, a standard treatment strategy has not yet been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sustained low-efficacy dialysis (SLED) for the treatment of MALA have been documented in some case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The advantages of CRRT and SLED are improved tolerability by hemodynamically unstable patients. We describe a case of MALA that was successfully treated with CRRT.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 70-year-old Japanese woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to our emergency room with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting for 3 days. She also had a history of colon polyps, depression, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3a. She had been taking metformin 1000 mg/day for more than 3 years without changing the dosage. Her condition was normal until 3 days before her admission when she started to have repeated diarrhea and vomiting. Her consciousness was deteriorating on the day of her admission. Her vital signs on arrival were as follows: blood pressure 71/56 mmHg, heart rate 85 beats per minute, temperature 35.7 °C, oxygen saturation 86% on room air, and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute with Glasgow Coma Scale E4V4M5. Her initial laboratory examination revealed severe kidney injury with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 67.5 mg/dL and creatinine of 10.17 mg/dL and she had metabolic acidosis with a high lactate level: pH 6.618, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO <sub>2 </sub> ) 17.3 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> ) 1.7 mmol/L, and lactate 18 mmol/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Whole-body computed tomography showed maxillary sinusitis and a uterine fibroid, but no evidence of infection.\n\n【12】**Table 1 Laboratory results on admission**\n\n【13】Full size table\n\n【14】Although supportive measures, including intravenously administered fluids, sodium bicarbonate, vasopressors, and antibiotics, were initiated, severe acidemia and hemodynamic instability persisted. Tracheal intubation was performed and she was transferred to the intensive care unit where she received urgent CRRT (continuous hemodiafiltration with a dialysate rate of 5000 mL/hour). Her lactate level and pH value completely normalized within 72 hours and, thus, CRRT and vasopressors were stopped 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. She was extubated on day 6 and antibiotics were discontinued based on negative blood cultures on day 7. She left the intensive care unit on day 12 and was discharged on day 20. Her serum creatinine level before discharge was 1.11 mg/dL.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Clinical course of the patient. _CRRT_ continuous renal replacement therapy, _HCO_ <sub><i>3 </i></sub> <sup><i>− </i></sup> bicarbonate\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】After discharge, she was treated as an out-patient with orally administered anti-diabetic drugs other than metformin and her serum creatinine level remained stable. Her metformin level before CRRT was 77.5 mg/L (therapeutic range 0.5–2 mg/L). Metformin concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with an InertSustainSwift™ C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.0 μm; GL Sciences Inc. Tokyo, Japan) and QTRAP® 4500 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) using isocratic elution of 10 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile at a ratio of 80:20 (v/v). The linearity of the calibration curve was between 6.25 and 100 mg/L with a determination coefficient of 0.999.\n\n【19】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【20】We identified two important clinical issues. The present case had one of the highest metformin concentrations in MALA successfully treated with CRRT and serum metformin concentrations may be useful for the diagnosis of this condition. CRRT is an effective treatment for patients with MALA with hemodynamic instability.\n\n【21】Metformin blood concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L are within the therapeutic range, whereas those higher than 4.0 mg/L are generally considered to be toxic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The causal link between metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis has been questioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Previous studies reported a poor correlation, which may have reflected the suboptimal timing of sample collection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Recent studies noted a correlation between metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the present case, the serum metformin level before CRRT was 77.5 mg/L. This level exceeded the lethal range of metformin concentrations (> 50 mg/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 10 \\]</u>. Moreover, this patient had most of the poor prognostic indicators in MALA, such as advanced age, arterial pH less than 7.35, the need for mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Although a poor prognosis was expected, we successfully treated one of the highest metformin concentrations in MALA with CRRT. Our suspicion of MALA was supported by the high level of metformin. Although plasma metformin concentrations are not easily available in all laboratories, it is important to ensure specimen storage because plasma metformin concentrations measured in the emergency room will contribute to an accurate diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】CRRT is an effective treatment for patients with MALA with hemodynamic instability. Initial therapy for MALA is resuscitation and supportive care. There is no specific treatment for MALA and sodium bicarbonate alone is generally not sufficient to correct acidosis. Metformin has a low molecular weight and its protein binding rate is limited; therefore, it freely diffuses through hemodialyzers and hemofilters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Intermittent hemodialysis has been suggested as a treatment for drug removal and the correction of severe acidemia. CRRT for the treatment of MALA has been documented in some case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The clearance of metformin may exceed 200 mL/minute with intermittent dialysis and up to 50 mL/minute with CRRT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 14 \\]</u>. The clearance of drugs by CRRT may be less effective than that for intermittent hemodialysis, but needs to be considered for patients who are hemodynamically unstable. In our patient, intermittent dialysis was difficult because she was hemodynamically unstable to receive high doses of vasopressors. After CRRT was initiated, her lactate level and pH value improved and she subsequently recovered from shock. CRRT is an effective treatment for MALA if intermittent hemodialysis cannot be performed due to hemodynamic instability.\n\n【23】The most common symptoms of MALA are those related to the gastrointestinal tract (including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) followed by an altered mental status, shortness of breath, hypothermia, and hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Metformin toxicity may mimic sepsis with gastrointestinal symptoms. MALA is characterized by a blood lactate concentration greater than 5 mmol/L and arterial pH less than 7.35 in association with metformin exposure. Metformin clearance decreases with reductions in the glomerular filtration rate because metformin has limited metabolism and is mostly eliminated unchanged by the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In the present case, her serum metformin concentration was elevated because of prerenal acute renal failure induced by repeated diarrhea and vomiting. It was not clear whether repeated vomiting and diarrhea were due to enteritis or MALA; however, the present case demonstrated that MALA may occur even if patients take an appropriate amount of metformin. In emergency settings, difficulties may be associated with obtaining a detailed medical history; therefore, it is important to suspect MALA in patients with metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels in any setting. In the present case, we obtained a detailed medical history, which included a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with metformin, and a history of preceding gastrointestinal symptoms; therefore, we immediately suspected MALA.\n\n【24】We described one of the highest metformin concentrations in MALA successfully treated with CRRT. Since MALA is difficult to differentiate from sepsis, particularly in severe cases, serum metformin concentrations may be useful for reaching a diagnosis. MALA needs to be considered a differential diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving metformin even without overdose who have severe lactic acidosis. Although intermittent hemodialysis is the preferred approach, CRRT is an effective alternative for hemodynamically unstable patients.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CRRT:</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Continuous renal replacement therapy</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MALA:</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Metformin-associated lactic acidosis</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SLED:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sustained low-efficacy dialysis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Renal cell carcinoma metastases are regarded as radioresistant tumors and surgery is recommended. However, since metastatic renal cell carcinoma has poor prognosis and is composed of abundant blood vessels, it is sometimes difficult for clinicians to choose surgical therapy. Here, we report a case of a patient with renal cell carcinoma metastasis to the maxillary bone, which was successfully controlled by surgical therapy after vascular embolization, and provide a detailed literature review regarding the treatments and outcomes of renal cell carcinoma metastasis to the oral cavity.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An 89-year-old Japanese man presented with an 8 × 8-mm granulomatous tumor with palpable pulsation in the left upper gingiva, which had been clinically suspected as an arteriovenous malformation or neoplastic lesion with rich blood vessels. Our patient had undergone left nephrectomy for clear cell carcinoma 7 years prior. Pulmonary metastasis had appeared 3 years later. After intravascular embolization, our patient underwent tumor resection of the maxilla with little intraoperative blood loss. The tumor was diagnosed on histopathology as a metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma to the maxillary bone. Seventeen months after surgery, he died because of pulmonary metastasis without evidence of recurrence in the oral cavity.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our literature review reveals that oral metastatic lesions of renal cancer often exhibit rapid enlargement and cause severe symptoms, such as dysphagia and bleeding. Although oral metastasis of renal cell carcinoma has a poor prognosis due to the presence of concurrent disseminated metastases, surgical therapy may be recommended because of its high local control rate and ability to maintain quality of life. Preoperative vascular embolization is considered to be effective to reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, which leads to safe surgery.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Tumor metastasis to the oral cavity is uncommon, comprising only 1% of all oral malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. After lung and breast carcinoma, renal carcinoma is the third most common tumor that metastasizes to the head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Because oral metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a late-stage phenomenon, often accompanied by lung metastasis, its prognosis is very poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. RCC metastases are often regarded as radioresistant tumors, and surgical treatment is recommended. However, given the poor prognosis of metastatic RCC to the oral cavity, careful consideration is necessary regarding whether surgery can improve quality of life for end-stage oncological patients. In this report, we describe a patient with RCC metastasis that developed in the maxillary bone, which was successfully controlled by surgical treatment after vascular embolization. We provide a review of the current literature and discuss the treatment regarding oral cavity involvement of RCC metastasis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 89-year-old Japanese man noticed swelling of the left maxillary gingiva in November 2016. In December 2016, he was referred to our department because the mass had slowly enlarged. His past medical history included clear cell RCC in his left kidney 7 years prior, which had been treated by nephrectomy. Multiple pulmonary metastases of RCC had appeared 3 years after surgery. He had received molecular targeted therapy with sorafenib for 4 years, which suppressed the growth of pulmonary metastases.

Pulsation around the tumor was not palpable after embolization. Prior to surgery, a biopsy specimen of the left maxillary gingiva had been subjected to frozen study. The results indicated that metastasis of the previously treated RCC could not be ruled out. Subtotal maxillectomy was performed by an intraoral approach 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Intraoperative blood loss was only 26 ml. After surgery, there was no problems with oral intake of the patient.

However, considering the poor prognosis of oral metastasis of renal cancer, clinicians have to weigh the benefits of surgery and the disadvantages of not having it.\n\n【32】Oral metastatic lesions of renal cancer are known to undergo extremely rapid enlargement, which results in severe symptoms and a decline in quality of life. Dysphagia was observed in 18 patients 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Obstruction of the upper airways due to rapid growth of oral metastasis led to tracheotomy in one patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> and death in one patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Mazeron _et al._ described a patient with RCC metastasis to the tongue, who initially decided against surgery due to the poor prognosis. However, doctors were later forced to perform surgery because of a rapid increase in the size of the intraoral mass and resistance of the tumor to chemoradiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. In the present case, our patient began to feel pain because of the rapid increase of the intraoral mass. It was possible that dysphagia or obstruction of upper airway may have occurred without surgery, suggesting that surgical therapy can maintain quality of life of the patient.\n\n【33】Among 153 patients with oral metastasis of RCC described in the literature, the treatment and outcome of the oral lesion were described for 78 patients, which are summarized in Table 2 . Surgery was performed in most patients (53 cases), and the local control rate was greater than 90%. In contrast, the local control rates of radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and palliative surgery (debulking and cryosurgery) ranged from 33.3% to 66.7%. Considering the high ratio of local control after surgery, surgical therapy before further disease progression may be the first choice for patients with oral metastasis of RCC.\n\n【34】**Table 2 Therapeutic outcomes of oral metastatic lesion of renal cell cancer. ( _N_ \\= 78)**\n\n【35】Full size table\n\n【36】However, hemorrhage was observed in many patients because RCC is characterized by rich blood vessels, which makes surgery difficult. Pulsation was observed in seven patients at the first visit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 16 \\]</u>. Three of these patients exhibited pulsation in the maxillary bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Tables 1 and 3 )</u>. In our patient, arteriovenous malformation was clinically suspected due to pulsation. Past reports indicated that two patients with mandibular lesions were also clinically diagnosed with vascular malformation, then diagnosed with RCC metastases upon pathological examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 \\]</u>.

Three patients underwent preoperative vascular embolization or ligation, which did not lead to complications during surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 13 \\]</u>. Our experience with the present patient also indicated that preoperative vascular embolization is helpful in preventing massive hemorrhage during biopsy and surgery for pulsatile oral metastasis of RCC. We believe that surgical therapy after vascular embolization can improve or maintain quality of life for the patients with oral metastasis of renal carcinoma, even if they are late stage oncological patients.\n\n【37】**Table 3 Summary of the reported cases of renal cell cancer metastasis in the maxillary bone**\n\n【38】Full size table\n\n【39】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【40】Although oral metastasis of RCC has a poor prognosis due to the presence of concurrent disseminated metastases, surgical therapy may be recommended because of its high local control rate and ability to maintain quality of life. Preoperative vascular embolization is considered to be effective to reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, which leads to safe operation.\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RCC:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Renal cell carcinoma</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors are the most frequent cause of death in these patients. However, the extent and intervals of screening in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 are controversial as neuroendocrine tumors are usually slow growing. Here we report the case of a patient who developed a fast-growing neuroendocrine carcinoma within 15 months of a laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We followed a group of 45 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 by an annual screening program in the Department of Visceral, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery at the University Hospital Marburg in cooperation with the Department of Radiology and the Division of Endocrinology. A man with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 who was diagnosed with a recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism underwent a distal pancreatic resection for a non-functional neuroendocrine tumor. In the context of our regular screening program, a large non-functional neuroendocrine tumor was diagnosed in the pancreatic head 15 months after the first pancreatic surgery. Therefore, we performed an enucleation and regional lymph node resection. At histology, the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine carcinoma with one lymph node metastasis was established. There was no evidence of recurrence 9 months after re-operation.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Fast-growing neuroendocrine tumors are rare in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. The intervals, both postoperative and in newly diagnosed pancreatic lesions, in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 should be reduced to 6 months to establish the early diagnosis of rapidly progressive disease in a small subset of patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (MEN1) is an inherited tumor syndrome, which is typically characterized by tumors of the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary. Organs such as the adrenal glands, the thymus, the skin and the bronchial tree are involved less frequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 4 \\]</u>. Pancreatoduodenal endocrine tumors (PETs) are determinants of long-term survival. About one-third of patients with MEN1 develop malignant tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Predictive genetic screening and regular screening programs are designed to detect and treat malignant tumors at the earliest stage possible. However, the extent and intervals of screening in patients with MEN1 are controversial. Current recommendations are based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference in 2001 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. A yearly biochemical screening and a tumor imaging every 3 to 5 years are emphasized. In the past few years, endoscopic ultrasound has gained importance in the detection of PETs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>, particularly in the setting of a prospective screening program. To date, the survival benefit of periodic screening and early intervention has not been proven.\n\n【10】As a consequence of periodic screening, asymptomatic patients with functioning or non-functioning tumors are scheduled for pancreatic resections more often and at a younger age. The indication, extent and timing of surgery in patients with MEN1 are a matter of debate. Indications for insulinomas and non-functioning tumors larger than 2 cm are well established, although some groups postulate a more aggressive strategy with a limit of 10 mm in non-functioning pancreatoduodenal endocrine tumors (nf PETs) in order to prevent malignancy and liver metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 – 12 \\]</u>. Malignancy is evident in about one-half of patients with PETs; unfortunately, markers for the development or progression of malignant disease are not yet available.\n\n【11】Here we report the case of a 37-year-old man with MEN1 who developed a rapidly growing non-functioning tumor in the pancreatic remnant 15 months after a laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a rapidly growing non-functioning PET in a patient with MEN1 that was detected by a regular screening program.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with MEN1 owing to a recurrent symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and a positive family history. Genetic analysis of the _Menin_ gene showed a frame-shift mutation in codon 229 (c.657 1bpdel/K285X). At the initial evaluation, a non-functioning pituitary gland tumor, non-functioning adrenal lesions and a 17 mm non-functioning PET were detected. Normal levels of pancreatic polypeptide, gastrin, chromogranin A, serotonin, insulin, proinsulin and glucagon were present. Computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the pancreatic tail with a diameter of 25 mm without any radiological signs of malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) visualized two small lesions in the pancreatic tail 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1A )</u>. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (SRS) did not provide any evidence of a somatostatin-receptor positive tumor. There was no evidence of lymph node metastases (LNMs) or distant metastases (DMs) in the imaging procedures.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】**Imaging studies before initial and re-operation** .

(D) Pre-operative endoscopic ultrasound before the re-operation.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】This patient was scheduled for a laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection after laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) to rule out additional tumors in the pancreatic head and body. At laparoscopy, after mobilization of the pancreatic tail, LUS confirmed the finding of the pre-operative EUS. In the absence of additional lesions in the pancreatic head and body, as well as no DMs or LNMs, the patient underwent a spleen-preserving distal pancreatic resection. A rapid histological diagnosis was performed to exclude malignancy. Seven days after an uneventful clinical course, the patient was discharged.\n\n【18】Histopathological examination showed four well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (one of 40 mm, three of 3 mm). Immunohistochemistry displayed a positive staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The Ki-67 index was lower than 1% 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2A )</u>.\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】**Histological characteristics of the neuroendocrine tumor at initial operation and the neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas at re-operation** .

(D) Ki-67 stain of the neuroendocrine carcinoma at re-operation.\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】The patient was re-evaluated 15 months after surgery. At presentation, the patient was asymptomatic. Thus, he participated in our regular screening program and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SRS and EUS were performed. As was the case before the initial operation, hormone levels were within the normal range. Surprisingly, MRI and EUS demonstrated a tumor measuring 25 mm in the pancreatic head and an enlarged lymph node (LN) above the caval vein on the lower pancreatic margin. DMs were not detected. An additional pancreatic lesion, 7 mm in diameter, was visualized by EUS 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1B )</u>. The pancreatic head tumor had developed within 12 months of surgery, but radiological signs of invasion could not be established. The patient was scheduled for surgical exploration as malignancy was suspected owing to the rapid growth.\n\n【23】At laparotomy, an intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS) was performed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3A )</u>. A well-outlined encapsulated tumor measuring 22 mm was found in the pancreatic head. Before the final decision on the surgical procedure was made, one enlarged, but soft, LN of 15 mm from the hepatic ligament was transected to rule out LNMs. As rapid histological diagnosis showed a normal LN, the pancreatic head tumor was enucleated. At the lower margin of the pancreatic head, two enlarged LNs of 10 mm were also transected. The tumor bore macroscopic invasion of the surrounding pancreatic tissue. The defect was covered by a Y-en-Roux loop 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3B )</u>. A resection of the pancreatic head would have resulted in a pancreatectomy, which results in XXX pancreoprivic diabetes. The patient was discharged after an uneventful clinical course of 10 days.\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】**Situs at laparotomy before and after resection** .

The tumor was covered by a white capsule 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3C )</u>. Microscopically, the tumor-forming epithelial glands infiltrated the pancreatic tissue. The tumor cells showed a hyperchromatic nucleus with a gross chromatin structure. In some parts, the tumor displayed necrosis. Immunohistochemistry resulted in a positive staining for chromogranin A and a negative staining for insulin and gastrin. The Ki-67 index was again lower than 1%. The LN of the hepatic ligament (12 mm) and one of the two LNs of the lower pancreatic margin (10 mm) were without evidence of tumor cells. The second LN of the lower pancreatic margin, measuring 9 mm, revealed an infiltration of atypical epithelial cells.\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】In our experience with more than 40 patients who participate in a regular screening program at our hospital, this is an extraordinary case. Most non-functioning PETs in patients with MEN1 are small, multiple and follow a benign course and, consequently, are seen as slow-growing tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】It is noteworthy that malignant PETs have become the most important determinant of long-term survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. About one-third of patients with MEN1 succumb to malignant tumors. To date, no markers for malignancy have been established. As a consequence, the rationale for screening is to detect lesions at an earlier stage and to perform prophylactic, but pancreas-preserving, surgery before DMs or LNMs develop. Predictive genetic screening and regular screening programs are intended to detect and treat malignant tumors at the earliest stage possible. However, the extent and intervals of screening in patients with MEN1 are controversial owing to the fact that a survival benefit of periodic screening and early intervention has not been proven. Most authors emphasize a postoperative follow-up after 12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The Uppsala group and the NIH consensus conference suggest a regular screening interval of 3 to 5 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In view of the presented case, the diagnosis of a new, rapidly growing neuroendocrine carcinoma was established in an asymptomatic patient as a result of a postoperative follow-up at 15 months. A misdiagnosis and oversight by three different imaging modalities (CT, EUS and IOUS) before the initial surgery seem to be unlikely. A 6-month follow-up in our patient would possibly have resulted in earlier surgery on a smaller tumor. Therefore, we suggest a closer follow-up every 6 to 12 months, postoperatively in the case of a newly diagnosed lesion, taking into consideration that a small subset of patients seems to develop rapidly progressive disease. However, this policy leads to a higher number of 'unnecessary investigations' in patients who follow a benign course. Once patients display stable disease over several years, the intervals may be extended. Prospective data on follow-up of PETs in patients with MEN1 are rare, and most studies did not differentiate between prospective and non-prospective diagnosed PETs. However, randomized prospective studies seem to be unethical owing to the potential benefit of regular screening.\n\n【32】The indication for surgery in patients with MEN1 is an unresolved controversy. The observation that non-functioning PETs smaller than 3 cm rarely developed LNMs and DMs has prompted some groups to suggest operating only on PETs larger than 3 cm. However, one could argue that the aim is not to detect but to prevent metastases, which leads to a more aggressive strategy and indicates surgery when a PET larger than 10 mm is detected. Skogseid and Oberg emphasize performing surgery when biochemical evidence is established with or without positive imaging results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The extent of surgery in non-functioning PETs is controversial, although distal pancreatic resection up to the level of the portal vein and enucleation of pancreatic head tumors including LN transection is the procedure most groups prefer. Laparoscopic resection could also be considered, simply because there are no data on the value of routine LN dissection, notably in the setting of early surgery in small non-functioning PETs. Whenever a re-operation is indicated, the strategy must be tailored to the patient, which makes it difficult to establish 'guidelines': the younger the patient is, the more pancreatic tissue must be preserved to prevent XXXpancreoprivic diabetes. In elderly patient or in patients who present with diabetes, even pancreatectomy is sometimes indicated, for example, after a distal pancreatic resection when the tumor is located in the pancreatic head. The location, number and size of tumors must be taken into consideration to 'design' tailored surgery in patients with MEN1.\n\n【34】Whenever dealing with prophylactic surgery, low morbidity and almost absent mortality is required. It has to be emphasized that most patients with non-functioning PETs are asymptomatic and have excellent long-term survival without surgery. Therefore, total pancreatectomy is rarely indicated but has been advocated for patients in families with aggressive PETs. In our experience, it must be considered that most patients who have undergone pancreatic resection are discovered in the follow-up to have developed small non-functioning PETs, which would lead to additional surgery in the future. Patients with a prior distal pancreatectomy would consequently undergo a total pancreatectomy. The XXXpancreoprivic severe diabetes in a patient of 40 or 50 years is of utmost importance.\n\n【35】The patient we have presented here was scheduled for an exploration, which could have resulted in either an enucleation or a pancreatoduodenectomy. A resection of the pancreatic head preserving the duodenum was also an option. After the rapid section of the LN in the hepatic ligament excluded LNMs, we decided on an enucleation of the soft PET in the pancreatic head. Surprisingly, one LN, macroscopically unsuspicious, at the lower margin was an LNM. We will follow the patient closely and if he displays evidence for local recurrence, he will be scheduled for total pancreatectomy. Six months after surgery, he was without any evidence of recurrence.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【37】The postoperative follow-up intervals and those for newly diagnosed pancreatic lesions should be reduced to 6 months to establish diagnosis as soon as possible in patients with rapidly progressing disease.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Although it has no symptoms, heterotopic pancreas found during surgical procedures should be excised.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is defined as pancreatic tissue without real anatomical or vascular connection to the pancreas and was first reported by Jean-Schultz in 1729 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The incidence of HP is 0.5 to 13.0% in autopsy studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common sites of HP are the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum, but it can be also found in the ileum, Meckel’s diverticulum (MD), colon, gall bladder, umbilicus, fallopian tube, mediastinum, spleen, and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. HP can cause complications including inflammation, ulceration, chemical irritation, bleeding, obstruction, malignant transformation, jejunojejunal intussusception and ileus \\[ 5 \\- 8 \\]. However, most patients with ectopic pancreas are asymptomatic and diagnosis is usually confirmed during a radiological examination or endoscopy of the digestive tract or during surgical explorations motivated by other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. On microscopic examination, ectopic pancreas is composed of varying amounts of pancreatic ducts, acini and islets of Langerhans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Heinrich’s criteria are used to classify HP: type 1 contains cells of exocrine glands, excretory ducts and islets of Langerhans; type 2 contains only excretory glands and excretory ducts; type 3 contains only excretory ducts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We report an unusual case of HP found in MD.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】An 81-year-old Lithuanian woman was tested for faecal occult blood during preventive colorectal cancer screening. Test results were positive and she underwent a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy revealed a tumour in her caecum. Abdominal and thoracic computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed no metastasis. She then underwent elective surgery. During the operation, a 6×5cm tumour was found in her caecum. Her MD was found 40cm from the hepatoduodenal ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. A right hemicolectomy was performed to excise the MD from her jejunal loop. After the operation, she underwent chemotherapy. There were no complications related to the surgery. Histological results showed a poorly differentiated G3 adenocarcinoma of the caecum. In her small intestine a muscular layer of excised MD and mesenteric adipose tissue was found, which was pancreatic tissue morphologically. Microscopic analysis revealed pancreatic tissue without islets of Langerhans 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u> in the small intestine and mesenteric adipose tissue. Moreover, in the HP tissue, dilatation of the pancreatic ducts was observed.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】Histological section (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) of the small intestine. The figure shows the presence of pancreatic tissue (black arrow – pancreatic acini) in the small intestine and a muscular layer of Meckel’s diverticulum with cystic dilatation of the ducts (blue arrow).\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Discussion\n----------\n\n【16】The aetiology of HP, otherwise known as “aberrant”, “ectopic”, or “accessory” pancreas, is still unclear, but it is believed to arise embryonically during rotation of the foregut and fusion of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds. Some tissue separates from the pancreas and develops into HP in any portion of the alimentary system. Another best known theory is based on the pancreatic metaplasia of endodermal tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Because of the proximity of the embryonic pancreatic primordial buds and the foregut during development, it is not surprising that 70 to 90% of ectopic pancreas occurs in the upper gastrointestinal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. MD is the second most common site of heterotopic tissue; the stomach is the most common site (50 to 60% of cases) while 5 to 16% of cases occur in the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Surgical excision is the first and best choice of treatment because medical treatment is not effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, the treatment of HP depends on the patient. Asymptomatic patients with a positive diagnosis must remain under medical supervision and be reviewed periodically. Symptomatic patients without complications should have their lesions excised, preferably by local resection. In sites accessible by fibrescope, endoscopic removal may be performed. HP found during surgical procedures motivated by other diseases, as in our case, should be excised and submitted for a frozen section study whenever necessary, thus avoiding possible complications and the need for reoperation. In cases of lesions associated with bleeding, obstruction or suspicion of malignancy, an appropriate surgical approach is undertaken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. HP can be eliminated by simple excision, as multiple lesions are unusual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The preoperative diagnosis of HP in the small intestine is difficult. Symptoms depend on the size of lesion and involvement of mucosa. On clinical examination, significant lesions are greater than 1.5cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 \\]</u>. Most cases represent HP in a MD with gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>, but in our case it was asymptomatic. Because HP can be found submucosally and the most common submucosal tumour is gastrointestinal stroma tumour (GIST), HP can frequently be mistaken as GIST or leiomyoma at endoscopy, ultrasonography or CT scanning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In our case, HP was mistaken for metastasis of the caecal tumour. The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by pathological examination after the resection 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>. However, endoscopic ultrasound findings are often associated with these lesions: a diameter larger than 4cm, poorly defined margins, cystic spaces and internal echogenic foci, and adjacent lymphadenopathy and rapid growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Although, pathological examination is the most accurate diagnostic method for diagnosis of ectopic pancreas, most biopsies are inconclusive, because it is difficult to take adequate tissue samples. MD can be diagnosed with <sup>99m </sup> technetium pertechnetate scintigraphy, which detects ectopic gastric mucosa in MD. However, the diagnostic accuracy of this method is 46% in adults. Abdominal ultrasound, X-ray and CT usually give nonspecific findings. MD can be detected by capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy. The diagnosis of MD with HP is difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 14 \\]</u>. Management of incidentally found MD is controversial. Some authors suggest that indications for diverticulectomy should be based on intraoperative findings. Wide-mouthed, thin-walled diverticula without bands could be left undisturbed, whereas thickened, narrow-based diverticula should be resected. However, there are no definite anatomic criteria to predict the probability of future complications. According to the literature, the benefits of incidental diverticulectomy outweigh its attending morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In our case, MD was resected because ectopy of the pancreatic tissue was considered a metastasis of the caecal tumour.\n\n【17】**Table 1 **Comparison of heterotopic pancreas found in Meckel’s diverticulum****\n\n【18】Full size table\n\n【19】**Table 2 **Comparison of heterotopic pancreas found in different locations****\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【22】If HP is asymptomatic, as in our case, diagnosis is unlikely without surgical intervention.

Other features include low birth weight, microcephaly, hypotonia, and severe mental and developmental retardation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Most fetuses show sonographic findings including cerebellar hypoplasia, ventricular septal defect, ventriculomegaly, choroid plexus cyst, and nasal bone hypoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. It is estimated that 5p deletion syndrome affects one in every 20,000–50,000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a diaphragm defect, is a life-threatening anomaly with an incidence of 2–3 cases per 10,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. CDH is characterized by intraabdominal organ penetration into the thoracic cavity, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension. Recently, there have been improvements in the prenatal diagnosis and evaluation of CDH. However, information on the precise prediction of mortality and morbidity in CDH cases complicated with genetic changes, which is critical for parents, remains limited. Therefore, the outcomes of such rare complications should be accumulated for prenatal counseling.\n\n【11】Herein we present the clinical course of a CDH case complicated with 5p deletion syndrome, which was diagnosed prenatally.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 28-year-old Japanese woman was referred for 5 mm of nuchal translucency (NT) at 14 weeks of gestation. She and her partner had a 3-year-old healthy daughter, and the couple had no history of abortion. Following counseling, they did not agree to further prenatal examination. At 20 weeks of gestation, fetal growth restriction was detected, and at 24 weeks suspicious findings of a left-sided CDH and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) were observed in the fetus. The observed lung-to-head ratio was approximately 30%. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging revealed intestinal penetration of the thoracic cavity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 A, B, arrows)</u>, but liver herniation was not detected. Thus, the severity of CDH was estimated as moderate, with a survival rate of 50–60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.

In addition, fluorescence _in situ_ hybridization (FISH) also revealed the absence of a 5p15.2 signal 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 C, green spot)</u>. After discussion, the parents were determined to provide aggressive treatment to the newborn, who might have been refractory to treatment compared with CDH newborns with normal karyotype.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【15】Prenatal evaluation.

A 1542 g female neonate was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth were 4 and 6 points (appearance 0 and 1, pulse 1 and 2, grimace 1 and 1, activity 1 and 1, respiration 1 and 1), respectively. Immediately after birth, the baby was intubated with sedation and muscle relaxation according to the standard of care for prenatally diagnosed CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>, and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother was discharged 5 days after delivery without complications. The surgery for CDH performed on postnatal day 1 was successful. The evacuated organs were the colon, small intestine, and spleen, and no artificial membranes were needed. The baby was extubated 13 days after birth, but nasal continuous positive airway pressure was required for laryngomalacia. Antenatally suspected AVSD was not detected, but a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was newly found. The patient was transferred to the hospital near her home 42 days after birth, and was discharged without any respiratory support 91 days after birth. At 15 months, the VSD had closed spontaneously, and the infant could not stay sitting up unassisted.\n\n【18】The postnatal karyotyping of peripheral blood was confirmed to be 46, XX, del通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>(p14); however, the karyotypes of both parents were normal. Therefore, the deletion of 5p was determined to be _de novo_ . The child also showed the phenotypes associated with 5p deletion syndrome, including developmental impairment.\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】CDH can be a rare complication associated with 5p deletion syndrome. Several chromosomal anomalies are known to be related to CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Importantly, chromosomal abnormalities are often related to poor prognosis of patients with CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. However, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no data on the prognosis of CDH complicated with 5p deletion syndrome are available on PubMed. Thus, only general information was provided to the couple.\n\n【21】The pathological role of 5p deletion in CDH remains unknown, although few reports have suggested an association between 5p and CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. For instance, Cornelia de Lange syndrome often associates with CDH, and its most common cause is mutations in the _NIPBL_ gene on 5p13.2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. However, the present case retained the 5p13 region. Another patient with CDH presented a 5p15 microdeletion and microduplication of 12p13.3 in a mosaic unbalanced translocation (5;12) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The loss of the 5p15 region is consistent with the present case. In addition, a case of 5p trisomy with bilateral CDH was recently reported, in which the child died of aspiration pneumonia and paralytic ileus at 17 months of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Recently, part of the 5p deletion syndrome has been reported to be associated with rearrangements between different chromosomes, or with a deletion followed by a duplication in 5p, as revealed by microarray 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 16 \\]</u>. However, the reported patient’s microarray could not be conducted, and the rearrangements might be relevant to CDH. Thus, accumulation of additional molecularly investigated cases is needed to investigate and further clarify if an association between the 5p region and CDH exists.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【23】In summary, we present the clinical course of a CDH case complicated with 5p deletion, in which the patient survived and was discharged without any respiratory support after CDH repair. We believe that this study will be helpful in the prenatal counseling of parents of fetuses with similar diagnoses. However, further accumulation of such reports is required.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AVSD:</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Atrioventricular septal defect</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CDH:</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VSD:</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ventricular septal defect</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This is the first time in the literature that indices of ophthalmic artery Doppler sonography of women with preeclampsia were evaluated before and after the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Indices of ophthalmic artery Doppler sonography of six women with severe preeclampsia at 27 to 33 weeks of gestational age were evaluated before and after the use of magnesium sulfate (10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after the magnesium sulfate loading dosage. The patients’ ages were 26 years (patient 01), 29 years (patient 02), 20 years (patient 03), 21 years (patient 04), 20 years (patient 05), and 19 years (patient 06). The ethnic group of patients 01 and 04 was white and the ethnic group of patients 02, 03, 05 and 06 was mulatto.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The apparent increase in resistance index and pulsatility index values, although there is no statistical significance in this series of cases, and the decrease in peak ratio values after the administration of magnesium sulfate reflect an increase in the impedance to flow in the ophthalmic artery and consequently a reduction in cerebral perfusion after the use of magnesium sulfate. This may explain how magnesium sulfate protects women with severe preeclampsia against cerebral damage and prevents acute convulsions in these patients. We believe that this case series report may have a broader clinical impact across medicine because the mechanism of how magnesium sulfate can protect patients and prevent acute convulsions is controversial.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the most important causes of maternal death and the acute cerebral complications in women with PE are responsible for at least 75% of these deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>.

However, the anticonvulsant mechanism of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> is not fully elucidated and the cerebral hemodynamic effect of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> in PE is still under investigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 \\]</u>. The total peripheral resistance reduction properties of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> , which counteract the vasospasm induced by vasoconstrictor substances, can act on most types of calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle on voltage, receptor, and leak-operated membrane channels and as such would be expected to decrease intracellular calcium. Low intracellular calcium would inactivate calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase activity and decreased contraction, causing arterial relaxation that may subsequently decrease peripheral and cerebral vascular resistance, relieving vasospasm, and decreasing arterial blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Some authors have suggested that MgSO <sub>4 </sub> has a cerebral (and retinal) vasodilator effect in women with PE; however, if in most severe cases, women with PE have cerebral overperfusion rather than ischemia, the question is: How can MgSO <sub>4 </sub> protect these patients and prevent acute convulsions? 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Belfort _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, 2008, investigated the cerebral hemodynamic effect of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> in 15 women with PE.

All patients received antihypertensive therapy with hydralazine (5 mg intravenously administered over 2 minutes). The patients’ ages were 26 years (patient 01), 29 years (patient 02), 20 years (patient 03), 21 years (patient 04), 20 years (patient 05), and 19 years (patient 06).

The clinical findings of PE can manifest as either a maternal syndrome, or a fetal syndrome (that is, fetal demise, fetal growth restriction), or both. The onset of seizures in pregnant women with PE defines a severe form of the disorder called eclampsia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【56】The etiology of eclamptic convulsions is unclear. Cerebral vasospasm, cerebral overperfusion, excitation of brain receptors, and a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system have been implicated as etiologic agents of eclampsia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【57】Over the years, the available clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging findings have led to two theories to explain the cerebral abnormalities associated with eclampsia: cerebral vasospasm and cerebral hyperperfusion. The first theory suggests that, in response to acute severe hypertension, cerebral “overregulation” leads to vasospasm. Vasospasm and diminished cerebral blood flow are hypothesized to result in cytotoxic edema, ischemia, and tissue infarction. The second theory suggests that sudden elevations in systemic BP may exceed the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, a mechanism that aims to maintain adequate brain perfusion in abnormal situations, such as hypertension. Impaired cerebral autoregulation leads to forced vasodilatation, especially in the arterial boundary zones, with extravasation of plasma and red cells through opening of the endothelial tight junctions leading to a breakthrough brain edema. This phenomenon has been described as posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is now hypothesized to be the primary injury in eclampsia. The pathophysiologic mechanism of PRES remains under investigation; however, endothelial damage is recognized as a major feature in the pathophysiologic mechanism of PE-eclampsia and as a relevant risk factor for PRES 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 15 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【58】The management of PE has been focused on identifying women at higher risk of severe complications in order to prevent them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 \\]</u>. The use of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> is indicated for cerebral protection in women with severe PE. Since publication of the MAGPIE trial, which involved 10,110 women with PE in 175 hospitals in 33 countries, which showed a significant reduction in the rate of eclampsia in women with PE treated with MgSO <sub>4 </sub> , there has been a worldwide increase in the use of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> for seizure prophylaxis in women with PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Various theories have been promulgated to explain the mechanism of action of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> in the prevention of seizure, including peripheral neuromuscular blockade, membrane stabilization, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocking activity, cerebral vasodilation, and calcium channel blocking action 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【59】The anticonvulsant mechanism of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> is not fully elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 \\]</u>. Although some authors have suggested that MgSO <sub>4 </sub> has a cerebral vasodilator effect in women with PE, others studies observed reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure in those patients with high baseline cerebral perfusion pressure. As in most cases of severe PE, women with PE have cerebral overperfusion rather than ischemia, the reduction in cerebral perfusion after the use of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> should explain the cerebral protection of this medication in severe PE.\n\n【60】In the present study, we used Doppler velocimetry in ophthalmic artery to evaluate the hemodynamic status of the intracranial vasculature. Some studies have shown low orbital impedance flow patterns in cases of severe PE compared with mild ones, demonstrated by the elevation in ophthalmic artery PR and reduction in RI and PI. Although the mechanism of elevation of PR in severe PE remains unclear, the PR has been proposed to be the most sensitive indicator of vascular changes associated with central overperfusion in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 11 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 22 \\]</u>. The apparent increase in RI and PI values, although there is no statistical significance in this series of cases, and the decrease in PR values after the administration of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> observed in our study, reflect an increase in the impedance to flow in the ophthalmic artery and consequently a reduction in cerebral perfusion after the use of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> . This can explain how MgSO <sub>4 </sub> protects women with severe PE against cerebral damage and prevents acute convulsions in these patients.\n\n【61】Our proposal for a future study, following this research line of ophthalmic artery Doppler as a clinical tool to analyze the effects of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> on cerebral circulation, takes into account the feasibility of this procedure as a factor that could determine the success of the therapy. However, it would be important to include a previous analysis of the cerebral parenchyma by MRI, but it is necessary to consider the difficulty of transporting and executing MRI in a patient with a severe clinical condition. It is also important to consider the ethical implications because performing MRI could delay the beginning of the treatment with MgSO <sub>4 </sub> .\n\n【62】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【63】The decrease in PR values and the apparent increase in RI and PI values after the administration of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> reflect an increase in the impedance to flow in the ophthalmic artery and consequently a reduction in cerebral perfusion after the use of MgSO <sub>4 </sub> . This can explain how MgSO <sub>4 </sub> protects women with severe PE against cerebral damage and prevents acute convulsions in these patients.\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ANOVA:</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Analysis of variance</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BP:</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Blood pressure</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GA:</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Gestational age</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ISSHP:</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MgSO <sub>4 </sub> :</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnesium sulfate</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PE:</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Preeclampsia</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PI:</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pulsatility index</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PR:</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peak ratio</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRES:</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RI:</u>\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Resistance index</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SD:</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Standard deviation</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Her parents were healthy and non-related. The pregnancy was complicated and was positive for intrauterine growth retardation. Her birth weight was 1950 g, her length was 43.5 cm, and she had a head circumference of 29.3. In addition to postnatal growth delay, she had scant frontal hair, small eyes, hypertelorism, low-set of ears, flattened nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, down-turned mouth, three café au lait spots, and delayed dentition.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Despite the frequency of some phenotypes expressed in the different clinical cases reviewed and the present case, a common phenotype for patients with ring 15 could not be determined and it is restricted to the region of the chromosome lost during the ring formation.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Rings are aberrant structures that arise from random events during cell replication, which yield a circular chromosome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. They have been identified for all human chromosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Ring formation often results from terminal breaks in both chromosome arms, followed by a fusion event of the broken ends 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>. As a result, genetic material may or may not be lost, leading to different types of rings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Rings also occur due to the fusion of subtelomeric sequences like telomere–telomere fusion. This fusion might lead to complete ring formation with no significant loss of genetic material, as seen in patients with normal phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Due to the circular nature of the affected chromosomes, they tend to be unstable during cell division 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Sister chromatid exchanges due to cell mistakes during mitosis can result in chromosomal abnormalities that produce dicentric rings, interlocked rings, or ring loss leading to monosomy or mosaicism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.

The first case reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, described a patient with café au lait macules, strabismus, and diminished mental and motor development. Further clinical features ranged from cardiac problems to digit and musculoskeletal abnormalities.

Since the first case report of a patient with ring chromosome 15 syndrome in 1966, only 97 clinical cases have been published in the literature to the date. In addition, it has been suggested that the clinical phenotype is correlated with the amount of deletions and genomic imbalances during the ring formation and the instability of the latter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】This report describes the traits, demographic details, cytogenetic analysis, molecular diagnosis, and clinical manifestations of a baby girl with ring chromosome 15 and compares this case with other cases previously reported in the literature. The aim is to identify a common phenotype of ring chromosome 15 syndrome and improve our understanding of this genetic disorder.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】Our patient came from Coca city in the Amazon region of Ecuador; according to the ancestry profile of the Ecuadorian population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> she is a Mestizo: 63.1% Native American, 30.3% European, and 6.6% African ancestry. The first contact with our patient was in April 2016 at 11-months old, she was the second child of non-consanguineous healthy parents. Her father was 32-years old and her mother was 31 at the time of birth. Our patient was born at 38 weeks of gestation from a complicated pregnancy. Intrauterine growth retardation, hypermature placenta, and low amniotic fluid were detected during the fifth month of pregnancy. The infant was delivered by cesarean C-section. Her birth weight was 1950 g (<third centile), her length was 43.5 cm (<third centile), and she had a head circumference (HC) of 29.3 (<third centile). The Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) scores were 6–8. She required gastric probing, phototherapy, and thermo-cradle care for 10 days after birth.\n\n【15】At 15-months old after a physical examination, she showed a weight of 6000 g (<third centile), length of 63 cm (<third centile), and HC of 40 cm (third centile). In addition to postnatal growth delay, she had scant frontal hair, small eyes, hypertelorism, low-set of ears, flattened nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, down-turned mouth, three café au lait spots, and delayed dentition. Developmentally, she showed normal psychomotor progress. She held up her head at 3 months, sat down at 6 months, and walked with support at 15 months. Bone age was determined by bone densitometry.\n\n【16】A Giemsa trypsin banding (GTG) technique performed on our patient, at 450-band resolution, showed 73 out of 100 metaphases with a 46,XX,r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u> karyotype 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The parental karyotypes were normal. In addition, 750 ng of patient’s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was used for hybridization in the Affymetrix 750K Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The arrays were processed in the Fluidics Affymetrix 450 Station and scanned with GeneChip™ 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】Karyotype of the patient from the present study showing a 46,XX,r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u>\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】The arrays analysis revealed two copy number loss in the r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u>(q26.2q26.3) chromosomal region of 5,927,199 kbp, encompassing genes _NR2F2_ to _OR4F13P_ , and in the 15q26.3 chromosomal region of 3,459,976 kbp, encompassing genes _FAM169B_ to _OR4F13P_ 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. The analysis also revealed additional abnormalities in chromosomes 14 and X. In chromosome 14, our patient had a three-copy gain of genetic information at 369,716 kbp in the 14q32.33 chromosomal region, including genes _KIAA0125, ADAM6_ . While on chromosome X, there was a copy number loss of the genes _CT45A1_ to _CT45A6_ in the 119,101kbp region of Xq26.3 and a three-copy number gain of the genes spindlin family member 4 ( _SPIN4_ ) and _LOC92249_ in the 347,978kbp region of Xq11.1 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【21】**Table 1 Complete panel of ring 15 chromosome affected genes in the present case**\n\n【22】Full size table\n\n【23】**Table 2 Genetic abnormalities in other chromosomes in the present case**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】As a common phenotype for r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u> syndrome is not clearly described, we compared our patient case with 97 clinical cases of ring chromosome 15 found in the literature. In all 98 cases the average age at diagnosis was 10.85 years in females and 12.21 in males. The average maternal and paternal age at the time of birth ranged between 20 and 42 years (29.73%) and 22–46 (31.59%) years, respectively. Furthermore, the average weight and height for patients was 2252 g and 43.94 cm for females and 2345 g and 46.29 cm for males.\n\n【26】Among all phenotypic features, the following six were the most common in all 98 cases: growth retardation (76.53%), microcephaly (39.8%), clinodactyly (33.67%), triangular faces (32.65%), brachymesophalangy (32.65%), and low weight (42.86%). Other abnormalities for instance café au lait macules (25.51%), and psychological and behavioral abnormalities, such as developmental delay (27.55%), mental deficit (40.82%), and language deficit (27.55%) were also present 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【27】**Table 3 Complete panel of clinical manifestations in ring 15 chromosome patients ( _N_ \\= 97)**\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Ring chromosome 15 syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, which is still not completely understood. Ring chromosomes are formed due to a loss of the distal fraction of the chromosome, followed by a fusion event to the terminal region of the short arm of the same chromosome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. The size and position of the lost fragment determines the phenotype of the patients. As the nature of the chromosome is unstable and depending on what genes have been lost, the spectrum of clinical features can vary from patient to patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Copy number variations (CNVs) are one of the most referred causes of human disease pathogenesis because they often include important and functional DNA sequences. It has been reported that gene expression variability is highly related to CNVs larger than 40 kb, which is consistent with the number of copies lost in this study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Geneticists are no longer associating diseases with common genetic variants inherited through different generations, but with large and rare structural variants of recent origin (like ring formations). Large and rare structural variants of recent origin are responsible for serious conditions like autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability; intellectual disability is one of the most common phenotypes found in the different clinical cases analyzed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The clinical manifestations of the case described in this study fit well with previous ones reported in literature. In most of the cases, there is the presence of invariable size rings with a minimal loss of genetic material. We identified that there is a common breakpoint in most: the genomic region 15q26. Duplication, deletions, and gains in this region could be associated with different phenotypic manifestations as the region harbors different genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. For instance, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( _IGF1R_ ) is involved in normal growth and development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Mutations and changes in this gene, such as abnormal number of structures of receptor, can lead to different pathologies associated with growth deficit, such as Prader–Willi syndrome and Silver–Russell syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. The loss of one copy of the gene can also lead to abnormal head and body size. Other genes such as synemin ( _SYNM_ ) and tetratricopeptide repeat domain 23 ( _TTC23_ ) _,_ which play a role in the assembly of intermediate filaments in the Z-ring, are shared among previously described cases. Abnormalities in these genes can lead to musculoskeletal disorders, such as delayed bone age, digit and finger clinodactyly, and brachydactyly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】In addition, with the array analysis we found two other chromosomes involved in loss and gain of genetic material: chromosome 14 and chromosome X. Genes identified to be part of the region lost, Xq26.3, included several members of the family cancer/testis antigen family 45 ( _CT45_ ), such as _CT45A1_ – _CT45A6_ associated with oncogenic function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. On the other hand, gain of genetic material on region Xq11.1 involved genes _SPIN4_ and _LOC92249_ ; losses and mutations on these genes have been associated with periodontitis phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】The literature review for phenotype comparison 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 )</u> also led to interesting findings; the different phenotypes of all 98 reviewed cases were categorized. We reported the frequency of shared phenotypes and found that growth retardation, microcephaly, and a low weight were the main characteristics in cases with r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Figure 3 also shows phenotypes shared among the clinical cases in the literature with mental deficit, brachymesophalangy, clinodactyly, and triangular face as the dominant traits. Finally, the most shared phenotypes between all the cases were selected and compared 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u> with the aim of finding a common trait among the patients; we found that growth retardation was present in almost 80% of the cases. However, due to the low statistical significance of the frequency of the phenotype expressed by all cases, a common phenotype for patients with ring chromosome 15 could not be established and is highly restricted to the region of chromosome 15 lost due to the ring formation. It has been suggested that the clinical phenotype of patients with ring chromosome depends on two main features: the first is related to telomeric deletions responsible for the ring formation, and the second is directly related to the amount of DNA lost and the functional genes involved in this region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】**Fig. 2**\n\n【36】Shared phenotype frequencies among 97 clinical cases and the present case\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】**Fig. 3**\n\n【39】Shared phenotype frequencies among the 97 reviewed clinical cases\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】**Fig. 4**\n\n【42】Frequencies of the most common phenotype expressed by 97 clinical cases and the patient of this study\n\n【43】Full size image\n\n【44】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【45】Ring chromosome 15 syndrome shows a heterogeneous phenotype which is dependent on the region and the genes involved in the break, although there are some traits like the ones shown in Figs. 2 and 3 that have more than 40% frequency in the individual cases reviewed. Those traits can be suspected to be the shared phenotype of r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u> syndrome. Cases that show a breakpoint on genomic region 15q26 show common dysmorphic features, such as musculoskeletal abnormalities and growth retardation. Furthermore, cytogenetic and molecular approaches could facilitate the association of phenotypic and genotypic correlations. Further investigation and description of patients’ cases could provide an insight to the genetic aberrations involved in ring chromosome 15 disorders, in order to offer more information on the genes and the genomic regions affected.\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>APGAR:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CNV:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Copy number variation</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_CT45_ :</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cancer/testis antigen family 45</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GTG:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Giemsa trypsin banding</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HC:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Head circumference</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_IGF1R_ :</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>r通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u>:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ring 15</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_SPIN4_ :</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Spindlin family member 4</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_SYNM_ :</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Synemin</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_TTC23_ :</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 23</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Despite the use of these modern imaging methods it can still be difficult to distinguish the diagnosis of epidural varicosis from other causes, such as nucleus pulposus prolapse.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian woman who had been experiencing sciatic pain for seven years. A physical examination showed nerve root pain at L5 on the right side, with positive signs of neurotension. During an elective hysterectomy due to endometriosis, unusually pronounced varicosis in her lesser pelvis was seen that had not previously been detected. Postoperatively, our patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Findings from magnetic resonance tomography of her lumbar spine, in conjunction with our patient's history, were considered by the radiologist to be indicative of epidural varicosis. No further pathological abnormalities that could have been the cause of the nerve root pain were found.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In cases of epidural varicosis with irritation of neural structures as a result of inferior vena cava hypoplasia, surgical treatment leads to unsatisfactory results. Significantly better results can be achieved by resolving the cause of the vena cava pathology. In cases of hypoplasia or aplasia of the inferior vena cava this is not always possible; consequently, as in the case of our patient, only a symptomatic therapy in combination with an anticoagulant and compression therapy can be performed.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Low back pain with unilateral or bilateral radicular pain is mainly caused by protrusions of the intervertebral disc tissue that come into contact with the spinal nerves. Sometimes neurological deficiencies, in the form of paresis or bladder and rectal dysfunction, may also occur. The diagnosis in most cases can be made via computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n【10】The impingement on nervous tissue by spinal epidural varices has only rarely been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 4 \\]</u>. Despite the use of modern imaging methods (such as MRI, myelography and CT), it can still often be difficult to distinguish the diagnosis of epidural varicosis from other causes. Epidural varicosis often masquerades as a herniated nucleus pulposus, and the definitive diagnosis is usually made on operation.\n\n【11】We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian woman who was treated under a tentative diagnosis of a multisegmental lumbar disc protrusion for some years. After a diagnosis of inferior vena cava hypoplasia and updated diagnostic imaging, a diagnosis of epidural varicosis was finally made. The diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of this condition are discussed.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】We present the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian woman who had been experiencing sciatic pain for seven years. Her symptoms varied in intensity, and intermittent ambulant medical treatment was administered. When her symptoms increased, with the onset of sciatica radiating from the fifth lumbar nerve root on the right side, an MRI scan of her spine was performed and an intensification of conservative therapeutic methods under stationary conditions was planned. The MRI results (0.5T) were interpreted as a prolapse of the L4/L5 lumbar intervertebral disc, abutting the L5 thecal sac and nerve root, causing the pain in her leg.\n\n【14】Conservative treatment with a series of periradicular infiltrations (including bupivacaine and triamcinolone) in combination with physical therapy resulted in a decrease in her symptoms and our patient was discharged. Subsequently, she underwent an elective hysterectomy due to endometriosis. During this surgery, unusually pronounced varicosis was found in her lesser pelvis that had not previously been detected. Postoperatively, our patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Consequently, further evaluation of adjacent structures and diagnostic tests for thrombophilia were initiated. The pulmonary embolism was found to be caused by hypoplasia of her inferior vena cava, with a bilateral occlusion of her vena iliaca communis. A diagnostic evaluation showed that a collateral pathway with ectatic enlargement of the veins of her lesser pelvis had also developed. Anticoagulant medication in combination with compression therapy was recommended because a surgical correction of this malformation was not possible.\n\n【15】Subsequently, our patient was again admitted to our hospital because of an exacerbation of the nerve root irritation. She had classic root tension signs (straight leg raise and bow string tests). In addition, a greater level of pain was experienced with increased intra-abdominal pressure (when, for example, coughing, sneezing or pushing). More severe neurological deficiencies, in the form of paresis or bladder and rectal dysfunction, were not found. She was by this time severely incapacitated and bedridden.\n\n【16】Bearing in mind the hypoplasia of her inferior vena cava, a repeat MRI scan (1.5T) was performed. The MRI results, in conjunction with our patient's history, were considered by the radiologist to be indicative of epidural varicosis. No further pathological abnormalities that could cause the nerve root pain were found 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【17】**Figure 1**\n\n【18】**Epidural varicosis (arrows)** . MRI scan of the lumbar portion (transversal and sagittal).\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】According to our vascular surgeons, no surgical correction for the hypoplasia of her inferior vena cava was possible because it was a congenital defect. The optimal therapy to manage the progressive pain symptoms of our patient was then considered. Due to the increased risk of bleeding, the consideration of surgical intervention was abandoned and she was treated with peripheral analgesics in combination with low-dose pregabalin, with satisfactory results. In addition, compression therapy (class II) combined with Marcoumar (phenprocoumon) was carried out, which led to an acceptable decrease in her symptoms (target international normalized ratio; 2.0 to 3.0).\n\n【21】To date, our patient still complains of sciatic pain on her right side, but is able to work while on intermittent pain medication.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis of radicular complaints. A review of the recent literature and the case of our patient shows that the presence of epidural varicosis, without also being aware of a vascular abnormality, can easily be misinterpreted as being herniated disc tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Thrombosed veins appear hyperintense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Depending on the degree of thrombosis, an epidural vein on T2-weighted images may appear hypodense and hyperintense. Therefore epidural varicosis is often misinterpreted as herniated lumbar discs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In the literature, several pathophysiological models for the formation of venous epidural vascular anomalies are discussed. Gümbel _et al_ . postulated the possibility of primary epidural varicose veins without any underlying or extra intraspinal pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Wong _et al_ . suggested that varicose veins are due to the epidural mechanical compression of the venous plexus by disc herniations, spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Through venous stasis, an epidural vein thrombosis may occur over time with subsequent irritation of nerve structures.\n\n【25】Epidural varicosis as a result of an obstruction of the inferior vena cava has frequently been described in the literature. When an obstruction and/or occlusion of the inferior vena cava and vena iliaca communis is present, there is increased blood flow into the azygos and hemiazygos veins. Expansion of the epidural venous plexus, with potential compression of the neuronal structures, also occurs. Treatment with anticoagulant medication in combination with compression therapy, as in the case of our patient, is usually sufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In the literature, the alternative possibilities of thrombolysis and surgical intervention have been described. However, the results of thrombolysis are not convincing, so it is rarely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Genevay _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> consider that surgical treatment of an epidural varix is obligatory, but only if a neurological symptom is present. With respect to the nature of the surgery, different approaches exist. Reports on surgical thermocoagulation of the venous plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 – 12 \\]</u>, interventional techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> or surgical compression of the venous plexus with a resorbable gelatin sponge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> have been reported. In most cases, this leads to a good surgical result with significant reduction of the symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In cases of severe epidural varicosis due to a faulty inferior vena cava and dilation of all lumbar veins, the advice is against surgical intervention. This is based on unsatisfactory surgical results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> and disproportional surgical risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】Epidural varicosis with irritation of nerve structures observed on MRI should direct attention to the possibility of an inferior vena cava thrombosis or compression. In such cases, an MRI scan of the region around the inferior vena cava should be performed.\n\n【29】It is proposed that epidural varicosis due to inferior vena cava pathology can cause radicular pain. Knowledge of the existence of such a condition and its possible etiologies may assist in its recognition and improve clinical management of affected patients.\n\n【30】In cases of epidural varicosis with irritation of neuronal structures that develop due to hypoplasia of the inferior vena cava, surgical intervention gives unsatisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In contrast, interventions that resolve the cause of the pathology in the inferior vena cava lead to significantly better results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】This is not always possible where there is hypoplasia and/or aplasia of the inferior vena cava, so, as in our patient's case, only symptomatic therapy in combination with anticoagulation and compression therapy is possible.\n\n【32】Consent\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Histological examination revealed pancreatic metastasis.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Thought to be rare, metachronous cerebral pancreatic metastasis should be kept in mind in patients with pancreatic cancer. Early diagnosis and complete surgical resection play a key role in the survival of these patients.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality and one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Pancreatic cancer accounts for 4% of all deaths and is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The estimated 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer remains dismal. Recently published data showed that, in recent decades, mortality has been increasing in the USA, Europe, and Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u>. The mainstay of treatment remains radical resection combined with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is known for its local tumor extension to the liver; other common sites include the lung, distant lymph nodes, and bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 28 \\]</u>. Brain metastases are extremely rare and represent less than 0.6% of all brain metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】We describe herein a case of late metachronous brain metastasis in a patient known for biologically and radiologically silent adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas mimicking a high-grade primary brain tumor.\n\n【12】Clinical presentation\n---------------------\n\n【13】This 66-year-old right-handed Caucasian female was diagnosed 5 years ago 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> with unresectable adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas (T4N1M1). At the time of diagnosis, the tumor’s size was approximately 30 mm and it was encircling the celiac trunk, in contact with the splenic artery. It was associated with precaval and retrocaval lymphadenopathy. She therefore underwent needle biopsy, which revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9 were 21.3 μg/L and 900 kU/L respectively.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】**A** Axial reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) scan showing the tumor of the pancreas (\\*) with infiltration of peripancreatic fat tissues (black arrow) **B** Coronal reconstruction\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】She was initially treated with two cycles of FOLFIRINOX and 5-fluorouracil. Due to intolerance to this regimen, the treatment was switched to a combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine with a good oncologic response. She received a total of ten cycles. During the last oncologic evaluation, the CEA and CA19-9 were within normal limits. Of note, adjuvant radiotherapy was not given to the patient. On regular follow-ups 4 years later, thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed no detectable tumor or any metastatic lesions 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Posttreatment CT showing no residual pancreatic tumor\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Six months after the last oncologic follow-up, she presented to our institution with an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure, which was treated with levetiracetam. Other than headaches, the clinical examination did not reveal any neurological deficit. Neurological and physical examinations were unremarkable. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 5-cm cortical and white matter mass in the left middle frontal gyrus 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The mass had an extraaxial component attached to the dura matter adjacent to the frontal pole. The tumor had several large areas of central necrosis. Following gadolinium administration, avid contrast uptake was noted on the periphery of the lesion. T2-weighted images showed important vasogenic edema with mass effect on the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle that was provoking midline shift and subfalcine herniation. Laboratory analysis including liver and pancreatic function tests did not show any significant abnormality. The full blood count was unremarkable. Due to the good response to treatment, the rarity of cerebral metastasis in pancreatic cancer patients, the normal value of the last CA19-9, and these radiological findings, the most likely diagnosis was high-grade glioma.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】**A** Axial T2-w images show a cystic frontal lobe mass (asterisk) with evidence of significant surrounding vasogenic edema (black arrow). Brain compression and midline shift are evident on MRI. **B** Axial post-contrast T1-w images show the contrast-enhancing mass lesion (asterisk) throughout the left frontal with fairly well-encapsulated appearances. **C** Contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion imaging indicates high perfusion (green–red) in areas of viable tumor compared with baseline brain perfusion (black-blue)\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】The patient underwent left frontal craniotomy and surgical removal of the tumor. There was a dense, solid part as shown on the figures that was adhered on the dura without any areas of necrosis or any macroscopic evidence of thrombosed vessels.\n\n【26】The postoperative course was uneventful. She remained stable with no neurological signs or symptoms. Histopathological analysis revealed cubic to cylindrical cells with focal marked atypia 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. Immunohistochemistry revealed tumor cells diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7 and CEA. More than 50% of the cells were positive for TTF1, CDX2, and GATA3. There was no expression of cytokeratin 20, PAX8, WT1, or the estrogen and progesterone receptors. These results were compatible with a metastatic lesion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【27】**Fig. 4**\n\n【28】Microscope analysis revealed the tumor to be a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma surrounded by extracellular matrix (H and E)\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Immediate postoperative brain MRI revealed no complications 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u>.\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】**A** Axial T2-w images show a reduction of the mass effect and persistence of surrounding vasogenic edema. **B** Axial postcontrast T1-w images show a reduction of the mass lesion. **C** Contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion imaging shows a reduction of high perfusion (green–red) areas\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】Notably, during hospitalization, a repeat CA19-9 was abnormally high (221 kU/l). A repeat thoracoabdominal CT and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed bilateral pulmonary micronodules without any fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. It did not, however, reveal any recurrent pancreatic tumor or metastatic disease. She was discharged home on postoperative day 5 on Keppra. She thereafter received a total of 30 Gy of adjuvant radiotherapy on the surgical bed. At 6-month follow-up, she was doing well without any radiological signs of tumor recurrence.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】Pancreatic cancer, mostly adenocarcinoma, represents around 3% of all cancers diagnosed each year, affecting more frequently males older than 65 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 23 \\]</u>. Due to its silent nature and late presentation of symptoms, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 23 \\]</u> and a median survival of 3.9–7.4 months. Surgical resection is the best chance for cure, but only 15–20% of patients are candidates for pancreatectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Approximately 65% of pancreatic cancers occur in the head of the pancreas, 15% occur in the body and tail, and the remaining 20% may involve the entire gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 26 \\]</u>. It has been previously shown that patients with body or tail lesions had decreased median survival, increased frequency of metastatic disease, and were less likely to undergo surgery because head lesions cause symptoms earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 26 \\]</u>. In contrast to published works, our patient had an unusually long disease-free survival despite the unresectability of the pancreatic tumor.\n\n【37】Approximately 59% of patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma will develop distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Forty percent of these patients will be diagnosed with metastasis in the peritoneum, 38% in the liver, and 10% in the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) from pancreatic carcinoma is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 25 , 27 \\]</u>. In a series of 1229 patients with pancreatic cancer, Park _et al._ reported only four cases of cerebral (0.32%) and three spinal metastasis (0.25%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Similarly, according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010–2013)</u> including 13,233 patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer, the incidence of brain metastasis was 0.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Recently, Luu _et al._ reported a cohort of 2492 patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgical treatment where four patients (0.2%) suffered from cerebral metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. This low incidence rate likely reflects the short survival time of these patients, where death occurs before developing symptomatic CNS metastasis. Moreover, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are not systematically investigated for CNS metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 19 \\]</u>, likely resulting in underestimation of the incidence of asymptomatic brain metastasis. This hypothesis is supported by autopsy studies that revealed rates of pancreatic cerebral metastasis of up to 8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】The interval between initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and brain metastases varies between 2 months to more than 6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In the work from Park _et al._ , two patients presented with symptomatic brain metastasis 4–5 years following the initial diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. These two patients had concomitant lung or liver lesions at the time of diagnosis of cerebral metastasis. Our case has some similarities in terms of late metachronous presentation of the brain metastasis, but our patient was radiologically and biologically cured. Rarely, brain metastases can be the first manifestation of pancreatic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】The treatment of choice for cerebral brain metastases depends on the estimated prognosis and aim of treatment and may include surgical resection, whole-brain radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 14 , 24 \\]</u>. The treatment options have been discussed in detail elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. It is worth mentioning that, in general, if the primary tumor is not well controlled, surgical treatment for brain metastasis will not improve the survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Similarly, Park _et al._ reported that the cause of death was not due to the nervous system metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. However, as reported by Lemke _et al._ , resection of distant cerebral metastases originating from pancreatic adenocarcinoma can result in a significant increase in survival in patients with well-controlled primary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Lastly, there is no clear evidence for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for brain metastasis due to pancreatic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient received adjuvant radiation with satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【40】MRI findings in patients with pancreatic cerebral metastasis usually revealed a single intraaxial, cyst-like lesion, with an area of necrosis, irregular ring enhancement, and perifocal edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 19 \\]</u>. Moreover, pancreatic metastasis can be present as an isolated, small epidural mass to diffuse leptomeningeal spread without solid mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Rarely, patients can present with multiple metastatic lesions with simultaneous leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Our case presented some unique radiological findings. In contrast to primary pancreatic cancer that is hypoperfused on perfusion-weighted MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>, in our patient the cerebral lesion was hyperperfused. Moreover, in the majority of cases reported, there was either an extra- or intraaxial component. However, in this case, there was mainly an intraaxial mass with dura invasion and a smaller extraaxial component. Therefore, our initial differential diagnostic was glioblastoma versus gliosarcoma. Moreover, pancreatic metastasis can mimic radiologically other pathologies such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hemangioblastoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】The incidence of brain metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma is currently expected to increase because of prolonged survival due to improved treatment protocols. All patients with suspicion of metastatic CNS lesions should have cerebral CT scan and MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Neurologic symptoms led to brain imaging in all cases reported in literature, since routine brain MRI is not recommended for staging of pancreatic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, to improve outcomes, early detection is crucial. Recently, it was suggested that screening MRI for brain metastases should be performed in asymptomatic patients with extremely elevated CA19-9 levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Therefore, the current trend to perform contrast-enhanced cerebral imaging is advised by some authors even in asymptomatic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【43】We present a rare case of a late metachronous brain metastasis mimicking a high-grade glioma in a patient with a biologically and radiologically cured cancer of the tail of the pancreas. In our experience, surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy may be a good option in carefully selected patients. However, this remains an isolated case report, therefore further prospective studies need to be carried out. Lastly, clinicians should be aware of this rare entity, since its incidence may increase nowadays because of prolonged survival due to improved treatment regimens.\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Furthermore, various authors report that it is also hard to diagnose. It manifests with neurological symptoms at the affected wrist, which are usually induced by wrist movement, and can lead to partial or full loss of wrist function and sensitivity. The reason for reporting this specific case is that it was hard to differentiate between trigger finger and trigger wrist by clinical symptoms; no pathology was palpable or clearly seen on magnetic resonance imaging scan of the wrist. We propose a new diagnostic statement relative to this pathology.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A case of a 45-year-old white slavic man with trigger wrist associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by a fibroma of the flexor tendon sheath, is reported. Despite careful clinical examination, it was not possible to differentiate between trigger finger and trigger wrist. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to arrive at the right diagnosis but did not reveal any pathology in the wrist area. Carpal tunnel release was performed with a fibroma identified and excised. Wrist function was maintained well; no signs of carpal tunnel syndrome were seen at last follow-up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Trigger wrist can be misdiagnosed as trigger finger even if adequate clinical evaluation is performed, and this can lead to inadequate treatment. We state that, when clinical symptoms of both trigger wrist and trigger finger are present, except painful palpation of the A-1 pulley region, the case should be referred to as trigger wrist.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Trigger wrist is a rare pathology that can lead to loss of wrist function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 4 \\]</u>. It is defined as an occurrence of triggering or painful clicking at the wrist joint level, induced by wrist or finger movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>. Such symptoms are caused by temporary compression of the nerves in the carpal tunnel or extensor retinaculum area by tumor or adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most frequent reason for this condition is fibroma of the flexor tendons or tendon sheath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. We report a clinical case of a patient with complex trigger wrist caused by fibroma of the flexor tendon sheath. We believe this case to be complex and unique because of the difficult differential diagnosis between trigger finger and trigger wrist and unclear results of clinical examination. We also present a literature review and demonstrate the classifications used for this pathology.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 45-year-old white slavic male presented with 4-year history of “clicking” of the right wrist. For the last 2 years, pain at the right wrist joint level and fourth finger flexion failure had also occurred. All the symptoms were induced by wrist and fourth finger flexion and extension. Recently, the patient had noted weakening of the right wrist. Examination did not reveal any visible or palpable pathology at the wrist level. Weakening of the right wrist was noted while the patient was grabbing the examiners’ hand. Neurological examination revealed reduced sensitivity (pain) via the median nerve area at the right wrist. Triggering at the right wrist was noted during flexion and extension of the radiocarpal joint. Despite the obvious presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel’s sign was not present. MRI of the right wrist was performed: no pathological masses were seen inside the carpal tunnel. The compression of the right median nerve was confirmed by electroneuromyography. Carpal tunnel release was performed. An oval-shaped fibroma was identified in the carpal tunnel 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a)</u>. The tumor was attached to the flexor superficialis tendon sheath and was moving through the carpal tunnel via fourth finger and wrist flexion and extension. The fibroma was excised, and the wound was closed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b)</u>. A morphological study was performed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for differential diagnosis with peripheral nerve tumors 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. The tumor was composed of cells with a myoid phenotype 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 c)</u>. The postoperative protocol included positioning the hand in a resting splint, regular wound dressings, and antibiotics for 3 days. All fingers were left free for regular active finger exercises. The patient was discharged after 3 days of the postoperative period. Sutures were removed after 2 weeks after surgery. The patient was followed up at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the operation. During the last follow-up visit, there were no signs of trigger wrist or carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】**a** The release of the carpal tunnel.

This tumor in the development of relapse can also be attributed to fibromatosis, given its localization\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【19】Several classifications can be found in literature. Historically, the first classification of trigger wrist was offered by Suematsu _et al._ 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is based on etiological factors. Various authors report that this classification is not informative enough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Al-Qattan _et al._ 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> offered an extended classification. The reported case is classified as type A, which is the most common type of trigger wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】**Table 1 Classification of trigger wrist by Suematsu _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】**Table 2 Classification of trigger wrist by Al-Qattan _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】Differential diagnosis of trigger wrist and trigger finger is important 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, is usually caused by a size mismatch between the first annular pulley (A-1) and the flexor tendon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. More rarely it can be caused by a pathology inside the carpal tunnel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Unlike trigger wrist, trigger finger is a common disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The symptoms of trigger finger include clicking, snatching, or triggering in the finger area, induced by the finger movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Clinically, while palpating the A-1 area, pain can be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In the reported case, the patient expressed no pain around the A-1 area, so the presence of stenosing tenosynovitis was unlikely. However, if trigger finger caused by stenosing tenosynovitis is mistaken for trigger wrist, then this can lead to an unnecessary release of the carpal tunnel, which introduces the risk of damaging its structures and development of adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. The adhesions within the carpal tunnel can be an etiology of trigger wrist type E by Al-Qattan _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Another reason for the development of the adhesions is rheumatoid arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Giannikas _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and Minetti _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> reported several cases of trigger wrist induced by adhesions of flexor tendons inside the carpal tunnel, caused by rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【25】Park _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> also reported cases of trigger wrist with difficult diagnosis: clinically the condition was referred to as trigger finger, although there was a palpable mass inside the carpal tunnel and clicking occurred around the wrist joint area. It is stated that augmented CT scan was not informative enough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The diagnosis of trigger wrist was finally stated when the carpal tunnel was revised and an anomalous muscle belly was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our patient, carpal tunnel syndrome was present, but Tinel’s sign was not revealed—this phenomenon was also demonstrated by Macdonald _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The authors present a trigger finger case caused by a ganglion, located inside the carpal tunnel, with associated carpal tunnel syndrome and negative Tinel’s sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Similar cases demonstrating that trigger finger is not always caused by A-1 pulley pathology can be found: Parmaksızoğlu _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> reported three patients with trigger finger at the carpal tunnel level with the A-1 pulley intact. All of them were caused by a tumor inside the carpal tunnel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our patient, clicking and pain were located mainly around the wrist joint area, which was in favor of trigger wrist diagnosis. However, the fact of the fourth finger “locking” and other symptoms induced not only by wrist movement but also by fourth finger movement were the main factors to consider this case complex in terms of differential diagnosis between trigger finger and trigger wrist. Furthermore, the fibroma in the reported patient was not palpable and was not seen clearly on the MRI scan. We state that, in a case where clinical symptoms of both trigger wrist and trigger finger are present, except painful palpation of the A-1 pulley region, the diagnosis should be considered as trigger wrist. Pain around the A-1 area makes the diagnosis of trigger wrist less possible. Further research is needed.\n\n【29】A case of trigger wrist with a difficult differential diagnosis is presented. Despite the complexity of the case, a correct surgical procedure was performed. All the symptoms regressed, and the patient was satisfied with the treatment.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is included within the article.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation have been reported in the English-language literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. We present herein an additional case of posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation. Differential diagnoses for this rare entity are also discussed.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A healthy 53-year-old Japanese man experienced sudden onset of incomplete paraplegia after lifting a heavy object. The physical examination revealed that his motor strength was grade 0/5 in the right lower extremity and 0–2/5 in the left lower extremity. Sensory loss was observed below the level of the umbilicus. Urinary incontinence was also present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a posterior epidural mass compressing the spinal cord at the T9-T10 level 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. Compared to the spinal cord, the mass lesion appeared isointense on T1-weighted imaging, so detecting the mass with T1-weighted imaging alone would have been difficult. The mass showed slight signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging but was clearly detected after gadolinium administration, which showed peripheral contrast enhancement. Blood tests showed no abnormalities.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】**Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine.** Sagittal gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging **(a)** and axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging with fat suppression **(b)** show a peripherally and heterogeneously enhancing posterior epidural mass at the T9-T10 level, compressing the spinal cord (arrows).\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】The patient underwent emergency surgery consisting of laminectomy at T9-T10 with right medial facetectomy, removal of the mass lesion, and posterior instrumented fusion. The mass, which was not adherent to the dural sac, connected with the T9-T10 intervertebral disc space 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. The intra-operative diagnosis was thus a posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a degenerated cartilaginous mass consistent with sequestered intervertebral disc material.\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】**Intra-operative photograph.** The posteriorly migrated extradural disc fragment after laminectomy is apparent (asterisk).\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The patient had an uneventful post-operative course, with clear improvements in lower-extremity strength and urinary continence. He was able to resume walking without a cane by 4 weeks after surgery. At the most recent follow-up, 2.5 years later, he had no residual signs or symptoms.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Thoracic disc herniation is far less common than cervical or lumbar disc herniation. Only 0.15% to 4% of all symptomatic disc herniations occur in the thoracic spine通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Posteriorly sequestrated disc herniation is rare but is sometimes reported in the lumbar spine通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, only five cases of posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation have been reported in the English-language literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. All reported patients with posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation, including our patient, were men with a mean age at onset of 54.7 years (range, 47 to 66 years)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. Our patient and previously reported patients all showed a disc fragment with iso- to hypointense signals on T1-weighted imaging scans, slight signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging studies, and peripheral contrast enhancement通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】This entity should be considered among the differential diagnoses for an enhancing posterior extradural mass in the thoracic spine通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Differential diagnoses of a posterior epidural mass lesion, particularly a rim-enhancing epidural mass, in the thoracic spine include epidural abscess, epidural hematoma, synovial cysts, and extradural neoplasms. Although pre-operative differential diagnosis is important, definitive diagnosis of posterior epidural migration of thoracic disc herniation using MRI alone is unlikely because of the extreme rarity of this pathology.\n\n【23】Clinical information, including sudden onset with normal laboratory findings, may help in reaching a diagnosis. Five of six patients (including ours) with posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation presented with sudden onset of severe motor weakness通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. Generally, onset of neurological complications from neoplasm or synovial cysts is gradual, and absence of medical history or abnormal laboratory data is inconsistent with a diagnosis of epidural abscess or hematoma. Spontaneous hematoma may occur without abnormal laboratory data, but early-phase hematoma does not usually demonstrate enhancement通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A rim-enhancing lesion associated with hematoma is usually seen in its resolving state通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【25】Herein we report the case of a patient with an extremely rare presentation of posteriorly migrated thoracic disc herniation. The patient experienced sudden onset of incomplete paraplegia, and surgical treatment relieved the symptoms. Pre-operative diagnosis of posterior epidural migration of a herniated thoracic disc based on MRI alone may be difficult, given the rarity of this pathology. However, this entity should be considered among the differential diagnoses for an enhancing posterior thoracic extradural mass.\n\n【26】Consent\n-------\n\n【27】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

One case of a patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis was complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage caused by mycotic aneurysm rupture. A second case of a patient with right-sided valve endocarditis associated with a central catheter was complicated by an abdominal aortic mycotic aneurysm. The third patient had a splenic infarction and abscess associated with infected cardiac thrombi.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Complicated infective endocarditis is rare and is associated with cardiac, neurologic, renal, musculoskeletal, and systemic complications related to infection, such as embolization, metastatic infection, and mycotic aneurysm. Infective endocarditis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ is more frequently associated with complications. Because the mortality rate increases when complications develop, aggressive antibiotic therapy and surgery, combined with specific treatments for the complications, are necessary.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Infective endocarditis (IE) is associated with not only cardiac complications but also neurologic, renal, musculoskeletal, and systemic complications related to infection, such as embolization, metastatic infection, and mycotic aneurysm (MA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. We report three cases of patients with complicated IE; two were associated with MA, and one was associated with splenic abscess.\n\n【10】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【11】### Patient 1\n\n【12】A 57-year-old Chinese woman presented to our hospital with generalized weakness. Her medical history included hypertension and early liver cirrhosis caused by chronic viral hepatitis C (platelet count 104,000/μl). She had undergone mitral valve replacement (MVR) with a Hancock II 27-mm prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for mitral valve prolapse 1 month earlier. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, her breathing rate was 12 breaths/minute, her heart rate was 121 beats/minute, and her body temperature was 36.5 °C. She appeared acutely ill and was dehydrated. The result of an initial chest x-ray was normal, and the patient’s electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal prosthetic valve motion without evidence of vegetation or paravalvular leakage, but the patient’s mean diastolic pressure gradient was elevated at 10.3 mmHg 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. She had been discharged on warfarin and other medications after successful MVR without complications. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1b and Additional file 1: Video 1)</u> showed hyperdynamic echogenic material attached to the prosthetic MV. During preparation for redo surgery with administration of appropriate antibiotics, the patient suddenly had a generalized seizure with decreased mentation. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a , b )</u> revealed acute hemorrhage with perilesional edema in the bilateral cerebellum causing obstructive hydrocephalus, suggestive of MA rupture. She was transferred to the intensive care unit with an indwelling external ventricular drain (EVD) for monitoring. We performed a redo MVR with a Hancock II 27-mm prosthesis after resolution of her hemorrhage.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Transthoracic echocardiograms showing an elevated mean diastolic pressure gradient ( **a** ) of 10.3 mmHg and a hyperdynamic echogenic mass attached to the prosthetic MV ( **b** ) ( _white arrows_ )\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Brain computed tomography ( **a** ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( **b** ) revealing acute hemorrhage with perilesional edema in the bilateral cerebellum causing obstructive hydrocephalus, suggestive of mycotic aneurysmal rupture\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Additional file 1:** TEE showed a hyper-dynamic echogenic mass attached to the prosthetic mitral valve. (WMV 804 kb)\n\n【20】### Patient 2\n\n【21】A 70-year-old Korean woman presented with generalized weakness and headache. Her medical history included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her physical examination revealed her blood pressure was 163/81 mmHg and her pulse rate was 91 beats/minute. Brain CT revealed a chronic left subdural frontotemporal hemorrhage. After burr hole trephination was performed, generalized edema developed because of acute kidney injury (creatinine level 0.86 → 1.89 mg/dl). A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed. The patient developed a fever (38.1 °C) after 3 weeks, without a definite source of infection. TEE revealed a globular, mobile, echogenic mass (1.91 × 1.0 cm) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3a, b )</u> attached to the tricuspid valve. Blood cultures revealed _Staphylococcus aureus_ sensitive to vancomycin. The patient’s fever subsided after treatment with antibiotics, but a vegetation and persistent septicemia were noted after 2 weeks. We performed coronary angiography prior to possible valve surgery and observed no significant coronary obstruction, but a large saccular aneurysm was detected in the infrarenal abdominal aorta 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4a and Additional file 2: Video 2)</u>. CT indicated this was a newly developed abdominal aortic aneurysm (maximum diameter 5.2 cm) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4b, c )</u> that had not been present 2 years previously 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4d )</u>. The appearance was suggestive of an MA associated with IE. We recommended valve surgery and endovascular stenting or surgical removal of the MA in sequence, but the patient’s guardians refused. The patient was discharged to a private convalescent hospital and was lost to follow-up. We suspect IE developed in association with PICC placement and that persistent septicemia, despite use of proper antibiotics, led to an MA.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】**a** and **b** Transesophageal echocardiography revealing a globular, mobile, echogenic mass (1.91 × 1.0 cm; _arrows_ ) attached to the tricuspid valve\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】A large saccular aneurysm was detected in the infrarenal abdominal aorta by aortography ( **a** , _white arrow_ ) and computed tomography ( **b** and **c** , _white arrows_ ).

She had been diagnosed with a stroke in our hospital 3 months earlier. Other than fever (38.1 °C), she had stable vital signs. Although splenic infarction or embolism is common, splenic abscess is rare. In every patient diagnosed with splenic infarction, a search for the possible source of emboli should be performed, and IE is the most common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. There was no evidence of IE in this patient, but slightly increased mitral regurgitation (grade 1–2) (Additional file 3: Video 3 and Additional file 4: Video 4) was noted by TTE. TEE revealed a thickened, nonhomogeneous area with an echo-dense appearance around the aortic root 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6a )</u> and discontinuous endocardial tissue 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6b )</u> with flow communication detected by color and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6c , d )</u>.

A weblike structure with interruption of endocardial tissue continuity was noted 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 7a )</u>, and thrombi were observed within the pocket 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 7b )</u>.

(WMV 1254 kb)\n\n【41】**Additional file 4:** TTE showed increased mitral regurgitation. (WMV 1692 kb)\n\n【42】Discussion\n----------\n\n【43】IE is associated with cardiac, neurologic, renal, and musculoskeletal complications. Predisposing factors include the infecting pathogen, duration of illness prior to therapy, and underlying comorbidities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. IE caused by _S. aureus_ is associated with complications more frequently than other pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【44】MA can develop in the cerebral or systemic circulation in the setting of IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, and cerebral hemorrhage caused by stroke or a ruptured MA can cause neurologic complications. Direct bacterial inoculation, bacteremic seeding, contiguous infection, and septic emboli are the sources of MA. Intracranial MA usually involves more distal portions of the middle cerebral artery, as in patient 1, and unruptured aneurysms may be managed with antibiotics alone. However, ruptured aneurysms should be managed with a combination of antibiotics and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Patient 1 developed intracranial hemorrhage and a seizure; we initially attempted conservative treatment with EVD and close monitoring in the intensive care unit, and then we performed a redo MVR after stabilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The perioperative mortality rate for infected aortic aneurysms is 15% to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Survival is better for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms than for noninfrarenal aneurysms (96% versus 57%, respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, we suggest debridement of an infected infrarenal aortic aneurysm, along with extraanatomic reconstruction. The guardians of patient 2 refused all surgery because of the high morbidity and mortality risk.\n\n【45】In contrast to relatively common splenic infarctions in patients with embolic events, splenic abscesses are very rare and fatal complications of IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The treatments of choice are antibiotics, splenectomy, and valve replacement surgery. After patient 3 was stabilized with drainage of a splenic abscess, we decided to perform valve replacement surgery and debridement of the perforated intracardiac abscess pocket. The aortic and mitral valves were relatively clean, except for degenerative changes, but infected thrombi were noted in a phlegmon.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【47】IE is associated with cardiac, neurologic, renal, musculoskeletal, and systemic complications related to the infection (embolization, metastatic infection, and MA). Predisposing factors include the infecting pathogen, duration of illness, prior therapy, and underlying comorbidities. Complications can occur before, during, and after completion of therapy. IE caused by _S. aureus_ is associated with complications more frequently. Because the mortality rate increases with complications, aggressive antibiotic therapy combined with surgery and other specific treatments for complications is necessary.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EVD:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>External ventricular drain</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IE:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Infective endocarditis</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MA:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mycotic aneurysm</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MVR:</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mitral valve replacement</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PICC:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peripherally inserted central catheter</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TEE:</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transesophageal echocardiography</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TTE:</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transthoracic echocardiography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Because no consensus has been reached regarding the dysmorphology, thorough descriptions of conjoined twins as part of teratological collections can be useful to increase knowledge of this congenital malformation. In this case report, we describe a parapagus dicephalus twin from the collection of the Department of Anatomy of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. External anatomical characteristics were assessed through a detailed macroscopic examination and internal characteristics by means of whole-body computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (3 Tesla).\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Macroscopic examination showed a Caucasian male parapagus dicephalus tripus tribrachius conjoined twin a type of conjoined twinning in which there are two heads side by side, one rump, and three upper and three lower limbs. In addition, anencephaly was observed in the left twin. Radiological imaging showed a normal central nervous system in the right twin and absence of the calvaria, cerebrum, diencephalon, and mesencephalon in the left twin. There was clear duplication of the vertebral column, rib cage, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal system at least up to and including the first part of the duodenum. The heart consisted of a monoatrium with two separate ventricles. There was a fused liver with a single gallbladder, a single spleen, three kidneys, two bladders, and duplication of the penis. The third upper and lower extremities were articulating with a fused glenoid and acetabulum, respectively. The third foot showed both polydactyly and syndactyly of the toes.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case report describes a unique case of a male dicephalus parapagus tripus tribrachus conjoined twin discordant for anencephaly. Radiological imaging proved to be an adequate noninvasive method to provide insights into the internal (dys)morphology of this specific specimen, improving its scientific and educational value. This approach could be generally applied to other teratological specimens, thereby strengthening arguments regarding pathogenetic hypotheses, which may lead to new or improved insights into both normal and abnormal embryonic development.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Many anatomy and pathology departments possess valuable teratological specimens. However, due to lack of detailed external and internal (dys)morphological descriptions and proper diagnoses, these collections are sometimes stigmatized as “morbid cabinets” and not always used to their full scientific and educational potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Conjoined twins are often found among these collections. Conjoined twinning is a rare congenital malformation with an incidence of about 1.5 per 100,000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> that can be classified according to the most prominent site of union followed by the Greek postfix “-pagus,” meaning “fixed” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. No consensus has been reached regarding the dysmorphogenesis of conjoined twinning, which shows there is still much to learn about this congenital malformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The objective of this case report is to provide a detailed description of both external and internal properties of a unique case of a parapagus dicephalus tripus tribrachus male conjoined twin discordant for anencephaly. These findings will increase the scientific and educational value of this unique teratological specimen.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】The parapagus dicephalus specimen described in this report is part of the collection of the Department of Anatomy of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. The origin, gestational age, and original fixation and preservation method of the specimen are unknown. The specimen is currently stored in a plastic container with a preservation fluid composed of phenol, ethanol, and glycerol (0.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7% wt/vol, respectively). Its external anatomical characteristics were assessed through a detailed macroscopic examination, and its internal characteristics were evaluated by means of whole-body computed tomography (CT) (iQon CT scanner; Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3 Tesla; Philips). Fixed anatomical specimens have tissue characteristics different from those of live tissues, and scanning protocols were optimized accordingly. Tables 1 and 2 list the MRI and CT scanning protocols, respectively. Prior to scanning, the specimen was removed from its plastic container and placed in a disposable plastic bag to prevent dehydration. CT and MRI scans were assessed by a pediatric radiologist specialized in congenital anomalies. A pediatric urologist was consulted to macroscopically assess the genitalia.\n\n【13】**Table 1 Scanning protocol for Philips Ingenia 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】**Table 2 Scanning protocol for Philips iQon computed tomography scanner**\n\n【16】Full size table\n\n【17】### External characteristics\n\n【18】Macroscopic examination showed a Caucasian male parapagus dicephalus tripus tribrachius conjoined twin, a form of conjoined twinning in which there are two heads side by side, one rump, and three upper and three lower limbs.\n\n【19】#### Head and facial aspects\n\n【20】The right twin’s head and face were normally developed. The slight deformation of the nose was most likely the result of compression during fixation and preservation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a)</u>. The left twin’s face was flattened on the right side and positioned obliquely behind the right twin’s head 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a, b, and f)</u>. The left twin showed anencephaly 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b)</u>, wide intercanthal and outer canthal distance 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 and Fig. 1 g)</u>, and thickening of the philtrum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 f)</u>. All facial abnormalities in this twin could be the result of compression during fixation and preservation.\n\n【21】**Fig. 1**\n\n【22】External characteristics of the parapagus dicephalus. **a** Ventral view showing two heads, with anencephaly in the left twin, a shared thorax with a single umbilical cord, and two normal upper and lower extremities. **b** Lateral overview showing oblique positioning of the heads. The gluteal cleft of the left twin ( _black arrowhead_ ) and the three lower extremities ( _black arrow_ ) are distinguishable. **c** Detailed right-sided view of the genitalia showing two penises ( _black arrow_ ), of which the lower-positioned one is hypoplastic. The right perineal raphe ( _black arrowhead_ ) can be followed toward the anal opening ( _white arrowhead_ ). **d** Dorsal overview showing vertical ridge in the midline, the third upper extremity positioned between the heads ( _black arrow_ ), the gluteal cleft of the right twin ( _black arrowhead_ ), and the third lower extremity with a dysmorphic foot ( _white arrowhead_ ). **e** Detailed view of the male genitalia from the left side showing two penises and the left perineal raphe ( _black arrowhead_ ), which can be followed toward a small dimple ( _white arrowhead_ ). **f** Detailed view of the face of the left twin showing flattening of the face and thickening of the philtrum. **g** Detailed view of the face of the left twin showing wide inner and outer canthal distance. **h** Detailed view of the umbilical cord showing three vessels. **i** Detailed view of the dysmorphic foot of the third middle lower extremity with eight discrete digits, of which a single bigger toe with a split toenail ( _black arrowhead_ ) is seen\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】**Table 3 Body parameters and corresponding gestational ages for right and left twins**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】#### Neck and torso\n\n【27】The left twin’s neck was slightly shorter than that of the right twin. All observable hairlines appeared normal 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b, d)</u>. The ventral part of the rump showed a widened thorax and abdomen 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 )</u>. Two nipples and a single umbilical cord with three blood vessels could be observed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a, h)</u>. The dorsal aspect of the torso showed a median vertical protruding ridge, with an extra upper extremity at the cranial end positioned between the heads 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 d)</u> and an extra lower extremity at the caudal end 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b, d)</u>. On each side of the caudal part of this ridge, a buttock could be distinguished 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b, d)</u>.\n\n【28】#### Extremities\n\n【29】The left and right upper and lower extremities appeared normal 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a, b)</u>. The middle upper extremity was dysmorphic and consisted of one short segment with a single finger attached to it 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 d)</u>. The middle lower extremity was malformed as well and consisted of a normal-sized upper segment and shorter lower segment. The foot showed seven discrete digits, positioned wedge-shaped toward a single, bigger toe with a partial split toenail 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b, d, i)</u>.\n\n【30】#### Genital and anal areas\n\n【31】The male genital area showed a large single scrotum with two laterally positioned perineal raphae 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a, c, e)</u>. At the end of the right-sided raphe, toward the right gluteal cleft, an anal opening was observed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 c)</u>. At the end of the left-sided raphe, a small dimple could be distinguished 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 e)</u>. Cranial to the scrotum, two penises were observed, one positioned above the other. The cranially positioned penis appeared normal, but the other penis was hypoplastic 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 c, e)</u>. Both penises contained a urethral opening.\n\n【32】#### Body measurements and age estimation\n\n【33】Table 3 shows several body parameters measured to objectify anatomical characteristics and to roughly estimate the conjoined twin’s gestational age. The corresponding gestational ages were derived from biometric charts published by various studies on fetal growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Based on fetal growth parameters that could be reliably determined in the specimen (head circumference, biparietal diameter, and crown–rump and crown–heel lengths of the right twin and femur length of the normally developed leg of each twin), the gestational age of the specimen was estimated to be between 29 and 32 weeks.\n\n【34】### Internal morphology\n\n【35】#### Head and central nervous system\n\n【36】The right twin’s head showed a normal cranium 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u> with well-developed inner ears and a normal brain. A spinal cord was present in the vertebral canal, and the conus was observed at the level of thoracic vertebra T12/lumbar vertebra L1.\n\n【37】**Fig. 2**\n\n【38】Three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction of the skeleton. **a** Overview showing normally developed right twin’s cranium and anencephaly in the left twin. Two separate vertebral columns ( _purple arrow_ ) and three upper ( _green arrow_ ) and three lower extremities ( _blue arrow_ ) can be distinguished. **b** Dorsal view showing details of the third upper extremity ( _green arrow_ ) articulating with a joint (\\*) formed by the right scapula of the left twin and the left scapula of the right twin (scapulae indicated with _white arrows_ ). Three clavicular bones can be distinguished ( _orange arrow_ ). **c** Oblique, lateral detail of iliac bones ( _red arrow_ ) and lower extremities ( _blue arrow_ ). The third middle extremity is articulating with a joint (\\*) composed of the right iliac bone of the left twin and the left iliac bone of the right twin\n\n【39】Full size image\n\n【40】In the left twin, the calvaria were absent, and on both sides, not all semicircular canals and cochlear windings could be detected. No cerebrum, diencephalon, or mesencephalon was present, and clear pontine structures were lacking. A clear medulla oblongata could be observed. A small neural structure was seen in the posterior fossa, most likely a rudimentary part of the cerebellum. The vertebral column contained a presumably normally developed spinal cord, but the exact extent could not be determined.\n\n【41】#### Respiratory and cardiovascular systems\n\n【42】Both twins showed normal anatomy of the mouth, nose, and throat, and two separate tracheas could be distinguished. In the right twin, the lowest part of the trachea, the carina, was found at the level of T1, whereas the left twin’s carina was found at the level of T4 (normal being T4/T5). Both twins had their own pair of lungs 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u>, of which the medially positioned lungs showed no fissures, whereas the laterally positioned lungs showed one oblique fissure each.\n\n【43】**Fig. 3**\n\n【44】**a** Axial T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image showing a single atrium with two separate ventricles ( _red dotted line_ ) connected and two pairs of lungs ( _blue dotted line_ ). **b** Axial T1-weighted MR image showing a single, fused liver ( _green dotted line_ ) and two stomachs ( _brown dotted line_ )\n\n【45】Full size image\n\n【46】The heart consisted of a large single atrium with an auricle on the left side and a possible second auricle orientated more toward the right side. To this atrium, two physically separated ventricles were connected 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u>. Several vessels drained into the atrium. One central inferior vena cava entered the atrium on the right side at its caudal side. With respect to the thoracic midline, the medially positioned internal jugular veins from both twins merged before draining into the atrium. The right twin’s laterally positioned internal jugular vein drained directly into the atrium, whereas the left twin’s laterally positioned internal jugular vein was not detected. No pulmonary veins could be distinguished.\n\n【47】Each ventricle gave rise to an aorta with an aortic arch. Each arch had three branches toward the neck area. The aorta arising from the left ventricle arched to the left side, and the aorta arising from the right ventricle arched to the right. Both aortae descended on the right ventral side of the corresponding vertebral column.\n\n【48】The umbilical vein passed through one large liver as the ductus venosus, whereafter this structure drained into the single inferior vena cava. Two umbilical arteries were detected, which could each be traced back to an internal iliac artery. One iliac artery was positioned on the right side of the right twin’s pelvis, whereas the other one was positioned on the left side of the left twin’s pelvis.\n\n【49】#### Gastrointestinal system\n\n【50】In both twins, a clear, separate esophagus, stomach, and duodenum could be observed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 3 b and 4 b)</u>. The abdomen was separated from the thorax by one wide diaphragm. One large liver 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 b)</u> with a single gallbladder was observed, but no pancreas could be distinguished. A single spleen was positioned on the left side of the upper abdomen. Duplication of the intestine was seen at least up to and including the first part of the duodenum. No statement could be made about the exact extent of duplication of the intestine on the basis of radiological imaging. Only one distal colon was observed, which was connected to a rectum and anal opening on the right side of the scrotum.\n\n【51】**Fig. 4**\n\n【52】**a** Coronal T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image showing two separate esophagi and mirror-imaged stomachs underneath an overarching diaphragm ( _brown dotted line_ ). **b** Axial T1-weighted MR image showing the hypoplastic bone in the third upper extremity articulating with a cartilage tissue mass positioned between the left and right scapulae of the right and left twins, most likely representing a glenoid. **c** Oblique coronal T1-weighted MR image showing the femoral bone in the third lower extremity articulating with a cartilage tissue mass positioned between the left and right iliac bones of the right and left twins, most likely representing an acetabulum\n\n【53】Full size image\n\n【54】#### Genitourinary system\n\n【55】In total, three kidneys were observed. The right twin showed two kidneys with clearly observable, normally positioned adrenal glands. The right kidney showed normal anatomy, whereas the left kidney was dysplastic with multiple small cysts. The left twin showed a left-sided kidney that showed a more elongated shape with the suggestion of two renal sinuses and one adrenal gland on top of it. On the right side of this twin, an adrenal gland could be detected, but the kidney was absent. This combination of findings is suggestive of a renal duplication or crossed, fused renal ectopia in the left twin. One morphologically normal bladder was observed just above and behind the pubic bone. A possible second, smaller bladder was observed more left-sided and toward the dorsal body wall. Both bladders seemed to have their own urethra. No ureters were observed. The small, dorsally oriented bladder narrowed into a small segment cranially, suggesting a ureter stump. At the perineum, a large, fluid-filled single scrotum was observed. No testis could be identified in either the scrotum or the abdominal or pelvic cavity.\n\n【56】#### Skeleton\n\n【57】Two completely separated vertebral columns could be distinguished. There were three clavicles, of which the middle one was shared, positioned between both heads and oriented along the midline 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a, b)</u>. Two rib cages were distinguished 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. The medially positioned half of each rib cage was positioned more dorsally, and both halves were joined by a “dorsal” cartilaginous sternum. The lateral half of each rib cage was positioned more ventrally, and both halves were attached to a “ventral” cartilaginous sternum. Both twins had their own set of scapulae. The medially positioned scapulae of each twin articulated with the shared clavicle in the midline. The twins both owned a set of iliac bones, but they had only one pubic and one ischial bone each.\n\n【58】The left and right upper extremities showed a normal glenohumeral joint and bone structure. The third upper extremity was composed of one short, hypoplastic bone with one small digit bone attached 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. The epiphyseal cartilage of this extremity attached to articular cartilage positioned between the left and right scapulae of the right and left twins, respectively, most likely representing a fused glenoid fossa 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 b)</u>. The left and right lower extremities were normally developed. The third middle lower extremity was shorter and consisted of a single femur bone and one smaller hypoplastic bone. Its foot clearly showed discrete bones in all eight digits. The epiphyseal cartilage of this extremity appeared to articulate with articular cartilage positioned between the left and right iliac bones of the right and left twins, respectively, most likely representing a fused acetabulum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 c)</u>.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】Several consistent patterns regarding the internal anatomy of different types of conjoined twins have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 9 \\]</u>. For parapagus dicephalus twins, this pattern consisted of the presence of two separate brains, variable degrees of duplication of the spine, and a single shared pelvic ring. The location and extent of the shared viscera varied and depended mostly on the number of extremities, the extent of duplication of the vertebral column, the distance between both vertebral columns, and the width of the perineum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Even though many variations have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>, the morphological pattern of the male parapagus dicephalus tripus tribrachius conjoined twin discordant for anencephaly described in this case report is unique with its almost fully duplicated rump skeleton, heart consisting of a monoatrium with two ventricles, duplication of the penis and bladder, and the third foot showing polydactyly and syndactyly.\n\n【61】There are two main theories regarding the embryonic pathogenesis of conjoined twins: the fusion and fission theory. The fusion theory argues for a secondary fusion between two initially distinct embryonic discs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> _._ It states that the fusion of two embryonic discs is not random but can only occur at sites where ectoderm is absent or normally destined to fuse or break down during embryonic development (for example, oropharyngeal membrane). The second and most commonly accepted theory, known as the “fission theory,” describes incomplete division of the monozygotic embryonic disc around the primitive streak stage of development (days 13–14 after fertilization) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. One of the arguments supporting this theory is the incidence of mirror imaging in up to almost half of the thoracopagus and parapagus dicephalus conjoined twins, most frequently occurring in the right-sided twin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Levin _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> studied the cascade of secreted signals during gastrulation regulating left–right asymmetry. They found that when twin primitive streaks form at an angle rather than completely parallel, these signals can interfere between both twins, causing randomization of situs in one of the twins, sometimes resulting in mirror imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【62】The specimen presented in this report is most likely the result of incomplete splitting of the embryonic disc. Two parallel primitive streaks, closer at the caudal end and wider apart rostrally, could explain why the rostral region showed a more distinct duplication pattern of organs and structures (head and foregut structures) than in more caudally positioned organs and structures. Further supporting this assumption was the presence of mirror imaging observed in the right twin, best visualized in the position of both stomachs 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u> and in the orientation of the aortic arches.\n\n【63】In addition to the unique morphological pattern, the parapagus dicephalus specimen described here showed anencephaly in the left twin. Although not common, two previous case reports described the combination of these congenital anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Both cases concerned parapagus dicephalus dipus dibrachius twins. In the first case, the anencephaly was seen in the right twin, whereas in the second case, the left twin was affected. Any disruption of the dynamic sequential events of neural tube closure (NTC) can cause neural tube defects (NTDs), leading to deformities such as spina bifida, exencephaly, anencephaly, and craniorachischisis in the newborn. The occurrence of NTDs is explained by two theories: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> abnormal cell behavior (that is, insufficient cell proliferation, dysregulation of cell death, or inappropriate collective cell movement) that results in disrupted NTC or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> reopening of the tube, a theory also referred to as the “time window hypothesis” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Anencephaly is not the only NTD described in conjoined twins; spina bifida and craniorachischisis are also reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 18 \\]</u>. The frequent occurrence of the combination of conjoined twinning and NTDs suggests a common etiological factor contributing to both congenital conditions. To date, no valid hypothesis on a common etiology has been suggested.\n\n【64】This is not the first time radiological imaging was used as a noninvasive method to increase insight into the internal dysmorphology of a teratological fetus. Boer _et al._ used an approach similar to ours, in which 41 teratological specimens underwent both full-body CT and MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. With the wide availability of prenatal screening, most congenital anomalies are detected early in pregnancy, often resulting in termination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. This, in combination with the fact that stillborn fetuses are sparsely donated for scientific purposes, increases the value of scanning and describing teratological full-term fetal specimens of teratological collections. With radiological imaging, the fetus remains intact, and, even after long-term preservation, the radiological data have proved to be sufficient to describe most of the internal characteristics of the fetus. CT and MRI complement each other, with, for instance, skeletal structures best visualized with (three-dimensional) CT and MRI, providing more details on internal viscera and cartilaginous structures.\n\n【65】Significant limitations should be taken into account when working with teratological specimens from anatomical and pathological collections. First, most of these teratological specimens have been preserved long term in containers with formaldehyde solution for multiple years. Mechanical compression– and/or formaldehyde-induced tissue alterations could lead to deformation of external and internal structures, hampering proper morphological description.\n\n【66】Second, although modern imaging techniques are widely used in postmortem investigations, their diagnostic capacity is limited, and, in most cases, traditional autopsy remains indispensable for both diagnosis and determination of the cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【67】### Conclusion\n\n【68】This case report describes a unique case of a Caucasian male dicephalus parapagus tripus tribrachus conjoined twin discordant for anencephaly. Radiological imaging proved to be a successful noninvasive method of increasing insight into the internal (dys)morphology of this specimen, improving its scientific and educational value. This approach could be applied to other teratological specimens, thereby strengthening arguments regarding pathogenetic hypotheses, which may lead to new or improved insight into both normal and abnormal embryonic development.\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data will be made available if requested.</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FOV:</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Field of view</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>L:</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Lumbar vertebra</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA:</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NSA:</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Number of signals averaged</u>\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NTC:</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Neural tube closure</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NTD:</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Neural tube defect</u>\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T1w:</u>\n\n【89】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T1-weighted</u>\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T2w:</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T2-weighted</u>\n\n【92】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TA:</u>\n\n【93】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Total acquisition time</u>\n\n【94】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TE:</u>\n\n【95】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Echo time</u>\n\n【96】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T:</u>\n\n【97】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thoracic vertebra</u>\n\n【98】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TR:</u>\n\n【99】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Repetition time</u>\n\n【100】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TSE:</u>\n\n【101】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Turbo spin echo</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Although chemosensitive cancers, such as germ cell tumors, treated with chemotherapy should have sufficient dose intensity maintained to achieve the desired effect, many patients with cancer undergoing hemodialysis might be under-treated because the pharmacokinetics of anti-cancer drugs in such patients remains unknown.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We describe a 31-year-old Japanese man with a mediastinal yolk sac tumor treated with surgery followed by five cycles of chemotherapy containing cisplatin and etoposide while concomitantly undergoing hemodialysis. The doses of these agents used in the first cycle were 50% of the standard dose of cisplatin (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and 60% of the standard dose of etoposide (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) on days 1 through to 5; the doses were subsequently escalated to 75% with both agents. Hemodialysis was started 1 hour after infusions of these agents. Severe hematological toxicities were observed despite successful treatment. During treatment with concurrent hemodialysis, pharmacokinetic analysis of cisplatin was performed and its relationship with adverse effects was assessed. Compared with patients with normal renal function, the maximum drug concentration was higher, and concentration increased in the interval between hemodialysis and the subsequent cisplatin infusion, resulting in a higher area under the curve despite a reduction in the dose to 75% of the standard regimen.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Because of the altered pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics status of patients with renal dysfunction undergoing hemodialysis, pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics analysis is deemed to be helpful for effective and safe management of chemotherapy in patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Germ cell tumors of extragonadal origin have been reported to make up from 1 to 5% of all germ cell tumors. The most common site is the mediastinum, constituting 50 to 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In general, germ cell tumors are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and patients have a favorable prognosis. However, response of mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors to therapy is less than favorable, so these tumors have been classified into the poor prognosis group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. It has been reported that 40 to 54% of patients with mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumor treated with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection achieved long-term disease-free survival, but patients who relapsed after initial treatment experienced dismal outcomes with only 10% long-term survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is important to accomplish successful initial chemotherapy with an adequate dose.\n\n【10】Recently, the number of patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is increasing, and patients undergoing HD are potentially at high risk of cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy for patients undergoing concomitant HD have not been fully established and optimal doses of anti-cancer drugs and best timing of HD remains unclear. Many patients with cancer undergoing HD might be under-treated because the pharmacokinetics (PK) of anti-cancer drugs in such patients remains unknown and severe adverse effects are feared. However, chemosensitive cancers such as germ cell tumors treated with chemotherapy should have sufficient dose intensity maintained to achieve the desired effect.\n\n【11】In this article, we report the case of a patient with mediastinal yolk sac tumor who was successfully treated with cisplatin and etoposide while concomitantly undergoing HD. We carried out a PK analysis of cisplatin as part of a multicenter study and carefully considered the relationship between adverse effects and blood concentration of cisplatin.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 31-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with renal dysfunction in April 2014. He had a history of hypertension, hyperuricemia, and pituitary dwarfism, but had not taken any medications. He was 159.4 cm in height and 42.6 kg in weight (body surface area 1.398 m <sup>2 </sup> ). Initial blood tests showed anemia and renal dysfunction: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 64.6 mg/dl, creatinine (Cr) 5.66 mg/dl. A chest X-ray performed to evaluate cardiomegaly revealed a mediastinal tumor in his right thorax; a computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the mass to be a well-defined, homogeneous solid tumor (53×35 mm) in his anterior mediastinum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. An additional blood examination showed a high level, 322.6 ng/ml, of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, normal <9 ng/ml), but his beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was within normal range. A CT-guided biopsy of the mediastinal tumor showed the presence of tumor cells with mixed sinusoidal-like, cystic, and papillary structures 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a )</u> and Schiller–Duval body 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2b )</u>, which was positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 and AFP, and negative for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), β-hCG, and CD30 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2c, d )</u>, resulting in a diagnosis of primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor. Because of the complication of end-stage renal insufficiency, surgery was selected as the first treatment; following surgery, his AFP level decreased to the normal range. Subsequently, chemotherapy with cisplatin (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and etoposide (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) was conducted daily from day 1 through to day 5. HD was started 1 hour after infusions of these agents. Appendicitis with grade 4 neutropenia occurred, so an appendectomy was performed after the first cycle. In addition, grade 3 anemia and grade 4 neutropenia appeared under prophylactic treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Because severe hematological toxicities occurred, we conducted chemotherapy without dose escalation on the second cycle. In contrast to the first cycle, toxicities were admissible with 10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> cisplatin and 60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> etoposide in the second cycle. To elevate the dose intensity, the doses were escalated from the third to the fifth cycles: cisplatin to 15 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> and etoposide to 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as well as grade 3 anemia were sustained over 7 days in spite of prophylactic treatment with G-CSF. After five cycles of chemotherapy, his AFP level remained in the normal range and there has been no recurrence for 1 year.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Computed tomography scan confirms a solid tumor (53×35 mm) in the anterior mediastinum ( _arrow_ )\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Pathological findings of computed tomography-guided biopsy specimen. **a** Tumor cells with mixed sinusoidal-like, cystic, and papillary structures were observed (hematoxylin and eosin staining, ×20). **b** Schiller–Duval body was highlighted with _white arrow_ (hematoxylin and eosin staining, ×100).

Venous blood samples were collected five times each day: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> before cisplatin infusion, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> immediately after infusion, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> before HD, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> after HD, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> 4 hours after HD on days 1 to 5. In addition, blood was collected before HD on day 8 once in each course 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The time-concentration curve in the third cycle is shown in Fig. 4 . Our patient was administered 15 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> cisplatin, and maximum concentration (Cmax) of free cisplatin was 0.8 to 0.9 μg/mL. Just before treatment with cisplatin, the concentration had not recovered to the level observed after the previous HD. The concentration before infusion of cisplatin gradually increased each day during the 5 days of treatment, and this phenomenon was observed until 8 days after the start of chemotherapy. During the fourth cycle, chemotherapy was administered using the same doses used in the third cycle, and PK was similar to that of the third cycle.\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】Schedule of chemotherapy, hemodialysis, and blood sampling. In the third and fourth chemotherapy cycles, cisplatin (15 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and etoposide (75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) was conducted daily from day 1 through to day 5. Hemodialysis was started 1 hour after infusions of these agents. Venous blood samples were collected five times each day: ( _1_ ) before cisplatin infusion, ( _2_ ) immediately after infusion, ( _3_ ) before hemodialysis, ( _4_ ) after hemodialysis, and ( _5_ ) 4 hours after hemodialysis on days 1 to 5.

In our case, it was considered likely that standard chemotherapy would not be efficacious because of end-stage renal insufficiency, so surgery was selected as the first treatment so as not to miss the opportunity for complete tumor resection. In addition, bleomycin and active metabolite of ifosfamide are known not to be sufficiently removed by HD, resulting in enhanced toxicities such as pulmonary fibrosis, disturbance of consciousness, and convulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 – 14 \\]</u>. Therefore, we selected combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, and doses of these agents used in the first cycle were 50% of the standard dose of cisplatin (10 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and 60% of the standard dose of etoposide (60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) on days 1 through 5 according to previous reports, and the doses were subsequently escalated to 75% with both agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, the rationale for using these dosages, especially that of cisplatin, has not been elucidated because of a paucity of PK studies involving patients with HD. Froehner _et al._ reported that they started the treatment from 50% reduction of cisplatin according to guidelines on testicular cancer, and then escalated to 100% of standard dose after monitoring adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In this case, we obtained PK results for cisplatin during cycles 3 and 4 in cooperation with Kyoto University. The findings are as follows, compared with patients with normal renal function administered 100% standard doses of cisplatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the Cmax of free cisplatin was higher, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> concentration gradually increased after HD up to the subsequent infusion of cisplatin 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. The higher Cmax might be related to our patient’s low volume of distribution caused by pituitary dwarfism rather than renal insufficiency. Immediately after HD, the concentrations were lower, equivalent to those in patients with normal renal function based on previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, his free cisplatin concentration rose 4 hours after HD, and gradual accumulation of free cisplatin was observed up until the subsequent treatment with cisplatin. Pronounced elevation of free cisplatin concentration may be due to redistribution from peripheral tissues and reduced excretion of free cisplatin, resulting in an elevated area under the curve (AUC) of free cisplatin leading to severe hematological toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 – 18 \\]</u>. Although nephrotoxicity has not been thought to be a limitation in HD patients, dose-related adverse effects are often observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, and dose reduction is inevitable just as in our case. Because of the altered PK pharmacodynamics (PD) status of patients with renal dysfunction undergoing HD, determination of cisplatin dosage should be based on monitored concentration to conduct effective and safe chemotherapy.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【31】Malignancies sensitive to chemotherapy require careful maintenance of dose intensity, but this should be performed safely. PK analysis is deemed to be useful for appropriate chemotherapy in patients undergoing HD. Additional evidence from other similar patients is needed to establish suitable chemotherapy regimens for patients with concomitant renal insufficiency.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AFP:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Alpha-fetoprotein</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUC:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Area under the curve</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BEP:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>β-hCG:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BUN:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Blood urea nitrogen</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CK:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cytokeratin</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cmax:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Maximum concentration</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cr:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Creatinine</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>G-CSF:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HD:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hemodialysis</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IGCCC:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>International Germ Cell Consensus Classification</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IHC:</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Immunohistochemistry</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PD:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pharmacodynamics</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PK:</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pharmacokinetics</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PLAP:</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Placental alkaline phosphatase</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VIP:</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In addition, he had some dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures, flat occiput, and mild webbing of the neck. His length and occipital frontal circumference (OFC) at birth were 47 and 32 cm, respectively. During the hospital stay, the baby was well fed and his serum electrolyte levels and serum calcium levels remained normal throughout. Moreover, there were no documented hypoglycemic events or neonatal jaundice.\n\n【13】Subsequent investigations on day 14 of life showed normal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and 17-OH progesterone (17-OHP), with elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone level suggesting gonadal failure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Ultrasound of abdomen and scrotum revealed normal adrenal glands with no evidence of persistent Müllerian structures. There was no radiological evidence of radio ulnar synostosis. Karyotyping demonstrated chromosomal aneuploidy of 49XXXXY syndrome. Parents were advised to register the sex of the child as male and advised regarding follow-up and the need for hormone replacement therapy during puberty.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Investigation summary**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】The child was followed up at the endocrinology clinic at 3 months to assess growth and development. Surgical referral was done at 6 months of age for correction of perineal hypospadias, and surgery is planned for 1 year and 3 months of age.\n\n【17】At age 1 year, the child’s growth parameters included weight below the 3rd centile (6.8 kg) and length between the 3rd and 15th centile (72 cm) according to WHO growth charts. His development at the age of 1 year was delayed, and he was commenced on physiotherapy, occupation therapy, and speech therapy at the local hospital. Follow-up ultrasound (USS) of abdomen and pelvis at 1 year was normal except for nonobstructive right-side renal calculus of 3.5 mm.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】In 1960, Fraccaro _et al_ . reported the first case of 49XXXXY syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This is the rarest X chromosome aneuploidy, with approximate incidence of 1:85,000–100,000 male births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Nondisjunction of X chromosomes during both meiosis I and II is the probable chromosomal anomaly leading to 49XXXXY syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Initially this was considered as a variant of Klinefelter syndrome, but the prevalence of moderate to severe mental retardation with low intelligence quotient (IQ) and multiple associated malformations in 49XXXXY syndrome demarcates the differences between these two clinical entities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The classic triad of symptoms includes mental retardation, hypogonadism, and radioulnar synostosis, though our patient did not have the latter finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Other clinical manifestations include microcephaly with short stature; distinct facial features such as round face, ocular hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures, flat nasal bridge, and cleft palate; musculoskeletal defects such as genu valgum, pes cavus or planus, clinodactyly, scoliosis, hip dysplasia and hypotonia; congenital heart defects, with patent ductus arteriosus being the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>; and delayed neurocognitive development with low IQ levels. Moreover, it can be associated with immunodeficiency, making patients susceptible to infections.\n\n【22】A few case reports have highlighted the association of genital ambiguity with this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. One such case describes a 2-month-old baby with micropenis and right undescended testes. Another newborn had a normal stretched penile length with penoscrotal hypospadias and bifid scrotum, with 1 ml testes _in situ_ bilaterally. A 26-month-old baby had bilateral undescended testes with the penis buried with a urethral shelf at the urethral opening and penoscrotal webbing. In contrast to these, our patient had a unique presentation with micropenis, perineal hypospadias, and bifid scrotum with small palpable testes.\n\n【23】There has been a reported case of diabetes mellitus in an 18-year-old 49XXXXY patient, though this is common among children with Klinefelter syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Behavioral and development aspects in view of 49XXXXY have been studied widely, and many elderly patients with this syndrome had emotional lability, low frustration levels and shyness, occasional irritability, temper tantrums, and resistance to routine change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 \\]</u>. Marked delay was noted in language and speech development, with a clear discrepancy between language expression and comprehension. This child already had speech delay, and he needed further follow-up for assessment.\n\n【25】Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism needs to be evaluate at the age of puberty, and hormone replacement therapy with intramuscular (IM) testosterone should be initiated under endocrinology follow-up.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【27】Knowing the association of 49XXXXY syndrome in this child with ambiguous genitalia is beneficial as a multidisciplinary approach can be adopted for further management to ensure quality of life. Also, it is important to consider this rare possibility in a child with ambiguous genitalia and to stress the importance of karyotyping for evaluation.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It has been suggested that sarcoidosis might be due to the exposure to infectious or non-infectious agents in genetically susceptible individuals. In particular, _Propionibacterium acnes_ and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ have been considered causative microorganisms. We report a case of _P. acnes_ \\-associated sarcoidosis in which a drastic improvement was achieved with clarithromycin administration. A possible mechanism of clarithromycin action is discussed.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 78-year-old Japanese-Mongoloid woman with _P. acnes_ \\-associated sarcoidosis presented with a persisting fever, joint pains and generalized lymph node swelling. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by pathological and immunohistochemical studies of a biopsied lymph node. In this case, an oral administration of clarithromycin was applied. Soon after the initiation of this treatment her symptoms as well as lymph node swelling disappeared. The clarithromycin treatment was discontinued 3.5 months after its initiation. She is currently in good condition. The pathological analysis of her lymph node, which was obtained during the clarithromycin treatment, suggested an apoptosis-inducing effect of clarithromycin on the sarcoid granulomas.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Clarithromycin was found to be effective for treating sarcoidosis and seems to have important pharmacological effects such as immunosuppression, immunomodulation and induction of apoptosis in addition to its antimicrobial role.

The disease involves predominantly the skin, eyes, lungs and lymph nodes, especially the hilar lymph nodes. Many studies of sarcoidosis have suggested that it might be due to the exposure to infectious or non-infectious agents in genetically susceptible individzuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In particular, _Propionibacterium acnes_ ( _P. acnes_ ) and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ have been studied extensively as causative microorganisms. Latent infection of _P. acnes_ has been emphasized as a cause of sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, since _P. acnes_ is the only microorganism that has been isolated from sarcoid lesions by bacterial culture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Clarithromycin (CAM), a member of the macrolide family, is a widely used antimicrobial drug. It is also known to have other important pharmacological effects such as immunosuppression or immunomodulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. We report here a rare case of sarcoidosis in which a drastic improvement was achieved with CAM administration. A possible mechanism of CAM action including its antimicrobial, immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory and apoptosis-inducing effects in the treatment of sarcoidosis is discussed.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 78-year-old Japanese-Mongoloid woman (body weight: 48kg) with a 3-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia visited our hospital because of a persisting fever and generalized joint pains which had developed 2 weeks before initial presentation. She had been treated as having a common cold at a local clinic for 2 weeks previously, but her symptoms had not improved. After visiting our hospital, a drip infusion therapy of cefpirome with oral administration of loxoprofen was initiated on an out-patient basis. However, this treatment was not effective for the fever but caused toxic eruptions on the back of both her hands. Thus, this treatment was suspended 3 days later. She was admitted 4 days after initial presentation. Neither respiratory nor ocular symptoms were present. She had past history of panhysterectomy due to uterine cancer at the age of 38 and a fracture of her left wrist joint at the age of 68. She had no environmental or occupational history of beryllium or other metal exposure. A physical examination on admission showed bilateral inguinal and axillary lymph node swelling and erythematous eruptions on the back of both her hands. A chest X-ray showed minimal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL); however, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan clearly revealed mild BHL without pulmonary infiltrates 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. Since respiratory function tests were normal, bronchoscopy was not performed. Electrocardiogram and ophthalmologic evaluations were normal. A complete blood cell count showed slight anemia (red blood cell count, 3.70×10 <sup>12 </sup> /L; hemoglobin, 10.8g/dL), slight leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 11.9×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with 74% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 1% basophils) and normal platelet count (360×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (110mm/hour), C-reactive protein (CRP; 13.73mg/dL; normal range 0 to 0.26mg/dL), soluble-interleukin (IL)-2 receptors (s-IL2R; 1300IU/mL; normal range 124 to 466IU/mL), antinuclear antibodies (×640; normal range <×40) and ferritin (722ng/mL; normal range 39.4 to 340ng/mL), and reduced levels of serum iron (34μg/dL; normal range 54 to 181μg/dL) and albumin (2.5g/dL; normal range 3.9 to 4.9g/dL) were observed. Serum electrolytes and renal function indices were normal. Rheumatoid arthritis particle agglutination, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), anti-Sm, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-microsome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibody titers were within normal limits. No increments of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and lysozyme were seen. The results of an anti-acid fast bacterium antibody and a tuberculin skin test were negative (0×0mm). Serologic tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Serum Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ titers showed prior infection patterns. The results of serologic studies for _Cytomegalovirus_ , _Brucella_ , _Legionella_ , _Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma_ and _Toxoplasma_ were negative _._ Her urine showed nothing remarkable.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】**Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan images on admission.

In the present case, the sarcoid granulomas were somewhat diminished in size and number, and ill defined from surrounding tissue 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 B)</u>. In addition, some of the giant cells showed condensed heterochromatin 通用删除1(英):<u>(pyknosis; Figure 3 A)</u>, multiple fragmented nuclei 通用删除1(英):<u>(apoptotic bodies; Figure 4 A)</u> and multiple nuclear remnants with indistinct nuclear configurations in the eosinophilic condensed cytoplasm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4 B)</u>. These findings indicate that the giant cells were, although atypical, in the apoptotic process according to the features described by Wyllie _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These degenerated giant cells appeared to have transformed into eosinophilic homogenous substances with fibrotic configuration 通用删除1(英):<u>(that is, hyaline-like degeneration; Figure 4 C)</u>. The degenerating/degenerated giant cells showed slightly increased stainability with periodic acid–Schiff 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4 D)</u>. Neither acid-fast bacterium nor fungus was demonstrated by Ziehl–Neelsen and Grocott stains (not shown). Immunohistochemical staining for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ showed a negative result (not shown). EBV-encoded small ribonucleic acid (RNA) was not detected in the sarcoid granulomas (not shown). To demonstrate the presence of _P. acnes_ in the granulomas, the lymph node specimens were tested by immunohistochemistry using a specific monoclonal antibody against _P. acnes_ lipoteichoic acid (PAB antibody). PAB-positive reaction products were observed preferentially in the degenerated homogenous substances.

Infiltrated plasma cells were positive for IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgG4 at different degrees. Positive reactions for IgG4 were only occasionally seen in the plasma cells, thus negating the possibility of IgG4-related disease. Some of the giant cells and degenerated homogenous substances were positively stained with anti-IgG antibody, and the reaction was more intense in degenerating/degenerated giant cells than in intact ones 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 6 A)</u>. The giant cells were faintly stained with anti-IgD antibody 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 6 B)</u> but not with anti-IgA (not shown), anti-IgM (not shown) and anti-IgG4 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 6 C)</u> antibodies.\n\n【31】**Figure 6**\n\n【32】**Immunohistochemical staining of the lymph node for immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin D and immunoglobulin G4.

After the initiation of this treatment, her fever rapidly subsided coupled with the disappearance of joint pains and toxic eruptions within 1 week. The elevated levels of CRP returned to normal within 2 weeks and elevated s-IL2R levels were remarkably decreased within 3 weeks 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 7 )</u>. She was discharged 25 days after admission and followed as an out-patient. Administration of acetaminophen was suspended at the time of discharge. The levels of s-IL2R returned to normal within 2 months. The follow-up PET-CT scan 2 months after admission showed minimal FDG uptake in her bilateral hilar lymph nodes and distinct uptake at submandibular dental roots and in peripharyngeal lymph nodes. The FDG uptake in her spleen also disappeared 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 8 )</u>. CAM treatment was discontinued 3.5 months after its initiation. No unfavorable adverse effects were observed with CAM. During the course of illness, the patient was found to have urinary bladder cancer, which was successfully removed by endoscopy in the urologic department of another hospital. Her levels of s-IL2R remained slightly elevated (less than 750IU/mL) after cessation of CAM treatment without any symptoms. She stopped visiting our hospital 1.5 years after initial presentation because of traffic inconvenience to visit the hospital. Recently, she visited our hospital to undergo medical check-ups and was told that she was in good condition.\n\n【35】**Figure 7**\n\n【36】**Clinical course during admission.** After the initiation of clarithromycin treatment, the fever subsided within 1 week. The elevated levels of C-reactive protein returned to normal within 2 weeks and elevated soluble-interleukin-2 receptor levels were remarkably depressed within 3 weeks.

The spleen (yellow arrow) shows no <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. However, submandibular dental roots (blue arrow) and peripharyngeal lymph nodes (black arrow) still show <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake.\n\n【40】Full size image\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】Although the exact cause of sarcoidosis is still unknown, the current working hypothesis suggests that it is caused by alteration of the immune response after exposure to environmental, occupational or infectious agents in genetically susceptible individuals. Among the infectious agents, mycobacterial and propionibacterial organisms are most commonly implicated as potential etiologic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 4 , 8 – 10 \\]</u>. In particular, _P. acnes_ is the only microorganism that has been isolated from sarcoid lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Many fragments of _P. acnes_ nucleic acids have been detected in sarcoid lymph nodes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 – 13 \\]</u> and _in situ_ hybridization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. All available evidence has suggested the concept that the disease results from an exaggerated Th1 immune response to specific antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 8 , 14 \\]</u>. Moller _et al._ suggested that IL-12 induction and amplification of Th1 responses probably play an important role in the granuloma development in sarcoidosis through the effect of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) on macrophage activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The fact that the sarcoid granulomas can be experimentally induced in mice by administration of a recombinant trigger-factor protein of _P. acnes_ lends supportive evidence for hypersensitivity to _P. acnes_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】In the present case, _P. acnes_ was detected immunohistochemically using PAB antibody. Positive reaction products were found preferentially in eosinophilic degenerated homogenous substances. The presence of _P. acnes_ in the lymph node seems to be the supportive evidence for diagnosing sarcoidosis. Furthermore, its presence in the lymph node indicates that the sarcoidosis was caused by _P. acnes_ infection. The pathology of the lymph node in this case was key to understanding the degenerative process of Langhans giant cells. Some of the degenerating/degenerated giant cells showed apoptotic features. In addition, morphological transition from degenerated giant cells to hyaline-like substances was also observed. Thus, many giant cells were seen to undergo apoptosis due to the CAM treatment. Taking into account the apoptosis in the giant cells, it is possible that epithelioid cells might also have been involved in apoptosis. However, it was difficult to identify apoptotic features in individual epithelioid cells in the granulomas at the light microscopic level. The presence of IgG and IgD in the giant cells might be related to the apoptotic process because IgG was stained more intensely in the degenerating/degenerated giant cells as well as in the hyaline-like substances than in the intact giant cells. The presence of IgG and IgD in the giant cells might be due to incorporation of Igs by endocytosis or increased permeability of the cell membrane. In this connection, the incorporation of M-protein (IgG), possibly by endocytosis, has been demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy in various bone marrow cells such as erythroblasts, monocytes, reticulum cells, megakaryocytes, and stromal cells in a case of IgG-κ type multiple myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Thus, it is not surprising that the IgG and IgD were detected immunohistochemically in the giant cells. Non-specific reaction for IgG and IgD seems improbable because no positivity for IgG4, IgA, and IgM was demonstrated in the giant cells by the same immunohistochemical procedure. The exact mechanism and the significance of incorporated Igs remain to be elucidated, but this may reflect the degree of degeneration of the giant cells.\n\n【44】In the present case, typical clinical features for sarcoidosis such as pulmonary, ocular or cutaneous lesions were not observed. Moreover, her levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and lysozyme were not elevated. However, the PET-CT scan clearly showed axillary, mediastinal, hilar, iliac and inguinal lymph node swellings with massive splenic involvement. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made histopathologically based on the presence of non-caseating epithelioid granulomas with abundant Langhans giant cells in her lymph node. Although histologic evidence is mandatory for a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the histologic findings are not sufficiently specific to make the diagnosis, since non-caseating granulomas are found in a number of infectious diseases. In the present case, such a possibility was ruled out by negative serologic tests for _Brucella_ , _Legionella_ , _Coxiella burnetii, Mycoplasma_ and _Toxoplasma_ species. Serologic tests for EBV and _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ showed prior infection patterns. In addition, EBV-encoded small RNA was negative in the sarcoid granulomas. Legionella infection was unlikely because the patient had no pneumonia at presentation. Leishmaniasis is also unlikely because this disease is non-endemic in Japan and parasitized histiocytes were not observed in the biopsied lymph node. Although _P. acnes_ seems to be a potential etiologic agent, other viral, bacterial and environmental agents and genetic susceptibility might be also involved in the development of sarcoidosis in a complex manner.\n\n【45】In general, sarcoidosis can either remit spontaneously or become chronic, with exacerbation and remission. Two-thirds of the patients with sarcoidosis generally have a remission within a decade after diagnosis with few or no consequences. Remission occurs in more than half of the patients within 3 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In most cases, patients with sarcoidosis are not disabled by the illness, so the decision and selection of its treatment should be provided with discretion. A variety of drugs including corticosteroids, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α blockers have been tried 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Bachelez _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u> reported that in 12 patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis treated with minocycline, a clinical response was observed in 10 patients, which consisted of complete responses in eight patients and partial response in two patients. The use of minocycline and its analogues have also been proposed because of their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Recently, it was reported that minocycline treatment for sarcoidosis reduced the circulating levels of IL-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-inducible protein-10, thus emphasizing the immunomodulating rather than antimicrobial effects of the drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In the present case, we started CAM treatment without a definite diagnosis of sarcoidosis at the time of admission. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was only confirmed pathologically 2 weeks after the initiation of CAM treatment. Soon after the initiation of this treatment, CAM was found to be effective; the fever rapidly subsided with depressed levels of CRP and s-IL2R. Baba _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> reported a case of sarcoidosis with multiple endobronchial mass lesions which disappeared after treatment with CAM coupled with minocycline. However, there has been no report documenting a drastic effect for sarcoidosis after a single CAM administration. Although acetaminophen might have played a role in depressing the fever to a certain extent, the drug itself has no immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive effect. Thus, CAM was thought to have played a major role in improving sarcoidosis.\n\n【46】Recently, we reported a case of MTX-related EBV-associated Hodgkin-like lymphoma, in which complete remission was achieved after withdrawal of MTX coupled with CAM administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. We emphasized that CAM has important pharmacological effects such as immunosuppression or immunomodulation in addition to an antimicrobial role. It is postulated that CAM can influence the cytokine networks and enhance the activities of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Many investigators have reported immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory effects of CAM in patients with cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 \\]</u> or tumor-bearing animals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.

In the present case, the level of cytokines was not investigated. However, the pathology of the biopsied lymph node was very suggestive to understand the mode of action by CAM; the sarcoid granulomas clearly showed apoptotic degeneration in Langhans giant cells. In this connection, CAM has been reported to induce apoptosis of activated human lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Here, attention should be paid to the fact that the lymph node biopsy was carried out 9 days after the initiation of CAM treatment. This means that CAM had already exerted its pharmacological effect on the sarcoid granulomas at the time of biopsy. In other words, pathological findings of the lymph node represented the healing process by CAM treatment.\n\n【47】In the present case, the PET-CT images consistently showed distinct FDG uptake at the submandibular dental roots, suggesting the presence of chronic periodontitis. Concomitant FDG uptake in peripharyngeal lymph nodes seemed to be related with chronic periodontitis. _P. acnes_ is known to be indigenous to the skin, it is also considered to be important in the etiology of periodontal diseases. In this case, the possibility that the chronic periodontitis might have been a focus of _P. acnes_ infection cannot be ruled out.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【49】The present case provided helpful clues in the treatment of _P. acnes_ \\-associated sarcoidosis. CAM was found to be effective for treating sarcoidosis, and seems to have important pharmacological effects such as immunosuppression, immunomodulation and induction of apoptosis in addition to its antimicrobial role. The pathological analysis of the lymph node, which was obtained during the CAM treatment, demonstrated an apoptosis-inducing effect of CAM on the sarcoid granulomas. This effect might have resulted in satisfactory improvement in this case.\n\n【50】Consent\n-------\n\n【51】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The bullet lodged in the spinal cord at the C1 level and rendered our patient quadriplegic and dependent on a ventilator. For personal and forensic reasons, our patient and his family requested removal of the bullet fragment almost one year following the injury. Given the significant comorbidity associated with quadriplegia and ventilator dependency, a minimally invasive approach was used to limit the peri-operative complication risk and expedite recovery. Using a minimally invasive expandable retractor system and the aid of a microscope, the posterior arch of C1 was removed, the dura was opened, and the bullet fragment was successfully removed from the spinal cord.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Here we describe a minimally invasive procedure demonstrating the technical feasibility of removing an intramedullary foreign object from the high-cervical spine. We do not suggest that the availability of minimally invasive procedures should lower the threshold or expand the indications for the removal of bullet fragments in the spinal canal. Rather, our objective is to expand the indications for minimally invasive procedures in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with spinal procedures. In addition, this report may help to highlight the feasibility of this approach.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Gunshot injury to the spine accounts for 13% to 17% of all spinal cord injuries annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Spinal cord decompression and bullet removal remain controversial and can be associated with a high rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. Minimally invasive (MI) approaches have been applied to multiple spinal pathologies, including degenerative, traumatic, and neoplastic, in order to decrease morbidity and expedite recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 13 \\]</u>. We present the case of a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic patient, who presented 11 months following a gunshot wound, requesting removal of the bullet fragment from the high-cervical spinal cord. We describe the use of a muscle splitting, MI approach to successfully remove the fragment from the spinal cord at the C1 level.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A previously healthy 18-year-old African-American man suffered a high-cervical gunshot wound to the neck while driving. This injury resulted in quadriplegia at the C2 sensory level and ventilator dependence. Imaging studies demonstrated a retained bullet fragment in the spinal canal at the level of C1 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 A,B)</u>. His initial care was received at another medical center where he was evaluated. No surgical intervention for the gunshot wound was pursued. He was ultimately discharged to a rehabilitation center after a tracheostomy was performed and a gastrostomy tube and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter were placed. His recovery was complicated by cardiac arrest, with successful resuscitation, and pneumonia.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】**Radiographic imaging of a retained bullet fragment in the high-cervical spine.** Sagittal ( **A** ) and axial ( **B** ) computed tomography (CT) images show the relationship of the fragment (designated by \\*) to the arch of C1 and the dens of C2. Note the fracture of the right posterior arch of C1 (arrow).\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Our patient and his family presented to our clinic 11months after the injury seeking removal of the bullet fragment for personal and forensic reasons. He remained without neurologic improvement, and the family was clearly counseled that such a procedure would be extremely unlikely to result in any neurological recovery.\n\n【16】After induction of general anesthesia, a Mayfield head frame was placed, and our patient was turned to a prone position on a standard operative table with a Wilson frame. The head frame was secured to the operative table, and the wound was prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. Fluoroscopy was used to determine the bullet location. An approximately 5cm midline longitudinal incision was created, centered over the level of the bullet fragment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the METRx™ X-Tube Retraction System (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was placed, with sequential dilation of the muscle and exposure of the posterior arch of C1. The retractor was secured to the operative table and expanded to a working diameter of approximately 5cm. An operative microscope was then brought into the field for visualization. The posterior arch of C1 was removed using a Kerrison #2 bone punch, and the underlying dura was exposed. The dura was incised and found to be remarkably adherent to an underlying mass of granulation tissue. Rhoton™ microdissectors were used to carefully dissect the granulation tissue and expose the bullet fragment. The fragment was dissected free from the surrounding granulation tissue and removed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 A)</u>. The dura was closed using a running 5-0 prolene suture and a custom needle driver and knot pusher (Scanlan International, Saint Paul, MN, USA). The wound was closed using deep and subcutaneous absorbable interrupted sutures, and the skin surface was covered with surgical glue.\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】**(A) Photograph of the extracted bullet fragment and (B) photograph of our patient’s neck in the prone position, demonstrating the post-operative skin incision and the site of bullet penetration.**\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】The surgical time was approximately two hours and 20 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 50cm <sup>3 </sup> . The procedure and hospital stay were uncomplicated. At a 6-month follow-up, our patient remained at his pre-operative neurologic baseline and free from evidence of complications with only a small scar from the site of skin incision and bullet penetration 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 B)</u>.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】There are few absolute indications for the removal of a bullet lodged in the spinal canal, including neurological deterioration, infection, and lead or copper toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Whether to perform such a procedure in situations outside of these indications remains controversial. We present a case where a quadriplegic, ventilator-dependent patient requested removal of a bullet fragment retained in the high-cervical spinal cord. Given the comorbidity generally associated with ventilator-dependent quadriplegia, exemplified by our patient’s own history of cardiac arrest and pneumonia, we sought to minimize the morbidity of the planned procedure. Further, it should be noted that many patients who present following a high-velocity penetrating trauma are commonly medically unstable. In these situations, a minimally invasive approach of this nature may be advantageous given that a larger, open operation may be medically contraindicated.\n\n【23】Standard open approaches for removal of bullet fragments from the spinal canal have been associated with a high rate of complications. Simpson _et al_ . retrospectively reviewed 160 cases of penetrating spinal injury, including 142 cases of gunshot wounds and 18 stab wounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Complications included meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and wound infections. The complication rate was considerably higher in the patients who were surgically treated (22%) compared with patients who were treated non-surgically (7%). Minimally invasive procedures to access the spine have been developed in order to reduce approach-related morbidity and/or post-operative complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Initial applications were primarily confined to discectomies and decompressions for degenerative spine disease, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 16 \\]</u> but with recognition of the benefits and further advances in technology, the potential indications have markedly expanded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 , 17 – 19 \\]</u>. The ability to safely and effectively access the spinal intradural compartment through a MI approach has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition, the removal of bullet fragments in the lumbar spine has also been previously discussed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】When contemplating removal of a retained bullet fragment in the spinal canal, it is important that the indications and expectations are clear. These injuries are often treated non-operatively, especially in cases of complete neurological deficit. However, in select circumstance, when surgery is elected, a minimally invasive approach may be both safe and feasible.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【26】Here, we have demonstrated the technical feasibility of removing an intramedullary foreign object from the high-cervical region. Although surgical indications remain controversial, removal of a foreign object, such as a bullet fragment, from the high-cervical spinal cord may be safely and effectively achieved through a MI approach.\n\n【27】Consent\n-------\n\n【28】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this manuscript and any accompanying images.

The disease usually progresses relentlessly to result in recurrent fractures, short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis, and susceptibility to recurrent respiratory tract infections.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The index child was a male newborn to healthy, nonconsanguineous, Sinhalese parents. The child had multiple contractures involving all large joints with pterigium formation in addition to congenital fractures involving left humerus and ulna at birth. The phenotypic features in this child were highly suggestive of Bruck syndrome. Genetic counseling was offered to the parents, although specific genetic testing could not be undertaken due to lack of resources. Bone and skin biopsy were not performed since only palliative care was possible. Over the course, he developed recurrent severe chest infections due to poor muscle tone, weak cough reflex, and pooling of secretions. Unfortunately, he succumbed at the age of 7 months following severe pneumonia.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The association of arthrogryposis with osteogenesis imperfecta is extremely rare and known as Bruck syndrome. Early diagnosis during the antenatal period is helpful in genetic counseling, assessment of severity, and exploration of therapeutic options\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a symptom complex rather than a diagnosis and associated with many recognizable syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Chromosomal abnormalities, uterine abnormalities, and disorders of nerves, vessels, muscles, and connective tissues can lead to this symptom complex. AMC presents with congenital joint contractures. Bruck syndrome is identified when congenital joint contractures are associated with bone fragility and fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It has been considered as an autosomal recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This rare disorder has been reported in literature in only 27 patients by 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Viljoen _et al._ reported five children with congenital joint contractures with fractures in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Since the same features were described in 1897 by Dr. Bruck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, Viljoen named the condition as Bruck syndrome. The genotype and phenotype of Bruck syndrome are heterogeneous. While the genes coding for collagen 1 chains are unaffected in BS, there is biochemical evidence for a defect in the hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen 1 telopeptides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. We reported herein the case of a neonate with congenital joint contractures associated with bone fragility and fractures and meeting clinical criteria for Bruck syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A male newborn to healthy, nonconsanguineous Sinhalese parents at 37 weeks of gestation was identified to have multiple congenital abnormalities. The mother noted reduced fetal movements during pregnancy. Breech presentation and placenta previa were confirmed by antenatal ultrasound with no evidence of oligo- or polyhydramnios. The antenatal period had been otherwise uncomplicated, and anomaly ultrasound scan did not reveal specific congenital abnormalities. He was delivered by elective lower segment cesarian section, weighing 2.6 kg, at Peradeniya Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Length and occipitofrontal circumference were 48 cm and 34 cm, respectively. Apgar scores were 8, 9, and 10 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. Vital parameters soon after birth were heart rate of 114 per minute, respiratory rate of 52 per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% in room air.\n\n【12】Physical examination of the newborn revealed facial asymmetry and micrognathia. Neck muscles were thin and atrophied. Contractures involving all large joints were noticed with pterigium formation. Hands and feet were deformed with absent skin creases. Right talipes equinovarus and left calcaneovarus deformity with dislocated hip joints were also noted. The baby had microphallus with bilateral cryptorchidism. Based on these clinical findings, AMC was considered. Additionally, the child was found to have a disproportionately large head, disproportionately short limbs, scoliosis, and multiple fractures involving left humerus and ulna. Cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and abdominal examinations findings were otherwise normal at birth. Serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D levels were within normal ranges. X-ray of left arm and forearm revealed multiple fractures involving humerus and ulna. Hearing and visual assessments revealed normal findings. Ultrasound abdomen did not reveal any congenital abnormalities of the visceral organs.\n\n【13】Bone and skin biopsy were not performed since only palliative care was possible. Similarly, genetic studies for Bruck syndrome were not done due to limited resources. Establishing of feeding and handling was difficult due to increased fragility of bones and evidence of multiple congenital contractures. The baby was treated with vitamin D, calcium, and bisphosphonates and followed up by the pediatric and orthopedic teams.\n\n【14】He had recurrent chest infections since birth, managed in-patient with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care. He had a severe chest infection at the age of 5 months, needing management in the intensive care unit. He was intubated and provided with ventilatory care for 3 days. Intravenous cefotaxime was given for 10 days, and oral clarithromycin for 5 days. The chest infections were largely attributed to weak cough reflex, pooling of secretions, and poor muscle tone, including that of respiration muscles. He remained bed-ridden as he had severe and predominant gross motor developmental delay, which was further complicated by presence of multiple long-bone fractures. He received chest physiotherapy and gentle limb physiotherapy by the multidisciplinary team. Unfortunately, the child succumbed due to respiratory failure following severe pneumonia at age 7 months 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 , 2 )</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Multiple congenital contractures\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Healing intrauterine fractures\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】The second child born to the same parents also had clinical features suggestive of Bruck syndrome. He is currently 6 years of age and doing well with multidisciplinary follow-up. Further, he has normal intellectual functions. He is able to use his hands reasonably well in writing. The main concern of the parents is his limited mobility, and the parents carry him from place to place but his weight is becoming an issue. His current weight is 23 kg. He is toilet trained and suffers from infrequent chest infections, which are managed aggressively. However, he has not been hospitalized, except for once during the last 3 years. Perhaps COVID-19 had a positive effect as his younger sibling was not schooling, thus cross-infections were low. The parents are exploring the possibility of getting a wheelchair for him.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Bruck syndrome is characterized by congenital contractures with pterygia, onset of fractures in infancy or early childhood, severe limb deformity, and progressive scoliosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It has been classified into two forms—Bruck syndrome type 1 and type 2; however, both variants share common phenotypic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Bruck syndrome 2 is caused by homozygous mutation in the _PLOD2_ gene on chromosome 3q24. The syndrome has also been reported secondary to insertion/deletion mutation in the _FKBP10_ gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Phenotypic features such as short stature and progressive kyphoscoliosis have been suggested to be more associated with Bruck syndrome type 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, given that the index child succumbed early following a severe respiratory tract infection and respiratory failure, determination of the type of Bruck syndrome based on phenotypic features was difficult.\n\n【24】Bruck syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although there was no previous family history, presence of similar clinical features in both children supports the already known pattern of inheritance in this family. Consanguinity can be absent in some families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Many centers in developing countries, at present, do not have facilities for molecular diagnosis. However, it is of little help to prognosticate and assess the clinical severity of Bruck syndrome. Therefore, good clinical evaluation remains the key to delineate the basic abnormalities associated with this disorder.\n\n【25】In addition to multiple bone fractures and congenital joint contractures, patients with Bruck syndrome commonly have short stature, Wormian bones in the skull, clubfoot, and kyphoscoliosis. They mostly have white sclera as in the patient described herein, and normal hearing and vision. Individual case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 \\]</u> have described additional dysmorphic features, as reported in this child. The clinical outcomes and prognosis have been variable in reported cases, with some reported children dying soon after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u> while other patients have reportedly lived up to the third 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u> or fourth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u> decade in life.\n\n【26】The molecular defect underlying Bruck syndrome is a deficiency of bone-specific telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase, which results in aberrant crosslinking of bone collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Lysine residues within the telopeptides of type I collagen in bone are underhydroxylated, leading to aberrant crosslinking. In contrast to bone, cartilage and ligament show unaltered telopeptide hydroxylation in Bruck syndrome, as evidenced by normal patterns of crosslinking. These underlying biochemical derangements give rise to predominant changes in bone that include congenital fractures and contractures, and increased fragility. Brenner _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u> performed electron microscopy of a bone specimen of a patient with Bruck syndrome and found osteoblasts with swollen mitochondria and dilated endoplasmic reticulum. A decrease in the diameter of the collagen fibrils was also noted, along with low mineral content and increased pepsin extraction of collagen 1.\n\n【27】It is important to rule out osteogenesis imperfecta in newborns with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Radiological imaging should therefore be performed early so that the affected child can be better looked after by measures such as padding of beds and gentle handling to prevent further fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The mainstay of pharmacological management of Bruck syndrome is bisphosphonate infusions and vitamin supplementation, and the condition is treated similarly to most children with osteogenesis imperfecta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. However, prognosis is worse in children with Bruck syndrome given its association with joint contractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The disease progresses relentlessly in all patients, leading to complications such as severe limb deformities, short stature, progressive kyphoscoliosis, and multiple fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Most children with Bruck syndrome treated with pamidronate had good to fair response. Therefore, pamidronate therapy with the same doses used in osteogenesis imperfecta is currently recommended for these patients. Early orthopedic consultation would be routinely required for most of these patients to help them in rehabilitation and recovery.\n\n【29】Arthrogryposis can be picked up antenatally on ultrasound from the second trimester onward. Severe variants of Bruck syndrome diagnosed during the antenatal period can be offered genetic counseling and the option of termination of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】The association of arthrogryposis with osteogenesis imperfecta is extremely rare and known as Bruck syndrome. Early diagnosis during the antenatal period is helpful in genetic counseling, assessment of severity, and exploration of the option of therapeutic termination.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AMC:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

DCRV is described to be associated with different congenital disorders, most commonly with a membranous or malalignment type ventricular septal defect (VSD). An association with sub-aortic stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, atrial septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, and tetralogy of Fallot has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

The mechanism of calcification of the tricuspid valve is considered to be due to the high pressure or volume overload of the right ventricle associated with congenital disorder.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 71-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our institution for further evaluation of chest discomfort, heavy dizziness and nausea after the use of nitroglycerin prescribed by a general practitioner.\n\n【13】On physical examination, cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic ejection murmur at her left sternal border. Her blood pressure was 130/60 mmHg, heart rate 68 beats/min, and her peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% in the room air. The 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed small negative T waves in leads III and a VF. A chest X-ray showed no pulmonary congestion, and the cardiothoracic ratio was 51%. Mild hypercholesterolemia was shown on her blood chemistry.

Her coronary angiography showed no abnormalities. Right to left flow through her patent foramen ovale, but no left to right shunt flow, was observed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4A )</u>. Her pulmonary artery pressure was 24/13 mmHg; the pullback pressure recordings demonstrated a pressure gradient of 74 mmHg across the RVOT stenosis, and her right ventricular pressure was 97/5 mmHg 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4B )</u>. The diagnosis of double chambered right ventricle was confirmed based on the stated findings. Our patient refused surgical correction, and so beta-blockade (calvedilol) was prescribed. This was effective in reducing her symptoms after discharge.\n\n【26】**Figure 4**\n\n【27】**Cardiac catheterization** .

(B) Pullback pressure recordings demonstrated a pressure gradient of 74 mmHg across the RVOT stenosis.\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】DCRV is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly in which the right ventricle is divided into two chambers by anomalous muscle bundle. Most cases of DCRV are associated with different congenital disorders such as VSD, and the flow abnormalities related to these disorders are considered to be involved in the postnatal development of the proliferation of the muscle bundle. In our case, right to left flow through the patent foramen ovale was observed, but no left to right shunt flow (including VSD) was observed. Multislice cardiac enhance CT is usually recorded only at the diastole, but the stenosis became severe in the systole. Motion recordings of her right ventricle were useful for diagnosis.\n\n【31】A severe calcification of the tricuspid valve was observed in our case, but the other three valves were not calcified. There was no tricuspid stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation was mild. However, results from the CT scanning and MRI study suggested that this lesion was involved in the RVOT stenosis. Reports of calcification in the tricuspid valve are very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 – 7 \\]</u>. The mechanism of calcification of the tricuspid valve is considered to be due to the high pressure or volume overload of the right ventricle associated with congenital disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Most cases previously reported are associated with pulmonary stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>, some cases are with atial septal defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>, and one case was with rheumatic valve disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our case, it is suspected that the use of nitroglycerin in RVOT stenosis led to low output and a decrease in systolic blood pressure; beta-blockade was effective to reduce systolic stenosis and also cardiac oxygen consumption.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】DCRV is a rare cardiac anomaly, and is difficult to diagnose in adults. Calcification of the tricuspid valve is also an extremely rare disorder, which is suspected to be associated with high pressure of the right ventricle. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other case report of this combination of DCRV and calcification of the tricuspid valve.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Studies on a possible relationship between of _FLT3_ /ITDs length and clinical outcomes in those AML patients were inconclusive, yet.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Here we report a 54-year-old Arab male diagnosed with AML who had two _FLT3_ \\-ITD mutations in addition to _NPM1_ mutation. Cytogenetic approaches (banding cytogenetics) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes to detect translocations t(8;21), t(15;17), t(16;16), t(12;21), and deletion del(13q)) were applied to exclude chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular genetic approaches (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the Sanger sequencing) identified a yet unreported combination of two new mutations in _FLT3_ \\-ITDs. The first mutation induced a frameshift in JMD, and the second led to a homozygous substitution of c.1836T>A (p.F612L) also in JMD. Additionally a _NPM1_ type A mutation was detected. The first chemotherapeutic treatment was successful, but 1 month after the initial diagnosis, the patient experienced a relapse and unfortunately died.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】To the best of our knowledge, a combination of two _FLT3_ \\-ITD mutations in JMD together with an _NPM1_ type A mutation were not previously reported in adult AML. Further studies are necessary to prove or rule out whether the size of these _FLT3_ \\-ITDs mutations and potential other double mutations in _FLT3_ \\-ITD are correlated with the observed adverse outcome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) genetic diagnostics were performed in the past mainly by cytogenetics and molecular cytogenetics. In recent years also tumor markers were added, which rely on molecular genetic methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( _FLT3_ ) gene encodes a class III tyrosine kinase receptor for the FLT3 ligand, which is normally expressed in CD34 <sup>+ </sup> ‏ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and plays a fundamental role in both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the _FLT3_ gene ( _FLT3_ /ITDs) represent one of the most common molecular abnormalities in patients with AML. They are detectable in around 25–30% of all patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. ITDs consist of in-frame insertions of duplicated sequences localized in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of the FLT3 molecule. Their presence results in a constitutive, ligand independent activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the FLT3 receptor; this is responsible for abnormal proliferation and differentiation of leukemic stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In AML constitutive activation of kinase domain happens due to disruption of auto-inhibitory interaction between JMD and the activation loop, which normally stabilizes the inactive kinase, and at the same time protects ATP binding pocket 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. _FLT3_ /ITDs also protect leukemic cells from the damaging chemotherapeutic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】It was suggested that an increasing length of additional sequences like ITDs may influence the grade of tyrosine kinase activity of the FLT3 receptor, and could 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> lead progressively to increasing activation levels and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to worsen the overall survival (OS) in affected patients. Still, the results of studies which investigated the impact of ITD length on the clinical outcome are contradictory. Some studies confirming the aforementioned assumption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>, whereas others contradicted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Presence of _FLT3_ /ITDs has been associated with an increased initial peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of blast cells in bone marrow, a reduced disease-free survival (DFS) and OS, and a high relapse rate with an overall adverse prognosis. However, the rate of complete remission (CR) was not significantly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Thus, a prognostic significance of _FLT3_ /ITDs has been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017, AML cases with cytogenetically normal karyotypes and _FLT3_ /ITD mutation have a poor prognosis.\n\n【13】Besides in _FLT3_ /ITD, mutations in nucleophosmin 1 ( _NPM1_ ) gene represent the second most frequent molecular aberration in AML patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. A combined status of mutated _NPM1_ and the wild type _FLT3_ gene ( _NPM1_ <sup>+ </sup> / _FLT3_ <sup>− </sup> ) is a well-established favorable risk factor in younger adult patients, with less probability of relapse and prolonged survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>; these patients are not obliged to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Otherwise, co-occurrence of _FLT3_ /ITD and _NPM1_ mutations was suggested to partially improve response rates, DFS and OS outcomes compared to AML-patients having exclusively _FLT3_ /ITD mutations. However, cases with mutations in _FLT3_ /ITD and _NPM1_ have worse prognosis than those having ( _NPM1_ <sup>+ </sup> / _FLT3_ <sup>− </sup> ) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】Here, we present a unique case with two _FLT3_ \\-ITDs mutations in JMD and an _NPM1_ type A gene mutation associated with adverse outcome.\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】In October 2019, a 54-year-old Arab male patient presented with 2 months history of fatigue, orthostatic hypotension followed by bruising on the lower right extremity, melena (present for one month only) and dyspnea II. Physical examination and computer tomographic scan showed hepatomegaly (4 cm). He had no familial history of malignancies and no social and environmental history of exposure to toxins or animals. Initial laboratory evaluation of peripheral blood (PB) revealed white blood cells count (WBC) of 26.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l (10% were blasts). Pathologic examination of bone marrow (BM) aspirate characterized hybercellularity with 60% of blasts. Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis classified this case as AML-M2 according to world health organization (WHO) classification. The abnormal cell population (60%) was positive for CD45 <sup>dim </sup> , CD34, HLADr, CD13, CD33 and expressed CD117 heterogeneously. Blasts cell population was negative for CD3, CD117, CD14, cCD3, cCD79a, CD14, CD11c, CD38, CD64, CD32, CD7, CD19, CD10, and CD5.\n\n【17】The patient was given standard treatment for AML including 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy (daunorubicin 60 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> for 3 days and cytarabine 200 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> for 7 days). One month later, under treatment with 3 + 7 protocol, the patient relapsed, i.e. his PB showed a WBC of 107 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l, anemia (hemoglobin level (Hgb) = 8.8 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (Plt 93 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l). The patient was given re-induction with 3 + 7 chemotherapy protocol 通用删除1(英):<u>(for more details see Table 1 )</u>. Less than one month after relapse, the patient acquired additional severe symptoms such as neutropenia, neutropenic enterocolitis, and diabetes insipidus, and the patient unfortunately passed away due to respiratory and cardiac arrest. No autopsy was performed. The patient’s brother agreed with the scientific evaluation of this case and the study was approved by the ethical committee of Pharmacy faculty at Damascus University, Ministry of High Education, Syria review Board, No. 2/2019.\n\n【18】**Table 1 Clinical history of the patient together with diagnostic results and treatment**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】Chromosome analysis using GTG-banding was performed on BM sample taken prior to chemotherapy according to standard protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. A normal male karyotype was diagnosed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes to detect translocations t(8;21), t(15;17), t(16;16), t(12;21), and deletion del(13q), were applied to excluded chromosomal abnormalities, too, as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】For molecular analyses, whole genomic DNA was extracted from PB cells (EDTA-blood) prior to chemotherapy treatment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing were used to screen for the presence of mutations of the following genes: _FLT3_ /ITD (exons 11 and 12), _FLT3_ \\-KTD and _NPM1_ ; using specific primers for each mutation previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. ITDs were confirmed by Sanger sequence analysis; the wild-type band of 330 bp length, and other differently sized PCR products were identified in our patient 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> using the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

However, he had also _NPM1_ type A mutation (data not shown).\n\n【31】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【32】Here we report the first case of an adult AML patient with normal karyotype, who had one _NPM1_ type A and two frameshift _FLT3_ \\-ITD mutations. The first frameshift _FLT3_ \\-ITD was never reported before (COSMIC database for somatic samples from hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue), whereas the second mutation has already been observed, but as heterozygous variant (COSV54057677).\n\n【33】The present case supports previous findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>, which suggested that long ITDs are associated with adverse OS, a higher incidence for relapse and a negative impact on clinical outcomes in AML patients post chemotherapy.\n\n【34】Of special interest, is the suggestion that the complications of intense chemotherapy, as observed in our patient 通用删除1(英):<u>(see Table 1 )</u>, could also have been promoted by the observed combination of mutation events. The observed neutropenia, is associated with the risk for developing serious and complicated infections or even sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 , 28 \\]</u>. Also neutropenic enterocolitis (NE), a necrotizing process usually localized to the ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u> can appear in 15% of AML patients treated with a combination of Idarubicin and Cytosine arabinoside 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>, It also associated with increased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Finally, central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases with less than 100 cases reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Central DI can precede the diagnosis of AML or MDS or it can manifest during treatment and was thought to confer a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of central DI in AML and MDS may be secondary to leukemic infiltration of the infundibulum, hemorrhage, thrombosis, infection, or autoimmunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Further studies are needed to prove or rule out whether the size of the _FLT3_ \\-ITDs mutation and the double mutations in _FLT3_ \\-ITD are correlated with an adverse prognosis. Also, more research is needed to see if chemotherapy-complications as observed here can be omitted by the application of other treatment regimes.\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All relevant data and material is included in this publication.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AML:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute myeloid leukemia</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BM:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bone marrow</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CR:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Complete remission</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DFS:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Disease-free survival</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DI:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diabetes insipidus</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FISH:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fluorescence in situ hybridization</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FCM:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Flow cytometric</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FLT3:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>JMD:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Juxtamembrane domain</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ITDs:</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Internal tandem duplications</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MDS:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Myelodysplastic syndrome</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NPM1:</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nucleophosmin 1 gene</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NE:</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Neutropenic enterocolitis</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>OS:</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Overall survival</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PB:</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peripheral blood</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cells</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WHO:</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>World health organization</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Traditionally it has been thought that the kidney is the only organ which does not seem to be generally affected by the disease although the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is expressed in the kidney.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of an 11 year old boy with cystic fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome and review the literature that describes nephrotic syndrome and renal involvement in cystic fibrosis.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】With continued advances in the management of cystic fibrosis and improvement in life expectancy, several unrecognized co-morbidities are expected to emerge. It is important to screen patients for possible co-morbidities. Urine analysis may be helpful in this group of patients and any proteinuria should raise the suspicion of cystic fibrosis-related renal disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease characterized by chronic respiratory infections and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Recent advancement in therapy has lead to improvement in survival. Currently, the median age for a patient with CF is the early 30's 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. CF is no longer only a pediatric disease and long term complications are being more frequently reported in adults.\n\n【10】Patients with CF usually present with symptoms involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. However, other systems can be involved in CF including the renal system. Traditionally the only abnormalities associated with the renal tract are nephrolithiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u> and mechanical urological problems associated with coughing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this case report, we describe a patient with cystic fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome. We also review the literature about renal involvement in CF.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An 11 year old male with CF (homozygous for ΔF508), mild lung disease and pancreatic insufficiency presented with facial swelling that progressed to generalized anasarca over four days. There was a history of preceding upper respiratory symptoms. He denied any change in his urine color or bowel habit and there was no history of headache, visual disturbance, jaundice, chest pain or palpitation. The patient remained on his regular medications which included albuterol, multivitamins and pancreatic enzymes.\n\n【13】He was admitted with similar symptoms 6 months prior to this admission. At that time he had hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria on a random urine sample. An extensive workup was negative including liver function tests, viral hepatitis panel, Alpha 1 antitrypsin (stool, blood), abdominal ultrasound and upper GI endoscopy. He was treated with albumin infusion and furosemide and no corticosteroids were needed. However, the etiology for the hypoalbuminemia was uncertain.\n\n【14】On this admission, he had mildly elevated blood pressure at 131/73. His weight was 46.7 kg with 8 kg of recent weight gain. He had periorbital and facial edema and moderate pitting edema of both lower extremities and around the sacral area. Otherwise physical examination was normal.\n\n【15】Laboratory evaluations showed hypoalbuminemia (1.6 mg/dl) with normal kidney function (BUN of 11 mg/dl, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dl and normal urine microscopic evaluation without evidence of RBC casts). 24 hour urine collection revealed nephrotic range proteinuria (3 gm/24 hour). Other laboratory evaluations were normal including ASO, C3, C4 and ANA. He underwent percutaneous renal biopsy which revealed minimal change disease. The interstitium showed scattered mixed mononuclear inflammation with rare eosinophils and neutrophils without any evidence of fibrosis. There was no immune deposit and no significant glomerulosclerosis. The patient was treated successfully with oral corticosteroids 2 mg/kg/day and achieved remission after about six weeks of therapy.\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】There is a general perception that the kidney is spared in patients with CF. However in recent years there have been increasing reports of renal disease in patients with CF. Several anatomical and pathological reports describe renal abnormalities in association with CF although there is still a gap in clinical reporting. Glomerular alterations including glomerulosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, deposits of immune complexes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, IgA nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> and mesangial proliferations, nephrocalcinosis and microscopic hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, tubular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 9 \\]</u>, diabetic nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, fibrillary glomerulonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> and amyloidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u> have all been described in patients with CF. There are to our knowledge, only two cases that of nephrotic syndrome related to minimal change disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u> which have been reported in the medical literature.\n\n【18】Although nephrotic syndrome is rarely encountered with CF, mild proteinuria is not infrequently found on urine analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 12 \\]</u>. Castile _et al_ . reported that five out of 23 patients reviewed in an autopsy series had had unexplained proteinuria (range, trace to +2) recorded on routine urine analysis and the majority of these patients were noted to have renal pathology at autopsy.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【20】Nephrotic syndrome in this patient with cystic fibrosis could either be coincidental or a complication of CF. With continued advances in the management of CF and improvement in life expectancy, several unrecognized co-morbidities are expected to emerge and it is important that patients be screened for possible co-morbidities. Patients with CF are exposed to potentially nephrotoxic factors, including chronic and acute bacterial infections, with circulating immune complexes, and antibiotics especially aminoglycosides. We know that cystic fibrosis-related diabetes can produce the same microvascular complications including nephropathy recognized in the non-cystic fibrosis patient population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 – 18 \\]</u>.

The case study is the first report of short-term results of subthreshold nanolaser treatment in a patient with Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 43-year-old Caucasian man with moderate loss of visual acuity in his left eye (20/40) and normal visual acuity in his right eye (20/20), with clinical Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy diagnosis and genetic confirmation of the common heterozygous mutation ( _EFEMP1_ ) by genetic testing, underwent nanopulse subthreshold laser treatment in his left eye.\n\n【5】A safety examination, carried out 7 days after treatment, and clinical follow-up, conducted 60 days following laser treatment, showed improvement of visual acuity from baseline by two letters and a subjective improvement of blurring. While no apparent morphological changes were found on fundoscopy, increased autofluorescence in the treated eye was observed on imaging. In addition, 2 months after nanopulse subthreshold laser treatment, rod-mediated and cone-mediated full-field electroretinography b-wave amplitudes showed an increase from baseline in both the treated eye (300%) and untreated eye (50%).

In addition, mutations in the gene encoding tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase-3 ( _TIMP3_ ) are tightly linked to _EFEMP1_ and are associated with a severe form of DHRD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Likewise, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its intermediate stage is characterized by drusen or drusenoid deposits, Bruch’s membrane thickening, and RPE atrophy 通用删除1(英):<u>(see review, Hulleman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>)</u>. AMD and DHRD also share pathophysiologic similarities: two mouse models of DHRD showed complement activation and RPE atrophy, akin to the pathology observed in AMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In 2013, Lenassi _et al._ showed that low-energy argon laser treatment performed just outside the drusen boundaries, but away from the fovea, induced drusen clearance and improved visual function in patients with DHRD with confirmed _EFEMP1_ mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Recently, a low-energy, subthreshold nanosecond laser, the 2RT® (Ellex, Adelaide, Australia), has been utilized to induce targeted and controlled RPE injury without significant retinal neuronal damage or gliosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. A clinical trial in intermediate AMD provided evidence of efficacy at 12-month follow-up, both in the treated and untreated eye, with improvement in flicker sensitivity on electroretinography (ERG) and reduction in the mean drusen area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. A similar effect was found in the APoE-null mouse model of AMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, with thinning of Bruch’s membrane and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 following nanolaser treatments.\n\n【12】Based on the phenotypic similarities between AMD and DHRD, a single application of nanopulse subthreshold laser treatment (NSLT) was attempted in a patient with Arg345Trp (R345W) genotype confirmation and clear evidence of disease progression over the previous 12 months. Treatment was delivered in one eye (the worse eye) with a modification to the standardized protocol according to Guymer _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, applying 24 nanosecond laser spots. Retinal structure and function were assessed before and after the treatment. Results showed no appreciable changes in retinal morphology but an increase in autofluorescence on imaging in the treated eye. There was also a functional improvement in both the treated and untreated eye on ERG. This is the first report following NSLT of DHRD.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 43-year-old Caucasian man presented with a moderate loss of visual acuity in his left eye (20/40) and normal right eye acuity (20/20). His medical, family, and psychosocial history was irrelevant. He did not have a history of medication use or previous diseases other than common childhood infectious diseases. For 12 months he complained of blurring, progressive alteration of night vision, and reduced contrast sensitivity in both eyes, with a much more pronounced effect in his left eye. Clinical diagnosis of DHRD was made after full ophthalmologic examination and detailed retinal imaging. Figure 1 shows OCT and fundus autofluorescence in both eyes. ERG, including mesopic and photopic full-field ERGs as well as multifocal ERGs (mfERG), were performed at baseline and 7 days after treatment. Genetic analysis confirmed the common heterozygous DHRD mutation in _EFEMP1_ : (2p16.1) (p.R345W; c.1033C > T).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】**a** , **b** Right eye, autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography imaging before 2RT® laser treatment. **c** , **d** Left eye, autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography imaging after 2RT® laser treatment\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】He was offered NSLT for his left eye. After written informed consent and full explanation of methods and procedure were completed, he underwent the treatment in his left eye, which applies ultra-low energy laser pulses in 24 spots around the macula of one eye (0.15–0.45 mJ), using 400 μm diameter laser spots, 3 nanosecond pulse length, 532 nm wavelength and energy titrated to the patient. Clinical follow-up was conducted at 60 and 180 days after treatment. Table 1 summarizes the clinical ophthalmological testing performed during follow-up. Visual acuity improved from baseline by two letters. There was a subjective improvement in blurring in his left eye. No morphological changes were apparent on fundoscopy, but increased autofluorescence in the treated eye was observed on imaging 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Rod-mediated and cone-mediated ERG b-wave amplitudes showed an increase from baseline in both the treated eye (300%) and fellow eye (50%) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. mfERG amplitudes did not change significantly from baseline, but the implicit time of the main positive component decreased by 8 milliseconds compared to baseline in the treated eye and by 5 milliseconds in the fellow eye 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Subjective and clinical improvements persisted unchanged at 6-month follow-up. The rod-mediated and cone-mediated ERG b-wave amplitude remained unchanged (300% increase) in the treated eye and returned to the pre-treatment value in the fellow eye.\n\n【19】**Table 1 Summary of the clinical ophthalmological testing performed during follow-up**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】**a, b** Mesopic and photopic electroretinography b-wave responses before 2RT® laser treatment. **c** , **d** Mesopic and photopic electroretinography b-wave responses 6 months after 2RT® laser treatment.

The treatment was well tolerated and transpired without adverse events or complications up to the 6-month post-intervention time point, with sustained improvement in retinal function on ERG in both eyes. The improvement in ERG testing suggests enhanced phototransduction and retinoid recycling and aligns with the mechanism of action of this treatment, which in preclinical models was shown to reduce the thickness of Bruch’s membrane and increase the expression of metalloproteinases, thus resulting in improved retinoid recycling. The functional improvement observed in the untreated eye is consistent with other studies on this device and is hypothesized to arise from an increased expression and release of metalloproteinases that circulate systemically. The present results encourage further long-term studies with the subthreshold nanosecond laser as a potential treatment of retinal and RPE abnormalities associated with DHRD and similar conditions such as AMD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is often misinterpreted as chronic dermatitis or psoriasis causing a delayed diagnosis. Synchronous bilateral mammary Paget’s disease is exceptionally rare and an advanced case with underlying invasive carcinoma might require long-term treatment and follow-up that could affect a patient’s physical, psychological, and social aspects of well-being.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 54-year-old Javanese woman presented in our clinic with a 2-year history of itching and chronic eczema in both areolae. Bilateral nipple retraction and retro-areolar palpable lumps were observed during the first presentation. Breast ultrasound revealed hypoechoic lesions in her left and right breasts. Mammograms showed an irregular hyperdense lesion and multiple microcalcifications. Histopathology from biopsy and bilateral mastectomy demonstrated infiltration of large Paget’s cells in the epidermis of the areola with underlying lesions of invasive ductal carcinoma, diagnosed solid type with high nuclear grade and negative expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, with positive expression of human epidermal growth receptor-2(HER2) and Ki-67 (45%).\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In a patient with suspicious chronic inflammation of the nipple and areolae, prompt biopsy should be performed to avoid a delayed diagnosis of any malignant breast lesion.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Mammary Paget’s disease presents as an eczema-like skin rash, with itching, ulceration, or scaly changes affecting the nipple and areola; it is frequently found with an underlying malignant tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The disease is often incorrectly assumed to be atopic or contact dermatitis, psoriasis, or other benign dermatological lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Around 90% of patients are diagnosed without a palpable mass during physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Diagnosis is established through full-thickness skin biopsy showing the invasion of epidermis by typical giant glandular epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei known as Paget’s cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is frequently developed through clinical findings; however, radiological imaging is required to detect the underlying carcinomas and to determine clinical staging for planning the further management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Paget’s disease represents 1–3% of all breast cancers and the synchronous bilateral case is very uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In patients with an associated palpable mass, the concurrent tumor is likely to be an invasive carcinoma located in the center of the breast with axillary lymph node infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Therefore, patients with mammary Paget’s disease with evidence of palpable mass most probably require both radical surgery and adjuvant treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Because the initial appearance resembles benign skin lesions, diagnosis of mammary Paget’s disease is often delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In low-income and middle-income countries, including Indonesia, the delay in diagnosis is even longer due to the relatively low level of cancer awareness and limited health facilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. In a case of bilateral Paget’s disease with associated invasive carcinomas and lymph node infiltration, bilateral mastectomy and subsequent adjuvant local and systemic treatment remain the preferred treatment choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. In addition, positive family history and genetic predisposition are independent risk factors of synchronous bilateral breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Therefore, psychosocial support and multidisciplinary rehabilitation are highly recommended to promote emotional and behavioral adaptation after the acute treatment. We reported a case of synchronous bilateral mammary Paget’s disease who underwent bilateral MRMs.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 54-year-old Javanese woman presented to our hospital with a 2-year history of non-healing scaly rash and itching in both nipples and areolae without any family history of breast or ovarian cancer. She was previously examined by general practitioners as well as a dermatologist and received anti-allergy topical treatment before undergoing a biopsy. On physical examination, eczema, excoriation, and ulceration of both nipples and areola were observed with right nipple retraction and no obvious nipple discharge 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Irregular firmly formed retro-papilla lumps of size 2 × 2 cm and 1 × 2 cm were palpated in her right and left breasts, respectively. No palpable axillary lymph node was observed in the bilateral axillae. Ultrasonography of both breasts showed a spiculated hypoechoic lesion with calcification measuring around 1.61 × 2.06 × 1.78 cm in the right retro-papilla and an amorphic, irregular lesion measuring 0.82 × 0.67 × 1.73 cm located in the left retro-papilla 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Both lesions were categorized as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) IV 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Mammograms showed an amorphic hyperdense lesion measuring around 1.26 × 2.12 cm that was centrally located approximately 1.75 cm in the right nipple and multiple retro-papillae microcalcifications in her left breast 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. A histopathological examination showed typical Paget’s disease of the bilateral breasts with underlying invasive ductal carcinoma, diagnosed as high grade with lymphovascular invasion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. Pathological staging was pT2 pN1 cM0 for the right breast and pT1 pN0 cM0 for the left breast. Immunostaining showed negative expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) and positive expression of human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2) and Ki-67 (45%) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u>.

Early manifestation might present as scaling or redness that is often misinterpreted as eczema or chronic inflammatory reaction causing a delayed diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 \\]</u>. Round plaque with eczema-like rash and ulceration limited to the areolae with or without bloody/serous discharge represent an advanced lesion of Paget’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 \\]</u>. It is often accompanied by inversion or retraction of the nipple. A unilateral lesion is mostly found whereas the synchronous bilateral case is very uncommon. Several benign skin lesions that often cause misinterpretation of mammary Paget’s disease as well as common clinical manifestations that can be used to differentiate it from benign inflammatory skin lesions are summarized in Table 1 . We report the case of a patient with advanced lesions of bilateral mammary Paget’s disease and concomitant palpable masses 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 , 2 and 3 )</u>. Delayed diagnosis is associated with multiple factors including patient delay (lack of knowledge and awareness, use of traditional therapy, fear of treatment, financial constraints, competing life priority, and embarrassment of breast cancer diagnosis) and system delay (complicated referral system, appointment delay, misdiagnosis, misinterpretation of mammography or diagnostic tests, and limited health facilities) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Both factors might have influenced the delayed diagnosis in our case, therefore, further study is required to identify determinants causing delayed diagnosis of breast cancer in Indonesia.\n\n【30】**Table 1 Benign skin and mammary lesions that often cause misinterpretation with mammary Paget’s disease**\n\n【31】Full size table\n\n【32】Any suspected Paget’s disease should be further assessed with radiological imaging because of its high association with _in situ_ or invasive breast carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Imaging is very important to determine the suitable option for surgery as well as the adjuvant treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Breast ultrasonography is useful particularly if it is used in combination with mammography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Breast ultrasonography is able to detect any hypoechoic area, discrete mass, heterogeneous parenchyma, skin thickening, and dilated ducts which are mostly nonspecific findings with signs of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In addition, bilateral mammograms are very important to detect an underlying lesion including a mass or cluster of microcalcifications, to exclude multifocal carcinomas, as well as to evaluate the contralateral breast. Other presentations of mammary Paget’s disease are thickening of skin, nipple, and areolae as well as nipple retraction, subareolar microcalcification, discrete mass, and architectural distortion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Although a mammogram is not always able to detect the underlying ductal carcinoma _in situ_ (DCIS), the sensitivity is particularly higher in patients with palpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. We revealed underlying tumors in the bilateral breasts using sonography and mammography in a patient with synchronous bilateral Paget’s disease 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 2 and 3 )</u>. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered superior to detect the underlying malignancy in Paget’s disease because of its ability to better demonstrate abnormal enhancement or thickening of the nipple-areolar complex, as well as an enhancing _in situ_ or invasive tumor including in a clinically unpalpable mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. However, MRI is not always widely available in low-income and middle-income countries and referral for MRI examination is usually made only in occult disease after careful assessment of clinical and mammogram evaluations.\n\n【33】In Paget’s disease, the main characteristic of histopathological examination is the presence of intraepidermal Paget’s cells, which are glandular epithelial cells with a large clear cytoplasm and enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei that are often found in a basal layer without any intercellular bridges to the adjacent cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Expression levels of hormonal receptors, HER2, and Ki-67 vary among cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Expression of ER and PR was negative and expression of HER2 was positive in our reported case. HER2 protein expression is associated with the capability to promote cell motility and intraepithelial spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In addition, the patient might be eligible for future therapy targeted therapy to HER2.\n\n【34】Surgery remains the mainstay of mammary Paget’s disease treatment. Mastectomy or subcutaneous mastectomy with or without axillary dissection has been practiced as a standard procedure. However, the current trend has shown the increased implementation of breast-conserving therapy for Paget’s disease with comparable clinical outcomes particularly in the cases with DCIS or without underlying tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. With the availability of sentinel node biopsy and radiotherapy, conservation surgery for mammary Paget’s disease has gained more interest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our case, we performed bilateral MRM because of the underlying invasive carcinomas in the bilateral breasts, unavailability of sentinel node biopsy, and potential long queue for radiotherapy. However, double mastectomies might result in a permanent change of appearance and body image of a woman. As the breasts represent femininity, beauty, motherhood, and women’s identity in Indonesian and many other cultures, the perceived loss might cause negative impacts on both physical and psychosocial aspects of well-being. Quality of life measurement using a self-reported questionnaire showed that our patient had lower scores in the global health status, and cognitive and social functioning domains compared to the reference scores of patients with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In addition, our patient had lower scores in future perspective and sexual functioning but higher scores in the symptom scales compared to the references 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Although several factors contribute to a patient’s quality of life score, including social-economic status, education, and the method of measurement, a self-reported questionnaire enables quick detection of an individual’s response to treatment and current state of well-being. Meeting the psychosocial needs of a patient over the course of treatment and surveillance is recommended to improve the patient’s acceptance, adherence to therapy, as well as their overall quality of life and well-being.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】Although the presentation of mammary Paget’s disease is rare, any suspected signs or symptoms of eczematoid, pigmented, crusted, or scaly lesions or chronic inflammation in the nipple or areolae should be confirmed with biopsy to avoid delayed diagnosis. In particular, in Indonesia, further public health actions are therefore required to improve breast cancer awareness as well as to strengthen the current health system for better breast cancer management.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The clinical and imaging data supporting the analysis and findings of this study will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BIRADS:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DCIS:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ductal carcinoma _in situ_</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ER:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Estrogen receptor</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EORTC:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HER2:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Human epidermal growth receptor-2</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRM:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Modified radical mastectomy</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PR:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Progesterone receptor</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>QLQ:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Quality of Life questionnaire</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The natural history and expected complications in these patients as they age remains unknown. Despite the rarity of this condition, unusual malignancies have been reported in the medical literature for decades. It is clear that providers should suspect unusual malignancies in these patients, particularly as they age.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a 20-year-old Caucasian woman with Trisomy 13 who presented with colonic volvulus, found to have colonic polyposis and adenocarcinoma of the colon. Genetics of pathology specimens revealed 47(XX) + 13 without other mutations. She underwent prophylactic completion colectomy due to presumed risk of colorectal cancers given underlying adenomatous polyposis. She has recovered well without evidence of recurrence.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The presence of colonic polyposis and colorectal cancer without family history or known mutations for polyposis syndrome suggests an intrinsic predisposition toward colorectal cancer in this patient with Trisomy 13. Recent research into colorectal cancer oncogenes supports that aneuploidy or increased copy number of certain genes on chromosome 13 may increase the risk of malignant transformation. This is an important correlation for researchers studying these topics and clinicians caring for patients with Trisomy 13 as they age.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Trisomy 13 is one of the most common autosomal aneuploidies, with a prevalence of 1.18–1.39 cases per 10,000 live births in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Mortality is very high for this condition, with a median survival of 2.5–10 days and less than 10% surviving to 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Given the rarity of children with Trisomy 13 surviving to adulthood, the clinical complications and expected pathologies in such patients as they age are not well known.\n\n【10】Increased incidence of malignancy in patients with constitutional Trisomy, including Trisomy 13, 18, and 21, has been described previously. Specifically for Trisomy 13, a recent review found 17 malignant tumors reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The most common reported malignancies include embryonic tumors, predominantly neuroblastoma and nephroblastoma, followed by malignant germ cell tumors, leukemias, brain cancer, carcinomas, and sarcomas. Two cases of carcinomas, an adrenal carcinoma and an adenocarcinoma of the colon, both noted incidentally on autopsy findings of neonates, have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Although a small number of reports, this is exceptional given how rare carcinomas are in neonates. Despite this relatively increased incidence of unusual neoplasms in neonates with Trisomy 13, the mechanism responsible for development of malignancy in these patients is unknown. We describe one of the oldest known patients with Trisomy 13 reported in the literature, the second case of colorectal cancer in a patient with Trisomy 13, and the first case of colonic polyposis. The presence of colonic polyposis suggests a predisposition toward adenocarcinoma of the colon that is important not only in the clinical setting as more patients with Trisomy 13 age into adulthood but may also be pertinent to research concerning malignant transformation.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】We present the case of a 20-year-old Caucasian woman with Trisomy 13 (non-mosaic) with colonic polyposis and adenocarcinoma of the colon. She was originally diagnosed with Trisomy 13 as an infant via karyotype that was ordered due to multiple congenital anomalies. Her medical history includes ventriculoseptal defect that was closed as an infant, seizure disorder, profound developmental delays leaving her without purposeful speech and requiring gastrostomy dependence for all nutrition, spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, cataracts, and urinary tract anomalies including horseshoe kidney, and frequent urinary tract infections. At her medical baseline she is on numerous antiepileptic medications, urinary tract prophylaxis, and vitamins. She lives at home with her father with home health nursing support.\n\n【13】She was brought to the hospital on day of admission by her home health nurse due to bloody output from her gastrostomy tube and abdominal pain. Notably, she was discharged from the hospital 2 days prior after brief admission for Pseuodmonas aeruginosa and _Escherichia coli_ urinary tract infection causing increased seizure frequency. At that time, she was started on a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin, which she was still taking at home. Her vital signs on admission were normal and she was apyretic. A physical examination was significant for abdominal distention and tenderness to palpation, hypoactive bowel sounds, and a decreased level of alertness compared to her neurologic baseline. Laboratory findings were significant for a white blood cell count of 21,900, but other hematologic and electrolyte results were normal. Urinalysis was positive for trace protein, small leukocytes, but negative for nitrite. Point-of-care gastroccult and hemoccult testing were positive. An X-ray of her abdomen was significant for pancolonic gaseous distention with a loop of large bowel, which was noted to be similar to baseline abdominal imaging 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. She was made non per oral, started on proton pump inhibitors, and previous ciprofloxacin and home medications were continued. Blood and urine cultures, Clostridium difficile, and other infectious testing for gastrointestinal pathogens returned negative results.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Extensive colonic dilatation without evidence of pneumatosis or pneumoperitoneum was identified on plain abdominal film at the time of admission and was similar to an Xx-ray obtained 1 week prior\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Twenty-four hours after admission, she developed an acute abdomen and signs of septic shock with white blood cell count increased to 26,300. Antibiotic therapy was broadened to intravenous metronidazole and vancomycin. Computed tomography of her abdomen with intravenous contrast revealed ascending ischemic colitis involving the cecum and ascending colon with pneumatosis and portal venous gas 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Pneumatosis of the right colon and significant colonic distention identified on computed tomography scan. The arrow is pointing to pneumatosis of the right colon\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】She was taken to the operating room urgently and exploratory laparotomy revealed her cecum was not fixed in the right lower quadrant and the ascending and transverse colon had volvulized around the ileocolic pedicle. She had three areas of full-thickness necrosis in the ascending and transverse colon. The intervening segments of colon were viable. She had a normal ligament of Treitz. The left colon had proper fixation. Although there were no areas of perforation, there was murky ascites in the abdomen and pelvis. Because our patient was hypotensive requiring pressors during the case, the decision was made to perform a resection and bring out an ileostomy with creation of a Hartmann’s pouch. She completed a 10-day course of intravenous meropenem. She did well postoperatively, enteral nutrition was advanced slowly, and she was discharged home on postoperative day nine.\n\n【22】The pathology report of her resected colon revealed ischemic necrosis and ulceration, as well as an incidental finding of a 2-cm adenocarcinoma. The resection margin was clear with all 16 lymph nodes negative for disease, indicating a diagnosis of stage 1 cancer of the transverse colon (T2N0M0). Microarray and karyotype of the malignancy revealed 47XX + 13 without any other identifiable cytogenetic abnormality. Pathology also noted numerous other tubular adenomas concerning for polyposis of the remaining colon. There was no family history of familial polyposis syndromes or colorectal cancers. She subsequently underwent completion proctocolectomy due to polyposis and risk of developing additional cancers in the future.\n\n【23】Pathology of the proctocolectomy specimen confirmed polyposis with multiple tubular adenomas with high-grade dysplasia and benign lymph nodes. The postoperative course was complicated by small bowel obstruction due to an internal hernia around her ileostomy requiring surgical reduction, and portal vein thrombosis, which spontaneously resolved. Over 2 years after her completion proctocolectomy she is doing well without signs of local recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】The findings of colonic polyposis and adenocarcinoma of the colon in a young adult with no such family history and no known mutations associated with either condition suggests Trisomy 13 may be an important clinical factor. Chromosomal aneuploidy is thought to be an important step in malignant transformation of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The exact risk that constitutional trisomy of chromosome 13 confers for malignancy is unknown. Trisomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality has been implicated in the malignant transformation of acute leukemias, especially myeloid leukemias, since the early 1990s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. This has been described as a rare but distinctive lineage that confers poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Chromosomal analysis of adenomatous colonic polyps has shown trisomy of chromosome 13 to be a frequent abnormality, thought to contribute to malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. The exact mechanism of this contribution remains unknown, but an increased copy number of certain genes on 13q have been implicated in colorectal carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In particular, cyclin-dependent kinase 8 ( _CDK8)_ is a known colorectal oncogene, also located on 13q, and has been found to have increased copy number in 62% of colorectal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. None of these genetic variants have been noted in patients with a polyposis syndrome, and it is unclear how Trisomy 13 without other cytogenetic abnormalities confers an increased risk of colonic polyposis.\n\n【26】Colonic adenomatous polyposis is a condition characterized by numerous adenomatous polyps. It is associated with heritable genetic syndromes, most frequently familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Polyposis typically indicates an increased risk of colorectal cancer and is usually associated with an underlying premalignant genetic abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. About 20% of colonic polyposis cases are considered sporadic, meaning patients do not test positive for known syndromic gene mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. A majority of these are still familial, with numerous family members exhibiting polyposis, indicating a likely genetic association as yet undescribed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. There is no known association between aneuploidy or increased copy number of genes on chromosome 13 and colonic polyposis.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】The finding of polyposis syndrome and colorectal cancer in an adult patient with Trisomy 13 without other cytogenetic abnormalities indicates a predisposition to developing colorectal cancer, but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Given recent discoveries surrounding the importance of chromosome 13 on the malignant transformation of colorectal cancers, it is possible this is not a coincidence. This is an important correlation to report not only for researchers, but also for clinicians caring for patients with Trisomy 13. It is clear that clinicians should suspect unusual malignancies in these patients, particularly as they age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

They underwent to exeresis of lesions and application of leukocyte-platelet rich fibrin membranes. Tissue healing was clinically evaluated after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 postoperative days. No recurrences were observed after 2 years of semi-annual follow up.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We obtained rapid and good healing of soft tissues probably due to the elevated content of leukocytes, platelets and growth factors in the leukocyte-platelet rich fibrin. Based on our results we suggest the use of leukocyte-platelet rich fibrin to cover wounds after exeresis of oral neoformations such as hyperplastic gingival lesions.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Hyperplastic gingival lesions consist of fibro-epithelial reactions that are secondary to multiple factors: chronic inflammation, local irritation (e.g. dental plaque, tartar, root residues, projecting fillings and reconstructions, incongruous dentures), hormonal factors (puberty, pregnancy), and drugs such as anti-epileptic drugs (diphenylhydantoin sodium, valproate sodium, carbamazepine), immunosuppressive drugs (ciclosporin) and antianginal vasodilators (nifedipine) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. A dysplastic hypothesis has been formulated regarding its onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>; this hypothesis is suggested by the tendency of some hyperplastic gingival lesions to grow and not to regress spontaneously. They tend to recur unless a radical surgical therapy is performed. Examples of these lesions are giant-cell epulis and fibro-osseous epulis. Giant-cell epulis is the most common form and it is also called peripheral giant-cell granuloma (PGCG). It was first reported as fungus flesh in 1848 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, then reported as giant cell reparative granuloma in 1953 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This lesion is the peripheral opponent form of central giant-cell intraosseous tumors, characterized by the presence of giant cells that seem to originate from osteoclasts in the periodontal ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Fibro-osseous epulis or peripheral ossifying fibroma (POsF) was first reported and described as ‘alveolar exostosis’ in 1844 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. It presents a dense collagenous stroma in which thin trabecular bone can be observed.\n\n【10】We report two cases of hyperplastic gingival lesions treated by exeresis and application of leukocyte-platelet rich fibrin (L-PRF) membranes in order to improve and accelerate tissue healing. L-PRF belongs to a second generation of platelet concentrates which does not need biochemical blood manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. It is used for tissue healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u> and regeneration in periodontal and oral-maxillofacial surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> because of its elevated content of leukocytes, platelets and growth factors.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】### Case number one\n\n【13】A 78-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a complaint of a swelling in her right mandibular molar teeth area that was painful at mastication. The swelling had arisen 4 months previously and had grown quickly. On extraoral examination she presented a right facial swelling and the skin of her face was healthy. Her regional lymph nodes were not palpable. On intraoral examination she showed poor oral hygiene. A 45×30×20mm sessile, lobular, soft tissue mass was evident in her right posterior mandibular gingiva 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The mucosal covering of the lesion looked rosy-purple with a focal area of ulceration. The lesion was painful and bleeding on palpation with a parenchymatous consistency. At orthopantomography two premolar residual roots were observed in the area of the lesion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u> with no other significant findings.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Intraoral appearance of the lesion, Patient 1\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Orthopantomography, Patient 1\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】### Case number two\n\n【21】A 30-year-old Caucasian man presented with a complaint of a swelling in his left hard palate region which had arisen approximately 2 months previously after contact with hot food. The lesion was not painful but was responsible for discomfort on swallowing and phonation. On extraoral examination facial skin lesions or swellings were not highlighted and his regional lymph nodes were not palpable. An intraoral examination showed a sessile and detected lesion of hard palate in correspondence with left maxillary lateral incisor, left maxillary canine and left maxillary first premolar. The lesion was characterized by a diameter of 10mm and the mucosa which covered it looked eutrophic 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The lesion was not painful on palpation and it had a hard consistency. He showed good level of oral hygiene. The adjacent teeth did not have carious or periodontal lesions and they responded positively to the vitality test. At orthopantomography no signs of pathology were found.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Intraoral appearance of the lesion, Patient 2\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】### Surgical procedures\n\n【26】In both cases we decided to proceed with a surgical approach characterized by complete excision of lesions and application of L-PRF membranes in order to improve and accelerate tissue healing.\n\n【27】Prior antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin clavulanate (2g 1 hour before operation) infiltrative anesthesia (mepivacaine 30mg/mL and epinephrine 0.01mg/mL) was performed. Full thickness incisions were realized by Bard-Parker blades number 15 and they included at least 2 mm of healthy tissue. The lesions strongly adhered to the floor below. They were lifted by Prichard’s periosteal spatulas and surgical tweezers 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. At the same time blood samples (40cc per patient) were collected in test tubes without anticoagulant to obtain the L-PRF. L-PRF protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> is realized with the Intra-Spin L-PRF which provides blood centrifugation at 2700 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 12 minutes. Centrifugation determines the formation of the clot and the activation of the growth factors. After centrifugation L-PRF clots were collected together with some red blood cells from the test tubes using sterile scissors. L-PRF clots were compressed between two sterile gauzes to obtain manageable membranes useful to cover the wounds. The L-PRF membranes were stabilized with horizontal mattress and single sutures in Vicryl 3/0 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 5 and 6 )</u> removed after 7 days. After the surgery, the patients were encouraged to take, in case of pain, acetaminophen (1g/8 hours) or ibuprofen (600mg/8 hours) and a collutory with chlorhexidine 0.20% was prescribed for 7 days. Tissue healing was clinically evaluated after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 30 postoperative days 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 7 )</u>. Healing was quick and without dehiscences. Therefore, complete excision of the lesion was performed and the entire specimen submitted for histopathological examination 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 8 )</u>.

Both young and old patients must take prompt actions to avoid growth of oral lesions that can begin to become difficult to manage. There is unanimous consensus on the surgical excision of these lesions in toto to prevent recurrence. The target of these case reports is to focus on the management of the L-PRF and its placement on the surgical wounds. The first benefit is given by covering the surgical site, which would otherwise heal by secondary intention, which provides greater comfort to the patient in the postoperative period. The same wound healing appears to be substantially accelerated because of the structural and neoangiogenetical properties of L-PRF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In the polymerization step of the L-PRF, thrombin, which is present in physiological concentrations, allows the formation of a fibrin matrix in a slow and natural way obtaining a flexible structure capable of determining entrapment of cytokines, cell migration and tissue healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The effect of L-PRF on reducing pain and postoperative swelling has the same importance. There are countless practices that the L-PRF offers in the dental field such as the accelerated healing of extraction sockets and use with other biomaterials in bone regeneration (GBR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In the context of tissue regeneration we evaluated the role of L-PRF in the promotion of wound healing. We also stress the importance of such a gel in the control of hemostasis in patients taking anti-platelets and/or anticoagulants for whom extractions can be performed without discontinuation of these drugs.\n\n【51】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【52】According to the encouraging results obtained in these two clinical cases about tissue healing after application of L-PRF membranes, we suggest that L-PRF be used to cover wounds after exeresis of oral neoformations such as hyperplastic gingival lesions.\n\n【53】Consent\n-------\n\n【54】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is a rare complication, but pulmonary embolism caused by thrombus shedding may be life-threatening. There are few reports and no standardized consensus on prevention and treatment. This paper reports the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with IVC thrombosis during ECMO, and discusses the prevention and treatment of IVC thrombosis during ECMO through a literature review. Informed consent was obtained for all special treatment protocols involved.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 75-year-old female patient (Han Chinese ethnicity) weighing 55 kg with cardiogenic shock was admitted to our critical care department. After regular treatment was unsuccessful, she was treated with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) on January 19, 2021, for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. MAQUET ECMO equipment was used. The ECMO catheter was implanted into the right femoral vein and left femoral artery under ultrasound guidance. The end of the catheter was confirmed to the level of the right atrium by ultrasound. VA-ECMO was established with a rotational speed of 3500/minute, flow rate of 3.2 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen \\[FiO <sub>2 </sub> \\] of 100%, gas flow rate of 4 L/minute, and vasoactive drugs dobutamine 6 μg/(kg/minute) and norepinephrine 0.1 μg/(kg/minute) The parameters of the ventilator were adjusted as follows: oxygen concentration 50%, respiratory rate 10 times/minute, tidal volume 5 mL/kg, and positive end-expiratory pressure 8 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O. When ECMO was established, due to abnormal coagulation function (activated clotting time \\[ACT\\] > 200 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time \\[APTT\\] > 160 seconds), anticoagulation was temporarily delayed. A total of 600 mL of plasma and 4 U of red blood cell suspension were supplemented. ACT was monitored every 2 hours. When ACT decreased to less than 200 seconds, heparin anticoagulation was started at APTT of 60 seconds 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. We conducted a physical examination at the bedside, and we found that the pupil size of the patient’s eyes were not equal, so we performed a computed tomography (CT) examination. The CT report showed cerebral infarction and possibly a small amount of bleeding after infarction in the right parietal lobe. The right frontal lobe showed basal ganglia cavity infarction and elderly brain changes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Because of the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, we used a low-intensity heparin anticoagulation strategy. With the assistance of ECMO, the patient underwent coronary angiography + percutaneous coronary angioplasty + stent implantation aided by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on January 20 at 08:20–09:35. After the operation, the cardiac function gradually recovered and the hemodynamics improved. On January 21, dopamine was stopped, and low-dose norepinephrine combined with dobutamine was continued. Because of the progressive decrease in platelets and the low activity of antithrombin III, the anticoagulation efficiency of unfractionated heparin was considered to decrease, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was not excluded. Argatroban anticoagulation was used to maintain APTT of between 50 and 70 seconds. On January 26, ECMO parameters were adjusted to a rotation speed of 2795 r/minute, blood flow 1.61 L/minute, FiO <sub>2 </sub> % 21%, air flow 1.5 L/minute, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) 90 mmHg. Bedside echocardiography showed that the patient's cardiac systolic function was improved, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (biplane Simpson method) was 35%, and hemodynamics were stable. As the patient's cardiac function improved, we discussed with caregivers and family about the discontinuation of ECMO therapy, and the ECMO was removed after evaluation. On January 27, 2021, color Doppler ultrasound showed 34% LVEF (biplane Simpson method) and thrombosis from the IVC to the atrium 通用删除1(英):<u>(about 70 mm in length, 8 mm in width, with a floating tail end, Fig. 3 a)</u>. Enoxaparin was given immediately for 1 mg/kg every 12 hours ih. On February 5, 2021, color Doppler echocardiography showed thrombosis from the IVC to the right atrium entrance 通用删除1(英):<u>(compared with January 27, 2021, volume reduced, shape changed, length about 48 mm, width about 4 mm, tail end floating, Fig. 3 b)</u>. On February 19, 2021, color Doppler echocardiography showed no obvious abnormal echo in the IVC; combined with medical history, thrombus disappeared after anticoagulant therapy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 c)</u>. Later, the patient's condition gradually stabilized. On the 30th day, she was taken off the ventilator and administered oral rivaroxaban instead of anticoagulants. Due to decreased muscle strength of her limbs, she received rehabilitation exercise and was discharged on the 60th day. Her level of consciousness returned to normal without residual central nervous system-related complications.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Monitoring values of anticoagulant dosage and coagulation function during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】In the right parietal lobe, cerebral infarction and bleeding after a small amount of cerebral infarction may be possible\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 3**\n\n【20】Echocardiography after cannula removal. **a** shows that after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation catheter removal, the inferior vena cava thrombosis was found by ultrasonography. **b** shows that the thrombosis of the inferior vena cava decreases gradually after heparin anticoagulation. **c** shows that the thrombus of inferior vena cava disappeared after heparin anticoagulation. _RA_ right atrium, _IVC_ inferior vena cava, Thrombosis in   inferior vena cava (arrowhead)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Although ECMO may be the most effective treatment for patients with severe heart or respiratory failure, it has many complications, including bleeding (33%), hemolysis (18%), and venous microthrombosis (10%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. During ECMO, there are many risk factors for thrombosis, including disease severity, sedation, frequent blood transfusion, non-pulse blood flow, and blood exposure to a non-biological ECMO pipeline, all of which are the microenvironment leading to thrombosis, so anticoagulation therapy must be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, the incidence of bleeding during ECMO can be as high as 29%, with 10% at risk of massive bleeding and 4–10% at risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This group of patients may have insufficient anticoagulation due to the existence of bleeding risk factors, which is also an important reason for thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Because of the possible risk of cerebral hemorrhage in our case, we reduced the anticoagulation intensity of heparin, which eventually led to IVC thrombosis.\n\n【24】In the process of ECMO treatment, we often encounter distal limb thrombosis. The treatment measures include strengthening anticoagulation, replacing the catheter, removing the thrombus, and other treatment measures, which are relatively easy to handle and of relatively low risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the incidence of thrombus formation near the entrance of the IVC is low, and thrombus shedding leads to acute massive pulmonary embolism, and even sudden death, which is rarely reported.\n\n【25】We retrospectively analyzed patients with IVC thrombosis during ECMO therapy reported in the previous literature. The PubMed database was searched by using the keywords \"inferior vena cava thrombosis\" and \"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\" Our search showed 13 other reports on the subject 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>. Among the 14 patients, five patients were treated with VA-ECMO, mainly cardiogenic shock patients, including one heart transplant patient; the other eight patients were treated with veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO) after acute respiratory failure, including two lung transplant patients. Unfortunately, these two patients eventually died. The cause of death was not caused by pulmonary embolism, which may be related to the severity of the disease. According to the literature, the causes of IVC thrombosis are as follows: blood loss, insufficient volume, decreased blood flow velocity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, continuous catheter shaking, low-intensity anticoagulation, or no heparin anticoagulation, all of which are also important reasons for thrombosis on the surface of ECMO catheter. In addition, because there is no heparin coating on the outer surface of the ECMO catheter, thrombosis is more likely to occur. If the antithrombin III (ATIII) level is low, there is also a risk of thrombosis; when the ATIII < 60% (normal range 80–120%). The anticoagulant efficiency of heparin decreased, and conventional ACT or APTT could not accurately determine the anticoagulant intensity, leading to thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】**Table 1 Case reports of inferior vena cava thrombosis during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】The clinical manifestations of IVC thrombosis in ECMO patients were nonspecific, mainly manifested as \"IVC syndrome,\" and distal limb edema in some patients after removal of the ECMO catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In addition, if IVC thrombosis occurs during ECMO, sudden hypoxemia and ECMO flow decrease may also be caused by the patient's postural changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Hemolysis has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The main diagnostic methods were ultrasound examination of the heart and IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 16 \\]</u>. It is worth noting that there is a kind of thrombus formed outside the ECMO catheter, which is not easy to find during ECMO, because it can be easily mistaken for the ECMO catheter wall. After the ECMO catheter was removed, two-dimensional ultrasound showed that the thrombus became tubular; color Doppler ultrasound showed that the blood flow could pass through the thrombus, and even the tail of the thrombus could float, as shown in the ultrasound in our case 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>. At present, there is no good method to identify this kind of thrombus, which may be judged by repeatedly measuring the wall thickness of the ECMO catheter. Therefore, color Doppler ultrasound can provide a suitable method for the detection and follow-up of venous thrombosis during ECMO or after removal of the ECMO catheter to prevent the occurrence of serious sequelae, such as pulmonary embolism.\n\n【30】Treatment measures include drug therapy, vascular interventional therapy, and surgery. According to a literature analysis, 76.9% (10/13) of patients received anticoagulant therapy, and there is no report about thrombolysis at present. One patient undergoing thrombectomy was a heart transplant patient, and another had received lung transplantation, and their prognosis was good. Both of the deaths were lung transplant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 18 \\]</u>. This indicates that the severity of the disease is an important factor affecting patient survival. At present, there is no report on the application of vascular interventional therapy. However, it has been reported that the AngioVac System can successfully evacuate the thrombus in cases of ECMO-related thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【32】Based on our clinical cases and literature analysis, we believe that IVC thrombosis is one of the serious complications associated with the process of ECMO therapy. Once it occurs, it is closely related to the mortality and disability rate of patients. Prevention of thrombosis and optimization of the anticoagulant regimen are the main preventive measures, and anticoagulant therapy is still the main cause of IVC thrombosis in the process of ECMO therapy. Other interventional strategies need to accumulate clinical experience.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This disease was first described by Oberling in 1928 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most patients with this disease are adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The prevalence of PBL is estimated at 3–7% amongst primary bone tumors and less than 2% amongst all lymphomas in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only 9% of all PBL has been reported in the spinal column 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The exact definition of PBL in medicine is still a controversial issue and much debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Overall, the diagnostic criteria used for PBL are those established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The treatment of these patients is challenging, and the best results come from early diagnosis. Here we report a case of primary lymphoma of the lumbar vertebrae in an adult. The clinical summary, imaging findings, and surgical procedures are discussed. Also, a review of the literature on primary lymphoma of the spinal vertebrae (PLSV) is presented.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 65-year-old Persian man was admitted with severe low back pain. The current symptoms started 1 month before the admission. He experienced muscle weakness (3/5 muscle strength on the Medical Research Council scale) with progressive urinary retention and constipation. Therefore, he developed cauda equina syndrome. The patient did not experience any unintentional weight loss, night sweats, or fever. All routine laboratory tests including complete blood count with differential (CBC w/diff), thyroid function tests (TFTs), liver function tests (LFTs), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and ferritin levels, and tumor survey were normal.\n\n【12】Diagnostic radiographic imaging was performed according to symptoms and physical examination signs. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar vertebrae demonstrated a lesion in the L3 vertebra with destruction of the L3 vertebral body and the left pedicle 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine revealed a lesion of the L3 vertebral body with hyposignal on T1-weighted and hypersignal on T2-weighted image, with significant compression of the spinal cord. Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences also showed bone marrow changes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. No hemorrhage was seen. A whole-body bone scan \\[single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\\] was performed to evaluate various bone-related pathology, and increased absorption was seen only in the L3 vertebra. The diagnosis before surgery was a primary spinal tumor.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Axial ( **A** ) and sagittal ( **B** ) computed tomography images showing bony destruction on L3 vertebra\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Axial ( **A** ) and sagittal ( **B** ) magnetic resonance images showing signal changes and cord compression on the L3 level\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Rapid deterioration of the neurological condition of our patient led to the decision to perform surgery without biopsy. In April 2020, 3 days after the first visit, under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an L3 corpectomy with expandable cage placement, followed by an L2–L4 lateral screw placement with rod fixation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The vertebral body sample obtained from the surgery was submitted for pathology examination. Three days after the first surgery, facetectomy, laminectomy, and total spondylectomy were performed with pedicle screw from L1–L5. A titanium mesh was placed over the laminectomy site to protect the spinal cord and fusion with autograft bone from the patient's iliac crest 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】Intraoperative photograph ( **A** ) showing titanium mesh placed on the post-laminectomy defect. X-ray imaging after first surgery ( **B** ), anteroposterior and lateral lumbar spine radiographs ( **C** and **D** ) at the last follow-up\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Excisional biopsy revealed high-grade lymphoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. Histopathology and diagnosis confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which consisted of large lymphoid cells that had vesiculated nuclei with prominent nucleoli and frequent mitotic activity. Small mature lymphoid cells with mature nuclei were also found. Immunohistochemical staining was cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3)-positive for non-neoplastic cells, and CD3-negative, CD15-negative, and CD20-positive for neoplastic cells. Antigen Ki67 was positive in about 70% of tumor cells. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. A staging examination including CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis presented no additional suspicious sites.\n\n【24】**Fig. 4**\n\n【25】Histopathology examination of the patient\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Post-operation, the patient showed no new neurological deficit. The treatment was continued with a total of six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin \\[doxorubicin\\], vincristine \\[Oncovin\\] and prednisolone) and then local radiotherapy by a clinical oncologist and radiation oncologist, respectively. The patient received a total of 40 Gy over 22 sessions. The intensity of back pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), before and after the surgery. Eight months after surgery (last visit), an improvement was seen in back pain intensity (VAS) and neurological status. Anteroposterior and lateral lumbar spine radiographs are shown in Fig. 3 C and D at the last follow-up. Based on clinical status, radiological imaging, and laboratory tests, no extraspinal disease was observed. We reviewed a PubMed database for the following search terms: primary lymphoma, spine, and vertebrae from 2010 to 2020. We selected English, full-text publications which exactly corresponded to our subject of interest. Only primary lymphoma of the lumbar vertebrae without involving other bones was considered. In addition, primary lymphoma of the sacrum was not included in this study. We excluded studies that did not mention the type of lymphoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】**Table 1 Summary of five reported cases of primary lymphoma of the spinal vertebrae**\n\n【29】Full size table\n\n【30】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【31】To our knowledge, this case is the first report of primary lymphoma of the lumbar vertebrae with such a clinical presentation. Primary lymphoma arising from the lumbar vertebrae is exceedingly rare. Diagnosing the disease may be challenging due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical-radiological features. Spine surgeons should be aware of the unique presentation of this disease and that combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is a successful treatment strategy.\n\n【32】Sharma _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> presented 49 patients with PBL. Lymphoma involved multiple bones including spine + rib cage (51.0%) ( _n_ \\= 25) and pelvis (34.6%) ( _n_ \\= 17). No case involved single vertebrae. Zhang _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> analyzed 61 PBL cases. Only one case involved a single spinal vertebra. However, the location of the vertebra was not reported. Beal _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> reported a series of PBL that included 82 patients. In that series, the frequency of different bone involvement was femur (27%), pelvis (15%), tibia/fibula (13%), polyostotic (13%), humerus (12%), spine (9%) ( _n_ \\= 7), other (5%), mandible (2%), radius/ulna (1%), scapula (1%), and skull (1%). Further details of the spinal vertebrae were not reported. To improve overall survival rates of patients, they recommended the use of combined-modality over single-modality treatment, which is in line with this study. However, patients with advanced-stage disease who received chemotherapy alone have a good outcome when compared with those who received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In addition, according to the WHO classification, lymphoma involving the bone can be classified into four groups. Group 1 is lymphoma in a single bone position with or without local lymph node involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. We diagnosed the primary lymphoma of the lumbar vertebrae in our case based on the WHO classification to be primary lymphoma group 1. It should be noted that all treatment decisions will depend on the patient's status. Further studies are necessary to clarify the characteristics of PBL and its optimal treatment strategy.\n\n【33】Diagnosis of PBL may be challenging. Different imaging techniques including CT, MRI, SPECT, and positron emission tomography (PET) combined with biopsy results are used to diagnose this disease. However, a biopsy of an adjacent lymph node or directly from the involved bone forms is the foundation of the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In this study, we used CT, MRI, and SPECT imaging combined with biopsy results to diagnose the disease. However, integrated PET/CT was not used, which is a limitation of this study. Similar to this study, on MRI, the lesions often showed hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The contrast-enhanced images demonstrated areas of enhancement within the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. As our surgical approach, corpectomy and decompression with fusion were successful in preventing progressive neurological damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Also, local radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy are recommended based on the patient's condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. It is interesting that in our case, similar to other cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>, the clinical results show a good prognosis in the final follow-up. This may be because this disease cannot affect any part of the body other than the spinal vertebrae.\n\n【34】PBL is a rare but known entity. The most common site of occurrence is the long bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Spinal involvement was reported in only 9% of cases, and dorsal vertebrae are the most common site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u>. While isolated lumbar vertebral lymphoma has not been reported yet, it seems that there is no difference between vertebrae with lymphoma involvement, although more study is needed. This case was unique insofar as it is the first report of primary lymphoma of the lumbar vertebrae at the L3 position without involving other bones. Hence, it may have a role to play in medical research and evidence-based medicine. More importantly, it gives an indication of the decision-making process, and thus other clinicians can gain a broader understanding of clinical diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes with respect to their own cases. In the present case, the initial symptoms may have resulted result in lumbar cord compression. We believe that early diagnosis and early surgery for decompression of the spinal cord, followed by local radiotherapy and chemotherapy, was successful in preventing progressive neurological damage and maintaining quality of life.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the data supporting our findings are contained within the manuscript.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PET:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positron emission tomography</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PLSV:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Primary lymphoma of the spinal vertebrae</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SPECT:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Single-photon emission computed tomography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Cause of abdominal compartment syndrome and intra-abdominal hypertension**\n\n【11】Full size table\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 48-year-old Japanese man suffering from shock was transported by ambulance to our hospital. He recovered consciousness in the ambulance. His medical history included hypoglycemic encephalopathy sequelae, which led to poor performance status, namely disuse syndrome, type 2 diabetic neuropathy, constipation, and transient vasovagal syncope after defecation. He was treated with sitagliptin phosphate, voglibose, and a laxative, and did not take any medicines that could slow bowel movements, such as antidepressive drugs. The patient was unemployed and did not have any food or drug allergies. His family history contained nothing of note; specifically, there was no family history of any immunodeficiency disorder or other congenital anomalies.\n\n【14】The patient was 175 cm tall and weighed 47 kg. His vital signs were abnormal, with blood pressure of 82/52 mmHg, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, body temperature of 35.1 °C, oxygen saturation of 97% in ambient air, and respiratory rate of 16 per minute; his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 (E4V5M6). Nothing abnormal was detected upon physical examination. The patient’s laboratory findings were normal, including complete blood count, biochemistry, casual blood glucose, ammonia, and urine tests. An abdominal X-ray and arterial-phase dynamic computed tomography revealed a thickened gut wall and an extremely dilated sigmoid colon and rectum filled with a massive amount of stool as well as gas, compressing other intra-abdominal organs 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively)</u>. On the other hand, no apparent volvulus or peritonitis was observed. We diagnosed the patient with transient vasovagal syncope, together with abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), due to extremely elongated sigmoid colon and rectum plus fecal impaction, caused by anorectal disturbance derived from disuse syndrome and diabetic neuropathy.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】An abdominal X-ray on admission revealed a thickened gut wall and extremely dilated sigmoid colon and rectum filled with a massive amount of stool as well as gas\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Arterial phase of abdominal dynamic computed tomography ( **a** transverse plane, **b** coronal plane, **c** sagittal plane) on admission.

The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and an abdominal X-ray on the 41st hospital day revealed relief of dilated sigmoid colon and rectum together with massive amount of stool 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. He transferred hospitals on the 44th hospital day in order to continue treatment, and we did not follow him afterwards.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】An abdominal X-ray on the 41st hospital day revealed relief of dilated sigmoid colon and rectum together with massive amount of stool\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】We found no other cases of ACS showing a more severe elongated colon among patients who had disuse syndrome and type 2 diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, this is the severest known case of ACS due to extremely elongated sigmoid colon and rectum plus fecal impaction. Recent developments related to IAH/ACS and clinical practice guidelines were published in 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In general, IAH may be induced by any of several intra-abdominal or extra-abdominal conditions, reduced abdominal wall compliance, or intra-abdominal pathologies (of either the peritoneal space or parenchymatous organs); its mechanism is mucosal and submucosal tissue hypoperfusion, which causes considerable damage to the intestinal cells, potentially resulting in bacterial translocation, endotoxin release, or sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Among these, most commonly, intra-abdominal infections and/or sepsis and severe trauma or burns are predisposed to lead to IAH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. IAH is caused by decreased perfusion of the kidneys, abdominal viscera, splanchnic organs, central nervous system, and possible difficulties with ventilation and maintenance of cardiac output, and can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. IAH can be classified as either primary or secondary, and those causes are shown in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. ACS is the end point of a process whereby massive interstitial swelling in the abdomen or rapid development of a space-filling lesion in the abdomen (such as ascites or a hematoma) leads to pathologically increased pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Massive fecal impaction leading to surgical catastrophes has rarely been reported, and neglected fecal impaction may lead to megarectum causing ACS and colorectal obstruction, perforation, or necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In this case, diabetic neuropathy and disuse syndrome led to fecal impaction and distended abdomen; they then caused secondary IAH and ACS.\n\n【27】Measurement of intravesical pressure is the gold standard for diagnosing IAH, as well as measurement of bladder pressure: pressure greater than 12 mmHg is consistent with IAH, and greater than 25 mmHg is consistent with ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 17 \\]</u>. There are an increasing number of techniques that allow us to measure intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) at the bedside 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. IAP should be measured at end-expiration, with the patient in the supine position, after ensuring that there is no abdominal muscle activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. The level where the mid-axillary line crosses the iliac crest is the recommended zero reference for the transvesical IAP measurement; marking this level on the patient also increases reproducibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. In children, normal IAP in mechanically ventilated patients is approximately 7 ± 3 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. As an IAP of 10–15 mmHg has been associated with organ damage in children, an IAP greater than 10 mmHg should be considered IAH in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Moreover, as ACS may occur in children at an IAP lower than 20 mmHg, any elevation in IAP greater than 10 mmHg associated with new organ dysfunction should be considered ACS in children until proven otherwise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In this case, IAP was not measured, but IAH and ACS were strongly suspected based on the patient’s symptoms as well as physical examinations and imaging investigations.\n\n【28】Medical management of critically ill patients with raised IAP should be instigated early to prevent further organ dysfunction and to avoid progression to ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Appropriate actions should be taken when IAP increases above 15 mmHg, especially if pressures reach 20 mmHg or greater with new-onset organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Therapy for IAH/ACS consists of five treatment \"columns\": intraluminal evacuation, intra-abdominal evacuation, improvement of abdominal wall compliance, fluid management, and improved organ perfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 20 , 22 \\]</u>. As treatment, nonsurgical management is an important treatment option in critically ill patients with raised IAP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. In addition, many treatment options are available, and are often part of routine daily management in the intensive care unit (fluid resuscitation, the use of inotropes, positive pressure ventilation, nasogastric or enteral decompression tubes, enema, neuromuscular blocking, prokinetic agents, sedation/analgesia, body position, interventions that decrease fluid balance, and percutaneous catheter drainage) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 15 , 20 \\]</u>. On the other hand, improved resuscitation and sepsis control decrease, but do not obviate, the need for open abdomen and progression for ACS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】If conservative therapy fails, emergency laparotomy or colonoscopy is the most effective therapeutic approach to achieve abdominal decompression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 4 , 21 , 22 , 23 \\]</u>. In particular, surgical decompression with midline laparotomy is the standard ultimate treatment once ACS with organ dysfunction is established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Thereafter, patients with an open abdomen require intensive care, and are permanently threatened by the quadrangle of fluid loss, muscle proteolysis, heat loss, and impaired immune function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. As a consequence, the complication rate increases dramatically after 8 days of open abdomen therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】An early sign of ACS may be a decrease in urinary output, and ACS patients often complain of abdominal pain and abdominal fullness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 12 \\]</u>. In addition, elevated IAP may induce adverse effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, splanchnic, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system physiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. On the other hand, elderly patients sometimes develop dementia and experience reduced everyday activities that are common with aging, and they frequently complain of severe abdominal distension with hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. ACS progression can be life-threatening, with multiple-organ dysfunction in the respiratory, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal systems; therefore, the correct diagnosis of ACS onset and timely appropriate intervention are required for an optimal outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 24 \\]</u>. In this case, because of diabetic neuropathy, the patient did not complain of abdominal symptoms, therefore making it difficult to diagnose as ACS.\n\n【31】IAH/ACS may be prevented in patients undergoing laparotomy by leaving the abdomen open where appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. If untreated, ACS can lead to multisystem organ failure and death, with nearly 100% mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Additionally, ACS associated with new organ dysfunction or failure has a mortality rate of up to 60%, and despite many efforts, mortality in patients with ACS remains unacceptably high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 8 , 22 \\]</u>. The key to optimizing outcome is early abdominal closure within 7 days, because failure to do so increases morbidity, mortality, and fistula formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In conclusion, we encountered a case of ACS due to extremely elongated sigmoid colon and rectum plus fecal impaction caused by disuse syndrome and diabetic neuropathy. The key message here is that clinicians need to keep ACS in mind as a differential diagnosis, and perform careful and detailed examination when encountering patients presenting with symptoms or risk factors of ACS. In addition, they need to precisely diagnose ACS and perform optimal treatment without delay.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IAH:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intra-abdominal hypertension</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACS:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abdominal compartment syndrome</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IAP:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intra-abdominal pressure</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In this report, we present a novel c.639G>A (p.W213\\*) mutation in a Vietnamese man with HDGC.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】In September 2016, a 28-year-old Vietnamese male patient visited the National Geriatric Hospital in Hanoi due to epigastric pain, weight loss, and painful swollen lymph nodes in his neck for the past 5 months. He had no history of gastric disease. The subsequent workup included a gastroscopy that revealed an ulcer in the body of the stomach measuring more than 3 cm in diameter. The biopsy from gastroscopy was assessed for _Helicobacter pylori_ by the _Campylobacter_ \\-like organism (CLO) test and histopathological examination. Histopathology results for the ulcer were negative for _H. pylori_ and revealed stage IV diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC), characterized by signet ring cells. Unfortunately, for financial reasons, the patient refused additional diagnosis including neck lymph node biopsy, computed tomography (CT) scan, and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT to evaluate distant metastasis, and also refused to follow up on further treatments. The patient's health deteriorated, and he died 4 months post-diagnosis.\n\n【12】The patient’s family history did not show DGC. However, because of the clinicopathological presentation including early onset, severe clinical symptoms, and histopathological test results showing diffuse-type characteristics, we performed genetic screening for mutations in the _CDH1_ gene by E-cadherin protein expression.\n\n【13】With the patient’s consent, we used the Exgene™ Blood SV kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Korea) to extract DNA from the whole blood sample according to the instruction manual. This was followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing using both forward and reverse primers for all exons and introns of the _CDH1_ gene. The primers were designed using National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Primer-BLAST \\[Basic Local Alignment Search Tool\\] and the QIAGEN CLC Main Workbench (version 8.1.2.) and were reanalyzed using the OligoAnalyzer tool. After the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we separated the DNA by size using gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose gel). Finally, we performed gel analysis using the UVP GelDoc-It <sup>2 </sup> Imaging System (Fisher Scientific). The determination of DNA sequences for all samples was done on Applied Biosystems ABI 3500 (JP0 and ABI 3730xl; Thermo Fisher) deoxyribonuclease acid (DNA) analyzers, followed by gene analysis using BioEdit (version 2.0) and ApE (version 1.0) software.\n\n【14】We found a novel heterozygous nonsense mutation that resulted in a premature termination codon (PTC) UGA at p.213 in exon 5 ( _CDH1_ c.639G>A, p.W213) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The mutation shortened the _CDH1_ gene length from 882 aa to 213 aa. The immunohistochemical staining of the patient’s tissue sample showed decreased expression of E-cadherin 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Analysis of exon 5 deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing; c.639G>A, p.W213\\* mutation was located.

Positive staining is shown in brown. Representative images of E-cadherin staining demonstrated lower expression of E-cadherin\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】We collected blood samples from the patient’s family members (11 participants) for mutation screening in the _CDH1_ gene exon 5. The participants included three first cousins once removed (III-1, III-2, III-3), two uncles (III-4, III-5), the father (III-6), the mother (III-7), a male first cousin (IV-1), a female first cousin (IV-2), an older sister (IV-3), and a younger brother (IV-7) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. At the time of testing, no participants showed any symptoms of HDGC. Upon analysis of the pedigree, we found the patient’s parents to be healthy, and there was no family history of the disease. The DNA sequencing in _CDH1_ exon 5 showed a similar mutation (c.639G>A, p.W213\\*) in two members of the family: the father (III-6, 59 years old) and an uncle (III-4, 65 years old), with both heterozygous. Gastroscopy performed on the patient’s father revealed inflammation and antral gastritis. Six-core biopsy specimens showed chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and low-grade dysplasia. High iron diamine staining for metaplasia typing was negative.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Patient’s pedigree showing two members of the family carrying the cadherin-1 c.639G>A mutation\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】The reported patient was diagnosed with HDGC stage IV at a young age, characterized by severe clinical manifestations, which matched the latest guideline for diagnosis of HDGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The novel c.639G>A nonsense mutation reduced the expression of the E-cadherin protein due to the premature stop codon in the coding region of exon 5. Enrique and colleagues reported a heterozygous mutation c.1531C>T (p.Gln511\\*) which caused a PTC in a 22-year-old male patient with HDGC stage IV. Similar to the present case, the patient’s family history showed no sign of HDGC, and he died shortly after the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Another novel _CDH1_ mutation (c.1612delG), discovered by Caggiari and colleagues in 2017, also resulted in a PTC at codon 556 (p.Asp538Thrfs\\*19) in the extracellular fourth repeat region of a 41-year-old man with HDGC. In this case, the disease progressed rapidly to peritoneal, pancreatic, and hepatic metastasis despite 3 months of targeted therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Both studies demonstrated that _CDH1_ nonsense mutations are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poor prognosis in patients with early-onset HDGC.\n\n【27】While none of the patient’s relatives had HDGC, we found the same _CDH1_ c.639G>A mutation in the tissue of the patient’s father and uncle, who were both elderly. The results from six-core biopsy and gastroscopy of the father showed the absence of cancer cells. The mechanism behind the formation of signet ring cell carcinoma in carriers of the c.639G>A mutation is unclear; however, we speculate that environmental factors may play a role in the process.\n\n【28】In recent years, HDGC incidence has been increasing in Asia, the United States, and Europe, despite being a rare inherited condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The rapid disease progression, difficulty in early diagnosis, and highly metastatic nature contribute to the poor prognosis, especially in patients with early-onset disease. A study by van der Post _et al._ in 2015 showed a lower survival rate for gastric cancer patients with a _CDH1_ mutation compared to non-carriers, with 5-year survival rates of 4% and 13%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. There are several problems regarding the diagnosis of gastric cancer such as difficulty in detecting cancer tissue in the gastric mucosa or even after biopsy. This indicates the need for total surveillance of individuals carrying a _CDH1_ mutation, especially those with a family history of gastric cancer. This includes periodic checkups or prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG), which is recommended for _CDH1_ mutation carriers. In a systematic review of the histopathological diagnosis of gastric cancer, 87% of cases were detected from prophylactic gastrectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 11 \\]</u>. However, postoperative complications following PTG such as diarrhea, fatigue, acid reflux, and internal bleeding should be anticipated. Furthermore, considering the uniqueness of the healthcare system and the mindset of Vietnamese people, providing explanations and counseling to _CDH1_ carriers regarding PTG has proven to be challenging, mainly because of the absence of disease and/or symptoms. Thus, further research is needed to fully elucidate the effects of PTG in people with _CDH1_ mutations and those with family members having HDGC.\n\n【29】The limitation of the study was that the patient did not attend treatment after being diagnosed with HDGC. Therefore, we did not have the opportunity to evaluate and classify the disease stages according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors and could not evaluate the response to therapy. As a result, we were unable to thoroughly analyze the relationship between the patient's clinical, subclinical, and genetic changes.\n\n【30】Case study research in Vietnam concerning _CDH1_ mutations in stomach cancer is rare, and there is a lack of emphasis on genetic screening in HDGC diagnosis. Early identification of _CDH1_ mutations in HDGC patients and their family members is a significant factor enabling better counseling and preventive strategies such as PTG against the disease in mutation carriers. More importantly, it provides recommendations for the development of disease prevention strategies and formulation of more specific governmental health policies to support the treatment of Vietnamese patients in extraordinary circumstances in the future.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HDGC:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DGC:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diffuse-type gastric cancer</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CDH1:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cadherin-1</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PTG:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prophylactic total gastrectomy</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PTC:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Premature termination codon</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report the case of a 10-day-old neonate with cardiac tamponade secondary to a PICC line who was successfully treated by pericardiocentesis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】An Iranian (Asian) preterm male neonate was born by Cesarean section with a birth weight of 1190 g and a first-minute Apgar score of 7. Based on an increased respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7, resuscitation measures and intubation were performed at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). On day 3 after birth, a PICC line was inserted for parenteral therapy. A chest X-ray confirmed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate position. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of the improved respiratory condition. On the day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Resuscitation and ventilation support were immediately started, and inotropic drugs were also given. Emergency echocardiography showed a severe pericardial effusion with tamponade. The PICC line was removed, and urgent pericardiocentesis was carried out. The respiratory situation gradually improved, the O <sub>2 </sub> saturation increased to 95%, and vital signs remained stable.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Dramatic improvement of the neonate's clinical responses after pericardial drainage and PICC removal were suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) made of silicone, polyurethane, or polyethylene provides a prolonged route for administration of parenteral fluids, nutrition, and medications. Preterm neonates admitted to hospital usually require a PICC because of their small and fragile vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Femoral, subclavian, and internal jugular veins are the most common sites used for PICC catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Although use of a PICC has many advantages for the treatment of neonates, catheter malposition may result in serious complications that could be life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. These potential complications (sepsis, embolism, intravascular thrombosis, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion with tamponade) indicate that insertion of a PICC line requires special medical qualification and follow-up examination to ensure its proper location (the inferior third of the superior vena cava) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Of the above complications, tamponade is a rare but fatal condition that occurs following catheter dislocation and pericardial perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Cardiac tamponade is responsible for 47–100% of the mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】We report here the case of a neonate admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade secondary to a PICC line that was successfully treated with immediate PICC removal and pericardiocentesis.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An Iranian (Asian) pregnant women aged 32 years old with a primary complaint of preterm uterine contraction and vaginal bleeding presented the obstetric ward of Yas Hospital (Tehran-Iran, January 2021). She was a multi-para woman (Gravida: 3, Para: 2, Living: 2, Abortion: 0) with a gestational age of 30 weeks. She did not report any prenatal complications and had received corticosteroid therapy 2 days prior to hospital admission. Upon presentation, magnesium sulfate was immediately administered but she was transferred to the operation room for repeat Cesarean section due to progressive cervical dilation. A preterm male newborn with a first-minute Apgar score of 7 and birth weight of 1190 g was born. Physical examination after birth showed a notable frontal bossing, acrocyanosis, and diffuse head, neck, hand, and leg ecchymosis. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were normal. No congenital anomaly or abdominal organomegaly was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable and heart sounds were normal without any abnormal sounds. His reflexes were normal, but limb movements were hypotonic. Due to an increase in his respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7 and signs of respiratory distress (inter- and subcostal retraction, grunting, and decreased breathing sounds), resuscitation measures were initiated. He was then given nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the operation room that was subsequently switched to mechanical ventilation in the NICU. Intratracheal surfactant and intravenous antibiotic therapy were also initiated in the NICU. Under mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setup, his O <sub>2 </sub> saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate improved to > 94%, 70/35 mmHg, and 160 beats per minute, respectively. On day 3 post-NICU admission, a PICC line (Premicath; 1Fr/28 G; VYGON, Écouen, France; Code 1261.080) was also inserted from the auxiliary vein of the right upper extremity for intravenous therapy, delivery of medications, and parenteral nutrition. A chest X-ray showed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate place in the superior vena cava (SVC) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of improved respiratory condition and normal automatic breathing. After extubation, low-flow oxygen therapy was continued and low-volume feeding was initiated based on his tolerance. His weight gain was acceptable and the clinical situation improved, including a gradual increase in the feeding volume and respiratory support. On day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He was gasping, had hypotension, and there was an absence of peripheral pulses. In the first minutes after the alarm signs, resuscitation was initiated and ventilation support provided, together with administration of inotropic drugs (1–3 minutes). Despite the high-frequency setup of the mechanical ventilator, the endotracheal tube was checked for displacement or obstruction due to his persistent critical condition (hypotension and shortness of breath). Pneumothorax and equipment failure were also ruled out. Several medical measures were initiated (approximately at minutes 3–4), including nothing by mouth (NPO), high-dose antibiotic therapy, emergency echocardiography, brain ultrasound, arterial and venous blood sampling, blood cell count, and arterial blood gas analysis.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Chest X-ray findings showing the tip of the peripherally inserted central catheter line at appropriate position\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Echocardiography was performed over the next 5–7 minutes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>, and the results showed SVC perforation caused by the catheter, severe pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, ventricle dysfunction, and tamponade. The ejection fraction value was 40%, and there was no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), pleural effusion, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A peripheral venous catheter was inserted, and the PICC was removed at the same time. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed through subxiphoid cannulation guided by echocardiography and 10 ml of the pericardial fluid was aspirated (over the next 7–15 minutes) (Electronic Supplementary Material file 1 : Video S1). The aspirated fluid was sent to the laboratory for tests, with the results showing severe acidosis (pH 6.80) and hyperglycemia 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. To improve the hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, the patient was hydrated with low glucose solution and bicarbonate was initiated. Respiratory support was continued and antibiotics covering _Staphylococcus aureus_ and Gram-negative bacteria were administered. Brain sonography was also performed, which was normal. The workup sequence is shown in Table 2 .\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Emergency echocardiography\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Table 1 Results of arterial blood gas and laboratory blood tests**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】**Table 2 Sequence of performed workups following onset of alarms**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】Under mechanical ventilation the respiratory parameters improved gradually; pericardial drainage and PICC removal occurred concurrently. O <sub>2 </sub> saturation increased to 95%, blood pressure elevated, and vital signs remained stable. Analysis of the aspirated pericardial fluid showed a hyperglycemic fluid 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 )</u>. A dramatic improvement in the neonate's clinical responses (after pericardial drainage and PICC removal) was suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography was repeated (× 3) every 12 hours to ensure no further pericardial effusion was present. On day 40 after birth, the patient was still in the hospital but showed weight gain; he was in good condition without requiring respiratory support.\n\n【25】**Table 3 Results of laboratory analysis of aspirated pericardial fluid**\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【28】It is commone practice to insert PICC lines for parenteral administration in preterm neonates. Although PICC lines are associated with a number of catheter-related complications, such as infection, catheter block, catheter migration, thromboembolism, and catheter damage, pericardial effusion following PICC insertion is an unusual complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In the case presented here, we highlight the potential risk of pericardial effusion with tamponade as a fatal complication in a neonate 1 week after PICC insertion. Although this complication is rare and uncommon following PICC insertion (0.5–2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, the diagnosis was suspected immediately in our case and confirmed by echocardiography. The patient recovered gradually after urgent removal of the PICC line followed by pericardiocentesis. Regarding the etiology of tamponade, we believe that the catheter tip eroded the catheterized vessel (SVC) and perforated the pericardium, allowing the infused fluid to move into the pericardial space. This flow of fluid into the pericardia space subsequently increased the pressure on the cardiac chambers, resulting in cardiac tamponade.\n\n【30】In accordance with our findings, da Silva Dornaus _et al_ . also reported a preterm neonate (30 weeks) with cardiac tamponade secondary to PICC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The neonate showed episodes of bradycardia, low O <sub>2 </sub> saturation, cyanosis, dyspnea, and worsening of clinical condition 5 days after PICC insertion. Radiography and echocardiography examinations revealed that the tip of the catheter was in the cardiac chamber with pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade. These authors also reported improvement in the neonate's clinical situation after immediate cardiac puncture and extraction of 25 mL of fluid similar to the infused solution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】An autopsy study by Warren _et al_ . also showed pericardial effusion with tamponade in five neonates who died unexpectedly and suddenly after receiving parenteral nutrition via PICC. The autopsy findings showed endocardial injury and pericardial filling with permeation of a hyperosmotic parenteral fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】Iyer _et al_ . reported cardiac tamponade in a 29-week-old preterm neonate with a sudden arrhythmia, unstable vital signs, and decreased O <sub>2 </sub> saturation. The neonate recovered after emergency intubation, administration of inotropic agents, and fluid aspiration from the pericardial space using an echocardiography-guided tap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】It should be noted that in cases with cardiac tamponade, the signs and symptoms may be non-specific and misleading (dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and non-palpable peripheral pulses). It is important that all infusions through the PICC must be stopped when tamponade is suspected. It has also been reported that in addition to catheter displacement, other factors, such as the material, length, and size of the catheter, duration of parenteral nutrition, osmolarity, and composition of the infused fluids may severely affect and worsen complications and outcomes related to cardiac tamponade. For example, it was reported in one study that pericardial presence of high-potassium infused fluid resulted in electrocardiogram alterations showing a pattern of hyperkalemia instead of a pattern of cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 9 , 12 \\]</u>. Another study also showed that tamponade was frequently observed in cases with PICC inserted through aperipheral vein compared to a central vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】In conclusion, th case presented here highlights the potential risk of cardiac tamponade following central line insertion with sudden and unexpected symptoms associated with cardiovascular collapse. In such conditions, it is important to rapidly confirm that the catheter tip had migrated into the pericardial space and urgently initiate pericardiocentesis and catheter removal, all of which are effective measures to prevent death. Based on our and previous cases, we strongly recommend using catheters with soft tips, minimizing the movements of the neonates, and checking the catheter position periodically to reduce the risk of perforation and prevent life-threatening complications. Moreover, pericardial effusion with tamponade should be suspected in every case with PICC, and all neonatologists should be aware of this clinical emergency and the steps to be taken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>. Further studies are also needed to suggest other preventive strategies.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ASD:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Atrial septum defect</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPAP:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Continuous positive airway pressure</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NICU:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Neonatal intensive care unit</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NPO:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nothing by mouth</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PDA:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Patent ductus arteriosus</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PICC:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peripherally inserted central catheter</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RDS:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Respiratory distress syndrome</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SIMV:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SVC:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Superior vena cava</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Long-term follow-up of untreated Monteggia fracture dislocations reveals development of premature arthritis, pain, instability, and loss of pronation and supination. Methods involving annular ligament reconstruction require post-operative immobilization and use of transcapitellar pinning for maintenance of reduction, and thus a delay in rehabilitation. The literature reports satisfactory results with methods that involve ulnar osteotomy and open reduction of the radial head without annular ligament reconstruction. We used the Ilizarov method in two cases with neglected Monteggia fracture dislocations to stably reduce the radial head without open reduction and annular ligament reconstruction.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report two cases of neglected Monteggia fracture dislocation, in two Kashmiri boys aged four and six years.

It represents a link between injuries of the forearm and the elbow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These injuries follow the course of forearm fractures prognostically if recognized and treated early. However these injuries are often missed at the time of initial trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Long-term follow-up of untreated Monteggia fracture dislocations reveals development of premature arthritis, pain, instability, and loss of pronation and supination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Thus, it is imperative to treat the neglected fracture as soon as it is diagnosed. Freedman _et al._ performed reconstructive procedures up to six years after injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Currently, chronic dislocations are treated by ulnar osteotomy, open reduction of the radial head and reconstruction of the annular ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The literature reports excellent results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>, but with restricted movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u> and development of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> associated with methods involving open reduction of the radial head, and ulnar ostoetomy with or without annular ligament reconstruction. Hirayama _et al._ , considering the interosseous membrane as the stabilizer of the radial head, described reduction of the radial head by hyperangulation and lengthening of the ulna without reconstruction of the annular ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Relocation of the radial head has been successfully achieved by using distraction lengthening and hyperangulation over a uniplanar lengthening device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】To create hyperanglation in two planes, we used the Ilizarov method in two cases with neglected Monteggia fracture dislocations. Using ulnar osteotomy with distraction osteogenesis, we were able to relocate the radial head gradually. Our follow-up supports the view that distraction lengthening and hyperangulation in different planes may obviate the need for open reduction and annular ligament reconstruction.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our first patient was a four-year-old Kashmiri boy, who had pain and deformity of the right elbow. The child had received trauma to the elbow six months previously. On physical examination, a prominent radial head and mild limitation of supination and pronation were seen. Our second patient was a six-year-old Kashmiri boy. He had a history of elbow trauma one year previously, for which he had not received any treatment at the time.\n\n【14】In both cases, an anterolateral dislocation of the radial head was confirmed by radiography. An underlying ulnar injury in both our cases was suspected because of the loss of proximal convexity of ulna 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.We chose a procedure (the Ilizarov technique) that would produce controlled lengthening and hyperangulation in two planes to restore the radiocapitellar articulation without open reduction and reconstruction of annular ligament. The procedure was explained to both sets of parents and written informed consent obtained from them.

Because the dislocation in both of our patients was an anterolateral one 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figures 1 , 2 )</u>, an osteotomy in the proximal ulna and differential lengthening in two planes was planned to create a medial 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u> and posterior 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4 )</u> hyperangulation, to place the radial head in the appropriate radiocapitellar orientation. We hoped to avoid open reduction of the dislocation and reconstruction of the annular ligament.\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】**Preoperative radiograph showing radial head dislocation (Patient 2)** .\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】**Sketch showing planning for reduction of the radial head with hyperangulation of the regenerate in the anterior-posterior planes** .\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Figure 4**\n\n【26】**Sketch showing planning for reduction of the radial head with hyperangulation of the regenerate in lateral planes** .\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The surgery was undertaken under general anesthesia. A two-ring construct with hinge application was used. The ring was fixed only to the ulna, to allow free supination and pronation movement. The proximal ring was fixed with an Ilizarov wire and one half-pin. The distal ring was fixed by two half-pins in different planes on the subcutaneous border. Through an incision 15 mm long, a low-energy corticotomy of the ulna was performed at the proposed site 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 5 )</u>. We did not make any attempt to hyperangulate the ostotomy intraoperatively. Distraction was started on the seventh day after surgery in a differential manner, to create lengthening and hyperangulation in two planes as planned.\n\n【29】**Figure 5**\n\n【30】**Postoperative radiograph after application of Ilizarov fixator and ulnar osteotomy** **(Patient 1)** .\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】We followed up the progress of our patients every week with both clinical and radiologic examinations to assess the lengthening, angulation and relocation of the radial head. For our first patient, relocation of the radial head was confirmed both clinically and by radiography by the third postoperative week. Relocation took longer for our second patient, being achieved by the fifth postoperative week and involving lengthening of the ulna by 15 mm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 6 )</u>. Both patients were encouraged to perform range of motion exercises of the elbow, and the frame was left in place until maturation of the regenerated bone. The ring was finally taken off at six weeks for our first patient and at 12 weeks for our second patient; for both, a protective long arm cast was applied for another two weeks. The regenerated bone healed at an average rate of three weeks/cm. The radial head maintained the reduced position without annular ligament reconstruction 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figures 7 , 8 )</u>.\n\n【33】**Figure 6**\n\n【34】**Postoperative radiograph during disraction lengthening** **(Patient 2)** .\n\n【35】Full size image\n\n【36】**Figure 7**\n\n【37】**Radiograph taken at the two-year follow-up visit showng excellent relocation of the radial head** **(Patient 1)** .\n\n【38】Full size image\n\n【39】**Figure 8**\n\n【40】**Radiograph taken at the final follow-up visit showing relocation of the radial head (Patient 2)** .\n\n【41】Full size image\n\n【42】At follow-up two years after surgery, both patients had an excellent result and 100% range of motion around the affected elbow 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figures 9 , 10 )</u>.\n\n【43】**Figure 9**\n\n【44】**Supination at elbow** .\n\n【45】Full size image\n\n【46】**Figure 10**\n\n【47】**Pronation at elbow** .\n\n【48】Full size image\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】Owing to the potential complications of conservative methods in cases of neglected Monteggia injuries, it is important that the radial head be replaced in appropriate relation to the capitellum. This is especially true in children who are less than 12 years of age.\n\n【51】In procedures involving reconstruction around the radial head, it is mandatory to stabilize the radial head by a transcapitellar K wire to prevent redislocation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. In one study, Hori _et al._ reported that of the 13 patients treated surgically with open reduction, ulnar osteotomy and annular ligament reconstruction, there were seven re-dislocations, and seven patients had restriction of movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The authors reported that they achieved better results once they modified the osteotomy procedure, and stressed the need for angulation and elongation of the osteotomy. Rodgers _et al._ reported 14 complications in seven patients, including problems with the osteotomy site, re-dislocations and nerve injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【52】Restriction of movement has been seen frequently in procedures involving radial head reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Problems with the fixation of the osteotomy are not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Hasler found it easy to reconstruct the radiocapitellar joint, and to allow early resumption of functional exercises by using external fixation for the ulnar osteotomy with no annular ligament reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Freedman _et al._ used a technique in which the annular ligament was not reconstructed but the radial notch was deepened to achieve stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【53】Chronic dislocations may be associated with significant discrepancy in the radioulnar length, the radius having overgrown as a result of lack of support between the capitellum and the radial head. The optimum treatment in these patients is lengthening of the osteotomy in addition to angulation. The excellent results of a lengthening osteotomy are best reflected in the cases presented by Exner, who used distraction lengthening over a uniplanar lengthening device to create hyperangulation and lengthening to reduce the radial head 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, the process of hyperangulation was performed after distraction at subsequent stages under analgesia. We found the Ilizarov technique to be advantageous in other respects as well, as it allows lengthening and angulation in several planes, and the processes of lengthening and angulation proceed simultaneously.\n\n【54】The advantages of distraction treatment can be summarized as: minimally invasive surgery, controlled lengthening, no radiocapitellar intervention, no need for bone grafting, and early resumption of functional exercises. The only difficulty encountered during the process of correction in our patients was the radiologic interpretation of the relocation of the radial head, because of the superimposing proximal steel ring; however, this problem can be easily managed by the use of carbon fiber radiolucent rings.\n\n【55】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【56】Use of ulnar osteotomy with distraction lengthening and hyperangulation in several planes with the Ilizarov technique could be an effective method of treating neglected Monteggia fracture dislocations.\n\n【57】Consent\n-------\n\n【58】Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of both the patients for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

Yet, symptoms often improve quickly as the initially impaired cardiac function is usually restored within days or weeks.\n\n【4】Although the initial presentation of the patient in this case report was dramatic, the clinical course was positive and the patient could be quickly dismissed in a good general condition. To the best of our knowledge, no presentation of a combined occurrence of postpartum pneumomediastinum and reverse (inverted) takotsubo cardiomyopathy exists.\n\n【5】### Case presentation\n\n【6】We present the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian woman with sudden onset of thoracic back and chest pain approximately 24 hours after an otherwise unremarkable vaginal delivery. A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography showed cervical and mediastinal emphysema without proof for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. She received a symptomatic analgesic treatment and was dismissed to the obstetrics department for monitoring.\n\n【7】Within hours, slightly increased levels of troponin I were observed without corresponding electrocardiography changes. Immediate cardiac catheterization and a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (performed within 24 hours) revealed basal to midventricular hypokinesia, but were otherwise unremarkable. A low-dose treatment for congestive heart failure was initiated, under which symptoms subsided within days. She was dismissed after 12 days in a good general condition.\n\n【8】### Conclusions\n\n【9】Although the clinical presentation of the combination of the diseases initially was dramatic, the prognosis is positive. In the context of the preceding delivery, knowledge about the postpartum pneumomediastinum lets the radiologist of the emergency department quickly make this diagnosis. The takotsubo cardiomyopathy, however, needs broader diagnostics to not miss intervention-requiring causes.\n\n【10】Peer Review reports\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】### Postpartum pneumomediastinum\n\n【13】Pneumomediastinum describes air or other gas in the mediastinum (mediastinal emphysema). The idiopathic form is also referred to as “Hamman’s Syndrome”, named after Louis Hamman who established its clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The postpartum pneumomediastinum is a spontaneous variant associated with labor. As described by Macklin and Macklin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, straining similar to the Valsalva maneuver leads to an increase of intrathoracic pressure: membranes of marginal alveoli rupture, air escapes into the surrounding tissue and travels via the pulmonary interstitium and hilum into the mediastinum (“Macklin effect”). There is no causative treatment and the emphysema usually is self-limiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Only in severe cases may decompression of the emphysema become necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. It is typically associated with retrosternal chest pain radiating to the back 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【14】### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\n【15】Synonyms: stress cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning syndrome, broken heart syndrome.\n\n【16】In this cardiomyopathy an apical ballooning of the left ventricle is observed with hypo- to akinesia of the apical parts and compensatory hyperkinesia of the basal parts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The resulting shape resembles a Japanese octopus trap called “takotsubo”. Synonyms like “stress-induced cardiomyopathy” or “broken heart syndrome” underline its association with psychologically or physiologically stressful events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, the akinesia does not necessarily need to affect the apex, as case reports with basal to midventricular myocardial dysfunction show 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. Typically, myocardial enzymes are raised and the electrocardiography (ECG) is abnormal. However, cases without ECG changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> and normal levels of myocardial enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> are reported. Symptoms mimic myocardial infarction and usually subside within weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】The pathophysiology of the takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not understood yet. Common theories suspect a vascular dysfunction, ranging from vasospasms of the coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> to microvascular dysfunctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Patients also showed levels of catecholamines beyond those of patients with myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, what on the one hand may explain the association of takotsubo cardiomyopathy to stressful events and on the other could be a potential trigger of the cardiomyopathy itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, it is beyond the scope of this case report to provide a complete review of the literature.\n\n【18】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【19】We present the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian woman with sudden onset of thoracic back and chest pain approximately 24 hours after an otherwise unremarkable vaginal delivery.\n\n【20】In consideration of the clinical presentation, a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism. D-dimer was also elevated (up to 2700μg/L), but since also normal pregnancies cause a progressive increase in blood levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, benefit of this parameter was limited. The CT showed cervical and mediastinal emphysema 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u> without proof for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. As no reason for her emphysema could be identified, in the context of the preceding delivery her emphysema was interpreted as spontaneous postpartum pneumomediastinum. She received analgesics and was dismissed to the obstetrics department for monitoring. No specific treatment was performed. According to the prescribing information of the contrast agent (Ultravist® 300; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) nursing was paused for 48 hours.\n\n【21】**Figure 1**\n\n【22】**X-ray and chest computed tomography at initial presentation. a** shows the chest X-ray of the patient that reveals a thin stripe of increased transparency along the left side of her trachea. **b** to **d** show slices of the chest computed tomography that reveal cervical and mediastinal emphysema.\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Within hours after the CT scan, slightly increased levels of troponin I (up to 1.88ng/mL) were observed. The patient’s ECG showed sinus tachycardia, but no other changes such as ST elevation or T inversion. Her left ventricle had an impaired function (ejection fraction, EF, 19%); echocardiography 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> as well as cardiac catheterization 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u> revealed basal to midventricular hypokinesia, but were otherwise unremarkable. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed within 24 hours after the initial presentation confirmed these findings 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u>. A low-dose treatment for congestive heart failure with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was initiated, under which symptoms subsided within days. A peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered, but the patient’s age, the fact that it was her first pregnancy, missing signs of a dilative cardiomyopathy as well as the course of the cardiac symptoms made the takotsubo cardiomyopathy more likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Also, symptoms and clinical findings fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of the takotsubo cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. However, a therapy with bromocriptine was initialized to prevent prolactin secretion, as positive effects on the course of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】**Table 1 **Course of left ventricular function in echocardiography from day 0 to day 12****\n\n【26】Full size table\n\n【27】**Figure 2**\n\n【28】**Cardiac catheterization.** Hemodynamically not relevant kinking of the left anterior descending artery.

Laboratory findings included a lactate level of 119 mg/dL (13.2 mmol/L), bicarbonate of 14.5 mmol/L, and serum metformin concentration of 1138 ng/mL. She was diagnosed as having metformin-associated lactic acidosis worsened by alcohol.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a well-known, life-threatening, rare complication, with an incidence of less than 10 per 100,000 patients a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Intensive care management is known to have gradually decreased the MALA-associated mortality rate. However, the mortality rate is still more than 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】MALA usually occurs in metformin-treated diabetic patients with kidney manifestations due to reduced metformin excretion. Additionally, renal insufficiency decreases hydrogen excretion by the kidneys and leads to the development of acidosis independent of metformin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Even if kidney function is normal, metformin overdose or ingestion of alcohol are risk factors for developing MALA. In kidney or non-kidney comorbidity, treatment for MALA comprises conventional renal replacement therapy (RRT), particularly continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) or hemodialysis (HD); however, the effort of RRT itself has been still unknown in the treatment for MALA due to both metformin overdose and alcohol ingestion.\n\n【12】We here report the case of a patient who developed MALA without organ manifestations by ingesting an overdose of metformin and alcohol simultaneously and who recovered with high-flow high-volume intermittent hemodiafiltration (HFHV-iHDF). This case suggests that HFHV-iHDF may become effective therapy for hemodynamically unstable patients with MALA due to simultaneous alcohol ingestion.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 44-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia was being treated at our hospital. For type 2 diabetes, she received 1250 mg of metformin and 50 mg of sitagliptin phosphate hydrate a day and an intermediate-acting insulin 6 unit injection before bedtime. For schizophrenia, she received 8 mg of biperiden hydrochloride, 600 mg of valproic acid, 600 mg of carbamazepine, 15 mg of mirtazapine, 25 mg of clomipramine, 25 mg of chlorpromazine, 12.5 mg of promethazine, and 40 mg of phenobarbital. There was no other medical history. Her father had type 2 diabetes. She smokes two packs of cigarettes per day for 24 years, and drinks socially. After a quarrel with her mother, she attempted suicide by ingesting 10 tablets of 500 mg metformin and drinking about 600 mL of Japanese sake containing 15% alcohol.\n\n【15】She was transferred to our emergency department because of disturbed consciousness. On physical and neurological examination, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 (eye, 1; verbal, 1; motor, 1). Both pupils were 1.5 mm, and light reflexes were rapid. Her respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Her heart rate was 120 beats per minute and blood pressure was 120/60 mmHg. She then received continuous intravenous administration of noradrenalin (0.13 μg/kg per minute) because she was in shock. Her body temperature was 35.5 °C. On auscultation, no crackles and wheezing were detected. There were no murmurs. Aspiration pneumonia was detected in both the lungs by computed tomography. Laboratory findings (normal ranges in parentheses) demonstrated aspartate transaminase level of 16 (7 to 35) IU/L, alanine transaminase level of 15 (7 to 40) IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase level of 273 (125 to 225) IU/L, creatinine level of 0.94 (0.60 to 1.20) mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 12.7 (8 to 20) mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis on 100% oxygen revealed a pH of 7.067, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood of 143 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood of 52.9 mmHg, bicarbonate of 14.5 mmol/L, base excess of − 16 mmol/L, lactate of 119 mg/dL (13.2 mmol/L), and blood glucose of 632 mg/dL. Serum metformin concentration was 1138 ng/mL 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration were 309 mOsm/kg and 135 mEq/L, respectively. No ketone bodies were detected in her urine.\n\n【16】**Table 1 Laboratory findings on admission**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】She was diagnosed as having MALA worsened by alcohol. First, enforced sedation with midazolam was performed because of restlessness, tracheal intubation was carried out, and activated carbon and magnesium citrate were used for decontamination after gastric lavage. After 4560 ml of bicarbonate ringer (Na <sup>+ </sup> 135 mEq/L, K <sup>+ </sup> 4 mEq/L, Cl <sup>− </sup> 113 mEq/L, HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> 25 mEq/L) was administered, HFHV-iHDF (dialysate flow rate: 500 mL/min, substitution flow rate: 3.6 L/h) was carried out for 6 h using a polysulfone high-performance membrane (APS-15E, Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) to treat metabolic acidosis and remove lactic acid and metformin. After that, her serum metformin concentration decreased to 136 ng/mL 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> and noradrenalin administration became unnecessary to maintain normal vital signs. On hospital day 2, HFHV-iHDF was carried out again, which improved her consciousness. On hospital day 10, she was extubated after aspiration pneumonia healed. On hospital day 12, she was moved to the psychiatry ward. She left the hospital 1 month after she moved to the psychiatry ward. When she left the hospital, she was discontinued from metformin administration. Although there is no recurrence of lactic acidosis, she was re-hospitalized into the psychiatry ward because she took an overdose of sleeping pills, 2 months after she left the hospital. Since then, she was in the hospital for the control of her schizophrenia and diabetes for more than 2 months.\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】Plot of bicarbonate ( _black rectangle_ ), lactate ( _filled circle_ ), and metformin ( _rectangle_ ) versus time. _HCO_ <sub><i>3 </i></sub> _\\-_ bicarbonate, _HFHV-iHDF_ high-flow high-volume intermittent hemodiafiltration\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【23】In the present case, the lactic acidosis was caused by an excessive consumption of alcohol and metformin, in spite of no renal dysfunction. CVVH was generally performed for cases like this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, HFHV-iHDF was performed under stabilization of hemodynamics in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and it was successful for rapidly removing metformin and lactic acid.\n\n【24】Metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, has a molecular weight of 165 g/mol, high water solubility, minimal plasma protein binding, and a large volume of distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. It is excreted predominantly unchanged by the kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. RRT is considered adequate for the treatment of MALA because it efficiently removes metformin and lactic acid by diffusion through the dialyzer membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Additionally, a bicarbonate-buffered and high-sodium dialysate improves the metabolic acidosis and increases blood volume, thus enhancing the renal blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】CVVH and HD are some of the RRT methods that were previously studied. The clearance of a drug by CVVH was less than that with conventional HD. Therefore, CVVH should only be considered in patients who are too hemodynamically unstable to tolerate HD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The reason of selecting HFHV-iHDF therapy for this hemodynamically unstable patient was that this therapy could remove metformin and lactate molecules more efficiently and sooner than CVVH does. A previous study reported that the plasma concentration of metformin after 24 h of CVVH was about one-third of that before CVVH. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> Our data suggested that the plasma concentration of metformin after 6 h of HFHV-iHDF was about one-seventh as that before HFHV-iHDF. Considering MALA pathogenesis, removing metformin is a fundamental solution for curing MALA. A recent study suggested that metformin and lactate plasma concentration significantly correlated with mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In HFHV-iHDF, hemodynamics of patients with critical MALA could worsen because of a large dialysate flow rate and a high filtration flow rate. However, HFHV-iHDF can be conducted for patients with MALA if sufficient transfusion can be maintained and under adequate critical care management.\n\n【26】MALA can occur in patients without organ manifestations due to the simultaneous ingestion of an overdose of metformin and alcohol. Several factors are involved in the development of MALA because metformin has multiple mechanisms of producing lactic acidosis. Simultaneous ingestion of alcohol simultaneously markedly promotes the development of MALA. Metformin decreases blood sugar concentration by reducing gluconeogenesis, increasing the peripheral uptake of glucose, and decreasing fatty acid oxidation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis by metformin is localized to the primary energy-consuming reactions, and in the negative shift of the NADH/NAD+ redox potential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Alcohol ingestion causes a sharp rise in hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio, which in turn inhibits gluconeogenesis from lactate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The MALA in our patient was caused by ingestion of an overdose of metformin (5 g); however, this dose was considered too small to cause MALA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A report suggested that increasing the dose was associated with the development of MALA, with a median ingested dose of 15 g causing lactic acidosis compared to 2.8 g without lactic acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In this case, removal of metformin by HFHV-iHDF was useful, because alcohol ingestion influenced metformin metabolism.\n\n【27】This case demonstrated the effectiveness of HFHV-iHDF for MALA due to simultaneous alcohol ingestion. HFHV-iHDF may improve the conditions of hemodynamically unstable patients with MALA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

She underwent complete debulking surgery, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and omentectomy. The histology of the ovarian tumor revealed malignant struma ovarii with thyroid-type papillary projections and poorly differentiated carcinoma. Because of the complete resection and the absence of distant metastasis, the patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy. At 24 months after surgery, she was free of disease.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This is a rare case report of malignant struma ovarii, without recurrence, in which the component was papillary thyroid carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma. Foregoing adjuvant therapy might be one option for malignant struma ovarii in cases with complete resection and no distant metastasis. In addition, we should consider that long-term follow-up is needed for malignant struma ovarii.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Struma ovarii (SO) is a very rare disease, defined as a single germ cell tumor consisting ≥ 50% thyroid tissue, thus making it distinguishable from mature teratoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Malignant struma ovarii (MSO) is an even rarer tumor, accounting for approximately 5–10% of SO cases that are histologically identified as differentiated thyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. To date, only about 200 cases have been reported in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most common histological type of MSO is papillary carcinoma, which accounts for about 50% of MSO cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. On the other hand, a pure type of poorly differentiated carcinoma accounts for about 3%, and mixed follicular and papillary carcinoma accounts for about 3% as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. Due to this tumor’s rarity, the optimal treatment of MSO remains uncertain.\n\n【10】We present herein a case report of malignant struma ovarii without recurrence in which the component was papillary carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 62-year-old Japanese female (gravida 4, para 3) complained of 1-month history of abdominal distension. She had no medical history. Physical examination revealed a pelvic mass touched on the dorsal side of the uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 6  × 5 cm <sup>2 </sup> cyst with solid parts on the left side of the uterus. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a multilocular cyst tumor, with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm, in the left ovary, and small-volume ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity on the T2-weighted image and mostly low signal, but some high signal, which was not fat suppressed in T1-weighted images after fat suppression 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Computed tomography (CT) showed no distant metastasis and no obvious abnormal accumulation in the thyroid gland. The patient’s preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated to 84.9 U/ml (normal range <35.0), whereas the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were within their respective normal ranges.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging findings. **A** T2-weighted image revealing a multilocular cystic tumor with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm in the left ovary. There was a small volume of ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity in T2-weighted imaging. **B** In T1-weighted image, the tumor showed mostly low signal but some high signal. **C** In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful.\n\n【17】Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 A)</u>. About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like “ground glass” with coffee bean-like grooves 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 B)</u>. In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 C)</u>. Based on these findings, we made a diagnosis of malignant struma ovarii, as shown by the histological type of papillary carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma. No teratoma component was identified. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both components were positive for thyroglobulin; the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index was 5% in the papillary carcinoma and 35% in the poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Histological image of the ovary. **A** Papillary thyroid carcinoma on the upper right corner of the screen shows papillary growth. The lower left of the screen shows poorly differentiated carcinoma. Chordal arrangement, insular arrangement, and solid patterns are seen (HE: ×40). **B** In the part of papillary thyroid carcinoma, high-resolution image depicting the cells comprising the papillary architecture of the tumor.

(HE: ×400) **C** In the part of poorly differentiated carcinoma, solid patterns composed of unified cells with increased mitotic activity (arrows) (HE:×400)\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】The final diagnosis was MSO classified as stage IA (pT1aNxM0), according to the International Federation Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2014 classification, with histological type of papillary carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma. The patient was subsequently referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology to confirm whether the ovarian tumor originated from a primary thyroid tumor. Adenomatous goiter was suspected upon ultrasound, and the patient underwent examination of the thyroid gland by fine-needle aspiration cytology. The results were negative for thyroid cancer. We considered postoperative adjuvant therapy, thyroidectomy, and radioactive iodine ablation (RIA). Since there were no distant metastases and no malignant findings in the thyroid gland, we decided to follow up the patient without adjuvant therapy.\n\n【22】The patient is scheduled for follow-up with postoperative serial measurements of thyroglobulin and serum CA125 every 2–3 months, contrast-enhanced computed tomography twice a year, and thyroid ultrasonography once a year. The patient was free of disease at 24-month follow-up consultation without any side effects.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】Malignant struma ovarii (MSO) is a rare tumor. The survival outcome of MSO is limited and, therefore, no management strategy has been established.\n\n【25】The most common histological type of MSO is papillary carcinoma, which accounts for about 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The other histological types are follicular degeneration of papillary carcinoma (20–30%), follicular carcinoma (20%), mixed follicular and papillary carcinoma (about 3%), poorly differentiated carcinoma (about 3%), anaplastic carcinoma (about 1%), and medullary carcinoma (about 1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. If the tumor is completely composed of thyroid carcinoma, it is named “pure” MSO; if the tumor has teratoma components, it is named “impure” MSO. Pure types account for 30% of MSO, while impure types account for 70% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】The diagnostic criteria for MSO have been in accordance with those for typical thyroid-type cancers. In follicular neoplasms of the thyroid gland, invasion of the tumor into the capsule is also considered a sign of malignancy. Robboy _et al_ . reported that, since the ovary does not have a capsule, extension through the irregular fibrous thickening of the outer cortex, which may occur above an ovarian tumor, represents invasion of a true capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Papillary carcinoma, which accounts for about 50% of MSO, can be diagnosed by the presence of a papillary structure and a recognized “ground glass” nuclei. However, in the absence of true papillary structures, the presence of glassy nuclei alone is insufficient to diagnose papillary carcinoma of struma ovarii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is not common for vascular invasion to be observed. The presence of ovarian serous invasion is an important clue to the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a rare type, even in primary thyroid cancer, and extremely rare in struma ovarii, which account for only about 3% of MSO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 8 \\]</u>. For many years, the diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated thyroid cancer have been controversial owing to their rarity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The hallmarks of poorly differentiated carcinomas are a uniform population of small follicular cells arranged in a solid, trabecular (or insular) pattern. It is also commonly characterized by significant mitotic activity (more than 3 in 10 high-power fields), necrosis or convoluted nuclei, and the absence of typical nuclear characteristics of papillary carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In our case, the nuclei of the tumor cells were “ground glass” with coffee bean-like grooves in the area of the papillary carcinoma. Moreover, in the poorly differentiated area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having malignant struma ovarii, as evidenced by the histological type of papillary carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma. No teratoma component was identified, so this case was a pure type.\n\n【27】No standard therapy has been established for MSO throughout the published literature. As surgical treatment for MSO, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy are considered optimal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Some reports have revealed that more aggressive treatment did not reduce the rate of tumor recurrence, so it was suggested that unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy/unilateral oophorectomy be performed to preserve the patient’s fertility in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 11 \\]</u>. In the 68 patients analyzed by Goffredo _et al_ . lymph nodes were often not examined (73%), and even with the lymph nodes that were examined, none of them were confirmed to have any metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, after the final histological diagnosis, we decided that additional lymph node dissection was not necessary. Our patient received total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy, which is consistent with published literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In addition, no guidelines for postoperative adjuvant therapy are defined either. Thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) have been discussed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>, and some authors have promoted routine RIA as a means to reduce the recurrence rate after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 14 \\]</u>. Yassa _et al_ . suggested that patients who have extra-ovarian disease or aggressive histological features should consider a thyroidectomy and eventually undergo RIA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. On the other hand, some authors have suggested that RIA should be performed in patients with distant metastasis because their prognosis in poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 13 \\]</u>. Although there are no histological or clinical features that can reliably predict which tumors are biologically malignant, dense fibrous adhesions, peritoneal fluid, and large stroma (especially >12 cm) are suggestive of a tumor that has spread by the time of surgery or is likely to recur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. It remains controversial whether to perform RIA in patients with MSO at stage IA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our case, we did not perform adjuvant therapy, including thyroidectomy and RIA, because there was no distant metastasis, no malignant cells in the ascites, and no dense fibrous adhesions; moreover, the tumor size was small (<12 cm).\n\n【29】Postoperative monitoring of MSO is even more important in order to rule out the possibility of metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Therefore, it is important to evaluate serum thyroglobulin in a long-term follow-up in cases of thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 , 10 \\]</u>. Li _et al_ . recommended that all patients with MSO should have serum thyroglobulin assessments every 6–12 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The most common site of metastasis was the peritoneum, followed by the liver, lungs, and bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 17 \\]</u>. There is a report that recommended regular follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis twice or three times a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Robboy _et al_ . reported that the overall survival (OS) rate for all patients at all stages was 89% at 10 years and 84% at 25 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Similarly, a study including 68 cases of MSO found OS rates at 5, 10, and 20 years of 97%, 94%, and 85%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Based on these findings, they suggested routine long-term follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 15 \\]</u>. On the other hand, there have been no reports on prognosis according to stage. The median time to recurrence has been reported to be 4 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, and it is also recommended that monitoring of MSO should take place for at least 20 years because the median duration of recurrence is 14 years, and cases of late recurrence have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. This means that long-term follow-up care is required for MSO.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】This is a rare case report of MSO with papillary carcinoma mixed with poorly differentiated carcinoma. In this case, a good clinical course was obtained by complete resection without adjuvant therapy. In addition, we have to consider that long term follow-up is needed for MSO.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The data used or analyzed are all included in this published article.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SO:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Struma ovarii</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MSO:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Malignant struma ovarii</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CA125:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cancer antigen 125</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FIGO:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, development of resistance to dopamine agonists after an initial period of robust treatment response is rare, and only 39 cases have been reported in the past four decades. We describe a Chinese man with this rare condition and explored the postulated mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon. We compiled similar cases that were previously reported and compared their etiology, progress, and response to treatment. On the basis of these cases, we derived a list of differential diagnoses to consider in patients with secondary resistance to dopamine agonists.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 63-year-old Chinese man presented with blurred vision and was subsequently diagnosed with a macroprolactinoma. He had initial response to cabergoline but developed secondary resistance to it after 5 years. The prolactinoma continued to grow, and his serum prolactin remained markedly elevated despite adherence to escalating dosages of cabergoline up to 6 mg/week. The patient finally underwent transsphenoidal surgery and was found to have a sparsely granulated lactotroph tumor with Ki-67 index of 5%. Postoperatively, there was improvement in his serum prolactin level, although he still required treatment with cabergoline at 6 mg/week.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Surgery can facilitate disease control in patients with prolactinomas that develop secondary resistance to dopamine agonists. Malignant prolactinoma is an important differential diagnosis in this group of patients, especially when serum prolactin remains markedly elevated despite resolution or stability of the primary pituitary lesion, suggesting a metastatic source of prolactin secretion.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Prolactinomas account for 30–60% of pituitary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u> and occur in 44.4–62.7 per 100,000 patients in cross-sectional studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Dopamine agonists (DA) are the drugs of choice to treat prolactinomas. DA normalize prolactin (PRL) levels in more than 90% of people with microprolactinomas and in 77% of people with macroprolactinomas, and reduce tumor size in up to 89% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, up to 10% of patients with microprolactinomas and less than 20% of patients with macroprolactinomas may not achieve normoprolactinemia or reduction in tumor size with DA therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. About 25% of people with prolactinomas are resistant to bromocriptine (BRC) and 10–15% are resistant to cabergoline (CAB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Most cases of DA resistance are apparent soon after starting therapy, and these patients are considered to have primary DA resistance. Rarely, patients develop hyperprolactinemia and/or tumor enlargement after an initial period of remarkable response, and these patients are considered to have secondary DA resistance. We describe a Chinese man with macroprolactinoma who developed secondary DA resistance and explore the possible mechanisms and clinical implications of this phenomenon. Our case report is the first to compile previous case reports on prolactinomas with secondary DA resistance to provide a comparison on their etiology, progress, and response to treatment. On the basis of these case reports, we derived a list of differential diagnoses to consider in this group of patients.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】We searched PubMed for articles published using the terms “aggressive prolactinoma,” “bromocriptine,” “cabergoline,” “CV 205-502,” “dopamine agonist,” “dopamine agonist resistance,” “Ki-67,” “macroprolactinoma,” “malignant prolactinoma,” “microprolactinoma,” “pergolide,” “prolactinoma,” “prolactin-secreting adenoma,” “quinagolide,” and “secondary resistance.” We summarized available articles describing secondary DA resistance and contacted authors for clarification when there were inadequate or ambiguous data.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 63-year-old Chinese man presented in November 2014 with gradual blurring of vision in his left eye for 3 months. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He has no family history of pituitary or endocrine disorders. He was found to have bitemporal hemianopia and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 2.4 × 2.0 × 2.0 cm (craniocaudal, transverse, and anteroposterior dimensions) lesion in the pituitary fossa with suprasellar extension and encasement of his left cavernous sinus. The MRI and perimetry in December 2014 are shown in Figs. 1 A and B, and 2 A respectively.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】MRIs. **A** , **B** December 2014, **C** , **D** June 2015, **E** , **F** February 2020\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Perimetry **A** December 2014, **B** June 2015, **C** December 2019\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】He reported no headache, diplopia, lethargy, postural dizziness, cold or heat intolerance, galactorrhea, or reduced frequency in shaving. He was not Cushingoid or acromegalic, and was clinically euthyroid. There was no postural hypotension. He had mild gynecomastia bilaterally and no galactorrhea. His blood tests showed PRL > 470 ug/L (reference: 4.0–15.2), free thyroxine 10.7 pmol/L (reference: 11.8–24.6), thyroid stimulating hormone 0.564 mU/L (reference: 0.270–4.200), early morning total testosterone 5.16 nmol/L (reference: 9.90–27.80), follicle stimulating hormone 4.8 IU/L (reference: 1.5–12.4), luteinizing hormone 4.1 IU/L (reference: 1.7–8.6), early morning cortisol 190 nmol/L (reference 171–536), adrenocorticotropic hormone 8.6 pmol/L (reference: 1.6–13.9), and insulin-like growth factor 1 153 ug/L (reference: 75–212). His peak cortisol with the Cosyntropin test was 667 nmol/L. He was diagnosed with a macroprolactinoma with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and central hypothyroidism.\n\n【21】CAB 1 mg/week and levothyroxine 25 mcg daily was started in December 2014 with good biochemical and radiological response of the macroprolactinoma. There was improvement in his visual field defects. The MRI and perimetry in June 2015 are shown in Figs. 1 C and D, and 2 B respectively. He defaulted treatment after February 2017 and the macroprolactinoma had expanded in size by the time he returned to the endocrinology clinic in December 2019. His left eye vision and visual field defects had deteriorated then. The MRI in February 2020 and perimetry in December 2019 are shown in Figs. 1 E and F, and 2 C, respectively. CAB was resumed at 1.5 mg/week since December 2019.\n\n【22】However, the patient failed to show biochemical and radiological response despite adherence to escalating dosages of CAB after December 2019. Adherence was assessed on the basis of direct questioning of the patient and his next-of-kin as well as counting leftover cabergoline tablets. He reported no side effects with cabergoline. His PRL trend, tumor size, and medications are summarized in Table 1 . He was referred to the neurosurgeons in December 2021 for consideration of surgery in view of tumor growth despite high doses of CAB and he finally agreed to surgery in September 2022. During the transsphenoidal surgery, a highly vascular tumor with a firm, adherent capsule was noted. Histology confirmed the presence of a lactotroph macroadenoma that was sparsely granulated and the tumor cells were strongly positive for PIT-1 and PRL. The Ki-67 index was 5% and no mitotic activity was seen. The hyperprolactinemia improved postoperatively from 236.6 ug/L to 100.8 ug/L and he was treated with CAB 2 mg/week.\n\n【23】**Table 1 Progress of patient between December 2014 and November 2022**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Six weeks after surgery, he presented with acute deterioration of his vision on the left but MRI showed stable postoperative changes without significant compression on his optic tracts. His hyperprolactinemia had stagnated at 99.9 ug/L, so CAB was increased back to 6 mg/week and levothyroxine was increased in a stepwise manner to 100 mcg daily.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】### Results of literature search\n\n【28】Between 1981 and 2022, at least 39 cases of prolactinomas with secondary DA resistance (excluding our case) have been reported in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. There was adequate information to confirm secondary DA resistance in 18 of these cases. Of the 39 cases, 12 were male, 11 were female, and the gender was not reported in 16 cases. The age of the patients was between 22 and 70 years. A total of 15 cases had macroprolactinomas, 3 had microprolactinomas, and the tumor size was not reported in 21 cases. The time to developing secondary DA resistance was between 10 months and 15 years. Four cases were treated with androgen or estrogen therapy prior to developing secondary DA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Importantly, ten cases were ultimately found to have malignant prolactinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. The Ki-67/MIB-1 index was reported in seven cases. Of these, five cases had Ki-67 index > 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 10 , 12 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>, two cases had MIB-1 > 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, and two cases had Ki-67 index < 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 , 21 \\]</u>. In eight cases, p53 staining was performed. Of these, three cases were positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 19 \\]</u> and five were negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>. We were unable to perform p53 staining in our institute. However, it appears from the available case reports that p53 correlates poorly with the clinical aggressiveness of prolactinomas with secondary DA resistance, while the Ki-67/MIB-1 index appears to be higher in aggressive prolactinomas. The reported cases with secondary DA resistance are summarized in Table 2 . The baseline characteristics of these cases are summarized in Table 3 .\n\n【29】**Table 2 Reported cases of prolactinomas with secondary DA resistance**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】**Table 3 Clinical features of prolactinoma patients with secondary DA resistance between 1981 and 2016**\n\n【32】Full size table\n\n【33】### Definition and frequency of DA resistance\n\n【34】There is no standardized definition for DA resistance. The most commonly used definition is failure to normalize PRL and/or reduce tumor volume by at least 50% using conventionally maximum or maximally tolerated doses of DA (for example, BRC 7.5 mg/day or CAB 2 mg/week) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 22 , 23 , 24 \\]</u>. Doses of CAB up to 12 mg/week and BRC up to 30 mg/day were required in rare cases to achieve control of prolactinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Ono _et al_ . also recommend using DA at the maximum tolerated dose for at least 12 months before concluding that DA resistance is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】There is also no proposed definition for secondary DA resistance. This makes it difficult to ascertain the frequency of secondary DA resistance. Furthermore, a significant proportion of cases of secondary DA resistance were reported before CAB was commercially available in 1992, so some of these may not be true cases of DA resistance. The majority of the reported cases of secondary DA resistance had achieved normoprolactinemia before PRL levels started to rise. Ten of these cases did not achieve normoprolactinemia, but most of them had reduction of PRL by more than 80% from baseline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 26 \\]</u>, with the exception of two cases where PRL fell by 48% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> and 73% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The PRL level in our patient had fallen by 84% from baseline in the initial 26 months of treatment before he developed secondary DA resistance. Thereafter, his PRL level stagnated between 144.4 ug/Land 282.5 ug/L despite escalating CAB from 1.5 mg/week to 6 mg/week. Given his remarkable initial response to CAB, we believe there should be no debate on the development of secondary DA resistance in this patient.\n\n【36】### Differential diagnoses of secondary DA resistance\n\n【37】Before concluding that a patient has secondary DA resistance, it is pertinent to exclude non-adherence to therapy. There is also a need to consider if the patient has a non-lactotroph pituitary adenoma with stalk effect. Stalk effect can sometimes happen when the tumor comprises two populations of lactotroph and non-lactotroph cells; the non-lactotroph component causes the stalk effect while the lactotroph component caused the initial improvement with DA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Occasionally, the tumor may expand due to hemorrhage, exerting a new stalk effect after an initial response. Certain medications such as spiramycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u> may accelerate BRC clearance and reduce its efficacy. Gonadal steroid replacement may induce DA resistance in lactotrophs, and this was seen in four cases with secondary DA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. An important differential diagnosis is malignant prolactinoma, which was reported in at least 10 of the 39 cases of secondary DA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. The PRL levels in such cases tended to be markedly elevated despite resolution or stability of the primary pituitary lesions, prompting exploration of additional foci of PRL secretion that led to discovery of metastases. Other differential diagnoses include pregnancy, physiologic causes of hyperprolactinaemia (for example, stress), interim development of pathologic causes of hyperprolactinaemia (for example, renal or hepatic impairment), and introduction of new medications (for example, antipsychotics).\n\n【38】### Mechanisms of secondary DA resistance\n\n【39】DA bind to dopamine type 2 receptors (D2R) in prolactinomas resulting in inhibition of PRL secretion as well as reduction of tumor size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. True DA resistance has been attributed to various D2R defects in prolactinomas. Breidahl _et al_ . demonstrated that secondary DA resistance in their patient developed due to growth of a population of lactotrophs that had reduced D2R expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. Some lactotrophs may also produce structurally abnormal D2R that have reduced DA binding capacity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 29 , 30 \\]</u>. The loss of D2R expression or affinity to DA may arise from late mutations in tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>, explaining the secondary resistance. D2R is expressed as short and long isoforms in human beings. The short isoform induces intracellular signalling via the MAPK and PI3k pathways while the long isoform inhibits these pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. A lower ratio of the short-to-long isoform has been shown to reduce the response of lactotrophs to DA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 30 , 32 , 33 \\]</u>. We were unable to perform D2R staining in our institute and were thus unable to ascertain if the secondary DA resistance in this patient was due to reduced D2R density.\n\n【40】It has been postulated that angiogenic factors (for example, vascular endothelial growth factor) promote tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in prolactinomas resistant to DA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 34 \\]</u>. This may confer the aggressive and invasive behavior of such tumors. The prolactinoma in our patient was noted to be highly vascular. However, we were unable to test for the presence of angiogenic factors in our institute.\n\n【41】Secondary DA resistance was previously reported in four cases that received gonadal steroid replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Similarly, our patient started exhibiting secondary DA resistance after he was started on testosterone replacement therapy. This can probably be explained by the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen, which then regulates PRL gene expression, downregulates D2R, and stimulates lactotroph hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 , 36 \\]</u>. However, in the prospective study conducted by Auriemma _et al_ . DA resistance was not seen in nine hypogonadal males with prolactinomas who were started on testosterone replacement therapy. These patients had improvements in their metabolic profiles instead 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Molitch _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> recommended the addition of aromatase inhibitors to counteract the estrogenic effect from testosterone therapy on the basis of a case report by Gillam _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】DA resistance has also been attributed to cell signalling defects. For example, defects in nerve growth factor (NGF) can disrupt autocrine growth factor signalling pathways in lactotrophs and disinhibit cell proliferation, causing prolactinomas to develop DA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. Response to DA was restored after prolactinoma cells were exposed to NGF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u> in cell culture studies. Filamin-A is a cytoskeleton protein that is involved in D2R expression and function. D2R cannot be trafficked to the cell membrane in the absence of filamin-A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Prolactinomas with DA resistance have reduced filamin-A expression, and inhibition of filamin-A expression using small interfering ribonucleic acids led to DA resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. In addition, micro ribonucleic acids may interfere with intracellular signalling and induce fibrosis in DA-resistant prolactinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 \\]</u>, resulting in failure of tumor volume reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】### Treatment strategies in secondary DA resistance\n\n【44】In patients who developed resistance to BRC, switching to CAB is a reasonable first-line strategy. This is because CAB has superior efficacy in normalizing PRL levels and reducing tumor size due to its higher affinity for D2R, leading to better cytocidal effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 45 , 46 \\]</u>. About 33% of patients with macroprolactinomas fail to achieve tumor shrinkage by at least 50% using BRC. Of these, 70% respond to CAB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. CAB also has superior side effect profile compared with other DA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 , 47 , 48 \\]</u>.\n\n【45】In patients with concurrent hypopituitarism or central hypothyroidism, we recommend thyroid replacement therapy to keep the serum free thyroxine in the upper half of the reference interval. As thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulates prolactin release 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 49 \\]</u>, the negative feedback exerted by thyroxine on hypothalamic thyrotropin releasing hormone secretion can help to reduce the stimulation of prolactin release.\n\n【46】Our patient was recommended for surgical resection after high doses of CAB failed to normalize his PRL and reduce tumor volume. Surgical resection was also performed in 17 of the reported cases. Three of the reported cases with secondary DA resistance received DA therapy in conjunction with surgery and achieved reduction in PRL by more than 50% after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 20 , 26 \\]</u>. A total of 11 cases had surgery and required extra treatment modalities (for example, radiotherapy) in addition to DA therapy. Of these, three achieved reductions in PRL by more than 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 21 , 50 \\]</u>. Thus, it appears that response to surgical resection is variable. Surgical resection has the additional advantage of providing tissue samples for immunohistological evaluation for cellular atypia, mitotic burden, and proliferation index. None of the cases treated with somatostatin analogue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, tamoxifen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, and chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> achieved significant reduction in PRL levels. Temozolomide was proposed as a plausible option by Sbardella 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> _et al_ . We recommend a low threshold for repeating MRI in patients whose histopathological samples showed high proliferative indices (for example, Ki-67 index > 3%), and who have unexpected or unexplained rise in PRL from their postoperative baseline, as this group of patients appear to be at higher risk for local recurrence and metastases. We also recommend further imaging to detect metastases if the MRI were to show stable changes in the parasellar region in this group of patients.\n\n【47】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【48】Secondary DA resistance in prolactinomas is a rare phenomenon and has been reported to occur up to 15 years after presentation. Mixed tumors, D2R defects, and abnormal cell signalling pathways may explain the development of secondary DA resistance. Importantly, malignant prolactinomas need to be considered as a differential diagnosis in such cases. Early surgery for tumor resection or debulking may confer additional biochemical control and provide tissue for immunohistological evaluation.\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AP:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Anteroposterior</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BRC:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bromocriptine</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CAB:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cabergoline</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CC:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Craniocaudal</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DA:</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dopamine agonists</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>D2R:</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dopamine type 2 receptors</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DXT:</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Radiotherapy</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EOD:</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Every other day</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>F:</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Female</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>F–S:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fridays to Sundays</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FT4:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Free thyroxine</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GHD:</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Growth hormone deficiency</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HPF:</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>High power field</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LT4:</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Levothyroxine</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M:</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Male</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M–F:</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mondays to Fridays</u>\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M–T:</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mondays to Thursday</u>\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NA:</u>\n\n【89】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not available</u>\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NGF:</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nerve growth factor</u>\n\n【92】通用结尾删除-1:<u>OM:</u>\n\n【93】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Once daily</u>\n\n【94】通用结尾删除-1:<u>P:</u>\n\n【95】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pergolide</u>\n\n【96】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRL:</u>\n\n【97】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prolactin</u>\n\n【98】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRLoma:</u>\n\n【99】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prolactinoma</u>\n\n【100】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Q:</u>\n\n【101】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Quinagolide</u>\n\n【102】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RI:</u>\n\n【103】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Reference interval</u></u>\n\n【104】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>S:</u></u>\n\n【105】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Surgery</u></u>\n\n【106】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>S–S:</u></u>\n\n【107】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Saturdays to Sundays</u></u>\n\n【108】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>T:</u></u>\n\n【109】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Testosterone cypionate</u></u>\n\n【110】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>TR:</u></u>\n\n【111】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transverse</u></u>\n\n【112】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>ULN:</u></u>\n\n【113】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Upper limit of normal</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Two anatomic variations have occurred in the same nerve, like \"the variation of the variation\".\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) is the most important structure in thyroid operations. Anatomic variations of a recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) may threaten the safety of thyroid surgery and so a complete knowledge of RLN anatomy, including all of its variations, must be mandatory for thyroid surgeons. Extra-laryngeal branching of the RLN as a terminal division is a common anatomic variation macroscopically discovered at surgical exploration. Terminal division of both right and left nerves seldom occurs bilaterally. Larger branches of the nerve bifurcation may affect laryngeal function. Non-recurrent ILN is a rare and important anatomic variation, threatening the safety of thyroid surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 7 \\]</u>. The association of a non-recurrent nerve and extra-laryngeal branching is an extremely rare occurrence. An anastomosis between an ILN and the cervical sympathetic chain is another rare anatomic variation, known as sympathetic inferior laryngeal anastomotic branch (SILAB) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】In this case report, three variations of ILN, with two variations in one ILN, are presented in the same patient with a large goiter surgically treated with total thyroidectomy.\n\n【11】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【12】A 56-year-old Caucasian male patient with a goiter, situated in an endemic goiter region, had a 40-year history of thyroid gland enlargement. He presented to the department of surgery with a large goiter and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\n【13】A physical examination, blood chemistry for thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxin, ultrasound imaging and thyroid nuclear scanning established the diagnosis of toxic multi-nodular goiter. Thyroid hyperfunction was normalized with anti-thyroid medication.\n\n【14】Our patient was treated with a total thyroidectomy. The weight of the fresh thyroid specimen was 404 g. The inferior thyroid arteries were identified, isolated, and a loop of silk suture was placed around the artery for traction. His ILN was identified below the artery and fully isolated on the left side after freeing and medially mobilizing the thyroid gland. His right ILN was not found at the usual position.\n\n【15】An exploration was made for his right ILN at the anticipated crossing point of the nerve and the artery. His right RLN was found not to follow the usual course of the nerve in the tracheaesophageal groove. The dissection was advanced in an upward direction through the Berry ligament. A non-recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and exposed near the Berry ligament. The non-recurrent nerve had a course parallel to that of his inferior thyroid artery. The nerve had extra-laryngeal terminal division, as anterior and posterior branches 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. The laryngeal entry point of the non-recurrent nerve was the same as the RLN. The two branches entered the larynx separately.\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】**Right non-recurrent ILN with extra-laryngeal bifurcation (magnified and edited operative photograph)** .\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】After isolation of his left inferior thyroid artery, his left RLN was explored at the anticipated neurovascular crossing point. The main trunk of his left RLN was first identified caudal to the artery. His left RLN was dissected in an upward direction to the laryngeal entry point, for full exposure of the nerve. During surgical dissection, the left RLN was found to have extra-laryngeal branching at the neurovascular crossing point where the nerve medially passes the inferior thyroid artery. Anterior and posterior branches of his left RLN entered the larynx separately. During routine exploration, we incidentally found an anastomotic nerve branch with a horizontal course on the posterior branch of the left RLN before laryngeal entry 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figures 2 and Figure 3 )</u>.\n\n【20】**Figure 2**\n\n【21】**Left RLN bifurcated at artery and nerve crossing point** . A horizontal nerve anastomosis on the posterior branch of the RLN known as SILAB (magnified and edited operative photograph).\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】**Left RLN with extra-laryngeal terminal division** . Each branch enters the larynx separately. Horizontal nerve anastomosis on the posterior branch of the RLN known as SILAB (magnified and edited operative photograph).\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】The safety of thyroid operations mainly depends on the surgical anatomy of the ILN. The nerve has many variations on its cervical course and full knowledge of RLN anatomy, including all variations, is obligatory for a thyroid surgeon. Variations of the ILN, such as rare non-recurrent ILN, threaten the safety of thyroid operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u>. SILAB is another rare anatomic variation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. On the other hand, extra-laryngeal terminal division of RLN is a common variation macroscopically discovered during thyroid operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Our patient is a rare example of triple ILN variations; co-existence of bilateral extra-laryngeal bifurcation of ILNs, right non-recurrent nerve and left SILAB. Synchronicity of three variations of the ILN in one patient is an extremely rare coincidence.\n\n【28】The prevalence of non-recurrent nerve has been reported below 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 7 \\]</u> and increases the risk of ILN injury. The laryngeal entry point for a non-recurrent ILN is the same as for a recurrent nerve. If the RLN is not found in its normal course during surgical exploration, the possibility of a non-recurrent nerve must be taken into account. Complete exposure of the RLN is mandatory to avoid nerve injury; especially near the Berry ligament where the nerve is more superficial and vulnerable during total thyroidectomy. The main anatomical feature of our patient was the extra-laryngeal terminal division of a right non-recurrent nerve. The prevalence of bifurcated non-recurrent ILN is unknown; two variations have occurred in the same nerve. This is a \"variation of the variation\". This double variation in the same nerve is extremely unusual.\n\n【29】Extra-laryngeal branching of RLN is a common variation reported in up to 65% of surgical and autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 , 10 \\]</u>. Macroscopically discovered terminal division of the nerve during thyroid operations has a prevalence of 18-36% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Bilateral bifurcation of both RLNs is relatively rare with a prevalence of 3-9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. This bifurcation, in larger anterior and posterior branches, may have significant functions. The anterior branch has motor fibers, whilst the posterior branch is mainly sensitive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 9 \\]</u>. In some cases, the posterior branch also has motor fibers, and may affect laryngeal function. It may innervate posterior cricoarytenoid (abductor function) and interarytenoid muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Extra-laryngeal terminal division of the ILN must be identified, exposed and preserved for motor function. The more superficial anterior branch, the principal motor division of the nerve, is under a greater risk of injury during Berry ligament dissection.\n\n【30】The SILAB is an anastomotic branch from the middle or superior cervical sympathetic ganglion to the RLN. The prevalence of SILAB has been reported as 0.74-1.5%. A large SILAB, with its horizontal course, may be mistaken for a non-recurrent nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. This branch brings sympathetic fibers to the ILN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. A left SILAB, which was localized in last 2-3 cm of the RLN, was discovered as a third variation of the ILN in our patient.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】The co-existence of three variations of the ILN, a right non-recurrent nerve, bilateral extra-laryngeal bifurcation of the ILN and left SILAB, is an extremely unusual coincidence in one patient. The coincidence of a right non-recurrent nerve and bilateral bifurcation of both right and left nerves in the same patient is a very interesting feature. SILAB appeared as additional third variation of RLN in our patient. Extra-laryngeal bifurcation of the non-recurrent ILN is an extremely unusual anatomic finding. Association of two anatomic variations has occurred in the same nerve, presenting \"the variation of the variation\".\n\n【33】Consent\n-------\n\n【34】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Though the prognosis of conjoined twins is generally low, there is limited evidence as to the optimal method of pregnancy termination, particularly in cases of advanced gestational age. We report a successful dilation and evacuation (D&E) done for conjoined twins at 22 weeks of gestation.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 20-year-old primigravid woman was diagnosed with a conjoined, thoraco-omphalopagus twin pregnancy after undergoing a detailed two-dimensional (2D) fetal ultrasound anatomic scanning. Assessment and counseling were done by a multidisciplinary team. The team discussed the prognosis and options of management with the patient. The patient opted for termination of pregnancy. Different options of termination were discussed and the patient consented for D&E, with the possibility of reverting to hysterotomy in case intraoperative difficulty was encountered. A 2-day cervical preparation followed by D&E was done under spinal anesthesia and ultrasound guidance.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】In this patient, D&E was done successfully without complications. Adequate cervical preparation, pain control, and ultrasound guidance during the procedure are critical for optimal outcomes. A literature review of methods of pregnancy termination for conjoined twins in the second trimester revealed 75% delivered vaginally through medical induction while 18% underwent cesarean section. Only one other report described successful D&E for conjoined twins after 20 weeks. D&E can be safely performed for carefully selected cases of conjoined twins beyond 20 weeks’ gestations avoiding the need for induction or hysterotomy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Conjoined twins are extremely rare, occurring in about 1 per 50,000 pregnancies and 1 per 250,000 live births. Though the prognosis of conjoined twins depends on the degree and location of union, it is generally associated with high perinatal mortality and patients may request termination of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, there is limited evidence as to the optimal method of pregnancy termination particularly in cases of advanced gestational age. Though medical terminations of conjoined twin pregnancies have been documented up to late second trimester, the use of surgical methods is not widely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Here we report a case of conjoined twins successfully managed with dilation and evacuation (D&E) and systematically review previously reported cases to analyze methods of pregnancy termination for conjoined twins in the second trimester.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 20-year-old primigravid woman was referred to our hospital at 22 weeks of gestation with a diagnosis of large fetal intra-abdominal cysts identified during a routine ultrasound examination. In our center, detailed fetal two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound anatomic scanning was done, revealing two fetal heads at a fixed position, facing each other 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. There was a fused chest and abdomen with a single shared distorted heart and one aorta. A single umbilical cord was noted. There was a single shared liver. The kidneys appeared enlarged with multiple non-communicating cysts and thinned-out cortical tissue. Two separate spines were visualized on either side of the uterine cavity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Conjoined, thoraco-omphalopagus twin pregnancy was diagnosed. Fetal karyotyping was offered but declined by the family.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Axial ultrasound image showing two normally shaped fetal heads facing each other\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】**Fig. 2**\n\n【16】Sagittal section of the fetal chest and abdomen showing two fetal spines, a single distorted heart, and multicystic kidneys\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Assessment and counseling were done by a multidisciplinary team composed of obstetricians, fetal medicine specialists, family planning specialists, and anesthetists. After discussion on prognosis and options of management, the patient opted for termination of pregnancy. Different options of termination were discussed and the patient consented for D&E, with the possibility of reverting to hysterotomy in case intraoperative difficulty was encountered.\n\n【19】We performed a 2-day cervical preparation. On day 1, 200 mg mifepristone was administered orally and five laminaria were inserted. On day 2, the patient was admitted and a new set of 10 laminaria were inserted. On the morning of the procedure, she was provided with 400 µg misoprostol sublingually and 200 mg doxycycline orally. After 2 hours she was transferred to the operating room and spinal anesthesia was given. D&E was done under ultrasound guidance. We started the procedure by rupturing the membranes to bring down fetal parts to the lower uterine segment. Initial extraction of fetal parts was done by disarticulating and removing the extremities. Decompression of the thoracic and abdominal cavity allowed further descent and separation of the thoracopagus. The presenting calvarium was decompressed with suction and delivered. Finally, the second twin and placenta were delivered intact. The procedure was completed without complications. Post-procedure tissue count showed two calvaria and spines, four well-formed upper limbs, single thorax and abdomen, and two well-formed and two fused primitive lower limbs. The patient recovered well and was discharged after 24 hours. A follow-up phone call after 2 weeks revealed an uneventful course.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】Conjoined twins are rare. The available management options are usually complex and ample experience with case management is limited to few centers worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Recent advances in antenatal imaging techniques, such as three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography, Doppler studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enable diagnosis as early as 12 weeks’ gestation. In addition, detailed prenatal anatomic scanning will define the extent of organ sharing and inform prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis followed by thorough counseling on the likely prognosis is crucial for optimal management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. However, as in our case, early diagnosis can be missed and the pregnancy may advance into the second trimester. Other reports from developing countries also show the diagnosis of conjoined twins may be delayed until the third trimester or even up to the time of labor and delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conjoined twins with a shared heart are associated with extremely poor prognosis, and separation and survival of both twins (or even one) is unlikely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 9 \\]</u>. Given this, our patient decided to terminate her pregnancy.\n\n【23】Pregnancy termination for conjoined twins in later gestation is often accomplished through hysterotomy because of perceived difficulty in vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Though details of the methods employed were not described, Brizot _et al._ reported 12 vaginal terminations for second trimester conjoined twins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Similarly, Mitchell _et al._ reported two successful inductions of late second trimester conjoined twins. However, both patients underwent two sessions of laminaria placement prior to administration of uterotonics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】We conducted a systematic search of the electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar using MeSH and keywords from the inception of the databases until November 30, 2020 通用删除1(英):<u>(see Additional file 1 )</u>. Bibliographies of the relevant articles were reviewed and then cross-searched to identify further relevant studies. We included all publications in English that specify the method of pregnancy termination for conjoined twins in the second trimester (14–28 weeks).\n\n【25】Two authors (FAA and THT) independently performed study screening and data extraction. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify eligible articles, and full text was obtained if both reviewers judged a citation to be potentially eligible. Standardized screening and data extraction forms were created prior to data collection. Extracted data include author, year of publication, the specific type of conjoined twin, gestational age at termination of pregnancy, method of pregnancy termination, and adverse maternal outcome or procedure-related complications (hemorrhage, blood transfusion, uterine rupture, sepsis, or death). Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (MDF).\n\n【26】Our initial search identified 512 publications. There were 392 articles after duplicates were removed. Examination of title and abstract led to the exclusion of 264 articles. The remaining 128 articles were assessed for eligibility by examining the full text. Of these, 95 were excluded as they did not meet the review inclusion criteria. Thus, our search identified 33 relevant publications with 47 previously reported cases to be eligible. With the addition of the present case, we therefore included a total of 48 cases from 34 publications for this review.

Our patient received regular botulinum toxin-A injections, casting, and physical therapy but no surgical interventions.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A white American boy with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy was evaluated annually by clinical motion analyses, including physical examination, joint kinematics, electromyography, energy expenditure, and standing postural balance tests, from 6 to 13 years of age. These analyses revealed that the biomechanical factors contributing to our patient’s crouch gait were weak plantar flexors, short and spastic hamstrings, moderately short hip flexors, and external rotation of the tibiae. Despite annual recommendations for surgical lengthening of the hamstrings, the family opted for non-surgical treatment through botulinum toxin-A injections, casting, and exercise. Our patient’s crouch gait improved between ages 6 and 9, then worsened at age 10, concurrent with his greatest body mass index, increased plantar flexor weakness, increased standing postural sway, slowest normalized walking speed, and greatest walking energy expenditure. Although our patient’s maximum knee extension in stance improved by 14 degrees at 13 years of age compared to 6 years of age, peak knee flexion in swing declined, his ankles became more dorsiflexed, his hips became more internally rotated, and his tibiae became more externally rotated. From 6 to 9 years of age, our patient’s minimum stance-phase knee flexion varied in an inverse relationship with his body mass index; from 10 to 13 years of age, changes in his minimum stance-phase knee flexion paralleled changes in his body mass index.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The motor deficits of weakness, spasticity, shortened muscle-tendon lengths, and impaired selective motor control were highlighted by our patient’s clinical motion analyses. Overall, our patient’s crouch gait improved mildly with aggressive non-operative management and a supportive family dedicated to regular home exercise. The annual clinical motion analyses identified changes in motor deficits that were associated with changes in the child’s walking pattern, suggesting that these analyses can serve to track the progression of children with spastic cerebral palsy.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Crouch gait is one of the most common gait disorders among children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is characterized by excessive flexion of the hip, knee, and ankle during stance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The specific causes of crouch gait vary among individuals, but the primary biomechanical contributors include short and/or spastic hamstrings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, short hip flexors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>, weak hip and knee extensors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, weak ankle plantar flexors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and/or malrotation of the femur, tibia, and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Poor selective motor control and poor balance also contribute to gait deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. With each progressive degree of knee flexion during stance there is a proportional increase in the demand on the knee extensors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Thus, individuals with CP and crouch gait commonly exert more energy while walking than their peers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> and are at an increased risk for joint pain and degeneration, formation of bony deformities, and loss of independent gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 – 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】It has been posited that crouch gait worsens with age due to increased body size and weight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. However, few studies have documented the progression of gait with age among children with CP treated non-surgically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 – 23 \\]</u>, and even these studies did not focus specifically on crouch gait and were limited to two time points. The purpose of this paper was to report the progression of crouch gait with non-surgical treatment through clinical motion analysis, which included joint kinematics, surface electromyography (EMG), and energy efficiency during gait, physical examination, and postural balance, in a single individual over 8 years. We further aimed to highlight the contributions of the motor deficits associated with spastic CP (that is, muscle weakness, shortened muscle-tendon lengths, spasticity, and impaired selective motor control) to crouch gait.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 6-year-old white American boy with a diagnosis of spastic bilateral CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> level I was referred to our clinical motion analysis laboratory. Our patient was born full term, with no history of epilepsy and no noted disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, or behavior. He received annual evaluations in the same laboratory for 8 years from ages 6 to 13 years. At each visit a physical examination and video analysis were performed, and our patient underwent instrumented three-dimensional gait analysis, including kinematics and dynamic surface EMG, as well as postural standing balance tests and analysis of his energy efficiency during gait. His treatment schedule of botulinum toxin-A injections (BoNT-A) and casting are displayed in Table 1 . Our patient was referred and treated by a physician at an outside hospital.\n\n【13】**Table 1 Treatments received by our patient and the age at which treatments were administered**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】Treatments listed for the whole year were administered 2–10 weeks after the annual gait analysis was performed. Treatments listed for the half year occurred at least 3 months prior to the subsequent gait analysis. For example, a gait analysis was performed at age 8; less than 10 weeks after this gait analysis, our patient received BoNT-A injections to his bilateral hamstrings and right gastrocnemius with long leg casting; approximately 6 months later at age 8.5 years, our patient had serial casting at his right ankle. Our patient received 300 units of BoNT-A at each treatment age, with the exception of age 10.5 years when he received 200 units of BoNT-A. The BoNT-A injections and long leg casting were performed under general anesthesia.\n\n【16】During the study interval, our patient participated in a wide variety of sports, including tennis, swimming, skiing, and horseback riding. He occasionally wore ankle-foot orthoses. His family reported he had an intensive home exercise program of stretching and strengthening exercises for the trunk and legs, as instructed in physical therapy; his father helped him with the exercise program to facilitate adherence.\n\n【17】### Assessments\n\n【18】At each visit to the clinical motion analysis laboratory, our patient’s body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Because BMI is both age-specific and sex-specific for children, the BMI-for-age percentile for boys was used to interpret his BMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. His leg length was measured supine from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus. Hip, knee, and ankle passive range of motion (ROM) measures were recorded and muscle strength was measured using the six-point 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–5)</u> Manual Muscle Test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 27 \\]</u>. At age 13 years, our patient’s selective motor control was tested using the recently introduced Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE) tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】Three-dimensional kinematics were collected during barefoot walking with an eight-camera optoelectric system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) was calculated from lower extremity kinematics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>, and his medial hamstrings’ muscle-tendon length and lengthening velocity were calculated using SIMM (MusculoGraphics, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Surface EMG was collected for his bilateral rectus femoris, lateral quadriceps, medial hamstrings, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior using the MA-200 EMG system (Motion Lab Systems, Inc. Baton Rouge, LA, USA). EMG and foot switch data were processed using EMG Analyzer software (B&L Engineering, Santa Ana, CA, USA).\n\n【20】Standing postural balance measures of center of pressure path length and average radial displacement were collected, as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. The energy efficiency index (EEI) was recorded during a 2-minute walk at a patient-selected comfortable walking speed and measured in heartbeats per meter walked, as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The same experienced physical therapist and bioengineer conducted the clinical motion analysis every year. After each session, the results were presented to a multidisciplinary clinical team and recommendations for treatment were made. Treatment recommendations were then sent to our patient’s referring physician at an outside hospital. Our patient’s parents provided informed consent for the presentation of data for scientific publication. The Institutional Review Board deemed the report exempt from review and approval, as the report did not meet the definition of “Human Subjects Research.”\n\n【22】### Outcomes\n\n【23】#### Physical examination\n\n【24】Our patient’s height and weight increased linearly at an average rate of 5.2 cm/year and 2.4 kg/year, respectively, which is slightly below the average rate of height and weight growth for a typically developing male in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. His BMI remained within the range of 14.6 to 16.7 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a , b )</u>, peaking at age 10.\n\n【25】**Fig. 1**\n\n【26】Key outcome measures. **a** Height and weight with the average growth rate indicated by _dashed lines_ ; **b** body mass index ( _BMI_ ), with the 50th, 25th, and 5th BMI-for-age percentiles for boys; **c** the Gait Deviation Index; and **d** maximum stance-phase knee extension. Postural balance measures of **e** path length and **f** average radial displacement ( _ARD_ ), during the eyes open testing condition. Path length represents the distance traveled by the center of pressure centroid per second, while ARD represents the radial deviation of the center of pressure centroid relative to the mean centroid location. **g** Energy expenditure as measured by the energy expenditure index ( _EEI_ ) during a 2-minute walking test; and **h** self-selected walking speed. All values are presented for ages 6 to 13 years\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Notable ROM measures, including any muscle contractures, are listed in Table 2 . All muscles tested were strong (5/5), excepting the hip abductors (4/5) and ankle plantar flexors (3/5 for ages 6–8 years and 2/5 for ages 9–13 years).\n\n【29】**Table 2 Notable passive range of motion measures for ages 6–13 years, with exceptions noted**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】Based on results of the SCALE at age 13, selective motor control was moderately impaired on his right (5 out of 10 possible points) and mildly impaired on his left (8 out of 10 points). Selective motor control was normal for his right hip and left hip, knee, and ankle. His right knee, ankle, and subtalar joints and left subtalar and toe joints had impaired selective motor control, while his right toe joints had no selective motor control.\n\n【32】#### Gait analysis: temporal-spatial parameters, kinematics, and electromyography\n\n【33】His mean GDI improved from 59 to 68 between ages 6 and 13 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1c )</u> but remained well below the mean for unimpaired gait (mean 100, SD 10).\n\n【34】From 6 to 13 years of age, his stride length (normalized to leg length) decreased from 1.29 to 1.18, cadence decreased from 131 to 111 steps/min, and single-limb support on the right decreased from 42.4 % of the gait cycle at age 6 to 36.2 % at age 13. Single-limb support on his left remained relatively constant. His step width normalized to leg length was greatest at age 6 (0.25), while double-limb support was greatest at age 13 (24 % of the gait cycle).\n\n【35】Our patient’s gait kinematics are displayed in Fig. 2 for his right side. Gait kinematics on his left were similar, though slightly less impaired than those on his right. Although our patient’s gait kinematics varied over the years, there were general kinematic patterns, as outlined below:\n\n【36】*   Pelvis: His pelvis was held in a posture of rotation to the left with left upward pelvic obliquity throughout the gait cycle. There was “double-bump” pelvic anteversion during the gait cycle.\n\n【37】*   Hip: Hip flexion and extension were nearly within normal limits (WNL) through the gait cycle. His right hip rotated internally during stance. His left hip was internally rotated through the gait cycle, secondary to the retracted pelvis on the ipsilateral side. His right hip was abducted and his left hip was adducted with respect to the oblique pelvis.\n\n【38】*   Knee: At initial contact, his knees were flexed, right more so than left. There was reduced knee extension in midstance, right more so than left. Peak knee flexion during swing was reduced on his left, and reduced and delayed on his right. His tibiae were externally rotated.\n\n【39】*   Ankle: His ankles were slightly plantar flexed at initial contact, with peak dorsiflexion generally occurring in loading response. His right foot progression angle was WNL, while his left foot progression angle was slightly internally rotated during stance.\n\n【40】**Fig. 2**\n\n【41】Right-side kinematics based on three-dimensional gait analysis. Joint kinematics are displayed for ages 6–13 years, including representative biomechanical analysis of medial hamstring length and lengthening velocity during gait\n\n【42】Full size image\n\n【43】His maximum stance-phase knee extension for ages 6–13 years is displayed in Fig. 1d . In general, his maximum knee extension in stance improved from 6 to 9 years, worsened at age 10, improved from 11 to 12 years, and worsened again at age 13.\n\n【44】Peak knee flexion in swing declined gradually from 6 to 13 years 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>: on the right from 70° to 45°, and on the left from 62° to 51°, with the most notable decline occurring after age 10. His hips became slightly more internally rotated, his tibiae became more externally rotated, and his ankles became more dorsiflexed in stance from 6 to 13 years 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. His foot progression angle remained 10–15° externally rotated from 6 to 13 years of age, bilaterally.\n\n【45】Analysis of his muscle-tendon lengths and lengthening velocities of his medial hamstrings suggest his hamstrings were consistently short at initial contact and had a reduced lengthening velocity in swing 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【46】His EMG profiles during gait varied little over time, with the exception of his right rectus femoris and right medial hamstrings 通用删除1(英):<u>(see Fig. 3 for details)</u>. His rectus femoris had prolonged activity in midswing, and his vastus lateralis and medial hamstrings had increased activity in stance. There was premature onset of his gastrocnemius in terminal swing and premature cessation of his tibialis anterior in midswing, bilaterally.\n\n【47】**Fig. 3**\n\n【48】Representative electromyography ( _EMG_ ) profiles and foot contact patterns. EMG profiles are normalized to the gait cycle. Exceptions to the typical patterns are noted with an asterisk: his right rectus femoris varied from continuously active, to active from initial swing through midswing and in loading response (as shown); his right medial hamstrings had continuous activity at ages 6 and 7 years, following which it was active from terminal swing through loading response with additional activity from preswing to initial swing (as shown). _ofto_ opposite foot toe-off, _ofc_ opposite foot contact, _TO_ toe-off\n\n【49】Full size image\n\n【50】#### Postural balance\n\n【51】His center of pressure path length with the eyes open was greater than age-matched reference values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u> from 7 to 10 years of age, and again at age 13 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1e )</u>. The average radial displacement remained consistently greater than two standard deviations above reference values, peaking at age 10 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1f )</u>. Our patient was unable to comply with balance testing procedures at age 6. In general, his postural balance measures improved from 7 to 9 years, worsened at age 10, improved from 11 to 12 years, and worsened again at age 13.\n\n【52】#### Energy efficiency\n\n【53】His EEI was WNL every year with the exception of age 10, when his EEI was more than two standard deviations above the mean 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1g )</u>. There was no change in EEI at age 6 versus age 13. His comfortable walking speed was at least two standard deviations slower than age-matched reference values 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u> each year, with the exception of age 11 when his walking speed was just WNL 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1h )</u>. When normalized to leg length, his comfortable walking speed decreased overall from 6 to 13 years of age. In general, the energy efficiency measures improved from 7 to 9 years, worsened at age 10, improved from 11 to 12 years, and worsened again at age 13.\n\n【54】#### Treatment recommendations\n\n【55】Based on the results of the gait evaluation, the multidisciplinary team recommended BoNT-A injections to his hamstrings and calf after the first motion analysis at age 6 years, and surgical hamstring lengthenings, as well as physical therapy for strengthening and balance training, annually thereafter. The reduced hamstring length and lengthening velocity, generated from the gait kinematic data, were most indicative of the need for hamstring lengthenings. However, his family opted against surgical intervention during the study period, and it was our patient’s family and his referring physician (at an unaffiliated hospital) who determined which treatments were performed. The schedule of BoNT-A and casting treatments are displayed in Table 1 . Our patient’s parents reported that he tolerated the treatments well, was compliant in each 2-week session of post-intervention physical therapy, and adhered to an intensive home exercise program.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】This case report provides an 8-year longitudinal study of a boy with spastic bilateral CP and crouch gait. The biomechanical factors contributing to our patient’s crouch gait included weak ankle plantar flexors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, short and spastic hamstrings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, moderately short hip flexors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>, and external rotation of the tibia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Our patient had strong hip and knee extensors and mild to no knee flexion contractures. His selective motor control was moderately impaired on the right and mildly impaired on the left 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. His postural balance was impaired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, as measured by the average radial deviation and path length of the center of pressure. Although hamstring lengthening was recommended from age 7 on, he and his family opted for non-surgical treatment through a combination of BoNT-A injections and casting 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>, as well as physical therapy and exercise.\n\n【58】### Weakness\n\n【59】Our patient had weak plantar flexors with a 3/5 rating on manual muscle testing from ages 6 to 8, indicating the ability to do 1–9 single limb heel rises (whereas 20 heel rises would be considered normal, 5/5 strength). At age 9, his plantar flexor strength decreased to 2/5, bilaterally, indicating an inability to perform at least one single limb heel rise. Weak calf muscles have been shown to correlate with crouch gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, and at age 10 it appeared his weak calf muscles, in combination with an increased BMI, resulted in a worsening crouch gait. Our patient’s progressive weakness from 3/5 to 2/5 was perhaps a result of the repeated BoNT-A injections to his calf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>, which were neither indicated nor recommended by motion analysis after age 6.\n\n【60】### Spasticity and shortened muscle-tendon length\n\n【61】Our patient had 10° knee flexion contractures that contributed to his crouch gait. Further, the muscle-tendon length and lengthening velocity data for his medial hamstrings (semimembranosus) suggest his hamstrings were consistently short at initial contact and had a reduced lengthening velocity in swing 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. A shortened semimembranosus length has been shown to correlate with increased knee flexion at initial contact and increased knee flexion in single limb stance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>, both of which contribute to a crouch gait.\n\n【62】### Impaired selective motor control\n\n【63】Our patient had moderately impaired selective motor control on the right (SCALE score = 5/10) and mildly impaired selective motor control on the left (SCALE score = 8/10). Impaired selective motor control results in abnormal movement patterns during gait, including flexion or extension synergies. During normal terminal swing, the combination of hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion require selective motor control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, impaired selective motor control may result in coupled movement patterns involving co-activation of the quadriceps and gastrocnemius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>, as is demonstrated by our patient in Fig. 3 . A lower SCALE score has been shown to correlate with an impaired ability to uncouple hip and knee movements during the swing phase of gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, resulting in greater knee flexion at initial contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Indeed, our patient had a lower SCALE score on his right compared to his left leg, and demonstrated greater knee flexion at initial contact on the right than the left.\n\n【64】### Stance-phase knee extension\n\n【65】Stance-phase knee extension improved from 6 to 9 years of age, worsened at age 10, improved from 11 to 12 years, and worsened again at age 13 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1d )</u>. The increased crouch gait, as determined by maximum knee extension in stance, at age 10 was concurrent with our patient’s greatest BMI, reduced plantar flexor strength, diminished standing postural balance, slowest normalized walking speed, and greatest walking energy expenditure. His maximum knee extension in stance improved from 6 to 8 years of age, despite an increasing BMI. From 9 to 13 years of age, changes in his maximum knee extension in stance paralleled changes in his BMI 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1b )</u>. Thus, it is not clear whether BMI, in and of itself, was a critical contributor to the magnitude of crouch, as noted by Rose _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Overall, maximum stance-phase knee extension improved by 14–15°, bilaterally, from age 6 to age 13.\n\n【66】### Swing-phase knee flexion\n\n【67】Swing-phase peak knee flexion was WNL from 6 to 10 years of age but declined considerably at age 11 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Peak knee flexion in swing has been shown to be highly correlated to knee flexion velocity at toe-off 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>, which is accomplished primarily through the action of the hip flexors and gastrocnemius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Thus, our patient’s flexed hip posture and decreased plantar flexor strength likely contributed to his reduced swing-phase peak knee flexion. Our patient received BoNT-A to his rectus femoris at age 11 without a resulting change in peak knee flexion in swing.\n\n【68】### Progression of crouch gait\n\n【69】Our patient’s crouch gait worsened at age 10 despite improvements from 6 to 9 years. His maximum stance-phase knee extension at age 10 was 31°, bilaterally. As noted above, this increased crouch was concurrent with his greatest BMI and second greatest BMI-for-age percentile 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>, as well as 10° knee flexion contractures 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>. The increased crouch was accompanied by poor postural balance, slower than average speed when normalized for leg length, and greater than normal EEI. The energy expenditure deficits likely reflect the increased demand that stance-phase knee flexion reportedly places on the quadriceps: 210 % of body weight at 30° of knee flexion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【70】Our patient’s crouch gait varied from moderate to mild, with BoNT-A and casting once a year from ages 6 to 9 years and every 6 months from 10 to 13 years, combined with regular stretching and strengthening exercises. Non-surgical interventions for mild cases of crouch gait typically include BoNT-A injections to the hamstrings, pre-tibial bracing, and physical therapy for stretching and strengthening exercises 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>, whereas soft tissue surgeries, such as hamstring or psoas lengthening, are often recommended for moderate cases of crouch gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 – 42 \\]</u>. Reports in the literature show that surgical lengthening of the hamstrings improve maximum knee extension in stance by an average of 11° (range 8–18°, _n_ \\= 218 limbs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 43 – 45 \\]</u>. In our patient, a combination of regular BoNT-A with casting and physical therapy showed similar control of his crouch gait as reported for soft tissue surgery. Because maximum knee extension in single limb stance has been shown to be highly correlated to knee flexion contracture and maximum length of the semimembranosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>, perhaps our patient’s history of BoNT-A injections with casting and physical therapy were able to halt the advancement of knee flexion contractures and/or shortening of the semimembranosus to allow for an overall, improved maximum stance-phase knee extension.\n\n【71】However, despite an improvement in our patient’s crouch gait at ages 11 and 12, his maximum knee extension in stance, bilateral hip flexion contractures, stride length, bilateral single limb support, and balance worsened by age 13. These functional declines may be related to the many changes, that is, physical, hormonal, and cognitive, that occur during adolescence. For example, between ages 12 and 13, both his height and weight increased at a rate greater than his average growth rate. It remains unclear how the remaining growth of adolescence will affect his gait at skeletal maturity.\n\n【72】### Limitations\n\n【73】Limitations of this case study include the lack of objective strength measures and an inability to consistently acquire gait kinetics every year due to variable participant cooperation and/or fatigue. However, when we were able to collect kinetics, two clear patterns emerged: reduced hip abductor moments during stance and reduced ankle plantar flexor moments in terminal stance, bilaterally, which were consistent with physical measures of strength (4/5 muscle strength for hip abduction and 3/5 to 2/5 muscle strength for plantar flexors).\n\n【74】Further, this case study is not representative of all children with spastic diplegia, and this patient’s response to treatment may not extend to other patients. Our patient was born full term, he had normal cognition, his family was able to cover all treatment costs, and he adhered to post-intervention rehabilitation and a general home exercise program. Every brain injury associated with CP is unique and, thus, individuals with CP represent a heterogeneous population. Regardless, longitudinal case studies of individuals with CP can provide a point of reference for clinicians to evaluate future patients and consider the complex interaction of treatments, growth, and external factors that influence movement in CP.\n\n【75】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【76】As this case report highlights, the assessment and treatment of crouch gait is multifaceted. The motor deficits associated with spastic cerebral palsy, including weakness, spasticity, shortened muscle-tendon lengths, and impaired selective motor control, were identified by our patient’s clinical motion analyses, along with poor postural balance. Overall, his crouch gait improved mildly with aggressive non-operative management and a supportive family dedicated to a regular home exercise program. The annual clinical motion analyses identified changes in motor deficits that were associated with changes in the child’s walking pattern, suggesting that detailed clinical motion analyses can serve to focus treatment to improve future outcomes for children with spastic CP. When evaluating the treatment options of surgical intervention versus annual BoNT-A injections and casting, consideration must be given to the effects on muscle strength, the treatment time, financial costs, risk of repeated general anesthesia, rehabilitation requirements, and the patient’s cognitive abilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Here we present the case of a patient suffering from chronic resistant mastocytosis. An original integrative method of evaluation was tested in this patient, to improve therapeutic management. It integrated the interactions between stressful life events and medical history as well as psychobehavioral components and neurobiological factors.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The patient was a 65-year-old Caucasian woman. The cutaneous symptoms of mastocytosis had progressively evolved over the past 36 years, increasingly affecting the patient’s quality of life. At the time of the evaluation, psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy had reduced pruritus, but very unsightly brown-red maculopapules persisted on the chest, back, and arms. We proposed an integrative diagnosis that combined a semistructured interview, a psychometric assessment with the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic tool, and the collection of medical data. The medical data were compared with the analysis of the significant events in the patient’s life, to determine the threshold of tolerance to stress beyond which the skin symptoms led to profuse thrusts of pruritus. At the same time, the psychobehavioral profile of the patient was determined; this highlighted how social isolation, the denigrated coping style, and problematic compliance could influence the extension of dermatological symptoms. The effects of stressors on the infiltration and degranulation of skin mast cells have been discussed in light of the neurobiological processes currently known. At the end of the evaluation, a new therapeutic strategy was proposed.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case report reveals the mind–body relationship of a patient suffering from mastocytosis. It highlights the points of vulnerability and the adaptative strategies specific to each patient to be considered in therapeutic management of other resistant chronic diseases.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Harmonious relationships between mind and body are essential to staying healthy. The skin is an organ particularly sensitive to imbalances such as those caused by stressful situations. Mastocytosis is a cutaneous pathology that has not yet been studied with regard to the mind–body relationship. Cutaneous mastocytosis is a disease of the hematopoietic stem cells preferentially occurring in childhood. Cutaneous manifestations most often disappear at puberty. This pathology is due to mast cell proliferation that causes symptoms such as pruritus, characterized by brown maculopapules on the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. These symptoms are explained by the degranulation of peripheral mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Mast cells can then release proteases such as tryptase and numerous mediators such as heparin, histamine, serotonin, substance P, cytokines, interleukins, lipids, and growth factors​. More than 50 substances can be released from mast cells. Some of them are the cause of the skin manifestations of mastocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Most of mastocytosis is due to a mutation of the gene coding for the c-kit receptor. The c-kit receptor ligand is the stem cell factor (SCF) that induces mast cell proliferation in physiological conditions. In mastocytosis, the c-kit gene mutation leads to overproduction of mast cells, which is the cause of the onset of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In adults, when mast cells moderately infiltrate other tissues, the pathology is considered as indolent systemic mastocytosis. In this case, “atypical” mutations of the c-kit gene occur and other symptoms usually appear. These symptoms can be chronic (skin lesions, asthma, muscle, joint or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or paroxysmal (flushing, anaphylactic shock, syncope). Neuropsychiatric symptoms have also been described (headaches, attention deficit, auditory or visual memory disorders, depression, sensitivity to stress), suggesting a cerebral effect of mast cells in this pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In 10% of cases, systemic mastocytosis becomes aggressive, with a poor prognosis and median survival of 2 to 4 years.\n\n【12】In 90% of cases, the mastocytosis remains cutaneous and treatments are available to reduce symptoms. It is recommended that affected people avoid conditions that trigger or worsen their symptoms when possible. Certain medications such as oral antihistamines and topical steroids are often prescribed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Affected adults may also undergo photochemotherapy, which can help alleviate itching and improve the appearance of the patches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】In this study, we present the case of an adult woman with a resistant form of cutaneous mastocytosis. The patient did not develop the systemic form of the pathology, but despite treatments, the cutaneous symptoms were progressively extended for many years, causing significant psychological distress and unaesthetic discomfort. To find an efficient medical care and improve the quality of life of the patient, an original assessment was decided in addition to the clinical diagnosis. This comprehensive and personalized method collects qualitative and quantitative data. It involves psychometric tools and scientific knowledge to evaluate the mind–body relationship.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】The patient was a 65-year-old Caucasian woman, with a history of cutaneous mastocytosis. She was divorced, with two children, and was a retired teacher. The patient did not smoke or drink alcohol. She had no major medical history except the presence of lumbar and femoral osteopenia. A detailed medical examination was performed on admission and revealed very good general condition, weight 54 kg, height 163 cm, blood pressure 120/85 mmHg, pulse 52 beats per minute, body temperature 37.3°C, supple abdomen, without hepatosplenomegaly, and normal cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological examinations. She had exhibited symptoms of mastocytosis for 36 years with pruritus and was diagnosed by skin biopsy. Dermatological examination revealed small brown-red maculopapules on the thorax, back, and arms 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. A positive Darier’s sign was elicited 5 minutes after skin scratching (the skin becomes swollen, itchy, and red). Additional laboratory analyses were performed. Complete blood count, blood ionogram, and glycemia were normal. No abnormal liver or renal functions were detected. Moderate proteinuria (0,18 g/24 hours) was diagnosed and had to be monitored, The serum tryptase level was slightly higher than normal (23.3 ng/ml) during crisis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of skeletal involvement, and paraclinical examination had concluded the absence of extracutaneous manifestations. The systemic form of the disease had thus been excluded, and the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis had been confirmed. A dermatological treatment was prescribed to the patient: application of a dermocorticoid cream once or twice a day with a maximum of two tubes of creams per month (clobetasol propionate at 0.05%, at the time of skin lesions with prurit). It was supplemented by oral administration of an antiallergic antihistamine drug (levocetirizine dihydrochloride 5 mg, two tablets per day). These local and oral treatments have been ineffective in the long term. Finally, photochemotherapy was also proposed to the patient. Photochemotherapy combines treatment with psoralen and exposure of the skin to long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA). At the time of the assessment, PUVA therapy (30 sessions, 1500 J) had been given each year for 4 years. The sessions had achieved reduction of pruritus with persistence of a moderate Darier’s sign, but very unaesthetic skin lesions had persisted with profuse thrusts. These cutaneous symptoms significantly decreased the quality of life of the patient.\n\n【16】During the medical consultation, the patient was informed of the objectives and procedures of the psychobehavioral assessment of the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. MBMD is a self-report inventory containing 165 true–false items. It provides scales to assess psychobehavioral factors, such as negative health habits, psychiatric indications, coping styles, stress moderators, treatment prognostics, and management guides. The scale aimed to identify attitudes that may affect health of the patient.\n\n【17】At the next visit, after giving consent, the patient told her life history during a structured interview. The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> was used to score each stressful life event in “Life Change Units” (LCU). The life events and LCU were collected in an Excel file and classified chronologically. LCU applied to life events for 1 year were summed to assess the annual stress score. In parallel, the medical data of the electronic health records were chronologically integrated in the Excel file to establish a comprehensive dermatological history of the mastocytosis. An automatized graph integrating annual stress scores and cutaneous symptoms was generated.\n\n【18】Analysis of life history and cutaneous symptoms indicated that stressful events could have exacerbated the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 for details)</u>. We observed that, if annual stress score of life events exceeded 50 LCU on the Holmes and Rahe scale, skin manifestations in relation to mastocytosis were induced subsequently. An annual score of 50 LCU could thus be considered as the threshold for stress tolerance of this patient.\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】Medical data and stressful life events. Horizontal axis corresponds to the age of the patient (in years). Green triangles represent annual stress scores. Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale was used to score each stressful life event (in “Life Change Units” LCU). Scores were calculated after the clinical interview of the patient. LCU applied to life events during 1 year were summed to assess the annual stress score. Red lines indicate the periods of cutaneous events recorded in the medical chart. Annual stress scores of life events were low (<50) during childhood. We did not have documentation about the medical status during this period. At the age of 22 years, two major stressful life events occurred: business readjustment (39 LCU) and divorce (65 LCU), totaling a global stress score of 104 LCU. At 23 years old, a second business readjustment (39 LCU) occurred with an abroad change in living conditions (25 LCU) (annual stress score = 39 + 25 = 64 LCU). Mastocytosis crisis (red lines) appeared at the age of 24 years as localized brown cutaneous lesions. It was scored with 53 LCU (according to Holmes and Rahe instructions, pathological events are considered to be stressful and scored with 53 LCU). At the age of 25 years, the patient moved to another country (Africa, 39 LCU) and married (50 LCU) (annual stress score = 89 LCU). The patient contracted subcutaneous filariasis at age 27 years (53 LCU) and developed a Quincke’s edema of unknown origin (53 LCU) at age 30 years. Until her 50th birthday, events such as the birth of two daughters and the adoption of a third daughter were reported, and were considered as mildly stressful on the Holmes and Rahe scale. No new somatic event occurred during this life period, and the patient did not consult a physician for mastocytosis. At the age of 51 years, she moved again within Africa for a job (39 LCU) and suffered from her father’s death (63 LCU) (annual stress score = 102 LCU). Subsequently, she developed brown cutaneous lesions related to mastocytosis, treated with corticoids. At the age of 53 years, while the patient and her husband were working in the same company, she realized that he was having an affair with a woman colleague (65 LCU). Then, cutaneous lesions were extended progressively and the patient developed mastocytosis symptoms again. From the age of 55 to 64 years, she suffered chronically from brown maculopapules (red lines), which could have been influenced by family-related events, such as one daughter’s marriage (39 LCU) and a patient’s divorce (65 LCU) (annual stress score = 104 LCU at 56 years old); the death of her mother (63 LCU), the departure of the last daughter (29 LCU), and retirement (45 LCU) (annual stress score = 74 LCU at 62 years old); and the death of the brother (63 LCU)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】The MBMD results detailed the psychobehavioral profile of the patient 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. This scale identifies attitudes and relationships that may affect health (with significant prevalence score >75) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The psychiatric indicators (anxiety–tension, depression, cognitive dysfunction, emotional lability, guardedness) did not evidence significant psychiatric comorbidities at the time of assessment 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. The MBMD results detailed the stress moderators of the patient 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig 2 b)</u>. For the patient, social isolation and the absence of spiritual support reinforced the stressful effect of life events, which could exacerbate the dermatologic symptoms of mastocytosis. Coping styles are shown in Fig 2 c. They reflect ways of dealing with life stress and illness. The significant prevalence scores revealed denigrated coping style. This personality trait would predispose the patient to somatic manifestations. In Fig 2 d, the significant prevalence score of treatment prognostics indicates the patient’s characteristics that should be considered by the clinicians because they influence treatment outcome. We noticed a low compliance with treatment as well as periods of medication abuse, which did not help care. Regarding everyday behavior, the MBMD test did not reveal negative health habits at that time (alcohol, drugs, eating, caffeine, inactivity, smoking, data not shown.\n\n【23】**Fig. 2**\n\n【24】Psychobehavioral diagnosis of the patient. Prevalence scores of psychiatric indicators ( **a** ), stress moderators ( **b** ), coping styles ( **c** ), and treatment prognostics ( **d** ) are calculated from the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic questionnaire, which assesses psychobehavioral factors that may affect health. MBMD responses were analyzed and scored according to the Millon guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. A prevalence score of up to 75 is considered as significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>\\]. Graphs were built to facilitate visualization of significant factors that may affect health. Turquoise arrows show significant indicators to consider\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】By synthesizing medical data, life history, psychometric tests, and biological knowledge of the pathology, the points of vulnerability of the patient’s mind–body relationship could be highlighted unambiguously.\n\n【28】Skin manifestations appeared systematically after a period of life events considered as stressful. Personal psychological factors associated with neurobiological processes of stress have surely exacerbated the symptomatology of cutaneous mastocytosis. When events scored up to 50 LCU in the Holmes and Rahe stress scale, the patient systematically displayed brown macropapules on the skin. The coping strategies have certainly been surpassed by stress, as suggested in other pathologies favored by stress susceptibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. The significant stressful life events concerned family bereavements (father and mother) or separations (husband and children). Moreover, the absence of spiritual resources combined with social isolation and noncombative personality traits constitutes a lack of psychological support that could impair stress moderation.\n\n【29】Usually, only physical data are considered in patients suffering from cutaneous pathologies. Neither life history nor stress coping skills are taken into consideration in medical care, while mind–body interactions are essential to health. Considering our results, we can conclude that it is extremely important to take into account the emotional stress and the psychological dimension because they can influence the symptomatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 , 16 \\]</u>. It has been shown, in gut diseases and dermatological pathologies, that stressful events can amplify inflammatory manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Moreover, acute stress combined with psychological factors increases the morbidity of allergy and dermatitis by the activation of skin mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 20 \\]</u>, suggesting psycho-neuro-immunomodulation of cutaneous crises.\n\n【30】The implication of mind in dermatological symptoms of mastocytosis could be explained by the known biological processes associated with stress 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. In the skin, there are anatomical and functional interactions between neurons, blood vessels, and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 21 \\]</u> that could be biological indicators of the influence of mind on the body. Cutaneous mast cells appear to have important physiological functions as sensors of stressful events mediated by the neuroendocrine system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】**Fig. 3**\n\n【32】Biological factors and cutaneous symptoms. Cutaneous mastocytosis is characterized by abnormal mast cell (MC) proliferation and degranulation in the skin leading to symptoms such as itchy, brown patches 通用删除1(英):<u>(see photograph)</u>. In many cases, mutations in the coding kit gene (c-kit) are responsible for intensification of mast cell proliferation, infiltration, and mediator release in the skin. In the case of this patient, several factors could contribute to the extension of cutaneous symptoms. When the coping strategies of the patient are surpassed, life events induce emotional stress (red flash), implicating the cerebral limbic system and triggering activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Heat and sun radiation (yellow flash) can reinforce the activation of mast cells, which locally release several substances such as histamine, tryptase, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), inducing a melanogenic effect. Cutaneous sensory nerve endings, in close contact with mast cells, can also be activated and induce neurogenic inflammation. They mediate the orthodromically itchy reflex associated with prurit (blue flashes). The following antidromic stimulation (violet flash) induces the release of mediators from sensory endings (substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP). These neuropeptides cause further mast cell degranulation. All these processes extend and exacerbate cutaneous mastocytosis symptoms\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】In the case of stressful life events, the brain limbic system involved in emotional and memory processes is activated. This leads to stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary axis. Stress induces the release of neurotransmitters and hormones into the systemic circulation, which alters immune function and skin inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Mast cells occupy a strategic position in the brain–skin axis and release mediators that act in both a paracrine and an autocrine fashion.\n\n【35】Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is considered as a direct mediator of the stress response able to stimulate mast cell degranulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 \\]</u>. Mast cells can be activated by acute stress or by intradermal administration of CRF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 26 \\]</u>. They strongly express the CRF receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 \\]</u>. The activation of the CRFR-1 receptor on mast cells can lead to strong proinflammatory states and be linked with many cutaneous disorders. Increased vascular permeability and flushing are dependent on CRF receptor expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 , 29 \\]</u>. CRF produced locally could have melanogenic effects under specific conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Solar radiation, for example, can stimulate this CRF production and increase mast cell activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 32 \\]</u>. In the case of this patient, repeated stays in Africa, in addition to stressful life conditions, could have favored the onset of mastocytosis. They would also account for the brown color of maculopapules. This visible component of skin manifestations greatly impacts the human relationships of the patient.\n\n【36】Cutaneous sensory nerve endings located in close contact with mast cells also contribute to the amplification of the symptoms. They are activated by histamine release and mediate the itchy reflex associated with prurit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. Moreover they can release neuropeptides in response to stressors. Substance P is a key mediator in connecting the brain and the skin, by stimulating mast cell degranulation during stress, an important process in neurogenic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 , 33 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】The c-kit mutations, solar radiation, stressful events, sympathetic system, HPA axis, circulating hormones, sensory nerves, neuropeptides, and mast cells mediators all could have contributed to the onset of cutaneous symptoms of mastocytosis. They contributed together to the amplification of cutaneous lesions that extended progressively along the life of the patient whenever a stressful event occurred. The lack of spiritual and social coping resources impaired the restoration of healthy mind–body interactions.\n\n【38】Considering the global examination of the case, a positive therapeutic strategy improving mind–body relationship could be proposed to the patient: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a therapy reinforcing social and spiritual abilities,to strengthen the capacities of the patient to moderate stress, such as a mindfulness-based intervention program, fostering the patient's ability to introspect and improve psychobehavioral skills and quality of life; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> careful monitoring of compliance with the prescription of oral H1 antihistamine medication (levocetirizine); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> strong discouragement of sun exposure.\n\n【39】This therapeutic strategy could improve harmonious relationships between mind and body, which are essential to staying healthy. The skin is an organ particularly sensitive to imbalances such as those caused by stressful situations.\n\n【40】This article focuses on the psychological aspect of the patient’s experience and its potential role in the exacerbation of cutaneous mastocytosis. Practical and therapeutic implications are explored. However, an anamnestic approach in a single case is not sufficient to demonstrate its validity. This could be a starting point for large-scale studies. This type of neuropsychobehavioral approach should be evaluated on a larger scale in a statistically representative cohort of patients suffering from cutaneous mastocytosis.\n\n【41】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【42】Mastocytosis is a cutaneous pathology that can be considered with regard to the mind–body relationship. Our study underlines the influence of the psyche on mast cell degranulation (psycho-neuro-immunomodulatory pathway) and/or the influence of the skin on the psyche (somatopsychic pathway), which could be implicated in this disease. The transdisciplinary approach presented in this study evaluated the influence of patient-specific factors on cutaneous symptoms. In addition to clinical data, integrative diagnosis has taken into account the patient’s history of life, psychobehavioral skills, and neurobiological processes.\n\n【43】A comprehensive and personalized approach of the patient reveals the vulnerabilities of the connection between the mind and the body and their involvement in the development of disease such as mastocytosis. This type of personalized and integrative diagnosis could be indicated in the case of other chronic diseases resistant to conventional treatments. It could also be proposed in primary health care, especially as a preventive measure throughout life.\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Please contact corresponding author for data requests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In most cases, it occurs as an isolated phenomenon (idiopathic Sweet’s syndrome) but it can be drug induced or associated with a variety of underlying diseases such as infections, neoplasms, and chronic inflammatory diseases. The association between Sweet’s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis is rare. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature.

The cause of this association remains unclear. Some hypotheses have been developed, but further studies are needed to confirm or refute them.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Sweet’s syndrome (SwS) is a rare disease characterized by a constellation of clinical symptoms, physical features, and pathologic findings which include fever, neutrophilia, tender erythematous skin lesions (papules, nodules, and plaques), and a diffuse infiltrate consisting predominantly of mature neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It was originally described by Dr Robert Douglas Sweet in the August-September 1964 issue of the _British Journal of Dermatology_ as an “acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. SwS usually presents as an idiopathic disease (2 out of 3 of cases), but can also be drug induced or associated with other disorders such as infections, malignancies, and inflammatory conditions like chronic rheumatic diseases. The association between SwS and spondylarthropathy is rare. To the best of our knowledge, only three cases of SwS associated with spondylarthropathy have been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>. We report a new case of SwS revealing ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 33-year-old Moroccan man with an unremarkable medical history, presented with large joints polyarthralgia, inflammatory pain in his buttocks and lower lumbar spine (morning stiffness of 45 minutes and frequent nocturnal awakenings), fever and skin lesions. He had no family history of rheumatic or skin diseases. On physical examination, the patient had a low-grade fever (38–39°C), six tender but not swollen joints (shoulders, elbows, and knees), a marked limitation of his lumbar spine flexion (Schober index=10+2cm, finger-to-ground distance=10cm), and painful erythematous maculopapules over his face, neck, and hands. Laboratory tests showed hyperleukocytosis (12,140/mm <sup>3 </sup> with 8500/mm <sup>3 </sup> of neutrophils), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (106 mm/hour), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (93 mg/L). The results of the immunological tests including antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. The results of urine culture, blood culture, tuberculin skin test, search of _tubercle bacilli_ in the sputum, and serology of cytomegalovirus and hepatitis were negative. Investigations for an underlying neoplastic disease remained negative. The patient’s chest X-ray was normal, whereas X-rays of the patient’s skeleton showed a squaring of the lumbar vertebrae 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>, and suspected bilateral sacroiliitis that was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. A skin biopsy revealed a neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis and epidermis.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】**Plain X-ray of lumbar spine showing squaring of the lumbar vertebrae.**\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】**Figure 2**\n\n【16】**Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints showing bilateral sacroiliitis with a hyperintense signal on T2 (arrow) of the iliac and sacral banks, and sacroiliac spacing.**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】A diagnosis of SwS was based on two major and two minor criteria proposed by Su and Liu and modified by Von Den Driesch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. The diagnosis of SwS associated with AS (the AS criteria of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society were fulfilled) was established. The patient received indomethacin (150 mg/day) and showed rapid onset of improvement. Within a few days, the progression of the skin lesions had stopped and they started to disappear. After one week, fever and pain disappeared with a decreasing CRP level (20 mg/L).\n\n【19】**Table 1 **Criteria proposed by Su and Liu** 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> **for the diagnostic of Sweet’s syndrome****\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】SwS remains a rare condition that can be drug induced (lithium, furosemide, oral contraceptives, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and so on) or associated with other pathologies, including infections in 20 to 30% of cases (bacterial, viral infections), malignancies in 10 to 20% of cases (hematological disorders in 75% of cases especially acute myelogenous leukemia, solid tumors in 35%, such as carcinomas of the genitourinary organs, breast, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tract), and chronic inflammatory disorders in 10 to 20% of cases (rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet’s disease, inflammatory bowel disorders, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematous) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. However, the association with spondylarthropathy has rarely been described. Only three cases of SwS associated with this rheumatic disease have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 5 \\]</u>. In two cases, the patients presented with a long-standing association: AS fulfilling the New York criteria, and SwS according to Su and Liu’s criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In one of these two cases, an acute Crohn’s colitis had developed. In the third case, SwS was concomitant with the AS as in our patient.\n\n【23】This association might be regarded as a mere coincidence; however, two facts raise some questions: SwS has already been reported to be associated with other inflammatory diseases, and the presence of three more cases reporting the association between SwS and spondylarthropathy.\n\n【24】No definite pathogenetic conclusions about the connection between SwS and AS can be drawn at the moment, because the respective pathogeneses of both diseases have not yet been clarified. Initial hypotheses have been raised regarding the deposition of immune complexes on the vessel walls, similar to the type III hypersensitivity reactions causing immune complex-mediated vasculitis. Other hypotheses, which have not been supported by experimental data, have been suggested including T-cell-dependent cellular immune activation, and altered neutrophil function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 \\]</u>. It is currently thought that impairment of neutrophil function and cytokine dysregulation (interleukins, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon gamma, and so on) may represent a common link between AS and SwS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 \\]</u>. An infectious hypothesis has also been suggested for the pathogenesis of spondylarthropathy and SwS: the same infectious agent could be the cause of these diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Taking into consideration all the currently available data, the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the association between SwS and AS remain not well understood.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【26】Spondylarthropathy may be added to the list of musculoskeletal disorders associated with SwS. The rarity of such case reports argues for an association by chance and, accordingly, to the lack of relationship between SwS and this rheumatic disease. Nevertheless, there are hypotheses that have not been supported by experimental data, which can explain the mechanism responsible for such an association. The diagnosis of this neutrophilic dermatosis must seek systematically an associated pathology including spondylarthropathy.\n\n【27】Consent\n-------\n\n【28】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease overlap with many other abdominal disorders, such as tuberculosis, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and others. Several publications in the literature describe that it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of this disease, despite the fact that many diagnostic armamentaria are available to suggest its presence. Most of the patients with Crohn’s disease are treated conservatively, and a few may require surgical intervention, especially those presenting with complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforations, and abscess as well as fistula formations, as seen in this index patient. Crohn’s disease is considered by many to be a very rare disease in Africa. It is interesting to know that Crohn’s disease, which affects mainly young adults, may debut at any age. The rarity and clinical curiosity of this entity suggested reporting of my patient’s case. Evidence-based up-to-date information on Crohn’s disease is also documented.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Crohn’s disease (CD), also referred to as regional enteritis, granulomatous enterocolitis, and terminal ileitis, is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of unknown cause that is often multifocal and can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It is generally accepted that the Scottish surgeon Dalziel gave the first account of the disease in 1913 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In the 1960s, Lockhart-Mummery and Morson described the involvement of the large intestine by CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and it was in the 1950s that anal and anorectal CD were described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In time, it became clear that CD can involve any part of the digestive tract and that extraintestinal manifestations can be present, especially in the skin, eyes, and joints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Epidemiological studies showed that CD has an incidence of 3 to 20 cases per 100,000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. CD is more common in the industrialized world, particularly in North America and Western Europe, though the incidence is rising in Asia and South America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. There may be a slightly higher predominance of CD in women, and it is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish origin than in non-Jews. The exact pathogenesis of CD is unknown, although there are a number of genetic and environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of the disease and lead to the aberrant gut immune response characteristic of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In a related development, other literature suggested a “north to south gradient” with respect to the incidence of CD. North America (7 to 10.3/100,000 per year), the United Kingdom (8.3 to 9.1/100,000 per year), and Northern Europe (5.8–6.3/100,000 per year) have the highest incidence of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The prevalence of CD also demonstrated a similar pattern, which is reported to be 207/100,000 per year in North America, 156/100,000 per year in the United Kingdom, and 90/100,000 per year in Northern Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. However, owing to limited information on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in southern countries, this “gradient” is not widely accepted.\n\n【12】Furthermore, there are only a few studies on the incidence and prevalence of CD in Latin America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 21 \\]</u>. Although the incidence of CD in South America has been surveyed to be lower than in North America, in the last 50 years, occidental countries have reported a rise in both incidence and prevalence of IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 21 \\]</u>. Another study mentioned that Puerto Rico has the lowest incidence of IBD within the southern American subregion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 22 \\]</u>. Yamamoto-Furusho, in his study of a Mexican population, reported an increasing incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) from 1987 to 2006, with a 2.6-fold increase from 1997 to 2006, compared with the previous decade. This increasing incidence of UC has been linked to environmental factors and the unique genetic mosaic of the Mexican population, but there is no information regarding CD incidence in Mexico to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 23 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】The rarity of CD and the prevalence of tuberculous enterocolitis in Africa and Asia in general tend to unnecessarily make clinicians hesitant to diagnose a CD both clinically and histologically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Its differentiation from UC is always a problem, but the distinction from tuberculosis is rather more difficult in developing countries if the lesion is granulomatous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. Surgically resected bowel segments again require a close examination using various diagnostic criteria to diagnose or exclude a CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. This case of histopathologically confirmed CD is presented because of the rarity and clinical curiosity of this entity. Evidence-based, up-to-date information on CD is also presented.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 70-year-old man of Kumbo origin from the Northwest region of Cameroon was admitted to a rural mission hospital in Cameroon with a history of crampy right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, nonbloody, nonmucoid diarrhea alternating with constipation for the last 5 days. Anorexia and low-grade fever were observed, but no weight loss. Abdominal examination revealed the features of acute intestinal obstruction with an ill-defined mass in the right iliac fossa (RIF) and visible peristalsis. A chest radiograph was essentially normal. An abdominopelvic ultrasound scan showed dilated bowel loops and an RIF mass. An abdominal plain radiograph showed multiple air-fluid levels and dilated bowel loops. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan and barium enema study confirmed a complex ascending colonic and cecal tumor. The patient had a markedly raised white blood cell count of 40,300 cells/ml. The C-reactive protein was significantly elevated, and results of the tuberculin test and Genexpert test for tuberculosis were both negative. The patient’s blood pressure was 129/78 mmHg, and his pulse rate was 60 beats/min. He also had pyrexia (− 37.9 °C). In view of acute intestinal obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was performed after routine investigations. The intraoperative finding was a huge complex inflammatory mass involving the cecum, terminal ileum, and sigmoid colon. The patient subsequently had a sigmoidectomy with end-to-end sigmoidorectal anastomosis and a cecal resection, and the proximal ascending colon was exteriorized because end mucoid fistula and terminal ileostomy were performed. Figure 1 is a postoperative photograph showing the ileostomy and disposable stoma bag. Figure 2 is the immediate postoperative photograph of the resected complex mass involving the cecum, terminal ileum, and sigmoid colon. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed macroscopic appearance of a complex large mass 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u> involving the cecum, sigmoid colon, and terminal ileum, with congested swollen mucosa interspersed with diffused, irregular ulcerations with a cobblestone appearance (noncaseating granulomas in all layers of bowel wall from serosa to mucosa). Also, multiple fissures were present, as well as perforation and fistula seen between adjourning bowel loops, but no significant IBD was observed in nonulcerated mucosa. Microscopically, prominent and enlarged lymphatic follicles, proliferation of muscularis mucosa, and formation of fissures extending from mucosa to serosa along with gross edema. Marked infiltrates of inflammatory cells involved all the bowel layers; the details are depicted in Fig. 4 . Therefore, histopathological diagnosis of CD was made. The postoperative period was uneventful. Thereafter, the patient received five courses of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of azathioprine (AZA), methotrexate (MTX), mesalamine, and methylprednisolone. He had complete disease remission and subsequently underwent closure of the ileostomy with satisfactory postoperative status. The most recent follow-up abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy revealed disease-free status. The patient is also currently receiving a maintenance dose of rectal mesalamine and oral omeprazole treatment. He has been followed every 2 months in the surgical outpatient clinic over the last 16 months with a satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】The index patient\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】Post op bowel specimen\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Colonic Crohn’s disease\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】The histopathology slide\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】CD causes inflammation of the digestive tract. It can affect any area of the GIT from mouth to anus; however, it most commonly affects the ileum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>. In CD, all layers of the intestine may be involved, and normal healthy bowel can be found between sections of diseased bowel. CD affects men and women equally in all age groups, with a predilection in the second and third decades and familial preponderance in a few 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. IBD was once considered rare in the developing world; its epidemiology is changing, and the incidence of both CD and UC is increasing in the Asia-Pacific region, India, Eastern Europe, and South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 \\]</u>. There have been very few reported cases of CD in black African patients in Kenya and South Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. The symptoms, anatomical distribution, signs, and pathology in black patients in Africa and America are similar to those described in white individuals. The disease is probably underdiagnosed in Africa because of difficulties in distinguishing schistosomiasis and tuberculosis of the bowel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 35 , 36 , 37 \\]</u>. The etiology of CD remains incompletely known, although several theories have been issued, such as the involvement of genetic factors, environmental factors (including diet), and infective agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\]</u>. CD is directly correlated with a triad of predisposing factors, including genetic problems, immune system malfunctions, and environmental factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】CD usually presents with abdominal pain especially due to involvement of ileum, blood-stained diarrhea, and anemia. Some patients with CD may have low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. Fissures or cracks may be evident, and fistulas and abscesses may form in anal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. CD may also present with extraintestinal manifestations such as skin or mouth lesions, pain in the joints, eye irritation, kidney stones, gallstones, and other diseases of the hepatobiliary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 39 \\]</u>. Affected children may have delayed milestones. Patients with severe cases of CD may have most common complications such as intestinal blockage with thickening and fibrosis of the affected segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】The diagnosis of CD is a clinical one and can be quite difficult, given that the presenting symptoms can be insidious and nonspecific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 \\]</u>. Red flag symptoms that require further evaluation include weight loss, bloody diarrhea, iron deficiency, and nighttime awakenings.\n\n【32】Similarly, significant family history of IBD, unexplained elevations in the C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or other acute-phase reactants (for example, ferritin and platelets), or low vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> should prompt further investigation for possible CD. Laboratory findings that are useful in CD are hypoalbuminemia, elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, anemia, or leukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\]</u>. The serologic markers of clinical importance are the anti- _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ antibodies, which are commonly positive in CD, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, which is negative for CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\]</u>. These tests are suggestive of CD but are not meant to be interpreted as diagnostic tests, because positive results could be present in a healthy population The main utility of these antibodies is for differential diagnosis in patients with characteristics of CD and other diseases, including UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 41 , 42 , 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】In spite of the widely used diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, barium x-rays, CT scans, and colonoscopy, a clear diagnosis of CD may remain obscure. Although no single “gold standard” indicator of this disease has been established, it is indeed possible to make an ideal diagnosis based on the patient’s clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and pathologic data; meanwhile, colonoscopy, capsular endoscopy, and laparoscopy significantly assist clinicians worldwide in elucidating the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 42 \\]</u>. Both computed tomography enterography (CTE) and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) allow visualization of the bowel wall, mucosa, and extraluminal complications. CTE and MRE have supplanted small-bowel barium studies as the criterion standard for the diagnosis and assessment of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 43 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Treatment and prognosis of the disease depend on several factors. The Montreal classification considers age of onset, location, and behavior of the disease, as well as presence of perianal disease, for categorization; many decisions regarding diagnostic approach, treatment, follow-up, and prediction of several outcomes, ranging from response to therapy to long-term prognosis, depend on this classification 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】**Table 1 Montreal classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>**\n\n【36】Full size table\n\n【37】Furthermore, for severity scoring, there is an extensive number of validated scores such as the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), mainly used in clinical trials because of its complexity, and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index used in the clinical setting owing to its simplicity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 45 , 46 , 47 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】**Table 2 Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>**\n\n【39】Full size table\n\n【40】There is a global resolve among clinicians that the treatment of CD should depend on disease severity, location of disease, and subtype of disease (that is, inflammatory, stricturing, or penetrating). Attempts are also being made to determine individuals who are at risk for aggressive CD and who may require earlier and more aggressive therapies. Risk factors for aggressive disease activity include age of diagnosis less than 30 years, extensive anatomic involvement, perianal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgery, and stricturing and/or penetrating disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 48 \\]</u>. One of the biggest challenges associated with CD is that after 20 years of disease activity, 80% of patients will require surgery, and approximately 30% will require surgery within 5 years of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 41 , 48 \\]</u>. Although the goal of medical therapy is to maintain remission without the need for surgery, once strictures and/or fistula complications occur, surgery may be required. Unfortunately, because surgery is not curative for CD, many patients will require multiple surgeries over their lifetime 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 49 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】There are a number of different drugs used to treat CD, as highlighted in Table 3 . Mesalamine has been evaluated in a number of studies but has not been shown to effectively induce or maintain remission in CD. The perceived benefit of mesalamine is likely related to its safety profile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 41 \\]</u>. Antibiotics are also used in CD, but the evidence supporting their use is also limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 50 \\]</u>. The main role of antibiotics is to treat the suppurative or perianal complications of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 51 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】**Table 3 Medications, monitoring, and adverse events <sup>a </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>**\n\n【43】Full size table\n\n【44】Immunosuppressants, including AZA, mecaptopurine (MP), and MTX, have been used for many years to treat CD. These drugs are typically used to maintain remission because of their slow onset of action. However, more recent studies question the overall efficacy of AZA/MP as monotherapy and their use in early CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 52 , 53 , 54 \\]</u>. Newer reports have suggested that these drugs can be used in combination with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs to decrease their immunogenicity and also to increase anti-TNF drug concentrations. The mainstay of therapy for CD has been anti-TNF agents.\n\n【45】More recently approved drugs are monoclonal antibodies directed against certain integrins (α4 or α4β7) or interleukins (IL-12/IL-23). The first anti-integrin approved for CD was natalizumab, but this is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal brain infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 55 , 56 \\]</u>. Vedolizumab is a gut-selective anti-integrin that has not been associated with PML and is used mostly to maintain remission in moderate to severe CD with only modest effectiveness at induction of remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 57 \\]</u>. In contrast, the most recently approved agent, ustekinumab, an IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor, has been shown to be as effective as anti-TNF therapy at inducing and maintaining remission in moderate to severe CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 58 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】Ultimately, the goal of medical therapy is to induce and maintain a steroid-free clinical remission, prevent complications and surgery, and improve the patient’s quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 59 \\]</u>. For typical medication, complications, and monitoring recommendations, _see_ Table 3 .\n\n【47】A significant number of patients with CD can be managed by adopting a conservative approach that includes adequate rest, a nutritious diet, multivitamins, iron, folic acid, antioxidants, and sulfasalazine. Surgical therapy is useful in refractory disease and when complications such as occlusion, abscess, and fistulas develop. Though surgery is required to relieve obstruction, to repair a perforation, to treat an abscess, or to close a fistula, a judicious approach to treating the patient is of utmost importance regarding the decision whether to intervene or to continue with conservative management to avoid life-threatening complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This evidence confirmed the role of surgical intervention as reported in the index patient.\n\n【48】The outcome of CD has improved with good medical care. It is serious, but it is not a terminal illness. Mortality in these patients is due to risks of surgery or associated diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 60 \\]</u>. These patients require very regular follow-up even if they are well, and any new symptom should be given due consideration. The index patient received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of AZA, MTX, mesalamine, and methylprednisolone. He had complete disease remission.\n\n【49】With respect to prognosis, the literature suggests that almost all patients with CD have complications; perianal disease is present in approximately 50%. Approximately 40% will develop active disease within the first 3 years, and disease remains inactive over time in only a small percentage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 61 \\]</u>. The majority will require bowel resections and several surgeries. A review showed that 10 years after diagnosis, 85% had the same disease location; however, the initial pattern will change after 25 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 61 \\]</u>. Stenosis or penetrating complications will be found in 60% of patients in the first 5 years, which will require intensive medical treatment (immunomodulatory and/or biological therapy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 61 \\]</u>.\n\n【50】The most recent postoperative abdominal CT scan and colonoscopy revealed disease-free status in the index patient. The index patient is currently receiving a maintenance dose of rectal mesalamine and oral omeprazole treatment. He has been followed every 2 months in the surgical outpatient clinic over the last 16 months with a satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【51】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【52】CD is considered by many as a very rare disease in Africa. It is interesting to know that CD, which affects mainly young adults, may debut at any age. The symptoms of CD may mimic many other abdominal conditions for which medical attention is required. However, it should be kept in mind as one of the causes of acute abdomen, especially in those patients who have a long history of intestinal pathologies whose treatments greatly differ. Establishing an appropriate treatment in order to avoid short- and long-term complications, which may be life-threatening, depends mainly on distinguishing between other inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract and CD. A histopathologically confirmed diagnosis becomes very necessary also because of the emerging evidence that there is an increased risk of adenocarcinoma in patients with CD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The epidemiology is elusive, but splenosis is frequently misdiagnosed as malignant tumors of gastrointestinal, gynecological, or hematological origin before the correct diagnosis is ultimately found. We herein report a rare case of combined, extensive intraabdominal and intrathoracic splenosis initially presenting as pleural mesothelioma.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented with dyspnea and recurring thoracic pain. Initial X-ray and computed tomography scans showed disseminated intrathoracic and intraabdominal lesions. Consequently, thoracoabdominal mesothelioma or a polytopically metastasized cancer of unknown origin was suspected. A thorough examination of the patient’s medical history and contrast-enhanced ultrasound by a skilled examiner revealed the diagnosis of extensive abdominal and thoracic splenosis as a consequence of an abdominal gunshot wound with a ruptured diaphragm several decades earlier. Timely diagnosis by noninvasive measures prevented the patient from potential complications of harmful diagnostic procedures, including nuclear imaging and biopsies. The patient is currently treated for hepatitis C and chronic obstructive lung disease, whereas no specific treatment for splenosis is required.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We present a case of rare intrathoracic and intraperitoneal splenosis mimicking mesothelioma. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and thorough patient history were used for diagnosis and prevented this patient from having to undergo potentially harmful diagnostics. Splenosis can occur after splenic trauma and, consequently, needs to be considered as a rare differential diagnosis to malignant tumors of various origins when a matching patient history is obtained.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Splenosis is the acquired heterotopic autotransplantation of splenic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. It should not be confused with accessory spleens, which is a common, benign, congenital condition that occurs in 10–44% of autopsy cases without a specific medical history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Splenosis, on the other hand, is a comparably rare condition that typically occurs after severe splenic trauma and/or splenectomy. Although its overall epidemiology remains largely unclear, it is reported in 26–76% of patients with a corresponding history of splenic trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. This divergence in case numbers is attributed to the rarely occurring symptoms that accompany the condition. Therefore, splenosis is mostly found incidentally after medical imaging reveals intraabdominal masses. Because splenosis typically presents with multiple, ectopic, intraabdominal foci, it is frequently misdiagnosed as metastatic cancer of gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or gynecological origin, leading to additional and potential harmful diagnostics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In rare cases, splenosis might occur intrathoracically and has thus been misinterpreted as thoracic lymphoma, thymoma, or mesothelioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. To raise awareness for the possibility of disseminated splenosis mimicking cancer of various origins, and to prevent misdiagnosis, we herein report a rare case of combined intraabdominal and intrathoracic splenosis that was diagnosed without invasive diagnostic measures.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented to our hospital with mild dyspnea that had been present for years, and a recurring pain exacerbation in his left thoracic wall. His previous history included intravenous drug abuse, continued smoking for more than 30 years, and untreated hepatitis C infection. When similar symptoms had occurred a few months previously, X-ray scans performed at another hospital showed suspicious masses at the left costal pleura. Therefore, pleural mesothelioma was considered. However, the patient was discharged and did not follow-up on this diagnosis before presenting to us.\n\n【12】After exclusion of myocardial ischemia, our X-ray scans showed the previously described lesions on the left costal pleura 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. A subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed two additional masses in the anterior mediastinum adjacent to the right atrium, measuring 2 and 4 cm in diameter 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a, b)</u> and recapitulated two lesions on the left costal wall measuring up to 5 cm in diameter 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 c)</u>. At this point, pleural mesothelioma, which had already been suspected elsewhere, was a plausible diagnosis.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Chest X-ray at admission.

Coronal ( **a** ) and axial planes ( **b** – **e** ) of the abdominal and pelvic cavities. White arrows indicate masses under the left diaphragm ( **b** , **c** ), between the abdominal wall and liver ( **d** ), and in the pelvic cavity ( **e** )\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】However, we decided to first conduct an extensive interview with the patient that revealed an important, previously unknown part of his medical history: When asked for previous injuries, the patient remembered an incident in the early 1970s. At this time he had engaged in drug trafficking and got involved in an argument about a drug delivery that had not gone as planned. In the course of the argument, our patient suffered an abdominal gunshot wound with extensive injury. Unfortunately, there were no medical reports available from that time due to the patient very rarely visiting a doctor. However, the patient recalled that his spleen and diaphragm were severely damaged and needed surgical repair. Indeed, our CT scans showed that a splenectomy had been performed.\n\n【24】Instead of biopsy, we then utilized contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of the pleural and abdominal masses. On CEUS, a bolus of ultrasound contrast medium containing gas microbubbles is rapidly injected intravenously, followed by another bolus of saline solution for immediate dispersion via systemic circulation. When ultrasound waves are then directed at microbubbles flowing through the organ of interest, the compressible gas cores oscillate and show an increased echogenicity compared with surrounding tissue. Compared with other tissues, splenic tissue has the property to sequester microbubbles from circulation, causing an avid and persistent late-phase enhancement of up to 7 minutes after application, whereas malignant masses are characterized by early wash-out and late-phase hypoenhancement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In our case, the application of sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles revealed circumscribed lesions that showed the characteristic pattern of splenic tissue, with persistent late-phase enhancement unlike malignant masses 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 a, b)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Together with the very specific patient history and the medical imaging we performed, we were now convinced that we found the correct diagnosis and decided on a conservative approach without additional, invasive diagnostic measures. Follow-up examinations after 12 months showed no progress of the lesions, confirming the diagnosis of abdominal and thoracic splenosis based on detailed patient history and CEUS. Importantly, we were able to refrain from diagnostic biopsy, which otherwise might have led to serious complications considering the highly perfused splenotic tissue and the deranged coagulation due to hepatitis C-related liver dysfunction. Since splenosis is a benign condition, no specific treatment was necessary. Instead, treatment for hepatitis C and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was initiated to improve his prognosis and the patient received oral pain medication, which resolved his pleurisy.\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of a splenotic lesion between abdominal wall and liver. Images are taken before ( **a** ) and during persistent (> 4 minutes) late-phase contrast enhancement typical for splenic tissue ( **b** )\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】Discussion\n----------\n\n【29】Due to its preferred occurrence in the abdominal cavity in up to 76% of severe splenic trauma requiring splenectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, splenosis is most frequently confused with tumors of abdominal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Rarely, and only after diaphragmatic damage, has thoracic splenosis been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. As shown here, splenosis may present as disseminated intraabdominal and intrathoracic lesions resembling mesothelioma, advanced malignant tumors, or possibly echinococcosis. Splenotic lesions are usually located in body cavities or on the surface of intraabdominal or intrathoracic structures. However, very few cases of intraparenchymal splenosis have been described, and are usually accompanied by preceding organ damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Common misdiagnoses of splenosis include intraabdominal lymphoma, hepatic, gastrointestinal or gynecological cancers, and endometriosis, and the consequences of misdiagnosis should not be underestimated.\n\n【30】The suspicion of a malignant tumor leads to stress for the patient and might cause a psychological burden, even when ultimately overturned. Moreover, diagnostic measures arising from the suspected diagnosis may lead to serious complications. The hemorrhagic potential of well-perfused and vulnerable splenotic masses is well documented by several case reports of spontaneous and posttraumatic bleeding in the peritoneal and thoracic cavities of patients with splenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u> implicating the necessity for careful evaluation of diagnostic biopsies to prevent complications. On the other hand, these considerations must never lead to delayed diagnosis of malignant tumors, since treatment at early stages leads to substantially improved outcomes compared with later stages. In our case, considering the deranged coagulation of our patient due to hepatitis C-related liver dysfunction, an attempted biopsy of one of the lesions might have led to severe bleeding. Additionally, nuclear imaging utilizing Tc-99m sulfur colloid or Tc-99m-tagged heat-damaged autologous erythrocytes are considered the gold standard to complete the diagnosis of splenosis, but have inherent risks due to radiation exposure. We here want to emphasize the importance of detailed patient history and CEUS as a noninvasive and affordable diagnostic technique that can be used to confirm the diagnosis when performed by an experienced examiner. However, biopsy should be considered when the patient history does not include injury to the spleen of any kind since this seems to be a prerequisite for most cases of splenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Moreover, if follow-up imaging reveals progressive lesions, histological examinations are necessary since malignant tumors need to be ruled out.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【32】We present a case of extensive intrathoracic and intraperitoneal splenosis mimicking malignant tumors in a patient that had suffered splenic trauma in the past. Suitable noninvasive diagnostic tools such as CT scans and CEUS performed by experienced examiners were used for diagnosis, and unnecessary invasive diagnostics were avoided. This case highlights that it is important to consider splenosis as a rare differential diagnosis for malignant tumors of the abdominal and thoracic cavities if there is a matching splenic trauma in the medical history. Thus, patients should be specifically asked for abdominal injuries and splenectomy in their medical history, even decades in the past. However, necessary diagnostics for malignant tumors must not be delayed, especially if there is no typical history of splenic trauma or the lesions are progressive. Follow-up controls and, if necessary, nuclear imaging can be useful to ultimately confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Change history\n--------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>*   ### 13 May 2022\n\n【37】    The Open Access funding by Projekt DEAL was not included in the original publication, this article has been updated.\n    </u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CEUS:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We present a case of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in a patient already diagnosed with, and treated for, granulomatosis with polyangiitis. He was treated successfully with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy for the pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 70-year-old Japanese man had a 3-year history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis that had manifested as multiple nasal nodules, pulmonary cavities, and serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive, necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis. He had taken 15 mg prednisolone and 150 mg of mizoribine per day since the diagnosis. Cyclophosphamide or rituximab was not used. Three years after the diagnosis (at which point the total amount of prednisolone was 17.5 g), he complained of severe back pain and consulted our hospital (Yokosuka General Hospital Uwamachi).\n\n【12】A physical examination revealed that his blood pressure was 143/93 mmHg, pulse rate 93 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16/minute, and body temperature 36.6 °C. His bowel sounds indicated hypoactivity, and his abdomen was distended but without tenderness. Laboratory analysis showed a C-reactive protein level of 12 mg/dl (normal 0 to 0.3 mg/dl) and white blood cell count of 9700/μl. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.378, base excess − 6.0 mmol/L, and lactate 1.1 mmol/L. Computed tomography (CT) showed a large amount of gas located in his abdominal wall, bowel wall, and mesentery 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. It was difficult, however, to rule out the possibility of intestinal perforation or necrosis.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Computed tomography shows a large amount of gas in the abdominal wall, bowel wall, and mesentery ( _arrows_ in axial view ( **a** ) and in coronal view ( **b** )).

Two years before this diagnosis, multiple ulcers had been detected in his colon on the right side 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>, so we surmised that some of these ulcers had developed pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. The day after the exploratory laparotomy, he started HBO therapy at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 90 minutes/day. The treatment duration was 17 days, with 13 sessions.

The presence of plasma cells in the liver or spleen is known to be associated with a more aggressive form of multiple myeloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> that usually requires a heavy treatment with chemotherapy or consolidation therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n【10】Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for EMP, with excellent response rates of approximately 86% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy has been used for approximately two decades to deliver ablative high-dose irradiations to small target volumes and low-dose irradiations to adjacent normal tissue. It plays an increasingly important role in the therapeutic arsenal of primary and secondary liver tumors but, to the best of our knowledge, its use has never been described in the treatment of hepatic plasmacytoma. We present a rare case of hepatic SP that successfully responded to a treatment with Cyberknife®.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 64-year-old white French man had stable monoclonal gammopathy of the immune globulin G (IgG) lambda type (IgG = 1 g/L) with normal bone X-rays. He had no other significant comorbidities, except for diabetes and hypertension. Two years after the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy, he developed cholestasis 10N (10 x normal level) and cytolysis 4N (4 x normal value). Ultrasounds revealed a 4-cm subcapsular nodule involving segment VI of his liver. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple signal anomalies, with hemangiomas and benign cysts and a slightly hyperintense nodule on the T2-weighted image 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a )</u> and T1-weighted image, with arterial phase enhancement 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1b )</u>. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with <sup>18 </sup> fluorodeoxyglucose ( <sup>18 </sup> FDG) revealed an unusual hypermetabolic nodule, with maximum standardized uptake value (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) at 16. An ultrasound-guided biopsy showed numerous plasma cells 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1c )</u> with a strong CD138 staining and low lambda light chain intensity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1d )</u>. A full blood count revealed: hemoglobin 140 g/L, platelets 160 G/L, and leukocytes 5 G/L. All other laboratory parameters including renal function, albumin, beta-2-microglobulin, and calcium were within the normal range. A bone marrow examination and skeletal assessment were normal and a diagnosis of hepatic EMP was made. Surgery was deemed too difficult to perform because of the proximity of the kidney, and standard conformal irradiation was also contraindicated for the same reason and because the lesion was highly mobile due to breathing movements. However, our multidisciplinary team suggested the use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in synchrony mode using implanted fiducials to limit liver toxicity in this patient with a single lesion without bone marrow involvement.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging images and tissue sections at diagnosis. **a** The lesion is hyperintense on the T2-weighted image ( _arrow_ ) **b** and on the T1-weighted image with arterial phase enhancement with a centered hypointense signal in the probably necrotic tissue ( _arrow_ ). **c** Diffuse proliferation of small monotonous round-to-ovoid cells with eccentric cytoplasms and round nuclei with **d** immunohistochemical analysis showing CD138 staining\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】In February 2015, our patient received 30 Gy in five consecutive fractions of 6 Gy, a dose that may be considered biologically equivalent to 40 Gy delivered in 2 Gy per fraction.

Hepatic plasmacytomas without systemic disease have been treated either by chemotherapy (melphalan/steroids or vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone combinations) or by radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Only a few cases of SP treated by fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy have been reported, and our case is the first reported with a hepatic localization.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy use in hepatic SP. The absence of toxicity observed in this unusual observation suggests that other patients with similar presentations could benefit from this treatment modality.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【24】This case shows that stereotactic radiotherapy could be highly effective in localized liver plasmacytoma. The Cyberknife® technology, which combines high precision and surrounding tissue protection, could be an alternative to conventional radiotherapy in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Due to the lack of guidelines and clinical trials, the indication of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of plasmacytoma should be further studied. In our case, the radiographic response was almost complete, safety was satisfactory, and our patient is still asymptomatic after 20 months.

We report a case of TAE with successful outcomes for hemothorax caused by a spinal fracture without obvious arterial injury and extravasation. We also review published case reports of hemothorax caused by spinal fractures.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】An 88-year-old Japanese woman with back pain and headache was admitted to our hospital, but the cause of injury was unclear. Her vital signs were stable (body temperature, 35.8°C; heart rate, 87 beats per minute; blood pressure, 180/90 mmHg; respiratory rate, 20 breaths per minute; percutaneous oxygen saturation, 100% on oxygen 2 L per minute via nasal cannula). She was oriented (Glasgow Coma Scale score, 15) but slightly agitated. CECT showed a massive right hemothorax, reverse Chance-type fracture of the tenth thoracic (T10) vertebra with wide separation of the anterior elements 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>, and mild traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. No obvious arterial injury or extravasation was observed. Computed tomography (CT) also revealed anterior-flowing osteophytes from the eighth thoracic (T8) to second lumbar (L2) vertebra causing diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). The hemothorax was caused by bleeding from the fractured vertebra. We decided to perform angiography and TAE to prevent rebleeding owing to her inability to rest and thoracostomy to rule out arterial injury. A 5-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery, and aortography was performed using a 4-French pigtail catheter. The bilateral tenth intercostal arteries were selected with a 4-French shepherd hook catheter, and a 1.9-French microcatheter (Carnelian Si, Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan) was introduced. Selective angiography revealed small pools of contrast medium in the T10 vertebra, but no arterial injury was observed. The radiculomedullary and anterior spinal arteries were not observed. After coil embolization of the tenth segmental arteries distal to the spinal branch with 0.014-inch pushable coils (C-Stopper, Piolax, Kanagawa, Japan), gelatin sponge particles (Serescue, Nippon Kayaku, Tokyo, Japan) were injected. The segmental arteries were then coil embolized as proximally as possible 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. No complications occurred with these procedures. A chest tube was inserted on the same day as the embolization, and posterior fixation was performed 9 days later. During this time, the hemothorax did not rebleed. The patient was discharged 30 days after admission.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. **A** – **C** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images showing fracture of the tenth vertebra with a right hemothorax but without extravasation or arterial injury. **D** Sagittal bone image showing the reverse Chance-type vertebral fracture with wide separation of the anterior elements of the tenth vertebra (arrow) and anterior-flowing osteophytes from the eighth thoracic to the second lumbar vertebra\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】**Fig. 2**\n\n【16】Angiography of the right tenth intercostal artery. **A** Selective angiography revealed no arterial injury, and no spinal branches were depicted. **B** Pooling of contrast medium (arrows) within the vertebral body was observed in the late phase. **C** Post-embolization angiography showing arterial occlusion and no contrast medium staining and pooling in the vertebra. **D** Digital angiography image taken after embolization of the bilateral tenth intercostal arteries\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】We demonstrated that TAE, a relatively safe procedure, may be an effective strategy to prevent hemothorax rebleeding until surgical spinal fixation is performed. Upon literature review of the PubMed and Ichushi (Japan Medical Abstracts Society) databases, we found 18 cases of hemothorax caused by spinal fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>, the clinical features of which, including our case, are presented in Table 1 .\n\n【20】**Table 1 Clinical features of 19 cases (including our case)**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】Patients with DISH may suffer from hemothorax caused by spinal fracture. At least 8 of the 19 cases had DISH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>, of which 6 were reverse Chance-type fractures on the basis of the descriptions and images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. DISH consists of ossification along the anterolateral aspect of at least four contiguous vertebrae and is common among the elderly. The most commonly affected area in patients with DISH is the lower thoracic spine and thoracolumbar junction, while reverse Chance-type fractures of the lower thoracic vertebrae occur by hyperextension due to mild trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. These events stretch and damage soft tissues including the pleura and are prone to causing complications of hemothorax.\n\n【23】Conservative treatment of hemothorax caused by spinal fractures is difficult. Six of the 19 patients had arterial injuries and required hemostatic procedures such as thoracotomy or TAE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Of the remaining 12 cases (excluding ours) that had no obvious arterial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>, four underwent emergency thoracotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>, two died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and six received conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, all six conservatively treated patients developed worsening hemothorax; four underwent thoracotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>, but one died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In 13 cases, spinal fixation was eventually required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Spontaneous hemostasis was difficult owing to fracture instability and the lack of a compartmentalization effect resulting from insufficient paravertebral hematoma formation due to thoracic cavity perforation. Early stabilization is essential to control bleeding in hemothorax caused by spinal fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, temporary mechanical stabilization such as external fixation is impossible, and conservative treatments fail to control hemothorax until spinal fixation is performed.\n\n【24】In vertebrectomy for spinal tumors, preoperative TAE reportedly reduced intraoperative bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. TAE may also control bleeding from vertebral bodies in hemothorax caused by spinal fractures. In cases where extravasation within the vertebrae is difficult to identify by CECT owing to interference by the bone, angiography may help determine the diagnosis. Thus, we propose a management algorithm for hemothorax caused by spinal fractures 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【25】**Fig. 3**\n\n【26】Management algorithm for hemothorax caused by spinal fracture. _CECT_ contrast-enhanced computed tomography, _TAE_ transcatheter arterial embolization\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】TAE is a relatively safe procedure for hemothorax caused by spinal fractures. Spinal cord ischemia is the most serious complication to be avoided in this procedure. The Adamkiewicz artery originates from the T7 to L2 vertebrae in 95% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>, and is the preferred site for spinal fractures that cause hemothorax. The complication can be prevented by ensuring a lack of blood supply to the spinal cord by angiography before embolization and selection of appropriate embolic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 19 \\]</u>. However, a few cases of complications related to spinal cord ischemia due to embolization of unrecognized radiculomedullary arteries have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Magnetic resonance imaging or CT angiography can identify > 90% of the Adamkiewicz artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. There was one case report in which CT during angiography was reported as useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. These diagnostic methods should be considered to prevent spinal complications.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】TAE was recently recognized as a good treatment option for arterial injury. However, it may also be an effective bridge to spinal fixation and/or an alternative to thoracotomy in case of hemothorax caused by spinal fractures in the absence of an obvious arterial injury.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TAE:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transcatheter arterial embolization</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CECT:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thoracic spine</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>L:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Lumbar spine</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DISH:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The case was surgically managed under spinal analgesia. The mother and her newborn were discharged on the fourth postprocedure day.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Neglected and inappropriately managed postpartum vulvar hematoma can cause significant maternal morbidity; therefore, timely surgical exploration, ligation of bleeding vessels, and obliteration of dead space can avert severe maternal complications\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】According to the World Health Organization (WHO), maternal near miss (MNM) is defined as “a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In Ethiopia, for every woman who dies from pregnancy-related causes, 12–21 others experience maternal near miss (MNM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]</u>. One of the causes of MNM is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The major causes of PPH are uterine atony, genital tract laceration, retained tissues (placenta and membranes), and coagulopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Vulvar hematoma is among genital tract traumas that cause PPH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】A vulvar hematoma is a collection of blood in the vulva 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The vulva is soft tissue mainly composed of smooth muscle and loose connective tissue and is supplied by branches of the pudendal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The venous drainage is provided by labial veins, and labial veins drain into the external and internal pudendal veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. This vulvar vasculature commonly develops varicosities during pregnancy, especially in parous women, due to increased venous pressure created by the increasing weight of the uterus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Damage to labial branches of the internal pudendal artery in this vascular network easily initiates hematoma development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Postpartum vulvar hematomas cause maternal morbidities such as anemia, postpartum hemorrhage, superinfection, necrotizing fasciitis, prolonged hospitalization, and need for transfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Here we present, a case of postpartum vulvar hematoma as the cause of MNM.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】This is a 28-year-old para IV mother from rural Ethiopia who gave birth to an alive female neonate weighing 3000 g at home 24 hours before presentation. She did not remember her last normal menstrual period (LNMP) but claimed to be amenorrheic for 9 months. She had antenatal care (ANC) at a nearby health center where she had routine investigations and care during pregnancy. During the last antenatal visit, she was told to come to the health center when she feels labor pains. However, her labor advanced within 6 hours of the onset of labor pain. She gave birth normally at home with the assistance of traditional birth attendants. The mother reported that there was neither difficulty with delivery of the placenta nor excessive bleeding during and after delivery. She noticed gradual swelling of her right vulva that was associated with vulvar pain. Due to the worsening of these complaints, the family took her to nearby hospital. At this hospital, evacuation of vulvar hematoma (6 cm × 8 cm) was done. The managing team evacuated 500 ml of hematoma and referred the patient to Wollega University Referral Hospital (WURH) for blood transfusion.\n\n【14】Upon arrival to WURH, the patient was re-evaluated by the charge resident physician and consultant gynecologist, and obstetrician. The mother reported vaginal bleeding from the vulva on her way to WURH, significant swelling of the vulva, and vulvar pain. She had difficulty with micturition. She also complained of palpitation, easy fatigability, vertigo, and headache. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or bleeding tendency.\n\n【15】On examination, she was acutely sick-looking. Her vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate (PR) 136 beats per minute, respiratory rate (RR) 22 breaths per minute, and temperature 37.1 °C. She had dry buccal mucosa and pale conjunctivae. Lymph glandular system, chest, and cardiovascular system were normal. Abdominal examination showed a 20-week-sized uterus that was well contracted and nontender, and the bladder was distended. There were no signs of fluid collection or organomegaly. On genital examination, there was a 12 × 20 cm right-sided vulvar mass extending to the mons pubis and posteriorly to the right buttock 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The mass was tender and fluctuant. There were two stitches applied to it. However, there was bleeding from this site. There was no active vaginal bleeding or vaginal and cervical tear. She exhibited palmar pallor. On neurologic examination, she was oriented to time, person, and place. She had normal reflexes and no neurologic deficits. With the final diagnosis of severe anemia secondary to postpartum hemorrhage secondary to a vulvar hematoma, she was admitted to the obstetric ward. At admission, she was investigated and the results were as indicated in Table 1 .\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】Postpartum spontaneous vulvar hematoma managed at Wollega University Referral Hospital, Western Ethiopia, 2021\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Table 1 Summary of laboratory investigations of the case of postpartum spontaneous vulvar hematoma managed at Wollega University Referral Hospital, Western Ethiopia, 2021**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】The patient was prepared and taken to the operation room. Under spinal analgesia, through a previous incision made at referring hospital, about 700 ml of clotted blood was evacuated from vulvar hematoma. The actively bleeding vessels were identified and ligated. Then, the wound was sutured in three layers. The site was observed for bleeding and vulvar swelling. A hemostatic gauze was used for further compression and removed after 12 hours. The patient was transferred to ward where she was transfused with two units of compatible blood. On the fourth postprocedure day, the patient was discharged with ferrous sulfate and appropriate advice on vulvar care.\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】This is the case of maternal near miss in rural Ethiopia. The major causes of maternal near-miss events are obstetric hemorrhages, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, difficult labor and delivery, sepsis, complications of abortion, and uterine rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. This patient presented with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) secondary to spontaneous vulvar hematoma. It is an unusual cause of PPH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. The other causes of PPH such as uterine atony retained tissue, coagulopathy, and genital tract laceration were excluded from patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigation. A huge postpartum vulvar hematoma explained the patient’s condition. The hematoma was severe enough to cause maternal shock and severe anemia. This patient could have died had she not been aggressively managed with intravenous fluid, blood transfusion, and surgical intervention.\n\n【24】Postpartum vulvar hematomas are rare events in modern obstetrics. Their magnitude varies from 1 per 300 to 1 per 15,000 deliveries. It can be classified into obstetric and non-obstetric vulvar hematomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Postpartum vulvar hematomas most frequently result from genital tract laceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> or improper hemostasis during the repair of perineal tears or an episiotomy wound. Failure to take precautions while suturing the apex of the episiotomy may result in a large vulvovaginal hematoma due to the distensible nature of the tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Postpartum spontaneous vulvar hematomas are rare events. They result from injury to blood vessels in the absence of laceration or incision of the surrounding tissue (such as pseudoaneurysm and traumatic arteriovenous fistula) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 13 \\]</u>. They usually follow precipitate labor, macrosomic babies, prolonged second stage of labor, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, coagulopathy, or vulvar varicosities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 10 , 11 , 14 \\]</u>. In our case, the total duration of labor was only 6 hours, which might have been the triggering factor. It occurred spontaneously after home vaginal delivery. It is observed that most spontaneous vulvar hematomas are right-sided vulvar hematomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> as in our case. This may be due to dextrorotation of the uterus, which might cause vulvar varicosities.\n\n【26】The pathogenesis of vulvar hematomas is due to iatrogenic injury to blood vessels and/or spontaneous rupture resulting in various symptoms such as vulvar swelling, vulvar pain, and urologic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 \\]</u>. Our patient presented with vulvar swelling, vulvar pain, and difficulty with urination. As bleeding into the vulva is largely restricted only by the Colles fascia and the urogenital diaphragm, a hematoma in this area is visible as tender fluctuant mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> as in our case.\n\n【27】Vulvar hematomas may develop within hours after delivery or be initially misdiagnosed as vulva swelling or edema until the delayed formation of the hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 14 \\]</u>. Early recognition is paramount in reducing the associated morbidity, improving patient outcomes, and shortening the length of hospital stay. Delay in recognition and management may result in adverse consequences and increase maternal morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 11 , 14 \\]</u> as in our case.\n\n【28】The management of vulvar hematomas depends on the size of the hematoma, hemodynamic stability of the patient, availability of medical resources, and duration of the hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 14 , 16 \\]</u>. Smaller and chronic vulvar hematomas can be conservatively managed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> including the use of sitz baths, ice packs, empiric antibiotics, pain medication, and/or blood transfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 14 \\]</u>. However, large and rapidly expanding hematomas, as in this case, are managed by surgical techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 11 \\]</u>. The surgical management can be surgical exploration or selective arterial embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The surgical exploration consists of incision and drainage of the hematoma, ligation of the bleeding vessels, and packing or placement of drainage tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Our patient was managed by a similar approach. However, the primary treating hospital did not place a vaginal pack or drainage tube. As a result, the patient was having ongoing active bleeding from the incision site on the way to the referral hospital. This made the patient develop a recurrent huge hematoma. Therefore, optimal management of vulvar hematomas includes surgical exploration, ligation of bleeding vessels, obliteration of the dead space and placing pack in the vagina, placing drainage tube, or applying pressure over it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 14 \\]</u>. The surgical exploration also prevents pressure necrosis of the surrounding tissue and decreases the risk of infection and necrotizing fasciitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Sometimes, however, a surgical repair may fail or a recurrent hematoma can be formed, as in our case. In such cases, selective arterial embolization is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】Neglected and inappropriately managed postpartum vulvar hematoma can cause significant maternal morbidity; therefore, timely surgical exploration, ligation of bleeding vessels, and obliteration of dead space can avert maternal complications\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ANC:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Antenatal care</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CBC:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Complete blood count</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HBsAg:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatitis B surface antigen</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LNMP:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Last normal menstrual period</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCH:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular hemoglobin</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCV:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular volume</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MNM:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Maternal near miss</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PPH:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Postpartum hemorrhage</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RBC:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Red blood cell</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RBG:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Random blood glucose</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VDRL:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Venereal Disease Research Laboratory</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cell</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WUR:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Wollega University Referral Hospital</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, arthritis accompanied by pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone is an extremely rare case, and to the best of our knowledge, isolated arthrodesis for this situation has not been previously described in any published reports.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The patient was a 39-year-old Japanese man. He had complained of pain in his left middle foot since a fall from his motorcycle six months previously. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone.

We performed an isolated arthrodesis of the talonavicular joint with two 6.5 mm cancellous screws. One year after the operation, radiographical bone union had been obtained, and the patient reported no pain and complete satisfaction with the result.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Isolated talonavicular arthrodesis is one of the effective procedures for the treatment of traumatic talonavicular arthritis with pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone both in providing pain relief and functional improvement.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Osteoarthritis of the talonavicular joint caused by inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and pes valgus deformity has been commonly described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, but osteoarthritis occurring as a result of fracture of the navicular bone is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

He had fallen from his motorcycle and was unable to remember the precise mechanism of injury. He visited his local hospital where he was diagnosed with a navicular fracture and treated with a short-leg cast for six weeks. He was referred to our institution because of nonresolution of his prolonged foot pain six months after the initial injury.\n\n【14】Physical examination revealed that his left foot was slightly swollen, but the skin color was normal and there was no local heat on his instep. Blood tests did not indicate infection or inflammatory disease. There was tenderness over his middle foot, and he had active toe plantar flexion and dorsal flexion without restriction. Injections of lidocaine on the navicular bone resulted in temporary resolution of pain. Radiographs and CT scans revealed that navicular bone union had not been obtained and the fragments were atrophic. There was also associated incongruity of the cuneonavicular joint 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 and 2 )</u>. T1-weighted MRI showed low-signal intensity on the lateral fragment, and T2-weighted MRI revealed high-signal intensity on the talonavicular joint and a slightly ragged joint cartilage, and a homogenous high-signal intense cystic lesion in the talus 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u>. We suspected there was avascular necrosis of the navicular bone fragment, and primitive osteoarthritis of the talonavicular joint because of the preserved joint space.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】**Radiographs at the time of presentation showed atrophic bones and non-union of navicular fragments** . **(A)** Lateral radiograph. **(B)** Oblique radiograph.\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】**Computed tomography scans at the time of presentation** . **(A)** Axial image. **(B)** Coronal image.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Figure 3**\n\n【22】**Preoperative magnetic resonance images.

The gap of pseudarthrosis was filled with soft tissue and there was no movement between the two fragments. The talonavicular joint capsule was opened widely to expose the articular surfaces of the talar head and proximal navicular. The articular cartilage was damaged and partially eburnated. After opening the joint capsule we removed the remainder of the cartilage from the articular surface of the talar head and navicular bone by roughening the subchondral bone using a shaver and chisel. Compression and fixation of the talonavicular joint were achieved using two 6.5 mm partially threaded cancellous screws (SYNTHES), which were both inserted in a distal- to- proximal orientation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 4 )</u>. Postoperatively, a short leg cast was applied for six weeks. Progressive weight-bearing as tolerated was allowed after removing the cast.\n\n【25】**Figure 4**\n\n【26】**Postoperative radiographs showed fixation with two screws** . **(A)** Anteroposterior radiograph. **(B)** Lateral radiograph.\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】The patient was followed clinically and radiographically at regular intervals, and one year after the operation, joint fusion was radiographically obtained, and he reported no pain or disability 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 5 )</u>.\n\n【29】**Figure 5**\n\n【30】**Lateral radiograph at one year after the operation showed completely united talonavicular joint** .\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】Discussion\n----------\n\n【33】There are few cases in the literature describing the result of isolated talonavicular arthrodesis in patients with traumatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. Most of the literature addresses patients with either inflammatory arthritis or adult acquired flat foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 – 11 \\]</u>. Main reported that the fracture of navicular was caused by shearing forces between the cuneiforms and the talar head, and triple arthrodesis was effective for persistent symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> while Chen maintained that isolated talonavicular arthrodesis provided both pain relief and functional improvement in traumatic arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】In our case, images revealed aspects of osteoarthritis of the talonavicular joint and pseudarthrosis of the navicular bone, and we suspected lidocaine penetrated to the talonavicular joint and the gap of pseudarthrosis. Therefore, we thought the middle foot pain was caused by both osteoarthritis and pseudarthrosis and we planned to perform both a fixation of the navicular bone fragments and arthrodesis of the talonavicular joint. In fact, the gap of navicular pseudarthrosis was filled with soft fibrous tissues. However, no abnormal mobility between navicular bone fragments was identified. In the talonavicular joint, the articular surface was partially eburnated, and osteophyte and bone cyst were found. We concluded that the middle foot pain was derived from osteoarthritis of the talonavicular joint, and performed isolated arthrodesis for the talonavicular joint. However, if abnormal mobility had existed between the two fragments of the navicular bone, we would have performed not only arthrodesis of the talonavicular joint but also fixation of the navicular bone fragments or additional bone transplantation. As a result, three months after the operation, the patient felt no middle foot pain and was able to return to work as a bus driver. One year after the operation, radiography showed that the talonavicular joint was fully fused.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】Isolated talonavicular arthrodesis is one of the effective procedures for the treatment of traumatic talonavicular arthritis due to an ununited navicular bone without abnormal movement both in providing pain relief and functional improvement.\n\n【37】Consent\n-------\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Upon detection of the injured cell content, mast cells then tailor the release of preformed and newly produced chemical mediators to the detected challenge, via an array of pathogen receptors. In addition to immunoglobulin E receptor-triggered mast cell activation, commonly referred to as allergic or atopic disorders, non-immunoglobulin E receptor mediated mast cell activation follows engagement of toll-like receptors, immunoglobulin G receptors, and complement receptors.

The mast cell compartments must return to a baseline steady state to remain tolerant towards self-antigens and harmless entities, including environmental conditions, to prevent unnecessary immune activation and chronic hypersensitivity disorders. Over the past 50 years, an increasing number of patients are experiencing episodes of aberrant mast cell activation, not associated with allergen-specific mast cell disease or systemic mastocytosis.

Scombroid toxicity is usually a self-limited illness, but there are individuals who have been shown to have severe symptoms or persistent illness following histamine fish poisoning. We describe a 74-year-old Caucasian woman, with a history of drug-induced urticaria, who developed a constellation of hypersensitivity illnesses consistent with the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome after ingestion of tainted fish.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Mast cell activation disease causes problems of increased complexity in children and adults. The increased prevalence and severity of mast cell activation disease has been attributed to dramatic changes in our lifestyles and modern living environments. These changes likely impact the integrity of the epithelial barriers, leading to loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment. Here, we present a case of a nonatopic, 74-year-old female who developed mast cell activation disease after exposure to a potent environmental toxin. Mast cell activation disease commonly involves several organ systems, with patients often referred to a succession of different specialists. This results in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal care. Instead, early recognition of mast cell activation disease would lead to better outcomes. We review the literature, describing the diagnostic criteria for mast cell activation disorders that can improve recognition of this multiorgan system syndrome. Further research is needed into the interaction of epithelial barrier disruption and the dysregulation of the immune system.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Case report\n-----------\n\n【9】### Background\n\n【10】Mast cells are closely associated with epithelium, serving as sentinels responsible for the recognition of tissue injury and coordination of the initial inflammatory response. Upon detection of the injured cell content, mast cells then tailor the release of preformed and newly produced chemical mediators to the detected challenge, via an array of pathogen receptors. In addition to immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor-triggered mast cell activation (MCA), commonly referred to allergic or atopic disorders, non-IgE mediated mast cell activation follows engagement of toll-like receptors (TLRs), immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptors, and complement receptors. Upon containment of the extrinsic challenge, acute inflammation is downregulated, and repair of the injured tissue ensues. The mast cell compartments must return to a baseline steady state, to remain tolerant towards self-antigens and harmless entities, including environmental conditions, to prevent unnecessary immune activation and chronic hypersensitivity disorders.\n\n【11】Over the past 50 years, an increasing number of patients are experiencing episodes of aberrant mast cell activation, not associated with allergen specific mast cell disease or systemic mastocytosis. This led to proposed diagnostic criteria of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). MCAS is a heterogeneous disorder, defined by a combination of 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> recurrent symptoms typical of MCA, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> an increase of validated mast cell-derived mediators, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> response to treatment with mast cell stabilizing or MC mediator-targeted therapies. Onset of MCAS ostensibly reflects the loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment to nonthreatening entities and nonhazardous environmental conditions. The etiology of chronic mast cell dysregulation and associated intolerance to self-antigens or harmless entities is not well understood, but a growing number of studies point to exposure of the epithelial borders, which leads to inappropriate or excessive mast cell activation or impaired resolution of acute inflammation following neutralization of the identified pathogen.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 74-year-old Caucasian woman, with a past medical history of arrhythmia, breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy, an acoustic neuroma, menopause, hypothyroidism, and chronic musculoskeletal complaints, presented to the emergency department (ED) with intense redness of her face and hands, burning sensation involving her face and neck, palpitations, a “pounding headache,” difficulty breathing, dysphagia, and a rapid heart rate. Her illness began shortly after eating a tuna burger from a local fish market. She denied previous incidents of food intolerance or anaphylaxis. In the past, the patient had only used prescription or over-the-counter antihistamines for drug induced urticaria, opiate pain relievers, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both pain relievers had been avoided for years.\n\n【14】Upon arrival in the ED, her vital signs were body temperature of 97.0 °F (36.1 °C), pulse of 120 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg, oxygen concentration of 99% on room air, and a respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute. She also reported chest pain, with a level of 5/10. On physical examination, she was found to have an erythematous facial rash and complained of diffuse itching. The patient was administered prednisone 60 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg, with relief of her headache, rash, chest pain, and pruritis. In addition, an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, at 107 bpm, and she was ultimately diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia. No other laboratory tests were ordered. Two samples of the tuna steak were obtained from the local fish market, which sickened four adults with scombrotoxinism. The samples contained histamine levels of 500 ppm and 4850 ppm, both greater than the threshold of less than 50 ppm deemed nontoxic by federal regulation. Since both the patient and her husband exhibited allergic-like reactions to the tuna burger, scombroid poisoning was suspected.\n\n【15】Unlike her husband, who was treated and recovered from this episode of scombrotoxinism, the patient experienced persistent urticaria and angioedema, with the diagnosis of new onset dermatographism, following completion of the 5-day course of oral prednisone and diphenhydramine from the initial ED visit. Despite the use topical corticosteroids and daily levocetirizine 5 mg, loratadine 40 mg, and fexofenadine 180 mg, the patient experienced daily symptoms, for the next 6 weeks. The patient returned to the local emergency department for persistent facial swelling and difficulty swallowing following ingestion of crab cakes for dinner, which had been tolerated in the past. The patient reported difficulty swallowing, sensation of food getting stuck, increased throat clearing, and nasal congestion, as well as numbness and tingling of the tongue, lips, and throat. In the local ED, the patient was found to have a body temperature of 98.2 °F (36.8 °C), a pulse of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 140/65 mmHg, oxygen concentration of 98% on room air, and a respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute. On physical examination, an erythematous facial rash was reported, and the patient was evaluated by an otolaryngologist in the ED, given new onset dysphagia. The otolaryngologist reported erythema of the laryngeal mucosa. The patient was discharged with a course of famotidine 20 mg, prednisone 40 mg, and diphenhydramine 25 mg.\n\n【16】Following this visit to the ED, the patient underwent an evaluation by a local allergy specialist. Recurrent urticaria was noted, and laboratory tests revealed the following: total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) of 16 IU/mL; total complement level within normal limits; undetectable serum IgE for insect venoms, tuna, and crab; undetectable autoantibodies to nuclear antigen (ANA); a negative recommended avoidance of all seafood.\n\n【17】The patient sought another opinion with our practice, regarding chronic urticaria and new onset shellfish allergy, 1 month after her last ED visit and 6 months after scombroid poisoning. She had continued her regimen of thrice daily histamine receptor-1 blockade and famotidine 20 mg twice daily. In addition to the recurrent flushing, rhinitis complaints, dyspepsia, and episodic dysphagia, the patient cited chest tightness at rest, in the evening, and on exertion. Spirometry revealed an obstructive pattern consistent with reversible airway disease, which exhibited a modest improvement following administration of levalbuterol 0.63 mg/3 mL. Another set of laboratory tests were ordered, with the following results: serum tryptase of 4.8 and a serum IgE 17 IU/mL, which were comparable to previous results, but a plasma histamine level of 13 nmol/L was detected (normal range 0–8 nmol/L) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【18】**Table 1 Results of serial testing of tryptase and histamine between 2014 and 2015**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】The patient maintained a limited diet, given her history of new onset shellfish allergy, and carried an epinephrine autoinjector and a short-acting beta agonist inhaler for the anaphylaxis and asthma, respectively. The patient opted for treatment with omalizumab for chronic urticaria, and was prescribed 300 mg, administered every 4 weeks, since she was still symptomatic despite thrice daily antihistamines, twice daily leukotriene modifiers, and oral and inhaled cromolyn preparations.\n\n【21】Following her first dose of omalizumab, the patient complained of increased pruritis, flushing, and chest tightness, prompting another ED visit. The patient required epinephrine administration for a grade two, drug-induced anaphylactic event. Following another course of oral corticosteroids and diphenhydramine, the patient underwent a graded challenge to omalizumab. Over a 3-month period, omalizumab 150 mg, administered every 2 weeks, was successfully reintroduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> . As recently reported, the addition of omalizumab, is the standard care for patients with MCAS.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of MCAS in this patient, following scombroid poisoning, is supported by detection of increased mast cell derived mediators. Following anaphylaxis, to crab meat and then to the first administration of omalizumab, we tested for validated markers of mast cell activation within a few hours of each suspected MCA event 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. An elevated serum histamine level was detected following ingestion of crab meat and her first omalizumab administration. After her third episode of anaphylaxis, serum histamine returned to baseline, but serum tryptase also reduced to 2.2 μg/mL from her previous recorded values, which ranged from 4.8 to 5.2 μg/mL. Along with the constellation of recurrent symptoms of mast cell activation, including chronic urticaria, asthma, and susceptibility to anaphylaxis, and a partial response to histamine and leukotriene blockade, the detection of an elevated plasma level following episodes of anaphylaxis, and a reduction of serum tryptase of greater than 2 μg/mL and > 20%, led to the diagnosis of nonclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【23】**Table 2 Proposed criteria for mast cell activation syndrome (all three criteria must be present) (Akin, 2017)**\n\n【24】Full size table\n\n【25】Upon reaching the maintenance dose of omalizumab 150 mg, every 2 weeks, the patient was able to expand her diet and reduce her daily medical regimen to control her asthmatic condition and chronic spontaneous urticaria. In addition to omalizumab, the patient is maintained on daily levocetirizine, chlorpheniramine, zafirlukast, and famotidine. Moreover, under ongoing treatment her quality of life was improved, including less disrupted sleep, resumption of outdoor exercise, reintroduction of food stuffs, except seafood, and less frequent urticarial outbreaks.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Over the past 50 years, there has been a rise in classic mast cell activation disorders, such as rhinitis, food hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, urticaria, and asthma, as well as less well known MCAD, such as neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal syndromes. A growing number of pediatric and adult patients are experiencing recurrent episodes of MCA, not associated with allergen-specific mast cell activation disease or systemic mastocytosis. This led to proposed diagnostic criteria of mast cell activation syndrome, which includes the following: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> systemic mast cell activation involving two or more organ systems, in parallel; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> an increase in validated mast cell markers during symptomatic episodes; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> having a major response to medications that block MCA or inhibit the action of MC-derived mediators 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>. The diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is appropriate, when all three criteria are met 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2 , 3\\]</u> .\n\n【28】Mechanisms contributing to rise of mast cell activation disorders, including MCAS, have not been established. Studies have implicated environmental exposures from modern living leading to excessive mast cell-initiated acute inflammation, or impaired resolution of inflammation following neutralization of the offending agent. This case report demonstrates the onset of MCAS in a 74-year-old woman following exposure to scombrotoxin.\n\n【29】Scombroid poisoning, or histamine fish poisoning, is a toxic event with symptoms and treatment that mimic anaphylaxis. Scombroid poisoning results from consumption of mishandled fish. Histamine and other decomposition products are generated in time-temperature abused raw fish by bacterial, enzymatic conversion of free histidine. The onset of scombroid poisoning is typically from 10 minutes to 1 hour following consumption of poisonous fish. The symptoms are variable and include peppery or metallic taste, oral numbness, headache, dizziness, palpitations, rapid and weak pulse (low blood pressure), difficulty in swallowing, and thirst. Scombroid poisoning often mimics allergen-specific IgE-triggered mast cell activation, with symptoms such as hives, rash, flushing, facial swelling, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Less specific symptoms such as anxiety are less frequently observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> .\n\n【30】Recovery is usually complete within 24 hours, but in rare cases can last for days. For example, serious cardiovascular compromise and respiratory complications have been observed, and in a few unusual cases, hospitalization, including treatment for anaphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5 , 6\\]</u> . There are two reports of patients developing chronic mast cell activation disorders following scombroid poisoning: after ingesting decomposed tuna, a 21-year-old woman, with a history of intermittent asthma, developed poorly controlled asthma, requiring multiple ED visits and five daily medications to control new onset, severe persistent asthma. Another woman, without a history of MCADs, was diagnosed with adult-onset rhinitis and asthma following scombroid poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7 , 8\\]</u> .\n\n【31】Scombroid poisoning is associated with elevated histamine levels in the outbreak-associated samples. However, there is not a clear dose-response relationship between oral administration of histamine and the magnitude of toxicity associated with scombroid poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> . Interestingly, several studies point to the impact of “histamine releasing factors” on the epithelium and closely associated mast cells, by enteric, gram-negative bacteria found in the fish cutis and intestines. These include _Escherichia coli_ , _Klebsiella_ species, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , and _Morganella morganii_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> . As reported in animal models of anaphylaxis and asthma, loss of tolerance in the mast cell compartment can be induced by exposure to chemical adjuvants and microbial-derived substances, such as aluminum hydroxide and lipopolysaccharides, respectively 9 , 10 , 11\\] . Combined with signals of tissue injury, called alarmins or damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the microbial-derived substances are potent stimulants of mast cell activation.\n\n【32】With this patient, the reportedly high levels of histamine detected in the two samples of tuna from this seafood market greatly exceeded the level of histamine deemed toxic by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more than 50 mg/100 g of tuna (50 ppm). Such high levels of histamine ostensibly reflect the burden of scombrotoxins, which in turn induced epithelial damage and delivered large quantities of histamine to the poisoned diners of the tainted fish. That is, the combination of histamine and histamine release factors, scombrotoxins, may have either severely disrupted the epithelium border and consequently caused a pronounced MCA event, or interfered with the processes that resolve inflammation after the acute insult has been neutralized. Three of the four adults with scombroid poisoning made a full recovery within 24 hours with conservative medical management. In contrast, our patient, with a distant history of drug-induced urticaria, required daily medication for adult-onset spontaneous inducible urticaria/angioedema, hypersensitivity gastroenteritis, and moderate persistent asthma, starting in the seventh decade of life. In addition to diet restriction, including avoidance of seafood, gluten, cow’s milk, soybean, and nuts, she must carry an epinephrine autoinjector and short-acting beta agonist inhaler given her history of anaphylaxis and intrinsic asthma exacerbations, following scombroid poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> .\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】In summary, we describe the clinical presentation of a presentation of MCAS following scombroid poisoning. The diagnosis is appropriate given her combination of 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> typical symptoms, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> laboratory abnormalities, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> response to treatment. Following scombroid poisoning, adult-onset chronic urticaria/angioedema evolved into susceptibility of anaphylaxis, chronic hypersensitivity gastroenteritis, and moderate persistent asthma. Symptomatic episodes were associated with an elevation in validated mast cell markers, both serum tryptase and histamine, and her symptoms came under better control with the addition of omalizumab, the anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, to her daily regimen of cromolyn antihistamines and leukotriene blockade. Despite the rise of immediate hypersensitivity disorders, it is not uncommon for MCAS to be diagnosed late, as observed with our patient. This leads to delayed recommendations for more effective treatment prescriptions of medications, with adverse effects; both of which may contribute to progressive disease. As recently described, the greatest hurdle to diagnosis and management of MCAS is to correctly attribute appropriate symptoms to this disorder, and timely measurement of validated mast cell activation markers. The latter will differentiate MC activation disorders from other syndromes with overlapping symptomology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12 , 13\\]</u> . This case also provides insight into potential etiologies and risk factors for development of MCAS.\n\n【35】Mast cell dysregulation can be due to a mutation affecting homeostasis of the mast cell compartment, clonal MCAS (mastocytosis, hyper alpha tryptasemia), or extrinsic factors driving aberrant MCA. Although the etiology of this newly recognized hypersensitivity syndrome is unknown, the course of events leading to adult-onset MCAS in this patient points to the disruption of the epithelial barrier by scombrotoxins. This, in turn, disrupted the tight regulation of this tissue-based, innate immune cell population, and increased susceptibility to mast cell activation events. Animal models and epidemiological studies support this theory of recurrent or severe injury to the epithelium in susceptible children and adults leading to development of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity syndromes: disruption of the epithelial barrier leads to loss of regulation of the mast cell compartment. This, in turn, leads to increased susceptibility of unnecessary inflammation, from impaired barrier function, and implicates the use of therapeutics targeting epithelial–mast cell interactions in preservation or restoration of immune homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10 , 14\\]</u> .\n\n【36】Availability of data and material\n---------------------------------\n\n【37】The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MC:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mast cells</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCAS:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mast cell activation syndrome</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TLR:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Toll-like receptors</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IgR:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Immunoglobulin receptors</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CR:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Complement receptors</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ARDS:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PAMPs:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pathogen associated molecular pattern</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>POTS:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>hEDS:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hypermobile type Ehlers–Danlos syndrome</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PID:</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Primary immunodeficiency</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACE2:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DAMPs:</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Damage-associated molecular patterns</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The condition is self-limiting, yet commonly misdiagnosed. Here we report a case of a patient with severe neck pain and odynophagia initially misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess before establishing the correct diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Caucasian man presented to an outside emergency department with a 5-day history of neck pain and odynophagia. The neck pain was severe and aggravated by movement. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. Computed tomography of his neck soft tissues was initially interpreted as a retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary care center for further evaluation and treatment. On physical examination, the patient’s neck range of motion was significantly diminished, and bilateral neck tenderness was present. An otolaryngologist performed an examination with laryngoscopy, the result of which was unremarkable. A radiologist at our facility interpreted his outside magnetic resonance imaging as showing “calcification in the prevertebral muscles at C1-C2, inflammation with edema of the prevertebral muscles, and retropharyngeal space edema/effusion,” consistent with acute calcific longus colli tendinitis. His antibiotics were discontinued, and he was started on intravenous ketorolac. He had significant improvement in his neck range of motion, and his pain diminished greatly. He was discharged on a 10-day course of diclofenac (50 mg three times daily). At 1-week follow-up, the patient was doing well; he had returned to work, and his pain was well controlled.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This case report details the presentation, characteristic radiographic findings, and management of a patient with an extremely rare condition of neck pain and odynophagia that could be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is a noninfectious inflammatory process secondary to the “deposition of amorphous calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the tendons of the longus colli muscle,” most commonly anterior to the C1–C2 vertebral level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Symptoms commonly include neck pain, limited cervical range of motion with neck stiffness, and odynophagia. The condition is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.50 cases per 100,000 person-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Due to its rarity, acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is often misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess, herniation, neck tumor, or associated with trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Here, we report a case of severe neck pain and odynophagia initially misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess at an outside hospital before the correct diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis was established.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 60-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tobacco use, solitary pulmonary nodule, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department as a transfer from an outside facility for further evaluation of neck pain concerning for retropharyngeal abscess based on imaging and clinical presentation. He presented with a 5-day history of sudden-onset neck and postauricular pain that occurred at rest. The pain was constant and was rated 9 on a 10-point numeric pain scale (0 = no pain; 10 = most severe possible pain). His pain intensity was amplified by neck movement. He also endorsed a 4-day history of sore throat and odynophagia associated with a change in voice quality. Two days prior to his presentation, he was evaluated at his local primary care clinic and was diagnosed with “right neck strain and spasm with probable cervical radiculopathy” and suspected bacterial pharyngitis. He was treated with rest, ice, ibuprofen, and cyclobenzaprine. For the suspected bacterial pharyngitis, he was prescribed a 10-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate.\n\n【12】The following day, he presented to an outside emergency department due to progression of symptoms. Laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis of 13,000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> and elevated C-reactive protein of 44.3 mg/L. The results of his basic metabolic panel (including sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels) and lactate measurement were normal. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ culture, and rapid group A _Streptococcus_ test results were all negative. Blood cultures were drawn. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed no acute intracranial findings. CT of the neck soft tissue was initially interpreted as showing a 1.1 × 5.6–cm retropharyngeal abscess with enlarged palatine tonsils, and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) initially confirmed a 1 × 7.1 × 3.2–cm prevertebral abscess. He was started on piperacillin/tazobactam and was administered 6 mg of morphine intravenously, followed 2 hours later by 100 μg of fentanyl intravenously. This reduced his pain from 9/10 to a 5/10. The patient was transferred to our tertiary referral center for formal otolaryngology evaluation and possible surgical intervention.\n\n【13】Following transfer to our facility’s emergency department, laryngoscopy was performed by an otolaryngologist, and the findings were unremarkable. The otolaryngologist reviewed the imaging and felt that the retropharyngeal fluid collection was unlikely to be infectious, owing to the lack of rim enhancement. The diagnostic images were also reviewed by members of the spine surgery service, who felt the findings were not consistent with an epidural abscess or infection involving the spine. However, given the lack of diagnostic clarity, intravenous antibiotics were continued, and the patient was admitted to the general medical service.\n\n【14】On admission, the patient’s physical examination was notable for significantly diminished range of motion of his neck in all directions, and there was tenderness to palpation of his neck laterally. Oropharyngeal examination was difficult secondary to body habitus (Mallampati class IV); however, no abnormalities were detected.\n\n【15】His outside images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 and 2 )</u> were reviewed by the radiology team at our facility. They stated that CT of the patient’s neck soft tissue exhibited a “retropharyngeal effusion, less likely abscess given \\[the\\] lack of \\[a\\] thick wall or rim enhancement.” The patient’s MRI scan was reviewed as exhibiting “acute calcific longus colli tendinitis with 1 cm calcification in the prevertebral muscles at C1-C2, inflammation with edema of the prevertebral muscles, and retropharyngeal space edema/effusion.”\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】CT of soft tissues of the neck shows a hyperdensity from calcium deposition in the longus colli muscle at the level of C2 (blue arrow)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】MRI T2 Fat Saturated sequence of cervical spine shows high-signal intensity in the soft tissues representing inflammatory edema of the prevertebral muscles and elongated retropharyngeal effusion (blue rectangle)\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Following diagnosis of acute calcific longus colli tendinitis, the medical team discontinued antibiotics and dexamethasone and started the patient on intravenous ketorolac while he remained an inpatient. After starting the ketorolac, he had significant improvement in neck range of motion in all directions, and his pain diminished greatly. He was discharged on a 10-day course of oral diclofenac 50 mg three times daily. His blood culture results remained negative after 5 days of inoculation.\n\n【23】At one-week follow-up, he was able to return to work, and minimal neck stiffness was reported. His pain was adequately controlled with the oral diclofenac.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Acute calcific longus colli tendinitis is a rare, noninfectious inflammatory condition that involves deposition of calcium crystals in the longus colli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The mechanism of calcium deposition is largely unknown; however, it may be secondary to repetitive trauma, recent injury, tissue necrosis, or ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Patients with acute calcific longus colli tendinitis typically have severe neck pain with limited neck range of motion that is accompanied by odynophagia and headache. In a recent case series published in 2017, the majority (62.5%) of patients were males in their fifth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. However, in a separate case analysis of ten patients, only three were male 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The age range was 26–68 years, with a mean age of 46.6 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】CT findings of calcium deposition in the longus colli muscle with retropharyngeal edema are sufficient to diagnose acute calcific longus colli tendinitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. MRI examination can also make the diagnosis with findings of calcium deposition, edema, and nonenhancing retropharyngeal effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is usually made by CT of the neck soft tissue, which is ordered with the clinical presumption of pharyngitis to rule out abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In the setting of retropharyngeal abscess, the fluid will rim enhance and be rounded in shape. In noninfectious retropharyngeal effusion, the fluid will not enhance and will be elongated. In the setting of infectious spondylodiscitis/osteomyelitis, the disc will enhance, the vertebral body endplates will have erosions, and there may be an epidural abscess.

Alagille syndrome (OMIM #118450) is a multisystem disorder that is defined clinically by hepatic bile duct paucity and cholestasis, in association with cardiac, skeletal, and ophthalmologic manifestations, and characteristic facial features. Alagille syndrome is caused by mutations in _JAG1_ on chromosome 20 or _NOTCH2_ on chromosome 1. Here, we report a preterm infant with karyotype 46,XX,der通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>t通用删除7(英):<u>(5,6)</u>(p15.2;p22.3) and hepatic dysfunction, who was diagnosed as having incomplete Alagille syndrome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】The Japanese infant was diagnosed based on the cardiac abnormalities, ocular abnormalities, characteristic facial features, and liver pathological findings. Analysis of the _JAG1_ and _NOTCH_ sequences failed to detect any mutations in these genes.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】These results suggest that, besides the genes that are known to be responsible for Alagille syndrome, other genetic mutations also may cause Alagille syndrome.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The 5p-syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality syndrome that is associated with partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. The prevalence of the 5p-syndrome is 1 in 50,000 live births. Low birth weight (< 2500 g), growth retardation, and a high-pitched cat-like cry during the neonatal period and infancy have been observed in children with the 5p-syndrome. Hypotonia, moderate to severe mental retardation, and characteristic facial features such as microcephaly, round face, interocular separation, and low-set ears have also been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Partial trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 6 is a rare chromosomal abnormality, with < 50 cases reported worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Characteristic phenotypes include low birth weight, developmental delay or growth retardation, mild to severe craniofacial abnormalities, eating disorder, recurrent respiratory infections, congenital heart disease, and renal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Alagille syndrome (AGS) is characterized by five main clinical abnormalities: liver dysfunction (cholestatic jaundice caused by paucity of bile ducts), cardiac abnormalities, spine anomalies, eye abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. Patients with these five clinical features are diagnosed with complete AGS, and patients with three or four of the features are diagnosed with incomplete AGS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.The prevalence of AGS is 1 in 70,000 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Hepatic disorders such as AGS with 5p monosomy or 6p trisomy have not been reported so far. The main clinical features of 5p monosomy, 6p trisomy, and Alagille syndrome are presented in Table 1 . Here, we report an infant with 5p monosomy and 6p trisomy, complicated by refractory liver failure.\n\n【13】**Table 1 Clinical features of 5p monosomy, 6p trisomy, and Alagille syndrome**\n\n【14】Full size table\n\n【15】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【16】The patient is a Japanese female infant who is the second child of a healthy non-consanguineous 34-year-old mother and 35-year-old father. The infant has a healthy sister, and the family history is unremarkable. The mother was admitted to the Center of Maternal, Fetal, and Neonatal Medicine, Hospital of the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan at the end of the 31st week of gestation, because the pregnancy was complicated with severe symmetrical fetal growth restriction, decreased fetal movement, and dilatation of patent ductus venosus. The preterm infant was born by cesarean section at the 32nd week of gestation because of severe decrease in fetal movement. The infant had respiratory distress with Apgar scores of 5 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, respectively, and required neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Thus, the patient was intubated after birth and was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. At birth, the infant’s weight, length, and head circumference measurements were 995 g \\[± 3.4 standard deviation (SD)\\], 34 cm (± 3.3 SD), 26.7 cm (± 1.6 SD).\n\n【17】To investigate the cause of the fetal growth restriction, we checked the infant for congenital TORCH infections ( _Toxoplasma gondii_ , rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and _Treponema_ ), but none were found.\n\n【18】The patient’s face was characteristic (hawknosed, micrognathia, interocular dissociation) and the cry was cat-like. The chromosome G-banding analysis and cytogenetic fluorescent _in situ_ hybridization analysis showed that the infant had a karyotype of 46,XX,der通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>t(5;6)(p15.2;p22.3) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The patient’s parents agreed to undergo chromosome analysis after genetic counseling. The chromosome analysis showed that the mother’s chromosome was normal, whereas the father’s chromosome showed reciprocal translocation as 46,XY,t(5;6)(p15.2;p22.3).\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】Chromosome G-banding and cytogenetic fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) show a deletion on chromosome 5p15.1-pter and additional 6p22.3 fragments on chromosome 5p and karyotype of 46,XX,der通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>t(5;6)(p15.2;p22.3), respectively\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】The patient had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and left mild ventriculomegaly was detected by ultrasound. Tube feeding was started at day 1 after birth. The patient was treated with indomethacin at 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 days old for hemodynamically significant PDA. The PDA closed at 21 days old and no side effects of indomethacin were detected. However, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and direct bilirubin gradually increased from birth. The infant excreted a white-ish stool at 15 days old. Mutations in _JAG1_ on chromosome 20 or _NOTCH2_ on chromosome 1 are known to cause AGS. Therefore, we analyzed the _JAG1_ and _NOTCH_ sequences to detect mutations that can cause liver dysfunction, but no such mutations were found. We analyzed the bile acids and no abnormal bile acids were found. We performed magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to elucidate the etiology of cholangiolitic hepatitis and found that the structures of the patient’s liver, gallbladder, and bile duct were normal, but a congenital portosystemic shunt was observed. The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and phenobarbital, but her condition got worse after treatment. Furthermore, the PDA reopened when the patient was 25 days old.\n\n【23】Because the cause of the cholangiolitic hepatitis was unclear, we performed a liver biopsy. The pathological findings showed the patient had cholestatic liver disease with abnormal portal triad, compatible with AGS. We suspected that the patient had AGS-like or incomplete AGS. The patient’s hepatic condition worsened, the aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and direct bilirubin levels were very high (peak values were 500 U/l, 326 U/l, and 19.0 mg/dl, respectively), and a blood coagulation disorder was discovered. The only treatment was liver transplantation, and therefore the patient was transferred for transplantation. PDA banding was required for the transplant, but the operation caused pulmonary bleeding and the infant died at 190 days old.\n\n【24】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【25】We found that unbalanced reciprocal translocation between 5 and 6p (5p monosomy and 6p trisomy) may cause cholangiolitic hepatitis and AGS-like.\n\n【26】The 5p-syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality caused by deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. The size of the deletion varies from the whole short arm to 5p15.3 (5–40 Mb) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Clinical features include a high-pitched cat-like cry, microcephaly, facial features, and severe psychomotor and mental retardation. Approximately 80% of 5p-syndromes are _de novo_ deletions, and approximately 10–15% are due to a parental translocation. The father of the patient in this study has reciprocal translocation (t(5;6)(p15.2;p22.3)).\n\n【27】Partial 6p trisomy is a rare chromosomal abnormality with variable phenotypes, including low birth weight with developmental delay or growth retardation, mild to severe anomaly of the face, eating difficulties, recurrent respiratory infections, congenital heart defects, and renal abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The 5p monosomy and 6p trisomy have never been reported to have conjugated bilirubinemia, elevation of liver enzymes, or defects in biliary excretion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. The 5p monosomy that has been reported in many clinical reports may have a very low frequency of hepatic disorders. The 6p trisomy is a very rare chromosomal abnormality that also has not been associated with hepatic disorders. We suspect that the hepatic disorder such as AGS may be caused by unbalanced reciprocal translocation between 5 and 6p. Generally, unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements impact gene expression through a variety of different mechanisms. Chromosome rearrangements, both near to and far from breakpoints, can affect gene expression. Therefore, relocations can disrupt normal interactions not only at the derivative chromosomes, but also at other chromosomes, and affect gene expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】AGS is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with abnormalities of the liver, heart, eye, and skeleton and a characteristic facial appearance. Syndromic bile duct paucity and arteriohepatic dysplasia, which are also observed in AGS, are significant causes of neonatal jaundice and cholestasis in older children.\n\n【30】AGS is characterized by reduction in the number of bile ducts on biopsy, leading to the obstruction of biliary flow (cholestasis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In our patient, the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and direct bilirubin levels were elevated from birth, but the MRCP showed that the structures of the gallbladder and common bile duct were normal, and no biliary atresia was found. The bile acid analysis found no inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. The comprehensive genetic analysis for bile stasis disease did not identify any known genetic abnormalities, and the open liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The pathological findings showed hypoplasia of the interlobular bile ducts 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 A)</u>, changes similar to giant cell tumor of hepatocytes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 B)</u> and anomaly of blood vessels 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 C)</u>.\n\n【32】**Fig. 2**\n\n【33】Liver biopsy images showing cholestatic liver with abnormal portal triad. **A** Paucity of interlobular bile duct. **B** Changes similar to giant cell tumor of hepatocytes. **C** Anomaly of blood vessels\n\n【34】Full size image\n\n【35】Congenital heart disease has been reported in up to 90% of patients with AGS. The most common cardiac defect is peripheral pulmonic stenosis. Other reported cardiac defects include tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The most common skeletal abnormality is butterfly vertebrae, and ophthalmological findings include posterior embryotoxon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. The range of facial features seen in patients with AGS include a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes with moderate hypertelorism, pointed chin, and saddle or straight nose with bulbous tip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Other symptoms of AGS include renal anomalies, mental retardation, and delayed physical growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 \\]</u>. No vertebral abnormalities were detected in our patient, but other cardiac abnormalities, ocular abnormalities, and characteristic facial features were observed. Because our patient had a histologically proven decrease in intrahepatic bile ducts, with at least three of the five main clinical abnormalities that characterize AGS, she was diagnosed with incomplete AGS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. In this patient, the phenotype was not representative, and therefore the liver biopsy was useful in confirming the diagnosis of AGS, even though liver biopsy is an invasive procedure.\n\n【36】AGS is caused by mutations in _JAG1_ or _NOTCH2_ ; _JAG1_ mutations have been identified in 94–96% and _NOTCH2_ mutations have been identified in 1–2% of patients with AGS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>. The analysis of our patient’s DNA did not detect mutations in _JAG1_ or _NOTCH_ . To the best of our knowledge, four clinical reports of infants with AGS, who were found to have Williams syndrome, have been published. These infants were clinically diagnosed with AGS, but microarray analysis detected deletions at 7q11.23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. We did not perform a whole genome analysis, but we speculate that incomplete AGS may be caused by a deletion at 5p15.2 and/or an insertion at 6p22.3. Our findings suggest that, besides the genes known to be responsible for AGS, one or more other genes can also cause the clinical features of AGS. To confirm this speculation, it is necessary to accumulate data of other patients with AGS in the future.\n\n【37】To conclude, we found that a patient with 5p monosomy and 6p trisomy had an abnormal liver structure, similar to AGS. The patient’s phenotype was uncharacteristic, and liver biopsy was found to be useful for AGS diagnosis, even in neonates. No mutations were detected in _JAG1_ and _NOTCH2_ but the patient had at least three of the five main clinical abnormalities that characterize AGS, thus she was diagnosed with incomplete AGS. Besides the genes known to be responsible for AGS, other genetic mutations also may lead to AGS.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AGS:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Alagille syndrome</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Here we report the unusual case of a patient who suffered from acute optic neuropathy following hemispherical subdural hematoma. Although confirmed up to now only through necropsy studies, our case strongly suggests a local, microcirculatory deficit identified through magnetic resonance imaging _in vivo_ .\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 70-year-old Caucasian German who developed a massive left hemispheric subdural hematoma under oral anticoagulation presented with acute, severe visual impairment on his left eye, which was noticed after surgical decompression. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations indicated sinistral optic neuropathy with visual acuity reduced nearly to amaurosis. Ocular pathology such as vitreous body hemorrhage, papilledema, and central retinal artery occlusion were excluded. An orbital lesion was ruled out by means of orbital magnetic resonance imaging. However, cerebral diffusion-weighted imaging and T2 maps of magnetic resonance imaging revealed a circumscribed ischemic lesion within the edematous, slightly herniated temporomesial lobe within the immediate vicinity of the affected optic nerve. Thus, the clinical course and morphologic magnetic resonance imaging findings suggest the occurrence of pressure-induced posterior ischemic optic neuropathy due to microcirculatory compromise.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Although lesions of the second cranial nerve following subdural hematoma have been reported individually, their pathogenesis was preferentially proposed from autopsy studies. Here we discuss a dual, pressure-induced and secondarily ischemic pathomechanism on the base of _in vivo_ magnetic resonance imaging diagnostics which may remain unconsidered by computed tomography.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Unilateral optic neuropathy (ON) following subdural hematoma has been confirmed by necropsy studies. In these studies, microcirculatory compromise of the optic nerve was proven as a pathogenic mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In this case report, diffusion-weighted images (DWI) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed signal alteration in the ipsilateral optic nerve as a strong evidence for the development of microvascular deficit. Thus, our case is in line with results from autopsies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case presentation that demonstrates microvascular impairment with optic neuropathy _in vivo_ .\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 70-year-old Caucasian man of German nationality receiving warfarin therapy for the primary prevention of chronic atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital due to symptoms of a coronary syndrome. An initial international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7 was elevated to therapeutic ranges (INR = 2.5). Three days later, the patient was found comatose after a first-ever generalized seizure. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) revealed a subdural hematoma measuring 16 mm at its maximum thickness and covering almost the entire left convexity which caused a massive midline shift 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1A )</u>. Rapid cerebral MRI of the same day depicted a beginning ipsilateral uncal herniation towards the chiasmatic cistern 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1B )</u>. Immediately after INR normalisation, surgical evacuation of the subdural hematoma and decompressive craniectomy were performed without any complications.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】**Computed tomography of subdural hematoma and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging depicting early uncal herniation and mesiotemporal ischemic brain injury** . **(A)** Preoperative cranial computed tomography scan reveals space-occupying subdural hematoma covering the left convexity. The hematoma causes a considerable midline shift at the level of the lateral ventricles. **(B)** Early diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging) depicts a slight uncal herniation and a midline deviation at the level of the chiasmatic basal cistern. **(C)** Diffusion-weighted imaging sequences four days after surgery show circumscribed signal hyperintensity in the left uncal region indicative of local ischemic injury. Note the close anatomic proximity to the distal prechiasmatic course of the left optic nerve. **(D)** Corresponding hyperintensity in T2-weighted images indicates edema of the left temporomesial lobe that is consecutive to hypoperfusion and residual to preceding uncal herniation.\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Two days after extubation and recovery from anaesthesia, the patient complained of severe sinistral visual loss. Neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations confirmed a severely reduced visual acuity on his left eye with concomitant afferent pupillary defect. A normal vascular fundoscopy and the lack of papilledema led to the working diagnosis of posterior ON. Four days after the surgery, a follow-up DWI of the cerebral MRI 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1C )</u> showed a signal hyperintense lesion within the left lateral, mesiobasal temporal lobe that was immediately adjacent to the distal prechiasmatic course of the affected optic nerve. Dull signal attenuation in corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and gadolinium enhancement in T1 (not shown) led to the diagnosis of a subacute cerebral ischemic event.\n\n【16】The corresponding hyperintensity of T2-weighted images indicated focal brain edema in line with regional hypoperfusion and the preceding uncal shift 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1D )</u>. Thus, pathomorphologic and sequence-specific MRI criteria suggest a primary mechanic compression followed by secondary microcirculatory impairment of the afflicted brain area. In support of this hypothesis, DWI alterations were not manifest at the initial MRI diagnostics. Although not directly proven by MRI but due to its close anatomic course and the temporal coincidence of optic nerve affliction, an equal dual pathomechanism was believed to be the cause of the appearance of ON. Further cerebral or orbital pathologies were not apparent (not shown). Within weeks, the patient was released for rehabilitation without further visual improvement.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】To date, only a few cases of ON following subdural hematoma are presented, and their pathomorphologic _in vivo_ findings do not at all elucidate its aetiology. Generally, reports do not present the existence of papilledema or of radiologic _in vivo_ evidence of optic nerve compression by mass effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In contrast, autopsy studies confirm optic nerve necrosis that is remote from space occupying lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The pathophysiology of ON has been discussed in the context of diverse aetiological events, and adequate diagnostic approaches have already been proposed. Table 1 provides an overview of selected publications focussing on key diagnostic means to identify and characterize vascular, mechanical, and pharmacologic aetiologies of ON 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【20】**Table 1 Overview of the different aetiologies of optic neuropathy.**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】At present, only a few cases refer to the diagnostic value of MRI in ON. By means of MRI, unilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> and simultaneous bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> ischemic ON were diagnosed. It was concluded that DWI and ADC maps of MRI may be useful in detecting ischemia of any white matter tracts that are disparate from the brain and spinal cord. MRI diagnostics may even prove suitable in distinguishing ischemic events from optic neuritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, while also providing the opportunity to simultaneously detect anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION). Likewise, MRI venography in relation to DWI and ADC maps unequivocally confirmed that ON can be caused by cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Using the MRI technique, we now provide a pathophysiologic insight on ON following space occupying subdural hematoma early _in vivo_ . Radiological signs of herniation were discrete, although highly sensitive MRI revealed a mechanic, pressure-induced brain lesion of the mesiobasal temporal lobe in proximity to the affected optic nerve. However, focal ischemic injury was missed in detecting basal brain shift by CT. Since MRI pathologies fulfilled the criteria of ischemic compromise, we suggest that the local increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) exceeded the perfusion pressure of both structures, namely the formation of the uncus and the nearby passing optic nerve. Consistent with this notion of a microcirculatory deficit, the lesion did not follow the characteristic extent of a vascular territory.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【25】We suggest that rare cases of acute ON following subdural hematoma are due to local pressure-induced optic nerve infarction. This pathomechanism may remain neglected when massive brain shift is lacking or when CT is the only diagnostic means. The use of serial MRI may help balance the discrepancy between the paucity of clinical reports and frequent neuropathological findings of anterior visual pathway damage in space-occupying brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Consent\n-------\n\n【27】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

In 2016, the so-called Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma, formerly known as the oxyphilic variant of the follicular thyroid carcinoma, was reclassified by the World Health Organization as a separate pathological entity, which accounts for approximately 3% of all thyroid cancers. Although Hurthle cell thyroid carcinomas are known for their more aggressive tumor biology, metastases are observed in a minority of cases, and long-term survival can be expected. However, disseminated disease is often associated with poor outcome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In the presented case, a 63-year-old Caucasian female was incidentally diagnosed with Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma after undergoing hemithyroidectomy for a nodular goiter. Following completion thyroidectomy, two courses of radioactive iodine therapy were administered. After 4 years of uneventful follow-up, the patient gradually developed metastases in five different organs, with the majority representing unusual sites, such as heart, kidney, and pancreas over a course of 14 years. The lesions were either treated with radioactive iodine therapy or removed surgically, depending on iodine avidity.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Follicular and Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma are known to potentially spread hematogenously to typical sites, such as lung or bones, however; unusual metastatic sites as presented in our case can also be observed. A search of the literature revealed only scattered reports on patients with multiple metastases in unusual locations. Furthermore, the observed long-term survival of our patient is contradictory to the existing data. As demonstrated, recurrent disease may appear years after the initial diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of consistent aftercare. Radioactive iodine therapy, extracorporeal radiation therapy, and surgical metastasectomy are central therapeutic components. In summary, our case exemplifies that thorough aftercare and aggressive treatment enables long-term survival even in recurrent Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma displaying unusual multisite metastases.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Thyroid carcinomas are responsible for approximately 1–2% of all malignant tumors. They are divided into differentiated (DTC) and nondifferentiated or anaplastic carcinomas. In addition, medullary thyroid carcinoma originates from calcitonin-producing cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】DTC include papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid cancers. Together, these two entities account for 80–90% of all primary thyroid malignomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u> and are associated with a favorable prognosis and relatively low mortality rates, respectively. This feature is primarily attributed to effective targeted therapy regimes: a combination of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Hurthle cell carcinomas (HCTC) were originally defined as oxyphilic or oncocytic variant of FTC, and account for 3% of all thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In 2016, however, new findings led to a reclassification by the World Health Organization as a separate pathological entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】DTC differ not only in their histopathological structure, but also in their metastatic pathways. The majority of PTC metastasizes within the locoregional cervical and mediastinal lymphatic compartments, whereas patients suffering from FTC or HCTC primarily display hematogenous dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. It is assumed that FTC and HCTC are based on an adenoma-carcinoma sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The distinction between benign adenoma and malignant carcinoma is based on the histopathological occurrence of capsular or vascular invasion. There are different subtypes of FTC or HCTC, such as the minimally or the broadly invasive type, with the latter being associated with a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. In addition to the invasion status, a distinction is also made by the grade of differentiation.\n\n【12】In general, FTC is known to metastasize less often than PTC. Metastatic lesions are mainly observed within the lungs, the bones, and the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. HCTC shows similar metastatic patterns, although some authors report a trend to more frequent distant lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, there are only scattered reports of patients suffering from HCTC and multiple unusual site metastases. Hence, data on therapeutic strategies and (long-term) prognosis are lacking.\n\n【13】Case report\n-----------\n\n【14】We report the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian female patient who was incidentally diagnosed with an oxyphilic variant of a minimally invasive FTC (syn. Hurthle cell carcinoma; HCTC) after undergoing left hemithyroidectomy with subtotal resection of the contralateral side for a nodular goiter in January of 2007. In line with current guidelines, thyroidectomy of the right side was completed and lymphadenectomy of the central cervical lymphatic compartment was performed in February 2007. The initial tumor formula was pT2, pN0 (0/6), cM0 with an oxyphilic phenotype. Subsequently, the patient received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy (March 2007: 4.8 GBq; July 2007: 7.4 GBq). Unstimulated serum thyroglobulin (TG) concentration before the second course of RAI therapy was 2.2 µg/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(shown in Fig. 1 )</u>. The follow-up period of 4 years did not reveal clinical symptoms or other signs of tumor relapse. In June 2011, we observed an increase in TG concentration of 13.0 µg/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) detected a mediastinal mass with increased tracer uptake, which was further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing enlarged thoracic lymph nodes. Accordingly, RAI therapy was repeated in August 2011 (7.0 GBq). Shortly afterwards, stimulated TG concentrations increased again to 43.9 µg/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Further PET-CT showed focal tracer uptake between esophagus and thoracic aorta, which was interpreted as lymphatic metastases. Hence, regional lymphadenectomy and pericardiectomy were performed in January 2012 via lateral thoracotomy. Of the eight lymph nodes removed, none was positive for the known HCTC, and the TG concentration persistently increased. In August 2012, unstimulated TG was 170.0 µg/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Eventually, we decided to perform a cardiac MRI, revealing a pediculated mass located within the right atrial septum 通用删除1(英):<u>(shown in Fig. 2 )</u>. In November 2012, a postoperatively confirmed HCTC metastasis was surgically removed from the right atrial septum via pericardial patch plastic. Only 6 months after the procedure, the unstimulated TG concentration was still increased at 48.3 µg/L 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. PET-MRI showed a further metastasis located within the pancreatic body 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Thus, we performed a distal pancreatectomy in June 2013. Afterwards, another uneventful follow-up period of 3 years occurred. In August 2017, PET-MRI was performed because of a newly increasing unstimulated serum TG concentration, revealing metastases within the right lung and right deltoid muscle 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Ratio of thyroglobulin (TG) to thyrotropin (TSH) \\[µg/mU\\] at selected points in time during follow-up.

Because of its small size, the muscular metastasis was initially left untreated.\n\n【22】In 2018, follow-up was unremarkable except for the known metastasis of the deltoid muscle, which remained stable in size. Unstimulated TG concentrations were elevated but stable. A year later, in May 2019, another PET-CT was carried out because of an increasing unstimulated TG concentration (112.0 µg/L) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The scan revealed a new metastasis of the right upper pulmonary lobe apart from the metastasis within the deltoid muscle. In addition, we detected a rapidly progressive metastasis located in the upper pole of the right kidney 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. RAI therapy (7.4 GBq) was performed. The pulmonary metastasis showed a good response, and the renal metastasis could not be visualized on postinterventional scintigraphy, but still observable on CT and PET-CT. After an interdisciplinary discussion, surgical removal of the upper pole of the right kidney and the no longer iodine-avid lesion of the deltoid muscle was performed in January 2020. In both locations, the pathological findings confirmed metastases of the known HCTC.\n\n【23】Now, almost 1 year after the last surgery, the patient is in good general condition and her quality of life is excellent. Unfortunately, unstimulated TG increased over the last few months 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. A PET-CT scan revealed two new small pulmonary metastases in the right upper and left lower lobe 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Together we decided on a “wait-and-see” strategy. Follow-up imaging is planned in 3 months.\n\n【24】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【25】In this case, we present the history of a patient suffering from an oxyphilic variant of a minimally invasive FTC, now known as HCTC. HCTC was long considered as an aggressive variant or subtype of FTC. In 2016, the World Health Organization reclassified HCTC as a separate pathological entity, although histological distinction of FTC and HCTC is particularly difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Clinically, the HCTC is regarded as more aggressive and lethal than FTC, especially in older research articles. However, more recent work contradicts these assumptions. Nagar _et al_ . were able to demonstrate that HCTC and FTC have a similar mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. It should be mentioned that the strict separation between FTC, PTC, and HCTC has only established itself internationally over the last 5–10 years. In the work of Cipriani _et al_ . the histopathologic results of more than 60 FTC-cases from 1965 to 2007 were reviewed retrospectively by three pathologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The majority of the original classifications had to be corrected. Similar findings were reported by a Japanese workgroup after reviewing more than 440 FTC cases. Only 45% of the originally as FTC classified thyroid cancers were confirmed as such on the basis of current diagnostic criteria and genetic and histological techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. In summary, much of the early work on both FTC and HCTC has to be interpreted with caution since a reliable discrimination of both entities seems uncertain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. In our patient, we observed metastases in different organs and soft tissue (that is, lung, heart, kidney, pancreas, and skeletal muscle) over a period of more than 14 years. Retrospective analyses have reported that 1–3% of all DTC display distant disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 18 \\]</u>. Although reports of patients experiencing more than three metastatic sites are scarce, Hugen _et al_ . reported that over 60% of all patients with metastasized DTC have multiple metastases, corroborating our findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. However, this was an autopsy study, and some of the included patients were not diagnosed with a thyroid malignancy during their lifetime, limiting the applicability of these results. In most cases, multiple metastases can be found within the lung and the bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Distant metastases and especially the involvement of multiple organs are risk factors for increased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 21 \\]</u>. Although we also observed recurrent pulmonary metastases, the majority of the lesions represented rather unusual metastatic sites such as the pancreas, the heart, or the kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 , 24 \\]</u>. A South Korean study investigated 38,772 patients with DTC, which were further divided into three groups: no metastases (38,361 patients; 97.94%), usual site metastases (392 patients; 1.01%), and unusual site metastases (19 patients; 0.05%). Contrary to our report, only six patients of the latter group experienced lesions in more than one unusual metastatic site. Furthermore, most of these patients were diagnosed with PTC, and the median survival (68 months) was markedly inferior to the observed survival of our patient (more than 168 months) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. A meta-analysis by Paspala _et al_ . which included 11 patients with pancreatic metastases from thyroid carcinoma revealed an even worse median overall survival of only 37.6 months as opposed to the data presented in our report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Stojadinovic _et al_ . reported on a cohort of 260 patients with metastasized DTC in which one-third of all patients displayed multisite metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>, confirming data reported by Yoon _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Prognostic factors for favorable outcome were female gender, radiological detection of metastases without clinical symptoms, a long disease-free interval between primary diagnosis and metachronous metastases, and young age. Apart from the latter, all of these factors were observed in our patient, partially explaining the excellent long-term survival. In a Japanese study of 106 individuals with metastasized FTC, disease-specific survival after 15 years was only 23.9%. Patient age was reported to be the most significant predictive factor for survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u>. In contrast, despite the advanced age of our patient, she was able to withstand her disease for more than 14 years.\n\n【26】Equally important to the mentioned prognostic factors is a thorough and lifelong follow-up (including physical examination, ultrasound, radioiodine scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging including <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG PET) and the combination of RAI therapy and radical surgery, in non-iodine-avid metastases. In patients not eligible for surgery, less invasive approaches such as microwave ablation or extracorporeal radiation and even multiple kinase inhibitors such as lenvatinib or sorafenib are effective alternatives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 27 , 28 , 29 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Furthermore, the presented case serves as an example of a structured interdisciplinary concept: Over the years, six different departments (radiology, nuclear medicine, cardiothoracic surgery, urology, trauma and orthopedic surgery, and visceral and endocrine surgery) participated in diagnostics and treatment. Experienced endocrine surgeons together with nuclear medicine practitioners should preside over such concepts as they are most familiar with the course of disease, possible changes in tumor biology and behavior, and surgical and conservative treatment modalities. A vital part in their cooperation is a lively discussion. Over the past few years, tumor boards became a strong and valid tool in tumor therapy. They improved the optimization of therapeutic decision-making and helped us to conquer different cancers, including thyroid malignomas, more sufficiently. Our report shows that recurrent disease in patients with HCTC does not preclude long-term survival if modern concepts of tumor aftercare and therapy are ensured.\n\n【28】The strength of this case report lies in the long follow-up of over 14 years and the durability in the treatment team. The patient was continuously cared for by the same experienced endocrine surgeon and nuclear practitioner. Furthermore, the patient showed a high level of compliance and adhered to the prescribed aftercare plans as well as the treatment suggestions. The limitation of this case report typically lies in the exclusive consideration of only one case. Additionally, the diagnostic uncertainty between the different thyroid carcinoma entities is an important fact.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used in this case report are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DTC:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Differentiated thyroid carcinoma</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FTC:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Follicular thyroid carcinoma</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HCTC:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RAI:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Radioactive iodine</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TG:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Thyroglobulin</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnet resonance imaging</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PET:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positron emission tomography</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用删除4(英):<u><sup>18 </sup></u> F-FDG:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fluorodeoxyglucose ( <sup>18 </sup> F)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, ocular lesions rarely present as initial symptoms. Herein, we describe a rare case of interferon-α-induced sarcoidosis with uveitis as the initial symptom, and present a review of the relevant literature.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】This case involved a 62-year-old-Japanese woman with a history of a combination treatment of pegylated interferon-α-2a, ribavirin, and simeprevir, after which she developed granulomatous panuveitis. She was subsequently diagnosed with sarcoidosis following histological examination of skin biopsy specimens. In addition to reporting this case, we performed a literature review of 27 cases (24 case reports) of histopathologically diagnosed interferon-α-induced sarcoidosis published between January 2009 and November 2018.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Among the reviewed cases, 23 (85.1%) cases developed skin lesions and 19 (70.1%) had lung lesions. Only three cases (11.1%) had accompanying eye lesions. Interferon-α therapy was discontinued in 16 cases (52.9%), and the majority exhibited improvement after systemic corticosteroid treatment. There are few reported cases of interferon-α-induced sarcoidosis with uveitis as the initial symptom. However, if uveitis develops during or after interferon-α treatment, it might represent an initial symptom of interferon-α-induced sarcoidosis, as observed in the present case.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Interferon (IFN) is an important therapeutic agent for treating chronic hepatitis C. There have been an increasing number of reports on the development or exacerbation of sarcoidosis lesions in recent years due to IFN therapy. It is well established that cell-mediated immunity by T-helper type-1 (Th1) cells is involved in the development of sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. However, a Th1/T-helper type-2 (Th2) imbalance due to IFN administration and a shift to Th1 may also result in disease development, although the mechanism is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.

She did not report any significant family or psychosocial history. From October 2014 to March 2015, she was on the following three-drug combination regimen: pegylated IFN-α-2a (180 μg/week for 24 weeks), ribavirin, and simeprevir. Subsequently, combination therapy with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir was administered from July 2016 to September 2016. In November 2016, she presented with blurred vision in the right eye and was diagnosed with anterior uveitis. Her condition improved after the topical administration of corticosteroids at a nearby eye clinic. In January 2017, she developed panuveitis in the left eye. She was treated with topical corticosteroids but without any relief. Hence, she was referred to our hospital for the treatment of blurred vision. At her first visit, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes and her intraocular pressure was 16/15 mmHg. There was no inflammation in the anterior chamber, although a tent-like peripheral anterior synechia was observed in both eyes. Chorioretinal exudates and optic disc hyperemia were observed in the right eye, whereas vitreous opacity, retinal periphlebitis, chorioretinal exudates, and retinal hemorrhages were observed in the left eye 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a)</u> Fluorescein angiography revealed significant fluorescein leakage from the retinal vein and hyperfluorescence consistent with the exudates in the periphery of the left fundus 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b)</u> No macular edema was observed on optical coherence tomography.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Imaging findings of a 62-year-old woman with interferon-induced sarcoidosis and uveitis. **a** Fundus photograph of the left eye shows vitreous opacity, chorioretinal exudates (arrowheads), and retinal hemorrhage (arrows). **b** Fluorescein angiography of the left eye shows fluorescein leakage from the retinal vein and hyperfluorescence consistent with the exudates\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The patient’s blood count and angiotensin-converting enzyme level were normal \\[20.6 U/mL (normal range 7.0–25.0 U/mL)\\]; however, her soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor level was high \\[1214 U/mL (normal range 145–519 U/mL)\\]. The patient tested positive for hepatitis C virus antibody, whereas she was negative for anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 antibody; she also had a negative syphilis test and IFN-γ release assay (for tuberculosis). On chest computed tomography, swelling of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and numerous nodular lesions in the bilateral middle lung lobes and from the middle lung regions to the pleural surface were detected 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Gallium-67 scintigraphy showed increased radiotracer accumulation in the bilateral hilar region and mediastinum, as well as light accumulation in both thighs.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Chest computed tomography.

No noncaseating granuloma were observed on transbronchial lung biopsy. At the beginning of February 2017, a skin eruption appeared in the right femoral region, which increased in size progressively. Histological examination of a skin biopsy sample revealed noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The vitreous opacity in the left eye deteriorated despite betamethasone phosphate instillation. In May 2017, the patient received sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection in the left eye, which improved the vitreous opacity. Cataract surgery for each eye was performed in April and September 2018, and the inflammation had not exacerbated when this report was written. The pulmonologists in our hospital continued her follow-up without treatment, considering that the lung lesions did not reveal any significant change. The skin lesion disappeared within a few months without any treatment.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Histological examination of the skin biopsy specimen reveals noncaseating granulomas (hematoxylin-eosin × 100).\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】We reviewed 24 case reports (27 cases) of IFN-α-induced sarcoidosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 \\]</u> and 6 case reports (6 cases) of IFN-β-induced sarcoidosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 \\]</u> that were published between January 2009 and November 2018.

Six reported cases of IFN-β-induced sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 \\]</u>.**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】The primary diseases of IFN-α-induced sarcoidosis were chronic hepatitis C in 24 cases, melanoma in 2, and erythrocytosis in 1 case. The male-to-female ratio was 4:5. The mean age at sarcoidosis onset was 51.4 ± 10.8 years (men 48.3 ± 9.9 years; women 53.9 ± 11.1 years). Twenty-three cases (85.1%) developed skin lesions and 19 (70.1%) had lung lesions. Only three cases (11.1%) presented with accompanying eye lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. After initiation of IFN-α therapy, the average duration of sarcoidosis onset was 7.9 months 通用删除1(英):<u>(range 2–14 months; Table 1 )</u>. IFN-α therapy was discontinued in 16 patients, and most of them showed improvement after systemic corticosteroid treatment; however, one patient died because of central nervous system disease 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Six cases of IFN-β-induced sarcoidosis are presented in Table 2 . The primary diseases of these IFN-β-induced sarcoidosis cases were multiple sclerosis in five cases and melanoma in one case. The lung was the most common site of disease development in six cases (100%), and none of the cases presented with eye lesions. In addition, after IFN-β therapy, the average duration of sarcoidosis onset was 53.8 months (range 5–156 months). The duration of sarcoidosis onset was longer in the IFN-β therapy group than in the IFN-α therapy group ( _p_ \\= 0.094; _t_ \\-test).\n\n【32】Our patient developed uveitis 25 months after initiating combination therapy with IFN-α and ribavirin to treat chronic hepatitis C. After 5 months, she was histologically diagnosed with sarcoidosis following a skin biopsy of the eruption on the right thigh. Uveitis was controlled with topical corticosteroid treatment.\n\n【33】Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease. In Japan, the frequency of pulmonary, eye, skin, or heart lesions is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. Th1 cell-mediated immunity is thought to be involved in the onset of the disease. IFN-α works in combination with IL-12, involving a mechanism wherein IFN-α administration causes increased production of IFN-γ and IL-18 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. This may shift the immune balance to Th1 dominance.\n\n【34】In contrast, ribavirin may suppress the Th2 immune response and activate the Th1 immune response. Although ribavirin-induced sarcoidosis has not been reported, combination therapy with IFN-α and ribavirin could increase sarcoidosis susceptibility. In addition, sarcoidosis has been reported to develop in patients with chronic hepatitis C without IFN-α treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. Therefore, the hepatitis C virus itself may be a trigger for the onset of symptoms. From the literature, we learned that IFN-α was associated with a shorter time of sarcoidosis onset than IFN-β (7.9 versus 53.8 months). Both hepatitis C virus infection and IFN-α therapy may shorten sarcoidosis onset compared with IFN-β. It is unclear if our patient developed sarcoidosis after a longer course (25 months) than the mean onset period of IFN-α-induced prolapse.\n\n【35】While the most common symptom of IFN-α-induced sarcoidosis was skin lesion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>, there have been few cases with uveitis in the reported literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>; three of four cases, including our case, involved Japanese patients. Uveitis appears more common among Japanese patients with IFN-induced sarcoidosis owing to the greater frequency of eye involvement in sarcoidosis among Japanese patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u> than non-Japanese patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>. Uveitis developed as an initial symptom in the present case, while skin lesions with uveitis appeared together in the case reported by Nigam _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In other Japanese cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, skin lesions developed before uveitis.\n\n【36】Few reports have outlined the treatment of IFN-induced sarcoid uveitis. One reported case of IFN-α-induced sarcoid uveitis with papillitis and macular edema showed improvement following sub-Tenon’s injection of methylprednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Doycheva _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u> reported treatment for a mild case of IFN-α-induced sarcoid panuveitis in which, despite the absence of histological examination, the dosage of IFN-α was gradually reduced and discontinued and replaced with steroid eye drops. In contrast, in cases with systemic symptoms, IFN-α was discontinued and oral steroids were needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. In our case, the patient’s condition improved following local steroid treatment alone, including steroid eye drops and sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection, although the lung lesion persisted.\n\n【37】Our literature review has some limitations. First, we only verified articles that could be searched and read; thus, the actual number of articles may be greater. Second, we only included cases of histopathologically confirmed IFN-induced sarcoidosis and did not consider clinically diagnosed cases. Thus, the number of cases might have been underestimated.\n\n【38】When using IFN treatment, it is necessary to monitor the onset of symptoms of sarcoidosis and systemic side effects of IFNs. If uveitis develops during or after IFN treatment, it may be the initial symptom of IFN-induced sarcoidosis. Ophthalmologists should suspect the development of sarcoidosis and conduct systemic investigations to diagnose sarcoidosis.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The dataset supporting the conclusions of this article is included within the article.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IFN:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Interferon</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IL:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Interleukin</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Th1:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>T-helper type-1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Even though it forms a large, prominent skin lesion, therapy for phacomatosis pigmentovascularis is rarely discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type II treated with combined laser therapy using Q-switched alexandrite and long-pulsed dye lasers.\n\n【3】### Case presentations\n\n【4】In the first of two cases reported here, a 2-week-old Japanese baby girl was given a diagnosis of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type II and Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome because of port-wine stains, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, and aberrant Mongolian spots over her trunk and limbs. After five laser therapy sessions under general anesthesia, her aberrant Mongolian spots and port-wine stains have improved. But interestingly, the cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita on the patient's back has improved without laser therapy.\n\n【5】In the second case, a 4-month-old Japanese baby boy was referred to us because of port-wine stains, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, and aberrant Mongolian spots over his face, trunk and limbs. Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type II was diagnosed and laser therapy was started. After three laser therapy sessions under general anesthesia, the aberrant Mongolian spots and port-wine stains have improved. The cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita on the baby's back, buttocks, and arms has faded somewhat without laser therapy.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Combined laser therapy improved the phacomatosis pigmentovascularis skin lesions, but was not effective for the cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita with hemiatrophy. Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita without atrophy can be expected to improve on its own. Our results will assist physicians considering how best to treat patients with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV), a rare congenital condition, was first reported by Ota et al. in 1947 as a vascular malformation associated with extensive pigmented nevi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. PPV is classified into four types, each of which is further classified into two subtypes according to whether there is systemic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although PPV skin lesions are quite large and can be emotionally distressing for patients and their families, therapy for PPV is rarely discussed. We here present two patients with PPV type II who were treated with combined Q-switched alexandrite laser (QAL) and long-pulsed dye laser (LPDL) therapy.\n\n【11】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A 2-week-old baby girl born to nonconsanguineous Japanese parents was referred to us because of skin lesions. The family history and personal history were unremarkable, and the pregnancy and labor had been uneventful. The baby's weight and height at birth were in the 50th percentile. On physical examination, we noted erythematous macules and plaques over her right chest, abdomen, and arm. We diagnosed these lesions as a port-wine stain (PWS). We also noted extensive areas of reddish-blue reticulated, marble-like lesions over her back and buttocks, consistent with a diagnosis of cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC). CMTC with hemihypertrophy was present on her lower right leg. Bilateral, demarcated greyish-blue hyperpigmentation on the buttocks and thighs, partly intermingled with the vascular lesions, was diagnosed as aberrant Mongolian spots. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Blood biochemistry, complete blood cell count, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were all within normal limits.\n\n【14】The physical findings indicated a diagnosis of PPV type IIb and Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome. Laser therapy was started when the patient was one-year-old. We used a QAL (ALEXLASER; Candela Corporation, Wayland, MA, USA) with an energy density of 6.0J/cm <sup>2 </sup> to treat the dermal melanosis of her buttocks and thighs. An LPDL (Vbeam®; Candela Corporation) with an energy density of 10J/cm <sup>2 </sup> and 1.5ms was used simultaneously to treat the PWS and CMTC lesions. Where the lesions were intermingled, we treated the dermal melanosis before the PWS and CMTC. The patient underwent five laser therapy sessions under general anesthesia. In each session, approximately 30% of the lesion area was treated; however, her back has yet to be treated.\n\n【15】The patient is now 3-years-old and shows normal mental and physical development. Although the hemihypertrophy remains, there is no leg length discrepancy. The aberrant Mongolian spots have faded. The four authors of this paper evaluated the amount of fading and agreed that although the lesions are still visible their color has decreased by about 80%. The PWS on the patient's trunk and arm has also decreased by about 80%, but the CMTC on her leg is mostly unchanged. We plan to change the laser power and pulse width for this patient's future treatment. Of interest, the CMTC on the patient's back has faded by about 90%, without laser therapy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】**Case 1: A baby with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type IIb treated with combination laser therapy.** ( **A** , **B** ) The baby had a port-wine stain on her right side, hemihypertrophy of her legs, and cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) on her back and legs.

The family history and personal history were unremarkable, and the pregnancy and labor had been uneventful. The boy's weight and height at birth were in the 50th percentile, and his postnatal development was normal. On physical examination, we noted a PWS on his right cheek and CMTC on his right side on his back, buttock, and arm. We found aberrant Mongolian spots, partly intermingled with the vascular lesions, on his chest and arms. We also noted ocular pigmentation of his right eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no other findings. No atrophy or hypertrophy of the soft tissues was observed. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Blood biochemistry, complete blood cell count, chest radiography, and electrocardiography were within normal limits.\n\n【21】PPV type IIa was diagnosed, and laser therapy began when the patient reached one year of age. We used a QAL with an energy density of 6.0J/cm <sup>2 </sup> to treat the dermal melanosis of his chest and upper limbs. We used an LPDL with an energy density of 10J/cm <sup>2 </sup> and 1.5ms to treat his PWS lesions simultaneously. Where the lesions were intermingled, we treated the dermal melanosis before the PWS. The patient underwent three laser therapy sessions under general anesthesia. We did not treat the CMTC in any of the sessions.\n\n【22】The boy is now 2-years-old and shows normal mental and physical development. Both the aberrant Mongolian spots on his trunk and upper limb and the PWS on his cheek have decreased by about 60%, although they are still visible. We plan to treat this patient with another session of combined laser therapy. The CMTC on the child's back, buttocks, and arms has faded by about 90% without laser therapy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【23】**Figure 2**\n\n【24】**Case 2: A baby with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type IIa treated with combination laser therapy.** ( **A** , **B** ) The baby had aberrant Mongolian spots on his chest and arms, a port-wine stain (PWS) on his cheek, and cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC) on his lower back and buttocks. ( **C** , **D** ) Photographs taken after three sessions of laser therapy show improvement in the aberrant Mongolian spots and PWS. The CMTC improved without laser therapy.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】PPV is classified into the following four types, according to the epidermal component accompanying the capillary malformation: type I, nevus flammeus (another term for PWS) with nevus pigmentosus et verrucosus; type II, nevus flammeus with aberrant Mongolian spots, with or without nevus anemicus; type III, nevus flammeus with nevus spilus or giant speckled lentiginous nevus, with or without nevus anemicus; and type IV, nevus flammeus with both aberrant Mongolian spots and speckled lentiginous nevus, with or without nevus anemicus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Each type is subdivided as having (a) only oculocutaneous involvement or (b) extracutaneous features. In addition, there are reports of patients with CMTC and aberrant Mongolian spots, and the term PPV type V has been proposed for this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】In 2005, Happle proposed classifying PPV into three distinct categories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, descriptively named phacomatosis cesioflammea, phacomatosis spilorosea, and phacomatosis cesiomarmorata. Our patients would be classified as having PPV IIa and IIb in the traditional classification system, and as having phacomatosis cesioflammea in the new classification system.\n\n【29】It has been proposed that PPV is the result of non-allelic twin spotting involving two different recessive mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Postzygotic recombination in early embryogenesis produces two homozygous daughter cell lines that migrate to different parts of the body and form a mosaic pattern of capillary and melanocytic lesions.\n\n【30】PPV has a roughly 50% association rate with systemic disease in all categories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>; Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome and Sturge–Weber syndrome are the most common identifiable disorders. Case 1 was classified as PPV IIb because of the presence of nevus flammeus, aberrant Mongolian spots, and Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome.\n\n【31】Although PPV skin lesions can be distressing for patients and their families, very few attempts have been made to treat PPV with laser therapy. Ono and Tateshita reported an improvement in one case of PPV treated with a Q-switched ruby laser and a dye laser 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Kono _et al_ . suggested a combined laser approach (a Q-switched ruby laser, a QAL, and a flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser) for PPV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. It has been reported that aberrant Mongolian spots can be effectively treated with Q-switched ruby and alexandrite lasers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and that PWS can be treated safely and effectively with LPDL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Therefore, we used QAL and LPDL for PPV therapy.\n\n【32】Laser treatment of intermingled vascular and pigmented lesions can be difficult. Thus, we recommend beginning PPV therapy with the QAL, followed by the LPDL after the dermal melanin content has subsided to some extent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Mazereeuw-Hautier _et al_ . reported that frequency-doubled Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet; Nd:Y3Al5O12) laser therapy failed to improve CMTC because of dilated veins and extensive large, deep capillaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. For the same reason, LPDL therapy was not effective for our first patient's CMTC with hemiatrophy. The power and pulse width will be raised for this patient's next laser therapy session.\n\n【34】Because CMTC without atrophy can be expected to improve on its own, vascular lesions should be examined carefully to differentiate between PWS and CMTC and to ascertain whether atrophy is present.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】We have reported two cases of PPV type II treated with combined laser therapy. The combined laser therapy improved the PPV skin lesions, the PWS, and aberrant Mongolian spots, but was not effective for CMTC with hemiatrophy. However, CMTC without atrophy can be expected to improve on its own. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PPV type II treated with combined QAL and LPDL laser therapy. Our results will be of some help to physicians in deciding how best to treat patients with PPV.\n\n【37】Consent\n-------\n\n【38】Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of both patients to publish this case report and the accompanying images; copies of the written consents are available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This phenomenon does not typically occur with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We present a case in which a patient treated with combination carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab experienced transient radiographic worsening of disease with subsequent regression.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 65-year-old never-smoking white male with advanced sarcomatoid non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation and with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 80% was initiated on combination chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy after progression on a MET inhibitor. After two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, repeat imaging suggested disease progression. Following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy levels, which were attributed to the waning of treatment-associated toxicities. On the day prior to initiation of the next planned line of therapy, repeat imaging was preformed to provide a baseline for treatment efficacy. Imaging revealed improvement compared to the prior imaging. Chemotherapy with carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab was resumed, with response ongoing 8 months later.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Pseudoprogression is a documented feature of ICI administration. Pseudoprogression is not typically observed in patients treated with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and has not yet been documented in patients treated with combination cytotoxic chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. At this time, there are no reliable means to predict or diagnose these rare events; therefore, more studies should be conducted to understand which patients are predisposed to developing this phenomenon and to increase clinical recognition.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】With a novel mechanism of action and unprecedented clinical efficacy in multiple tumor types, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy. Yet these promising treatments have also introduced new challenges. Compared to the well-characterized and predictable toxicities of cytotoxic chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapies, ICI-induced immune-related adverse events (irAE) affect a far broader range of organ systems, may mimic other clinical conditions, and may occur at almost any point in treatment. Clinical characteristics generally not considered relevant to other cancer treatments, such as body mass index, history of autoimmune disease, and exposure to antibiotics, may influence both the efficacy and tolerability of ICI treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Perhaps one of the most disconcerting features of ICI administration is the potential for pseudoprogression. While early changes in tumor dimensions reliably indicate the benefits of chemotherapy and targeted therapy, in a subset of patients treated with ICI transient radiographic worsening may precede subsequent benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Some studies indicate that pseudoprogression may occur in up to 10% of patients receiving ICI therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) plus chemotherapy or the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) plus chemotherapy offers the opportunity to deliver fast-acting cytotoxic agents along with slower but potentially more durably acting ICI. However, as demonstrated in the case presented here, pseudoprogression may still occur with such regimens.\n\n【12】This study was approved by the UT Southwestern Institutional Review Board (IRB #STU 082015-053).\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 65-year-old never-smoking white male with advanced sarcomatoid NSCLC harboring a _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation and with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 80% was initiated on combination chemotherapy plus ICI therapy after progression on a MET inhibitor. At the time, positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse metastases in the liver, adrenal gland, and bones. Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient’s never-smoking status.\n\n【15】The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities. However, repeat imaging after two cycles demonstrated concern for disease progression, with enlarging lesions in the lung, liver, adrenal gland, neck, and skull. Although clear growth was observed, it did not meet the threshold for hyperprogression, which is most commonly defined as at least a doubling of tumor growth rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Given primary disease progression and the high burden of disease, the clinical team planned to change treatment to docetaxel plus ramucirumab. In the weeks following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy level, which were attributed to waning of treatment-associated toxicities.\n\n【16】On the day prior to the planned initiation of docetaxel plus ramucirumab, repeat imaging was performed to provide a near-term baseline for subsequent efficacy assessment. The chest CT demonstrated improvement compared to the prior CT image. Accordingly, instead of changing the treatment regimen, the clinical team proceeded with two additional cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, following which further response was noted on the chest CT and PET images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 , 2 )</u>. Subsequently, maintenance therapy was initiated with pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, which was changed to pembrolizumab monotherapy after one cycle due to serum creatinine elevation and fatigue. Since then, the patient has received six cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab, and disease control remains ongoing at 6 months after the initiation of combination chemotherapy plus ICI. Aside from requiring a mild levothyroxine dose adjustment, the patient has had no substantial toxicities.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】Serial computed tomography axial images. **a** Baseline, **b** after 2 cycles of chemotherapy + immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), **c** after 4 cycles of chemotherapy + ICI and **d** 4 cycles of maintenance ICI.

With ICI alone, the reported incidence of pseudoprogression is 2–6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. How to distinguish these cases remains an ongoing area of research. While it has been suggested that clinical symptom trends (worsening in true progression vs. stable or improving in pseudoprogression) may distinguish these processes, it is not clear how reliable this strategy is. Indeed, pseudoprogression has been recognized in patients months after clinical deterioration, treatment cessation, and hospice referral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. PET-CT images, both of which document inflammatory changes and neoplastic tissue, routinely demonstrate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake but may also fail to differentiate pseudoprogression and true progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. If feasible, biopsy of an enlarging lesion may provide insight, with pseudoprogression featuring CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell lymphoid infiltrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. More convenient than tissue sampling, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) burden kinetics as a means to ascertain pseudoprogression represents an area of active investigation.\n\n【25】Concern for pseudoprogression resulted in specific recommendations for radiographic monitoring of ICI efficacy. In contrast to conventional response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), immune-related response criteria (irRC) incorporate moderate enlargement of pre-existing lesions and appearance of new lesions into the domain of disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, recent NSCLC clinical trials of combination chemotherapy plus ICI have employed standard RECIST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Additionally, these trials perform and act on early radiographic efficacy assessments (typically after 2 cycles, approximately 6 weeks after treatment initiation), in contrast to the later and confirmatory assessments recommended for immunotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】If pseudoprogression occurs in a patient treated with combination chemotherapy plus ICI, does this imply chemotherapy resistance? Alternatively, chemotherapy might have efficacy, but radiographic manifestation of immune cell influx outweighs that of tumor regression, resulting in tumor enlargement on imaging studies. In this case, while combination carboplatin-pemetrexed was continued for two more cycles and single-agent pemetrexed for one cycle of maintenance therapy thereafter, ICI monotherapy with pembrolizumab has resulted in months of ongoing disease control. For now, whether cytotoxic agents should be discontinued due to potential lack of efficacy when pseudoprogression occurs with combination chemoimmunotherapy will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n【27】How to determine which cases are experiencing true progression versus pseudoprogression, which is attributed to an early influx of immune cells resulting in apparent tumor enlargement, represents a true challenge for clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Ideally, all patients could continue ICI after initial progression. Such an approach would not only ensure subsequent pseudoprogression and clinical benefit are not missed, but would also provide insight into the true incidence of this phenomenon. In reality, however, many patients cannot afford to continue potentially ineffective treatment in the setting of advanced malignancy.\n\n【28】To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pseudoprogression with combination chemoimmunotherapy, which serves as an important reminder that this rare phenomenon may occur in various clinical contexts. Indeed, the potential for early disease control from cytotoxic agents has served as the rationale for such regimens as ipilimumab + nivolumab combined with two initial cycles of platinum doublet chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Currently, there is no reliable means to predict or diagnose these rare events. Given the potential long-term benefits of ICI therapy and the potential harms of unchallenged cancer growth, clinicians face high stakes when choosing whether to continue or change treatment. This is all the more true when one considers that pseudoprogression has been associated with improved survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. There remains a clear need for practical and accurate means to recognize pseudoprogression. This case report represents one novel presentation of pseudoprogression with combination chemotherapy with immunotherapy. There may be other presentations of this phenomenon; therefore, more studies, analyzing why presentations like this exist should be conducted.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data are available on reasonable request to corresponding author.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed multifocal, subpleural ground-glass opacities with nodular consolidations bilaterally. Computed tomography also demonstrated atypical bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a rarely reported imaging feature of COVID-19. Chest computed tomography 1 month before the presentation did not show focal consolidations or lymphadenopathy.

She received 5 days of oral hydroxychloroquine and experienced resolution of her symptoms.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Chest computed tomography has been used extensively to diagnose and characterize the distinguishing radiological findings associated with viral pneumonia. It has emerged as an integral part of the diagnosis of COVID-19 alongside reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays. Clinicians must be aware of uncommon clinical and radiological findings in order to diagnose this entity. Hilar lymphadenopathy is commonly seen with fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, and sarcoidosis. An extensive literature review found that bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy has not been reported in the setting of COVID-19. More data are needed to establish the clinical impact of this novel finding.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic in March 2020. Though the incidence of the disease has drastically dropped in China, it is rising worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Coronavirus is an encapsulated ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was identified as the culprit of a cluster of lower respiratory tract illnesses in Wuhan, China. A study suggested that it has two strains: type S and type L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The understanding of the disease, its transmission, and its treatment are still evolving. COVID-19 can range from being asymptomatic to a wide variety of severe symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several observational studies suggested that fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. As the outbreak of COVID-19 has progressed, so have the methodologies used in its diagnostic workup. A chest computed tomographic (CT) scan has quickly emerged as an integral part of the diagnosis alongside reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The most commonly reported CT findings in patients with COVID-19 are bilateral ground-glass opacities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In another study, CT manifestations were peripheral airspace consolidations in one-third of the cases. Less common findings include pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, cavitation, air bronchograms, and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. These data are helpful for clinicians to gain an understanding of a wide spectrum of imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Hilar lymphadenopathy is a common radiological finding associated with fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, and sarcoidosis. However, it is rarely seen in viral pneumonia. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting healthcare and economic systems worldwide, it is imperative to detect the disease earlier in the course before complications involving acute hypoxic respiratory failure warranting invasive mechanical ventilation arise. Characteristic CT scan findings, alongside RT-PCR and antibody testing, help clinicians diagnose COVID-19. None of these modalities can be used as a single tool to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection. An extensive literature review found that acute bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy has not been reported in the setting of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. It is important to report atypical imaging findings to establish their frequency and association with disease severity and outcomes.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 73-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary embolism, and rheumatoid arthritis came to our emergency department with complaints of fever, chills, generalized weakness, and decreased appetite of 1 day’s duration. Her home medication list included amlodipine 10 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid 1000 mg. The patient had a remote history of rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was not taking any medication. She had quit smoking almost 30 years ago and admitted to one or two glasses of alcohol consumption occasionally. In the emergency department, she was febrile with a maximum body temperature of 102.3 °F. Her blood pressure was 157/73 mmHg, heart rate was 81 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/minute, and pulse oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. At admission, she was alert and oriented and did not seem to be in any distress. Her pulse was regular; her heart sounds (S1, S2) were audible without any murmur or additional heart sounds; and no lower extremity edema was observed during her physical examination. Her lungs were grossly clear with equal air entry without any wheeze or rhonchi. Her abdomen was soft, and bowel sounds were present. Her hematological workup showed leukopenia (white blood cell count, 3400/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), anemia (hemoglobin, 10.5 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (platelets, 163,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), and elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (66.8 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (74 mm/hour). The result of multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for respiratory tract viral infections. Liver function tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (26 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT 8 U/L), and a basic metabolic panel, including blood urea nitrogen (16 mg/dl) and creatinine (1.03 mg/dl), were within the normal ranges. The result of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample for SARS-CoV-2 was positive by RT-PCR, and a diagnosis of COVID-19 was established. Blood cultures and sputum culture did not show any bacterial or fungal growth. The patient started developing a dry cough and respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula (up to 6 L/minute) on the second day of admission with sporadic rhonchi detected by physical examination. Contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed multifocal, subpleural ground-glass opacities with nodular consolidations bilaterally 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a, b)</u>. A CT scan also demonstrated atypical bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a rarely reported CT finding in COVID-19 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. Chest CT one month before the current presentation demonstrated no focal consolidations or lymphadenopathy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. The patient received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg and azithromycin 500 mg orally for 5 days alongside supportive treatment with acetaminophen and supplemental oxygenation via nasal cannula.

There is convincing evidence that viral load is high in NP samples, and RT-PCR can have false-positive and false-negative results. If there is a high clinical suspicion, then repeat RT-PCR with resampling from another site is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. There have been patients with a negative result of RT-PCR but whose CT scan was suggestive of viral pneumonia. Later, those patients had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Yan Li and Liming Xia suggested that CT scans can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to diagnose COVID-19 on the basis of a low rate of missed diagnoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. This argues in favor of chest imaging earlier in the course with clinical suspicion of viral pneumonia. Frequently encountered imaging findings include peripheral airspace consolidations and bilateral ground-glass opacities; less common associations include cavitation and air bronchograms. To our knowledge, hilar lymphadenopathy has not been reported in the setting of COVID-19. RT-PCR of the NP swab sample is the preferred and recommended screening test worldwide. However, false-negative results may occur because of inadequate viral load or impaired sampling techniques. In these circumstances, chest CT scans and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M antibody testing can significantly aid in the diagnostic workup. CT scan findings can vary on the day of imaging, and some studies even suggested obtaining a repeat CT scan to rule out worsening of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Clinicians must be aware of rare clinical and radiological findings in order to diagnose this entity. In the absence of effective antiviral therapy and persistent evidence-based guidelines, HCQ and zinc were initially used for COVID-19. Interleukin-6 inhibitors are used against the hyperinflammatory state because of the proposed cytokine storm syndrome. Immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 start developing after 2 weeks of disease onset, and convalescent plasma from the recovered patient population is being studied in compassionate trials at different centers. The efficacy of these medications and therapeutic interventions is yet to be established. Calcified lymph nodes have been reported in the late stages of alphaherpesvirus pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy has not been reported in the setting of COVID-19. Reporting and recognizing the rare imaging findings will help clinicians to understand their frequency and association with the disease. Follow-up imaging should be pursued to evaluate the persistence or resolution of hilar lymphadenopathy. More information with long-term follow-up is required to establish the importance and clinical implications of our findings.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【21】Chest CT has been used extensively to diagnose and characterize the distinguishing radiological findings associated with viral pneumonia. It has emerged as an integral part of the diagnosis of COVID-19 alongside RT-PCR. Clinicians must be aware of uncommon clinical and radiological findings in order to diagnose this entity. Hilar lymphadenopathy is commonly seen with fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, and sarcoidosis. In an extensive literature review, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy was not reported in the setting of COVID-19. Recognizing rare imaging findings will help clinicians understand their frequency and association with disease severity. Follow-up imaging should be pursued to evaluate the persistence or resolution of hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with COVID-19.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report the cases of five patients who experienced this complication and discuss their management.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We retrospectively evaluated five patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation-related internal mammary artery injuries who were treated between February 2011 and February 2016 at our institution. All five patients were Asian men, aged 56 to 68-years old, who had received concomitant intravenously administered unfractionated heparin (3000 units) with antiplatelet therapy. Four patients received targeted temperature management. The injuries and hematomas were detected using contrast-enhanced computed tomography in all cases. Three patients were treated using transcatheter arterial embolization within 6 hours following cardiopulmonary arrest, and two were resuscitated and received appropriate treatment following early recognition of their injuries. Two patients died of hemorrhagic shock with delayed intervention. Four of the five patients had excessively prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times before their interventions.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Computed tomography should be performed as soon as possible after the return of spontaneous circulation to identify injuries and consider appropriate treatments for patients who have experienced cardiac arrest. Delayed bleeding may develop after treating hypovolemic shock and relieving arterial spasms; therefore, transcatheter arterial embolization should be performed aggressively to prevent delayed bleeding even in the absence of extravasation. This approach may be superior to thoracotomy because it is less invasive, causes less bleeding, and can selectively stop arterial bleeding sooner. A 3000-unit intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin may be redundant; heparin-free extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be a more appropriate alternative. Unfractionated heparin treatment can commence after the bleeding has stopped.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Chest compressions for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were emphasized in the 2010 American Heart Association CPR guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, CPR-related bleeding complications are not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]</u>, and CPR-related fractures have been observed more frequently since 2010 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, CPR-related bleeding, particularly internal mammary artery (IMA) injuries, can become life-threatening in patients who undergo extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) because concomitant anticoagulant treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, antiplatelet treatment, targeted temperature management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, and bleeding coagulopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u> are often involved. We investigated five patients with CPR-related IMA injuries that occurred after they had undergone venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).\n\n【10】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【11】We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of patients with cardiac arrest who underwent VA-ECMO between February 2011 and February 2016 at our institution. Of the 129 patients identified, five experienced CPR-related IMA injuries. Four of these patients underwent ECPR and one underwent VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). All five patients were Asian men who had received 3000 units of intravenously administered unfractionated heparin with concomitant antiplatelet therapy for suspected acute coronary syndrome. Four of the five patients underwent targeted temperature management (the exception being Patient 3). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed CPR-related chest bleeding complications in all cases, for example, IMA injuries, intercostal artery (ICA) injuries, mediastinum hematoma, and hemothorax.\n\n【12】### Case 1\n\n【13】A 65-year-old Asian man had a history of myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation, and was receiving dual antiplatelet and warfarin treatment. After collapsing at a concert, he received immediate bystander CPR as well as six automated external defibrillator shocks before the emergency medical service (EMS) arrived; he was then transported to our hospital. His rhythm was asystole at the time of admission, and VA-ECMO commenced 45 minutes after his cardiac arrest because conventional CPR did not result in ROSC. Contrast-enhanced CT after starting VA-ECMO revealed bilateral multiple rib fractures, a sternum fracture, and right pleural effusion without contrast extravasation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a )</u>. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was not indicated; coronary angiography (CAG) was performed for suspected cardiogenic cardiac arrest based on the prehospital shockable rhythm. His left circumflex artery was completely occluded, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was attempted but failed because of strong calcification. Repeat contrast-enhanced CT was performed because of unstable blood flow during the VA-ECMO, and our patient exhibited a gradual decrease in his hemoglobin (Hb) levels from 10.8 g/dL at admission to 8.4 g/dL 2 hours later. CT revealed contrast extravasation at his mediastinum and right anterior chest wall, with increases in the sizes of the hematomas 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1b )</u>. TAE was performed for his right IMA and right ICA using n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) 560 minutes after his cardiac arrest. His activated partial thromboplastin time was > 130 seconds before TAE. He subsequently died 2 hours after TAE despite receiving 26 red blood cell units, 16 fresh frozen plasma units, and three packs of cryoprecipitate.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Computed tomography findings from Patient 1. **a** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography after the extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation revealed bilateral multiple rib fractures, a sternum fracture, and right pleural effusion without contrast extravasation. **b** Repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomography after coronary angiography revealed contrast extravasation at the anterior chest wall ( _arrow_ ) and mediastinum ( _arrowhead_ ), with increases in the size of these hematomas\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】### Case 2\n\n【18】A 68-year-old Asian man was transported to another hospital by the EMS because of chest pain. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was noted on his arrival, and conventional CPR was performed immediately. He achieved ROSC after four defibrillation shocks, and was subsequently transferred to our hospital for post-cardiac arrest care. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted at our hospital for cardiogenic shock, and CAG was also performed, revealing total occlusion of his left anterior descending artery. He was diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction and underwent successful PCI. Chest radiography did not reveal any traumatic abnormalities 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a )</u>, and his hemodynamics were maintained using IABP and a continuous infusion of noradrenalin. Minimal change was observed in his Hb levels (admission, 13.5 g/dL; 6 hours later, 13.3 g/dL). Two days after admission, he suddenly deteriorated, and VA-ECMO was initiated for suspected cardiogenic shock. However, his Hb level decreased to 5.3 g/dL, which indicated hemorrhagic shock. Ultrasonography and chest radiography revealed massive left pleural effusion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2b )</u>, and a massive hemothorax was diagnosed after inserting a chest drainage tube. The blood flow from the drainage tube was > 200 mL/hour for several hours, and contrast-enhanced CT was performed to identify the source of the bleeding. Contrast extravasation was noted behind his left sixth rib, as well as hematoma at his mediastinum and hemothorax without rib fracture 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2c )</u>. Thoracotomy was performed to achieve hemostasis 48 hours after cardiac arrest. Although the bleeding appeared to originate from his left ICA, it was difficult to stop; therefore, an artery involved with the adjacent rib was also ligated. However, this procedure did not stop the bleeding from the left chest drain, and angiography at 8 hours after the thoracotomy revealed bleeding from his left IMA. TAE was performed using microcoils and gelatin sponge pledgets, but did not control the bleeding. He subsequently died because of hemorrhagic shock 8 hours after the TAE.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】Chest radiography and computed tomography findings from Patient 2. **a** Chest radiography at the time of admission did not reveal any traumatic abnormalities. **b** Chest radiography 3 days after the admission revealed decreased left lung permeability. **c** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography from after the insertion of a chest drainage tube revealed extravasation of the contrast agent behind the left sixth rib ( _arrow_ ), a hematoma at the mediastinum ( _arrowhead_ ), and chest cavities without any obvious rib fractures\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】### Case 3\n\n【23】A 56-year-old Asian man (an in-patient) had undergone an emergency graft implantation for a type A aortic dissection. On the eighth day post-surgery, he lost consciousness and experienced cardiac arrest that was witnessed by a surgeon in the general ward. He experienced refractory VF after conventional CPR, and VA-ECMO was started 28 minutes after the cardiac arrest. CAG revealed a thrombus between the aortic graft and the left main trunk of his coronary artery. Blood flow in his coronary artery improved after thrombus aspiration and balloon angiography. Contrast-enhanced CT after the PCI revealed extravasation and a hematoma at the mediastinum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3a )</u>. Angiography revealed that the extravasation was proximal to his left IMA 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3b )</u>. Although TAE was performed using NBCA at 313 minutes after his cardiac arrest, the spasm persisted and ECMO flow could not be maintained at that time. He died 41 minutes after the TAE.\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】Computed tomography and angiography findings from Patient 3. **a** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography after the percutaneous coronary intervention revealed contrast extravasation ( _arrow_ ), a hematoma at the mediastinum ( _arrowhead_ ), and compression of the right atrium and ventricle. **b** Angiography after the contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed contrast extravasation proximal to the left internal mammary artery ( _arrow_ ) with arterial spasm ( _arrowhead_ )\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】### Case 4\n\n【28】A 62-year-old Asian man was transported to our hospital by the EMS because of pulseless electrical activity after receiving bystander CPR. VF was documented at the admission, and VA-ECMO was started for refractory VF 55 minutes after his cardiac arrest. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a sternal fracture and a retrosternal hematoma with contrast extravasation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4a )</u>. CAG was initially performed because the VA-ECMO flow was maintained and revealed 90% stenosis of his left main trunk. He was diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction and underwent successful PCI. IABP was initiated to treat cardiogenic shock during the VA-ECMO. He exhibited a gradual decrease in his Hb levels: admission, 16.3 g/dL; 4 hours later, 14.2 g/dL. Repeat contrast-enhanced CT was performed because of the hematoma and contrast extravasation, and revealed new contrast extravasation behind his right fifth costal cartilage and beside his sternum, as well as growing hematomas in the retrosternal space 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4b )</u>. Angiography revealed extravasations at his bilateral IMAs, and TAE was performed using NBCA at 327 minutes after his cardiac arrest 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4c )</u>. The TAE successfully decreased the IMA flow and the extravasations disappeared. The VA-ECMO and IABP were tapered on day 7 and day 11 post-admission, respectively. He was subsequently transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on day 123 at which point his Glasgow–Pittsburgh cerebral performance category was 3.\n\n【29】**Fig. 4**\n\n【30】Computed tomography and angiography findings from Patient 4. **a** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography before the coronary angiography revealed a sternal fracture and a retrosternal hematoma with contrast extravasation of contrast ( _arrow_ ). **b** Repeat computed tomography after the percutaneous coronary intervention revealed new contrast extravasation behind the fifth costal cartilage and beside the sternum ( _arrow_ ), as well as growing hematomas in the retrosternal space. **c** Angiography after the percutaneous coronary intervention revealed bilateral contrast extravasation at the bilateral internal mammary arteries ( _arrow_ s)\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】### Case 5\n\n【33】A 62-year-old Asian man was transported to our hospital by the EMS because of VF after four defibrillation shocks. VA-ECMO was started for refractory VF at 40 minutes after his cardiac arrest. Contrast-enhanced CT before the CAG revealed right rib fractures, a sternum fracture, and a mediastinal hematoma with contrast extravasation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5a )</u>. CAG did not reveal any coronary artery stenosis, and selective right IMA angiography subsequently identified the extravasation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5b )</u>. Artery embolization was performed using gelatin sponge pledgets and microcoils at 181 minutes after his cardiac arrest, and IABP was started after the TAE. He was a heavy drinker and was diagnosed as having VF that was caused by hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL at admission) and hypokalemia (serum potassium level of 2.6 mmol/L at admission). The VA-ECMO and IABP were tapered on days 2 and 4 post-admission, respectively. After implantation of a cardiac defibrillator, he was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on day 88, when he exhibited a cerebral performance category of 3.\n\n【34】**Fig. 5**\n\n【35】Computed tomography and angiography findings from Patient 5. **a** Contrast-enhanced computed tomography from before the coronary angiography revealed right rib fractures, a sternum fracture, and a hematoma at the mediastinum with contrast extravasation ( _arrow_ ). **b** Angiography after the coronary angiography revealed contrast extravasation at the right internal mammary artery ( _arrow_ )\n\n【36】Full size image\n\n【37】Discussion\n----------\n\n【38】We retrospectively identified five cases of CPR-related IMA injuries that were detected after VA-ECMO had been initiated 通用删除1(英):<u>(Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 )</u>. These cases highlighted three important clinical principles. First, patients who have been resuscitated after cardiac arrest should undergo CT as soon as possible to identify any CPR-related injuries (especially IMA injuries), which can also help select the appropriate treatment(s). Second, TAE may be superior to thoracotomy for treating IMA injuries. Third, an initial 3000-unit intravenous bolus of heparin may be redundant in cases that involve ECPR.\n\n【39】**Table 1 Patient characteristics**\n\n【40】Full size table\n\n【41】**Table 2 Patient clinical outcome**\n\n【42】Full size table\n\n【43】**Table 3 Blood test before intervention started and transfusion until intervention finished**\n\n【44】Full size table\n\n【45】A retrospective study of CT-detected CPR-related injuries revealed that 10% of cases involved chest wall hematomas, while 15% involved secondary signs of sternal fracture (retrosternal or mediastinal hematomas) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In addition, a prospective study revealed that the incidence of CT-detected hemothorax was 11.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Thus, CPR-related bleeding is not a rare complication, although the bleeding sources and their frequencies remain unclear. For example, bleeding can be caused by venous hemorrhage due to rib or sternal fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and/or arterial and branch hemorrhage due to ICA or IMA injuries. Although the 2015 CPR guidelines recommend targeting a reduced minimum compression depth (5 cm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, chest injuries have not been eliminated. On the other hand, the 2015 American Heart Association CPR guidelines recommend considering ECPR during a limited period of mechanical cardiorespiratory support for select patients with cardiac arrest and a suspected reversible etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, as this approach may improve neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. While there are not many reports of CPR-related chest bleeding complications after ECPR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, life-threatening chest bleeding complications may become increasingly common because of the new guideline recommendations.\n\n【46】IMA injuries can result in potentially life-threatening hemorrhage within a few minutes because of the rapid blood flow (150 mL/minute) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. However, the patient described in Case 2 exemplifies the fact that chest radiography may not reveal indirect signs of IMA injuries (for example, slight hemothorax or a mediastinal hematoma) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 15 \\]</u>, and early CT is required to identify active IMA bleeding and guide rapid surgical or angiographic intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. Cases 3 to 5 involved TAE treatment within 6 hours after the cardiac arrest, and the successful resuscitations and treatments in Cases 4 and 5 were based on the early CT findings. Unfortunately, patient 3 died because of hemorrhagic shock, as early intervention was unsuccessful because of arterial spasm. Of interest, IMA bleeding can result in temporary hemostasis because of arterial spasm and hypotension, which can lead to delayed bleeding after these complications are treated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 17 \\]</u>. The deaths of patients 1 and 2 were caused by hemorrhage shock because of the delayed treatment. The TAE in patient 1 was performed > 9 hours after the cardiac arrest because contrast extravasation was not detected during the first CT. In patient 2, the thoracotomy was performed at > 48 hours after the cardiac arrest because he did not undergo CT at his admission and exhibited stable Hb levels during a 6-hour period. Therefore, if the initial CT reveals massive hemorrhage, angiography should be considered to temporarily achieve hemostasis and delay bleeding. Furthermore, TAE may be performed aggressively in cases with IMA injuries, even if no active extravasation is detected during angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【47】Early contrast-enhanced CT should be performed to identify any CPR-related injuries and their etiologies, which can determine the indication for early TAE or thoracotomy. The selection of TAE or thoracotomy remains controversial, although surgery may be the first choice if the patient’s condition does not permit angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Furthermore “damage control interventional radiography” uses a time-sensitive algorithm that prioritizes saving the life of a hemorrhaging patient, and may be performed for hemodynamically unstable patients after a traumatic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. A previous study revealed success rates of 91.6% for the patients in an embolization group and 66% for those in a surgically managed group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The death of patient 2 may have been caused by surgical invasion and bleedings associated with the procedures combined with the concomitant intravenously administered anticoagulant treatment (unfractionated heparin) under VA-ECMO. Thus, TAE may be superior to thoracotomy because it is less invasive, causes less bleeding, and selectively stops arterial bleeding earlier than surgery (for example, in patients 4 and 5). Hence, we recommend that TAE be considered before surgery in cases that involve VA-ECMO, although exceptions may be made for patients in whom a massive hematoma compresses the right atrium or superior vena cava (such as in patient 3). In these circumstances, surgical treatment may be required to remove the hematoma and facilitate VA-ECMO blood flow.\n\n【48】The activated partial thromboplastin time before the surgery or TAE was excessively prolonged in all cases except for patient 4. Thus, if CT reveals CPR-related injuries but no interventions are planned, delayed bleeding may develop in association with arterial spasm and hypotension. In such cases, it may be useful to normalize the patient’s coagulation status and perform careful systemic heparinization after starting VA-ECMO. The guidelines for extracorporeal life support recommend a heparin bolus (50 to 100 units/kg) at the time of cannulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, although this recommendation is not specific to ECPR. Furthermore, a retrospective study of VA-ECMO in patients with severe trauma with hemorrhagic shock revealed that the mean duration of heparin-free ECMO was 5 days, and that the patients did not experience thromboembolic events or unexpected blood clot formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Therefore, initially heparin-free ECPR may be optimal for reducing bleeding complications, and heparin could be administered after confirming that hemostasis has been achieved using angiography or repeat CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【50】Patients who are resuscitated after cardiac arrest should undergo contrast-enhanced CT as soon as possible to identify any CPR-related injuries, especially IMA injuries, and to determine the appropriate course of treatment. TAE may be superior to thoracotomy for treating IMA injuries, although a 3000-unit intravenous bolus of heparin may be redundant at the start of ECPR.\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CAG:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Coronary angiography</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPR:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ECMO:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ECPR:</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EMS:</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Emergency medical service</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hb:</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hemoglobin</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IABP:</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intra-aortic balloon pump</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ICA:</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intercostal artery</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IMA:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Internal mammary artery</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NBCA:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>N-butyl cyanoacrylate</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PCI:</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Percutaneous coronary intervention</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ROSC:</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Return of spontaneous circulation</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TAE:</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transcatheter arterial embolization</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VA-ECMO:</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VF:</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ventricular fibrillation</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Because of the high radiosensitivity of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, this condition can be controlled with radiotherapy of approximately 30 Gy alone. However, ovarian dysfunction as an adverse event of radiotherapy for pelvic lesions can become a problem in girls and women.

We used horizontally opposed pair fields for radiotherapy to minimize the irradiation to her endometrium and ovary. A total dose of 30.6 Gy was given in 17 fractions of 1.8 Gy by 10-Megavolt X-ray linear accelerator. As a result, one-third of her uterus and half of her ovary were outside the irradiation field. After approximately 1 year of treatment, positive pregnancy was confirmed and finally she safely gave birth to a baby girl without congenital abnormalities.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This report provides hope for girls and women who have undergone irradiation for pelvic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and who desire to bear children.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a low-grade B cell lymphoma, first identified by Isaacson and Wright in 1983 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This lymphoma can occur in various parts of the body, and half of all MALT lymphomas occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric MALT lymphoma is the most common gastrointestinal tract lymphoma, comprising 85% of all cases, and primary rectal MALT lymphoma is very rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Because of the low frequency of the disease, the optimal therapeutic strategy for primary non-gastric lymphomas is yet to be established; however, prognosis is good, and the 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates have been reported to be approximately 90% and 80%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Radiotherapy or surgical resection is considered to be a therapeutic strategy of limited stage MALT lymphomas, but because of the high radiosensitivity of MALT lymphomas, this condition can be controlled by radiotherapy of approximately 30 Gy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 8 \\]</u>. The present case was of a 28-year-old Japanese woman who desired to bear children. However, ovarian dysfunction as an adverse event of radiotherapy for pelvic lesions can become a serious problem. Here we report a case of a 28-year-old woman with rectal MALT lymphoma who safely gave birth to a baby following 30.6 Gy radiotherapy to her whole rectum.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 28-year-old Japanese woman became aware of bloody stools from August 2013 and visited a neighborhood clinic dedicated to internal medicine and digestive organs in September 2013. An initial examination by colonoscopy identified elevated lesions with mild bleeding in the Rb section of her rectum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. These rectal lesions were biopsied for analysis. Immunohistochemical investigation of the biopsy revealed that the proliferating cells were phenotypically characterized as CD20+, CD79a+, CD3−, CD5−, CD10−, and cyclin D1−. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as having MALT lymphoma. A complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl. Biochemical examination of her blood showed a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 102 IU/l and a soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level of 190 U/ml (reference value, 145 to 519 U/ml). Although her hemoglobin was slightly reduced, LDH and sIL-2R were within the normal range. She was referred to the Department of Gastroenterology of a general hospital in October 2013. No enlargement of regional nodes or distant metastasis was revealed by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Finally, she was diagnosed as having Lugano I rectal MALT lymphoma.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Colonoscopy showing elevated lesions with mild bleeding in the Rb section of the rectum\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】She was then introduced to our institute and initiated on radiotherapy. However, she expressed a desire to bear children and had some embryos frozen by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology before being admitted to our department in February 2014.\n\n【16】To achieve dose constraints of 12 Gy to her entire ovary, we used horizontally opposed pair fields for radiotherapy to minimize the irradiation to her endometrium and ovary. The irradiated field and dose distribution for this case are shown in Fig. 2a and b , respectively. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the whole rectum and it is shown in orange in Fig. 2a . The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as CTV plus 1 cm margin in all directions and it is shown in green. The ovary and uterus are shown in yellow and pink, respectively. A total dose of 30.6 Gy was given in 17 fractions of 1.8 Gy by 10-Megavolt X-ray linear accelerator to PTV and no chemotherapy was scheduled. As a result, one-third of her uterus and half of her ovary would be outside the irradiation field. A dose volume histogram is show in Fig. 3 . The mean dose received by her uterus and ovary was 22.5 Gy and 16.6 Gy, respectively. We determined that a hot area of a maximum of 130% spreading to the soft tissue (subcutaneous fat) was acceptable as the actual dose was 39.8 Gy. Mild radiation dermatitis (Grade 2) around her anus was observed as an acute adverse event.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】**a** The irradiation field.

A female hormone test revealed a reduction in estrogen level and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone level. She was thus diagnosed as having premature ovarian failure. Kaufmann therapy was then commenced. After approximately 1 year of treatment, positive pregnancy was confirmed (April 2015), and she revisited the clinic. A gestational sac was confirmed by ultrasound examination, and the second month of pregnancy was diagnosed. Surprisingly, she had conceived naturally. Finally, she safely gave birth to a baby girl without congenital abnormalities in October 2015.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Non-gastric MALT lymphomas can occur in the colon, lung, thyroid gland, salivary glands, mammary gland, and ophthalmologic fields. Primary rectal MALT lymphoma is a particularly rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of all MALT lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Rectal MALT lymphomas tend to show elevated lesions, such as polyps or submucosal tumors, during endoscopy, and our case presented with similar characteristic polypoid lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Because of the low incidence of the disease, conducting large clinical trials is difficult. Therefore, the optimal therapeutic strategy for this type of lymphoma is yet to be established, and therapeutic strategy is currently determined according to the lesion site or clinical stage. In the case of limited stage MALT lymphomas, local therapy, such as radiotherapy or surgery, is generally the principal course of action. However, MALT lymphomas can be well controlled by radiotherapy alone with approximately 30 Gy, and surgery is considered excessive with regard to organ preservation and the postoperative quality of life. The therapeutic strategy used in the present case was radiation therapy, and a total dose of 30.6 Gy was given in 17 fractions to the whole rectum. After 9 months of radiotherapy, our patient was endoscopically examined, and all the lesions had undergone complete remission. No severe gastrointestinal late adverse events, such as rectal bleeding, have yet been observed.\n\n【26】A critical point of this case was our patient’s desire to bear children, and we wanted to meet her desire, as well as gain good control over her rectal MALT lymphoma. However, when radiotherapy is focused onto the pelvic cavity, ovarian dysfunction as an adverse event of radiotherapy becomes a serious problem. Therefore, we performed radiotherapy using horizontally opposed pair fields, which goes against the era of three-dimensional radiotherapy. Our treatment procedure had two purposes. First, we tried to minimize the amount of irradiation exposure to her ovaries. Although she had frozen embryos stored, we wanted to preserve her ovarian function as much as possible in an effort to give her a chance of a natural pregnancy. Second, we attempted to minimize the amount of irradiation exposure to her endometrium, such that we could maximize the chance of normal implantation if she could not become pregnant naturally and needed to use her frozen embryos.\n\n【27】Schuck _et al_ . reported that when the whole ovary is irradiated more than 15 Gy, ovarian dysfunction occurs in almost all patients. In addition, when one side of the ovary is preserved, ovarian dysfunction occurs in approximately half of all patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The mean dose absorbed by the ovary in this patient’s case was 16.6 Gy, although our treatment procedure was successfully achieved by removing half of her ovary from the irradiation field. Therefore, half of her ovary was not completely irradiated, and we expected her ovarian function to be preserved with a probability of 50%. Following our procedure, she developed temporary ovarian dysfunction; Kaufmann therapy, a replacement therapy comprising estrogen and progesterone for ovarian amenorrhea, was commenced. We consider that preserving half of her ovary using horizontally opposed pair fields for radiotherapy was a key benefit in terms of ovulation and natural pregnancy. On the other hand, the tolerance dose of the endometrium is not yet known and, consequently, there is a potential risk of implantation disorders. Because we could not identify her endometrium by CT, the irradiation dose to her endometrium could not be determined using a dose volume histogram. However, we believe that removing one-third of her uterus from the irradiation field was a key contributor to retaining normal implantation, thereby leading to the safe birth of a baby girl. Although the full dose of 30.6 Gy was used to irradiate her vagina, she delivered her baby without any problem. Therefore, we consider a total dose of approximately 30 Gy does not cause adverse effects to the vagina.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】Here we report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a rectal MALT lymphoma who safely gave birth to a baby following 30.6 Gy radiotherapy to her whole rectum. This case involves several rare points. First, there is a low incidence of primary rectal MALT lymphoma among cases of MALT lymphoma. Second, ovarian function could be preserved by removing half of her ovary from the irradiation field using horizontally opposed pair fields. Finally, by removing one-third of her uterus from the irradiation field, we could preserve normal implantation, which enabled her to give birth naturally. We believe that this case is extremely rare and will be of global interest, and we are proud to be able to report the control of rectal MALT lymphoma and the safe birth of a healthy child in this 28-year-old woman.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The normal position of the parotid glands is anterior to and below the lower half of the ear; superficial, posterior, and deep to the ramus of the mandible. They are surrounded by the mastoid bone and the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly, the parotid fascia and the skin laterally, and the masseter muscle anteriorly, and extend to the parapharyngeal space medially 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Ectopia of the salivary system is defined by the presence of the salivary system components, whether a complete organ or nonorganized tissue, in a location other than their normal anatomic positions. This condition is a rare abnormality that has been reported very few times. In this review, we present a case of an ectopic parotid gland in a 45-year-old patient.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 45-year-old Middle-Eastern woman with no significant medical history presented to the clinic complaining of the presence of a painless mass inside the left side of her face, recently discovered.\n\n【13】On physical examination, an approximately 2 × 1 cm painless mass was palpated in the left cheek, which was not visible externally. No skin changes or signs of inflammation were present. She stated that she had not noticed the mass in her face before.\n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an isosignal to high signal well-defined mass measuring 23 × 10 mm in the left buccal fat, which was isosignal with the right parotid gland. The left parotid gland was not detected in the normal anatomic site 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】**A** Axial T1 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence MRI. The left parotid gland is not seen in the normal anatomic area (yellow arrow) and located in left buccal fat (red arrow). **B** Axial T2-weighted MRI.

The same mass with enhancement similar to the right parotid gland. **D** Coronal T1-weighted image, with the mass in left buccal fat (red arrow)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Based on the clinical and MRI findings, the diagnosis of ectopic parotid gland was considered for the patient. Since the patient had no other complaints regarding mastication or any other oral conditions and no complications were detected, she was dismissed with no further procedures as she did not consent to further investigations.\n\n【19】Discussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\n\n【20】Ectopic parotid gland is an extremely rare condition, with very few reports in the literature. More common cases of parotid ectopia include accessory glands and heterotopic gland tissue. The accessory gland is defined by the presence of an ectopic gland with a duct system, which is distinct from the main parotid gland, while heterotopic gland tissue is the presence of ectopic parotid tissue in other locations, without a duct system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The accessory parotid gland is usually located adjacent to, but separate from the main gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The most common reported locations for ectopic salivary gland tissue are the cervical lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, the middle ear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and periauricular area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, the bones of maxilla and mandible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>, and the soft tissues of the neck and mouth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. It has also been reported in association with some congenital anomalies and syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Our case presents a woman in her mid-40s, with a mass that brought no complaints except for the mere physical presence of the mass, and no complications. Interestingly, most of the previously reported cases involved patients of a young age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>, as expected in most congenital conditions; whereas in our case, the patient has lived through four decades without developing anything requiring medical attention. Moreover, reported cases are usually associated with complications such as fistulous ducts or malignant changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>, while our patient’s clinical and radiologic findings showed no signs of such complications, and thus removed the need for any further tests or evaluation. Also, nearly all of the reviewed cases discussed the ecptoia of salivary tissue or an “accessory” gland, with the main gland present in its normal location. There was one report that described cases of the main parotid gland’s ectopia similar to our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, but those cases were in young individuals associated with congenital anomalies of the maxillary region, which did not exist in our case. Another report of a 12-year-old female with a diagnosis of bilateral ectopic parotid glands was found, without coexisting anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Supposedly, these congenital abnormalities form within the period of fetal development. During embryogenesis, parotid glands begin to form in the sixth gestational week, from a tunnel-like structure within the mesenchyme of the primitive mouth, originating from ectoderm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. These invaginations are close to the adjacent lymphatic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. We hypothesize that it might be possible for these invaginations to then move alongside the lymphatic tissue, and later be placed and ultimately develop into the parotid glands in an ectopic locus. Further evaluation of future detected cases is necessary to obtain more information regarding this condition’s pathogenesis and possible etiologies. Most reported cases of parotid ectopia were associated with various congenital anomalies. Still, there were also reported cases of ectopia without coexisting conditions, as well as our case, suggesting that there might be other causes of parotid ectopia. There is a need for more reports of similar cases, as well as diagnostic and etiologic studies, to understand the cause of this condition further.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Alzheimer’s disease is commonly characterized by progressive impairment of recent memory. Primary progressive aphasia is also often observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, language-associated symptoms, such as primary progressive aphasia, are diverse and varied in Alzheimer’s disease. However, nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia is not generally considered a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. To date, there has been no longitudinal study of primary progressive aphasia in Japanese-speaking patients or in patients speaking other languages with pathologically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease. Here we present a longitudinal study of primary progressive aphasia in a Japanese patient pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 75-year-old Japanese man, whose wife reported that his memory was impaired, also suffered from suspected aphasia. He was pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease using <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography. Based on clinical observation and the results of the Japanese standard language test of aphasia, he was also diagnosed with nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia. During the subsequent 2 years, his cognitive impairment, aphasia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia progressed. Furthermore, progression of pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition was revealed through <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography. Although the results of \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography suggested corticobasal degeneration, this was not observed on the \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (DaTscan). A previous study had reported that Alzheimer’s disease with a nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia was accompanied by corticobasal degeneration; however, this was not true in our case.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This is possibly the first longitudinal study of nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia in a Japanese-speaking patient with pathologically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease, but without corticobasal degeneration.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which is caused by the deposition of pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein in the cerebral cortex. Currently, the pathological criterion for AD is limited to significant accumulation of pathologic amyloid-β deposits.\n\n【10】AD is commonly characterized by progressive recent memory impairment, alongside additional progressive symptoms such as visuospatial cognitive impairment, executive functional impairment, primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and behavioral psychiatric symptoms. Language-associated symptoms including PPA in AD are diverse and varied.\n\n【11】PPA can be classified into the following three types: nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA), semantic variant PPA (svPPA), and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, other types of PPA that cannot be classified into these three types (or a mixture of types) also exist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Different variants of aphasia may reportedly appear in AD, as follows: 100% of lvPPA is due to AD, 25% of mixed PPA is due to AD, and 4% of nfvPPA is due to AD complicated by corticobasal degeneration (CBD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal study of PPA in patients with pathologically diagnosed AD has been conducted to date. We present here a longitudinal study of nfvPPA in a Japanese-speaking patient pathologically diagnosed with AD.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 75-year-old Japanese man with suspected PPA visited our clinic, accompanied by his wife. He was a university graduate. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, which was controlled by a pacemaker, and diabetes, which was under control. His family medical history was not particularly remarkable. His family had recently observed memory impairment and stuttering in the patient, which prompted his visit to our clinic. During the medical interview, his speech was effortful with stuttering; however, inconsistent speech sound errors were not obvious.\n\n【15】The following tests were performed four times in total, at baseline, half a year after base line, 1 year after baseline, and 2 years after baseline 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Japanese version (ADAS-cog), frontal assessment battery, digit span of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (WAIS-III), logical memory subtest I of the Wechsler Memory Scale–Revised (WMS-R), logical memory subtest II of the WMS-R, copy of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCFT), delayed recall of the ROCFT, and the Japanese reading test. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was performed twice in interviews with his wife, both at 6 months and 2 years after baseline. The Japanese Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) was performed 6 months after baseline. The results are shown in Table 1 . The results of the logical memory subtest and ROCFT indicated that the patient’s verbal memory was severely impaired at baseline, and his visual memory impairment at baseline showed gradual worsening, respectively. The results of the MMSE and ADAS-cog showed worsening of general cognitive impairment. His behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia also showed progression, as revealed by the results of the NPI. The RCPM was performed once 6 months after the baseline; the patient scored 26 out of 36, which indicated nonverbal cognitive impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】**Table 1 The results of neurocognitive tests**\n\n【17】Full size table\n\n【18】The Japanese Standard Language Test of Aphasia (SLTA) was also performed at each of the four time points 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The SLTA was developed in Japan and consists of 26 items for evaluating aphasia; the test kit is commonly used and easily available in Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The results of the SLTA are shown in Table 2 . Scores worsened over the 2 years for all of the following subtests: auditory comprehension (ability to obey verbal commands), naming, verbal explanation of behavior of persons and movement of others in pictures, verbal explanation of Manga, verbal fluency, reading comprehension of short sentences (ability to point at pictures), reading comprehension (ability to obey written commands), writing words with Kana (ability to represent pictures), writing explanation of Manga, dictation of Kana letters, dictation of Kanji words, dictation of Kana words, dictation of short sentences, and four arithmetic operations on paper. All other subtest scores were stable throughout the 2 years. Scores for auditory comprehension of words (ability to point at pictures), word repetition, reading aloud Kana letters, reading aloud Kana words, reading comprehension of Kanji words (ability to point at pictures), and reading comprehension of Kana words (ability to point at pictures) showed no errors during the 2 years.\n\n【19】**Table 2 The results of all subtests of SLTA**\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】Briefly, the results of the SLTA showed impaired comprehension of syntactically complex sentences, whereas single word comprehension and object knowledge were spared. Additionally, the content of his speech during the SLTA subtest of verbal explanation of Manga showed that his agrammatism in language production had progressed. These clinical symptoms met the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of nfvPPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The results of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography ( <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT), <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET), and <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 (THK5351) PET at baseline and 2 years are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The MRI results showed global cerebral atrophy, which progressed during the 2 years 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. PiB-PET and THK5351 PET, which indicated pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition, did not show obvious laterality 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>; however, <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT imaging showed significant regional hypoperfusion dominantly in the left hemisphere, particularly in the bilateral parietal and temporal association cortex, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex, the frontal association cortex, and the occipital lobe, which suggested CBD 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. These figures showed that pathologic amyloid-β and tau protein deposition progressed during the 2 years, and that hypoperfusion also progressed during this period. The finding of <sup>18 </sup> F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy- d \\-glucose (FDG) PET at baseline was almost the same as that of <sup>123 </sup> I-IMP SPECT, that is, glucose uptake was decreased dominantly in the left hemisphere, particularly in the bilateral parietal and temporal association cortex, the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex, the frontal association cortex, and the occipital lobe, which also suggested CBD. There were no remarkable findings on either \\[123I\\] FP-CIT SPECT (DaTscans), which was performed twice.\n\n【23】**Fig. 1**\n\n【24】**a** and **b** are magnetic resonance images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively. **c** and **d** are \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography images showing hypoperfusion at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively, using statistical voxel-based analysis using three-dimensional stereotactic surface software.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 2**\n\n【27】**a** and **b** are <sup>11 </sup> C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively. **c** and **d** are <sup>18 </sup> F-THK5351 positron emission tomography images at baseline and 2 years after baseline, respectively.\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Collectively, taking into account all results, the patient was diagnosed with nfvPPA with definite AD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The patient also met the DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria for AD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The patient’s clinical features included occasional urinary incontinence, progression of personality and behavioral changes based on the NPI, limb-kinetic apraxia at around 6 months after baseline, some inability to recognize grandchildren and old friends at around 18 months after baseline, and progression of ideomotor apraxia. A score of 3 was found on the modified ranking scale both 6 months and 2 years after baseline. These clinical symptoms did not meet the criteria for CBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Neither the patient nor his spouse expected to receive any pharmacotherapy. We did not introduce speech and language therapy because it would have been painful for the patient. However, we advised the couple to use an elderly adult day-care center, and the patient regularly went to such a center near their home.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】We present the first longitudinal case study of nfvPPA in a patient with pathologically diagnosed AD. We observed nfvPPA in a patient who was pathologically diagnosed with AD based on PiB PET and THK5351 PET evaluations. This is not commonly observed; a previous study by Spinelli _et al_ . reported that there were cases of nfvPPA with AD and CBD but not with AD alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Furthermore, nfvPPA has recently been considered an exclusion criterion for probable AD dementia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This discrepancy may be because the criteria for agrammatism differ between Japanese and US/UK researchers owing to their distinct grammar systems.\n\n【32】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of a Japanese-speaking patient with PPA observed in pathologically definite AD, using SLTA. Aphasia in AD is not well understood and is often only discussed with other neurocognitive impairments that appear in AD. Only a few studies have investigated aphasia in detail using SLTA in only clinically diagnosed AD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Furthermore, PPA in neurodegenerative dementias other than AD have been investigated longitudinally using SLTA in only a few studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The results of both \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT SPECTs (DaTscans) indicated that there was no CBD. However, there have been studies of dopamine transporter binding in autopsy-confirmed CBD, one of which reported that it is possible that patients with CBD have delayed neuronal loss in the substantia nigra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Thus, our \\[ <sup>123 </sup> I\\] FP-CIT SPECT (DaTscan) results cannot be used to rule out CBD. However, considering that clinical features did not yet fully meet the criteria for CBD, our results also do not indicate CBD in our patient, although we believe that he might progress to CBD in the future. This is because the results of IMP SPECT, FDG PET, and nfvPPA suggested CBD. This type of progression is a feature of some dementias caused by neurodegenerative diseases. For example, patients who are diagnosed with AD initially sometimes progress to dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\n【34】Radiation to the skull from nuclear medicine imaging and cardiovascular risk factors, including atrial fibrillation, can precipitate the onset of dementia in the elderly. Also, diarrhea and subsequent frailty following internal exposure might lead to dementia, in which case dementia may be prevented by probiotic supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Our study had several limitations: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> we presented only one case of aphasia progression in a Japanese-speaking patient with AD, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> we used the SLTA to evaluate aphasia, including agrammatism.

Isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return with an intact atrial septum is even rarer, and this condition is usually treated surgically in younger patients. We describe isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return in a 65-year-old woman who was treated by caval division with pericardial patch baffling through a surgically created atrial septal defect and reconstruction of the superior vena cava using a prosthetic graft.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 65-year-old Asian woman who presented with exertional dyspnea was diagnosed with isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The surgical indications and strategy were controversial because of the rarity of this pathology. She had an indication for surgery because she was symptomatic and had a high ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow. We considered that surgical procedures should avoid postoperative stenosis of a reconstructed flow tract, sinus node dysfunction, and thrombogenesis. We created a caval division with pericardial patch baffling through a surgically created atrial septal defect and reconstructed the superior vena cava using a prosthetic graft for the isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. She has since remained free of exertional dyspnea, arrhythmia, and thrombotic complications. This surgical strategy is safe and effective for treating isolated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return in older symptomatic adults.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The long-term outcome of surgical repair of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return with an intact atrial septum in our patient, a symptomatic 65-year-old woman, was excellent.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) is a rare congenital heart disease that usually involves the right pulmonary vein (PV) and an atrial septal defect (ASD). Isolated PAPVR with an intact atrial septum is even rarer; thus, surgical indications and strategies remain controversial. Single- and double-patch techniques are effective for treating PAPVR. However, concerns have been raised regarding postoperative stenosis or obstruction of the reconstructed flow tract and sinus node (SN) dysfunction, particularly in PAPVR when the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) inflows into the upper superior vena cava (SVC). Few surgical reports have described an older adult with PAPVR accompanied by an intact atrial septum. We describe PAPVR repair using caval division, a surgically created ASD, and prosthetic reconstruction.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 65-year-old Asian woman was admitted with exertional dyspnea. She had a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease that had required transcatheter intervention. Her family history also included coronary artery disease. Her social history was unremarkable with respect to environmental and workplace exposures, and she did not smoke or consume alcohol. A physical examination upon admission revealed no signs of cardiac congestion or neurological deficits. Her vital signs were a systemic blood pressure of 143/86 mmHg, pulse rate of 89 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 35.9 °C. Chest x-rays at the time of admission showed cardiomegaly with protrusion of the right first aortic arch, and electrocardiography showed an incomplete right bundle branch block of normal sinus rhythm. Coronary angiography performed because of her history of coronary artery disease revealed no significant coronary arterial stenosis. However, a concurrent pressure study revealed oxygen step-up in gas sampling between the SVC and right atrium (RA) with a pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) of 2.07, even though pulmonary artery pressure was normal in the pressure study and the atrial septum was intact on echocardiography. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed that the RUPV flowed into the SVC 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> without any other congenital heart conditions, including an ASD and a dilated RA and right ventricle (RV). Isolated PAPVR was diagnosed on the basis of CT imaging findings, and surgery was indicated on the basis of the patient’s symptoms and the hemodynamic pressure findings.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography findings. **a** Dorsal view. **b** Image excluding right pulmonary artery. _Arrow_ indicates where right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) connects to the superior vena cava (SVC) rather than the left atrium (LA)\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】The surgical approach was via a median sternotomy. The SVC was cannulated near the confluence of the innominate vein, sufficiently above the RUPV. A cardiopulmonary bypass was established, and cardiac arrest was applied. The RA was incised longitudinally. The intact atrial septum was incised in the cranial direction from the superior aspect of the fossa ovalis, and this new ASD formed a hole with an approximate diameter of 15 mm after the right and left atrial endocardia were closed using continuous 5-0 polypropylene sutures 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. An intra-atrial baffle comprising an autologous pericardial patch was sutured from the inferior border of the new ASD to the cavoatrial junction to separate the cavity between the RA and the SVC 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. The SVC was divided above the confluence of the RUPV, and the cardiac side of the SVC stump was sutured closed. A new RUPV outflow route to the left atrium (LA) was subsequently constructed through the surgically created ASD. A cavoatrial pathway between the cranial side of the SVC stump and the right atrial appendage (RAA) was reconstructed using a ringed extended polytetrafluoroethylene (EPTFE) prosthesis with a diameter of 16 mm.\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Intraoperative imaging findings. **a** Surgically created atrial septal defect (ASD) and right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV) orifice. **b** Atrial division with autologous pericardial patch baffle\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】The patient tolerated all procedures well and was discharged with normal sinus rhythm after recovery from temporary sinus bradycardia. Anticoagulation therapy with oral warfarin was postoperatively prescribed for 3 months, which is standard procedure after bioprosthetic valve replacement. Postoperative echocardiography showed flow from RUPV to the LA through the new ASD without a significant pressure gradient or congestion. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed that the RUPV flowed into the LA through the new pathway without intracardiovascular thrombus 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The patient remains free of dyspnea, arrhythmia, and thrombotic events, and echocardiography at 4-year follow-up did not reveal evidence of stenosis or obstruction of the reconstructed pathway.\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】Postoperative computed tomography (CT) findings. **a** Left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA). \\*Surgically created atrial septal defect. **b** Three-dimensional CT shows new pathway from right upper pulmonary vein to LA ( _arrow_ )\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】The approximate overall incidence of congenital PAPVR is 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The most frequent type of PAPVR involves RUPV inflow into the SVC associated with an ASD in about 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The incidence of congenital PAPVR involving the right PV with an intact atrial septum is even lower. Isolated PAPVR is initially asymptomatic, but progressive right heart failure or pulmonary hypertension results in the emergence of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Because PAPVR is usually diagnosed and surgically treated in childhood, few surgical reports have described older adults who have PAPVR, particularly with an intact atrial septum.\n\n【25】The surgical indications and strategy for treating isolated PAPVR remain controversial because of its extremely low incidence. The hemodynamics and clinical features of isolated PAPVR seem to resemble those of ASD, and Majdalany _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u> stated that regardless of complexity, surgical repair should be considered for isolated PAPVR with signs of RV overload, because their series did not include any surgical mortality and morbidity rates were low. We selected surgical repair for our patient because she was symptomatic and had a dilated RV and high Qp/Qs in addition to the surgical indication for typical ASD.\n\n【26】Surgical repair for PAPVR aims to reestablish systemic and pulmonary circulation, and the strategy will vary depending on the anatomical characteristics of PAPVR. However, the key features of the strategy are as follows. The first is to reconstruct the SVC and PV to create a cavity that is sufficient to avoid stenosis or obstruction. The second is to protect the SN or the SN artery to avoid arrhythmia, particularly SN dysfunction, which sometimes requires permanent pacemaker implantation. The third is to prevent thrombosis associated with prostheses, which perhaps ought to be avoided for infants from the perspective of growth.\n\n【27】The single- or double-patch technique seems effective for low PAPVR when the RUPV interflows into the cardiac side of the SVC. A single patch is simpler and can be a first choice of surgical repair for low PAPVR; however, it could result in stenosis or obstruction of the SVC or PV flow tract for high PAPVR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A double patch could avoid stenosis or obstruction of the reconstructed pathway, but it might be associated with SN dysfunction and PV stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Williams _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> and Warden _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> originally described caval division in 1984. This procedure aims to maintain a sufficient cavity to avoid stenosis or obstruction of the SVC or PV flow tract and to protect SN function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. We applied this technique to our patient because the RUPV interflow to the SVC was higher than at the cavoatrial junction with a large orifice. In addition, a congenital ASD that accompanies PAPVR is allowed to remain open to allow a rerouted pathway. Therefore, a new ASD should be surgically created to repair an isolated PAPVR, and the position and extent of such an ASD should play an important role in the rerouted hemodynamics. We created an ASD in the cranial position from the cranial margin of the fossa ovalis, considering the length of reconstructed pulmonary drain. Suturing the left and right atrial endocardia seemed to help maintain the circular form of the ASD, which postoperative echocardiography showed was free of both congestion and a pressure gradient. Direct suture of the SVC to the RAA or reconstruction with a conduit of autologous pericardial patch or an atrial pedicle flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u> should be considered, particularly for infants. However, the cranial SVC stump was inadequate to reach the RAA in our patient, and thus a prosthesis was used for reconstruction. In addition, the EPTFE graft provided an antithrombogenic effect. The long-term outcomes of caval division should be good, but although this procedure was safe and effective, it also carried the risk of postoperative PV-LA flow tract stenosis, as well as baffle leakage and obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Careful periodic follow-up is thus needed after these procedures.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【29】We surgically repaired PAPVR with an intact atrial septum using caval division with pericardial patch baffling, a surgically created ASD, and SVC reconstruction using a prosthetic graft in a symptomatic older adult with an excellent long-term outcome.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ASD:</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Atrial septal defect</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EPTFE:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Extended polytetrafluoroethylene</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LA:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Left atrium</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PAPVR:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PV:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pulmonary vein</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Qp/Qs:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow ratio</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RA:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Right atrium</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RAA:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Right atrial appendage</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RUPV:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Right upper pulmonary vein</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RV:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Right ventricle</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SN:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Sinus node</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SVC:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Superior vena cava</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

CPC is categorized as grade III according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, which is based on histological characteristics (cellularity, mitotic activity, pleomorphism, necrosis, and endothelial proliferation), and it is the most aggressive among choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The incidence of CPTs is ~0.4–1% with probable occurrence within less than 2 years of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Most of the CPCs reported so far are in pediatric patients and have been rarely reported in adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. Here, we report a case of CPC with leptomeningeal spread in a 46-year-old man.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】This case report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital (approval no. SCHCA 2018-05-051), which waived the requirement for informed consent. A 46-year-old South Korean (East Asian) man visited the hospital with back pain that started 3 months back. The patient had several supportive therapies for sustained low back pain at another hospital, but the treatments were not effective. When the patient first visited the hospital, he complained of headache, diplopia, and sensory change of right arm and face in addition to low back pain. Multiple nodular mass lesions were observed around cauda equina on spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken at the other hospital. MRI with gadolinium enhancement revealed heterogeneous enhancing masses in the left cerebrum, bilateral cerebellum, and whole spinal canal, in particular diffuse wall enhancement in posterior and temporal horn of left lateral ventricle. Diffusion and perfusion MRI showed increased cerebral blood flow and high cellularity in the left cerebral mass lesions 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig 1 )</u>. <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan showed no hypermetabolic lesions, thereby ruling out suspicious primary neoplasms. The patient underwent surgery via left occipital craniotomy. The tumor was a mildly firm, pinkish mass with calcified multilobulations 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. The medial part of the mass was calcified and well-bounded, but the other part invaded normal brain parenchyma. A subtotal resection of the solid tumor was achieved, and histologic examination was performed. Papillary architecture lined by atypical tumor cells and extensive necrosis was noted 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u>. A high-power view demonstrated highly atypical tumor cells with increased mitosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 b)</u>. We performed additional immunostaining, showing that CK7 was positive, CK20 was negative, and P53 was strongly positive. TTF-1 immunodeficiency dyeing was performed to distinguish metastatic central nervous system (CNS) adenocarcinoma of the lung. Consequently, the probability of metastatic adenocarcinoma originating in the lung was ruled out, because TTF-1 was negative. Based on these observations, the patient was diagnosed with CPC, WHO grade III.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans ( **a** – **e** ).

The patient underwent a simulation computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast enhancement at the supine position. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) treatment was planned divided into three parts: brain, upper spine, and lower spine. To minimize bone marrow suppression, we proceeded to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. After ten fractions of CSI, gap moving was performed to prevent a hot-spot region from occurring in the field gap. CSI was performed up to a total of 36 Gy in 20 fractions followed by boost radiation therapy of 18 Gy in 10 fractions for a remnant lesion in the brain. The patient showed improvement of motor grade of lower extremities from grade 1-2 to 2-3 at the end of radiotherapy. After the end of treatment, follow-up MRI images taken during radiation therapy revealed a mild decrease in tumor size. The patient completed the CSI dose scheme without any special side effects except for a period of 2 days during radiation therapy because of intermediated bone marrow suppression. During this period, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) decreased to 840/μl, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF) was injected. After completion of the treatment, the patient underwent rehabilitation. While considering adjuvant chemotherapy, aspiration pneumonia occurred. Unfortunately, the patient died 4 months after diagnosis and surgery, or 1 month after radiotherapy completion, as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【22】**Fig. 4**\n\n【23】Craniospinal irradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan.

The patient reported in this paper was in his mid-40s with no previous medical history. It is well known that maximal surgical resection in CPC majorly influences the overall survival and progression-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. However, CPC is often accompanied by leptomeningeal seeding at the time of initial diagnosis because of its ability to spread well into the spinal canal along the ventricle. In this report, the tumor masses of the patient were disseminated in the brain and spinal cord canal at the time of the initial diagnosis. Adjuvant radiation therapy was performed about 3 weeks after surgery.\n\n【27】A few studies have reported that radiation therapy leads to better clinical outcome in patients with CPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. However, the radiation field of CPC is a topic of debate. In this patient, CSI followed by boost RT was processed because the gross tumor had spread to the whole spinal canal, and tumor progression outside the treatment field was more than half. Mazloom _et al_ . reported that CSI has better overall survival and progression-free survival rate than whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT), with statistical significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Furthermore, Fabi _et al_ . concluded that CSI could be more effective than chemotherapy when leptomeningeal seeding is present. Even in our case, radiation therapy was found to be effective for CPC, but it is contemplated that further consideration of the optimal radiation dose and treatment field will be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Although the best chemotherapy regimen for CPC is still unknown, a report revealed long-term outcomes while applying temozolomide (TMZ) in CPC patient with MGMT methylation, while another report showed no effect of TMZ in the absence of MGMT methylation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 14 \\]</u>. In our case, TMZ-based chemotherapy did not proceed in the patient because MGMT methylation was negative in the patient. In the near future, a comparative study of TMZ with etoposide, which has been proven effective in a previous study, is also needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. Also, it is necessary to study the role of intrathecal chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. As it is difficult to perform randomized controlled trials on rare carcinomas such as CPC, diverse experiences of CPC in different institutions should be reported and shared. In particular, additional research on optimal radiation field and dose and suitable chemotherapy regimen is needed.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the present study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPC:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Choroid plexus carcinoma</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LMS:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Leptomeningeal spread</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CSI:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Craniospinal irradiation</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ARDS:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPTs:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Choroid plexus tumors</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IMRT:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TMZ:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Temozolomide</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

When _Leptospira_ are excreted into the environment, they are able to survive for several months in water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, which constitutes an important source of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Humans are usually infected by contact with urine-contaminated water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. _Leptospira_ enter the human body by penetration of damaged skin or via oral, genital, or conjunctival mucous membranes, and they are hematogenously disseminated afterward 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Disease manifestations vary from mild or asymptomatic to severe illness with multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Patients with leptospirosis typically present with fever, headache, and myalgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, but symptoms of any organ may be apparent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Severe forms include meningitis, pulmonary hemorrhage with respiratory failure, or Weil’s disease characterized by jaundice, bleeding, and renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Leptospirosis may mimic other infectious diseases, such as influenza, viral hepatitis, brucellosis, infectious mononucleosis, malaria, or dengue, depending on the setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, or even bacterial or viral meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. A recent review on leptospirosis meningitis revealed that almost all patients (N = 366 adults) presented with fever (98%), headache (94%), and neck stiffness (93%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The authors of that review found that the patients’ median age was 33 years, that most were male, and that the majority were believed to have acquired the infection from their work environment, with others contracting it after contact with fresh water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. There were no cases of transmission from pets. In this report, we describe a case of leptospirosis meningitis in a young, previously healthy woman who was most likely infected by her pet mouse.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 27-year-old Caucasian woman with an unremarkable medical history was admitted to a local hospital because of 1 week of fever, lower back pain, and cough. Since her fifth day of disease, she had experienced severe headache, ear and eye pain, and yellowish eyes. Further complaints included nausea, vomiting, dark urine, and diarrhea with pale stools. The patient had no recent travel history but had mice as pets, and one had fallen ill with conjunctivitis 1.5 months prior to the onset of the patient’s symptoms. Because of the patient’s symptoms and relevant exposure, leptospirosis and meningitis were suspected, and she was transferred to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet.\n\n【12】On admission, the patient’s physical examination revealed neck stiffness, conjunctivitis, and icteric sclera. Her blood pressure was 113/65 mmHg, heart rate was 79 beats/minute, temperature was 38.1 °C, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% without oxygen supplementation. Her laboratory examination showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.3 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 198 mg/L, along with increased liver function test values (alanine aminotransferase 186 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 359 U/L, γ-glutamyl transferase 624 U/L, and bilirubin 50 U/L) and hypoalbuminemia of 27 g/L. The results of the patient’s abdominal ultrasound and chest radiography were both normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated leukocytes at 213 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> (56% polymorphonuclear cells), lactic acid at 2.7 mmol/L, glucose at 3.4 mmol/L, and protein at 0.55 g/L. The result of her CSF culture was negative. Her blood and urine were examined on day 7 of disease with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that showed negative results for leptospirosis. However, the result of her microagglutination test (MAT) on day 11 of disease was positive and demonstrated strongest reactivity against _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar _sejroe_ with antibody titers of 3000, increasing to 10,000 on day 22 of disease. Conventional blood cultures were collected before the antibiotic treatment was initiated, but urine culture and lumbar puncture were done after 1 day of treatment. The patient was initially empirically treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and then briefly shifted to a bacterial meningitis regimen with ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Because of suspected leptospirosis, the patient was treated with 2 g of ceftriaxone intravenously for 7 days, and her condition improved. After 1 week of hospitalization, the patient was discharged without any sequelae. Figure 1 illustrates the antibiotic treatment in relation to CRP level during 1 week of hospitalization.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Antibiotic treatment and C-reactive protein during hospitalization\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】We report a case of leptospirosis meningitis in a previously healthy young woman who was most likely infected by her pet mouse. In a recently published surveillance and outbreak report, six cases of leptospirosis transmission from pet rodents to humans were retrospectively recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The median age of the patients was 31 years, and four of six cases were in women. One case was meningitis/meningoencephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. A literature review revealed only four previous case reports about transmission of leptospirosis from pets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 \\]</u>, all of which were cases involving pet rats, and no cases were of meningitis. Though rare, these cases highlight the need for awareness of possible leptospirosis transmission from pets.\n\n【18】Leptospirosis has a wide range of disease manifestations and may mimic many other infectious diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, which could potentially lead to misdiagnoses or doctor’s delay. Our patient had disseminated disease with symptoms arising from several organs. Leptospirosis was suspected because the patient had pet mice, and she was treated according to this suspicion. Prior to the onset of our patient’s symptoms, one of her pet mice had fallen ill with conjunctivitis. Unfortunately, the mouse was killed before being tested for leptospirosis. The incubation time for leptospirosis is 2–30 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>, and the patients typically present with fevers and headache 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, which are also symptoms that could represent a central nervous system infection. Despite these frequent symptoms, meningitis is present in only around 20% of leptospirosis cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 20 \\]</u>. According to the literature, leptospirosis meningitis often affects young adults with no serious concurrent medical diseases, and the prognosis is usually good 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In our patient’s case, CSF showed elevated WBC with a small predominance of polymorphonuclear cells, but we were not able to detect _Leptospira_ in CSF by culture or real-time PCR, consistent with the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 21 \\]</u>, nor did we succeed in detecting leptospires in blood or urine. The timing of the PCR test is very important for the identification of leptospires because they are detectable only in the blood and CSF during the first week and in the urine after 2–3 weeks of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. We might have conducted testing too late to detect _Leptospira_ in the patient’s blood and CSF and too early to detect it in the urine. The advantage of PCR, which is widely used, is that it has both high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (93%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, though this varies, depending on the specific PCR assay used, the time when it is used in the disease course, and if it is used before antibiotics have been initiated. The downside of the PCR test is the narrow window of detectability in the disease course and the fact that the test does not provide information on _Leptospira_ serogroup _._ The diagnostic “gold standard” is MAT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>, which measures antibody titers to specific _Leptospira_ serovars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Antibodies are usually not detectable until days 7–10 of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. An MAT result is considered positive when titers are > 100, and, more importantly, the diagnosis is confirmed if there is an approximately fourfold rise in titers in paired sera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In our patient’s case, the clinical diagnosis was substantiated by the positive MAT result. Challenges regarding current diagnostics probably contribute to the disease’s being underreported, as stated by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In addition, serologic studies show much higher seropositive case rates than reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. Only a fraction of patients with leptospirosis are hospitalized, because many infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have mild flulike symptoms, and these cases might not be diagnosed or reported to the authorities.\n\n【19】Though easily manageable if recognized in time, the disease can still be lethal, which is why accurate diagnostics and proper treatment are essential. The recommended treatment is intravenous penicillin or ceftriaxone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. Our patient responded well to both piperacillin-tazobactam and the subsequent week of ceftriaxone intravenously.\n\n【20】This risk of acquiring leptospirosis from pet rodents should be followed closely, especially because pet rodents have become more popular over the past few decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. Being a pet rat owner is highly associated with risk of acquiring leptospirosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. We never found the source of infection, and how our patient’s mouse was infected therefore remains unknown. Pet rodents bought in pet shops should be disease-free, which is why there may be a future need for screening pets for zoonosis, such as leptospirosis. One minor possible intervention could be to provide informational material about how to reduce transmission likelihood to new pet rodent owners, as also suggested by others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【22】This case report underlines that pet rodents may be sources of leptospirosis. Our findings emphasize that leptospirosis meningitis should be considered in patients with meningeal symptoms who have pet rodents. Obtaining a thorough medical history is essential, including information on animal exposure as well as establishing a timeline of the patient’s symptoms in order to use the proper diagnostics at the right time.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CRP:</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>C-reactive protein</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CSF:</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cerebrospinal fluid</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MAT:</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Microagglutination test</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PCR:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Polymerase chain reaction</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cell count</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This aggressive histologic subtype of peripheral T cell lymphomas is frequently susceptible to exposure of Epstein–Barr virus infection. The optimal treatment is not well elucidated. For stage IV disseminated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma, induction chemotherapy with consolidative autologus or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended as the major first-line treatment. However, there is controversy over which type of chemotherapy is most appropriate and effective as a bridge to autologus or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed disseminated advanced-stage or relapsed extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma because of cancer chemoresistance or associated complications. Pralatrexate is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved novel agent for the treatment of refractory/recurrent peripheral T cell lymphomas. In our case, pralatrexate was used as a successful bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with advanced-stage disseminated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma refractory to first-line chemotherapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We presented a case report of a 29-year-old Asian man diagnosed as having stage IV disseminated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma, nasal type, with skin and bone marrow involvement, whose disease was primary refractory to first-line dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide chemotherapy, but obviously responded to treatment with two cycles of single-agent pralatrexate treatment. Monitoring Epstein–Barr virus viremia revealed dramatic downregulation. In addition to complete remission of the involvement of bone marrow and nasal cavity, skin involvement also obtained partial remission. The extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma successfully achieved complete remission after a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This is the first study to present pralatrexate as a successful bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a 29-year-old Asian male patient with advanced-stage extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma refractory to first-line dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide chemotherapy. This case provides a novel treatment opinion for extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma, especially for the Far East Asian population.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is one of the more common subtypes of mature T cell lymphoma, an aggressive subtype of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), which occurs predominantly in non-nodal sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Most extranodal natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphomas (ENKL), nasal type, frequently involve the skin, soft tissue, aerogastrointestinal tract, and testis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. ENKL is associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive infiltration in lymphoid tissue or viremia and occurs more commonly in Asian and South American populations than in Western populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The quantification of circulating plasma EBV DNA can be used to monitor the treatment response of ENKL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Not only do patients with ENKLs have a poor survival rate at 5 years, ranging from 37.9 to 45.3%, but ENKLs also show easy resistance to chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Because ENKL is often resistant to anthracycline-based chemotherapy, regimens based on asparaginase and PEG-asparaginase, such as the dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide (SMILE) regimen, have been effective as first-line therapy for nasal type ENKL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The outcomes for advanced or relapsed/refractory ENKL remain poor, however, particularly once the disease becomes refractory to first-line SMILE chemotherapy. The survival of patients receiving second-line therapy averages less than 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Pralatrexate (PDX) is a novel drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. PDX was developed as a synthetic antimetabolite folate analog and had a higher potency than methotrexate in competitively inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. The recommended dose of PDX is 30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> once weekly for 6 weeks in a 7-week cycle until disease progresses or there is unacceptable toxicity for PTCL that may require dose reduction or discontinuation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) can be used as a first-line treatment to prevent relapse of advanced ENKL or as salvage treatment after chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Guidelines from the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation supported the use of both autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and AHSCT for chemosensitive relapsed disease in localized ENKL or as a front-line consolidation therapy for disseminated ENKL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. However, there is controversy over which type of HSCT is most appropriate in patients with advanced-stage or relapsed ENKL. For disseminated ENKL with bone marrow involvement, it is very difficult to collect enough autologous stem cells or avoid cancer stem cell harvesting. Until now, though, there remains a lack of effective first-line treatments for newly diagnosed ENKL or a bridge to AHSCT for relapsed/refractory ENKL. PDX provides a new option for salvage therapy or a bridge to AHSCT in patients with refractory or relapsed ENKL. Here we report what we believe to be the first successful use of PDX as a bridge to AHSCT for the treatment of a patient with advanced-stage disseminated ENKL, nasal type, which was refractory to first-line SMILE chemotherapy.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 29-year-old Asian man experienced rhinorrhea, intermittent fever up to 40 ºC (104 °F) two to three times per week, and multiple progressive non-itchy papules on his face and trunk since September 2015. He was treated for chronic atopic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis without obvious improvement after multiple courses of antibiotics since April 2016.\n\n【14】In February 2017, a nasopharyngoscopy revealed necrotic tissue in bilateral nasal cavities and septal perforation. Biopsies were completed for both nasal and skin lesions. The pathology of the skin lesions revealed many small lymphocytic infiltrates in the perivascular area with positive EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) stain. The scattered EBER-positive small lymphocytes were also positive for CD3, CD56, and TIA-1 stains and negative for CD20. Numerous reactive T cells were also noted to be positive: CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>; nasal lesions showed a similar picture. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed 20% small lymphoid cells with special stains similar to skin lesions. A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan revealed increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in his bilateral nasal cavity, bilateral neck level I and II lymph nodes, and bilateral axillary regions. EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for peripheral blood showed a viral load of 15,174 copies/mL. He was diagnosed as having ENKL, nasal type, with an Ann Arbor clinical stage of IV.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】The scattered Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small RNA-positive small lymphocytes were also positive for CD3, CD56, and TIA-1 stains and negative for CD20. _EBER_ Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small RNA, _H/E_ hematoxylin and eosin\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】In March 2017, he underwent systemic chemotherapy with the SMILE regimen (etoposide 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 2–4; ifosfamide 1500 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1–3; mesna 900 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 2–4; methotrexate 2000 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on day 1; dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4; and L-asparaginase 6000 U/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20). Cycles were repeated every 28 days. He received two cycles of SMILE, each complicated by intermittent fever after neutropenic recovery, progressive skin lesions, and rebounding EBV viremia during the chemotherapy window. At this point, his ENKL was noted to be primary refractory to the SMILE regimen; therefore, he received two cycles of PDX 30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 in a PDX clinical trial. After two cycles of PDX, a partial remission of skin lesions and complete remission of nasal lesions, neck lymphadenopathies, and bone marrow were documented.\n\n【19】He then underwent a matched unrelated AHSCT. After AHSCT, his disease achieved complete remission. Follow-up of EBV viremia showed significant decrease 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. The skin lesions on our patient’s face and trunk also revealed complete remission 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. A follow-up PET-CT scan of his nasal lesions and lymphadenopathies showed complete metabolic response after one cycle of PDX and maintained complete response (CR) after AHSCT 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. He suffered from progressive acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) with overall grade III and refractory to steroid (2 mg/kg per day) since January 2018. After we administered tocilizumab and sirolimus to our patient, aGVHD was gradually controlled. However, local recurrence of left nasal cavity without new lymphadenopathy, skin involvement, and bone marrow invasion was noticed in March 2018. Local radiotherapy with 5000 cGy/25 fractions to the relapse lesion and 4500 cGy/25 fractions to bilateral nasal cavities were administered. PET-CT revealed complete remission of nasal cavity in September 2018. However, one ulcerative skin lesion on his right forearm was noted. A biopsy showed ENKL, nasal type. Therefore, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with gemcitabine, Leunase (L-asparaginase), and oxaliplatin (GeLOX) regimen for four cycles and local radiotherapy with 5000 cGy/20 fractions to his right forearm lesion were administered until December 2018. The skin lesion revealed good healing without progression. We also gave low-dose nivolumab (20 mg) every month for maintenance therapy until January 2020. A follow-up of PET-CT, EBV viremia, skin lesion, and bone marrow showed no evidence of disease relapse.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】Epstein–Barr virus viremia showed significant decrease at follow-up. _AHSCT_ allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, _EBV_ Epstein–Barr virus, _PCR_ polymerase chain reaction, _SMILE_ dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】**Fig. 3**\n\n【24】Skin lesions of face and trunk at diagnosis ( **a** ) and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( **b** ) revealed complete remission\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans for nasal lesions and lymphadenopathies showed complete metabolic response after one cycle of pralatrexate and maintained the response after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. _AHSCT_ allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, _SMILE_ dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【30】The treatment for advanced-stage disseminated ENKL, nasal type, is very challenging for clinicians. Because ENKL cells are associated with a high expression of P-glycoprotein, which causes multidrug resistance and could contribute to the poor response associated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, we opted to use the SMILE regimen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Once ENKL is deemed primary refractory to first-line chemotherapy, the prognosis is very poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Although AHSCT is a potentially curative therapy with the possibility of disease relapse prevention, salvage chemotherapy with an effective treatment as a bridge to AHSCT is not well understood, especially for advanced-stage nasal type ENKL. Most patients often die of disease progression, infections, or associated complications after failure of first-line chemotherapy.\n\n【31】Our patient received a total of two cycles of SMILE chemotherapy and was unfortunately considered primary refractory to this therapy. He demonstrated a potentially excellent therapeutic effect of PDX in a patient with stage IV ENKL, nasal type, refractory to first-line SMILE. Through a bridge of PDX, he ultimately underwent AHSCT, leading to complete remission of disease. This is the first presentation to explore PDX as a successful bridge to AHSCT in a patient with advanced-stage ENKL refractory to first-line SMILE chemotherapy.\n\n【32】Circulating EBV DNA levels have been observed to be important for prognostication in NKTCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now recommends monitoring EBV DNA load and calculation of Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma (PINK) or Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma with Epstein–Barr Virus DNA (PINK-E) as part of the initial workup for ENKL. These recommendations are based on a retrospective study that analyzed EBV DNA in 328 patients and determined that a detectable EBV DNA titer was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.A prospective observational study in patients with NKTCL treated with an asparaginase-based therapy determined that pretreatment EBV DNA levels correlated with a lower rate of CR, and post-treatment EBV DNA levels were a prognostic factor for both progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (in patients with CR, post-treatment EBV DNA positivity correlated with inferior PFS and OS; _p_ < 0.0001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Similarly, another study found that higher levels of pretreatment EBV DNA predicted poor response rates to the SMILE regimen, indicating that the pretreatment EBV DNA level may be a positive predictive marker for response after asparaginase-based treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. If these findings are validated in future prospective clinical trials, patients with high pretreatment EBV DNA levels may benefit from more intensive treatments or novel drugs other than asparaginase-based therapy. In our patient, the EBV viral load rebounded during failure to SMILE with progressive generalized symptoms and skin lesions, but showed a significant downregulation of plasma EBV viral titer from the point of PDX therapy. An undetectable plasma EBV viral titer was noticed after AHSCT. The improvement of EBV viremia in our patient was also compatible with continuous clinical disease control.\n\n【33】In summary, our case demonstrates the successful use of PDX as a successful bridge to AHSCT, which played an integral role in our patient’s overall outcome, leading to complete disease remission. Due to the rarity of ENKL, it is unlikely that randomized trials will be conducted; however, based on our case’s outcome, we believe that this therapeutic schema warrants further evaluation to expand treatment options available to patients with advanced relapsed/refractory nasal type ENKL.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>aGVHD:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute graft-versus-host disease</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AHSCT:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CCRT:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CR:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Complete response</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EBER:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small RNA</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EBV:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Epstein–Barr virus</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ENKL:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FDG:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fluorodeoxyglucose</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GeLOX:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Gemcitabine, Leunase (L-asparaginase), and oxaliplatin</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HSCT:</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NCCN:</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National Comprehensive Cancer Network</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NK:</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Natural killer</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NKTCL:</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Natural killer/T cell lymphoma</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>OS:</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Overall survival</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PCR:</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Polymerase chain reaction</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PDX:</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pralatrexate</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PET:</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positron emission tomography</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PFS:</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Progression-free survival</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PINK:</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PINK-E :</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma with Epstein–Barr Virus DNA</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PTCL:</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Peripheral T cell lymphoma</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SMILE:</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We report a case demonstrating the limitations of these modalities, especially the inability of functional imaging to help localize the site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 37-year-old Arabian woman presented with 12 months of progressive Cushing's syndrome-like symptoms. Biochemical evaluation confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone -dependent Cushing's syndrome. However, the anatomical site of her excess adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion was not clearly delineated by further investigations. Magnetic resonance imaging of our patient's pituitary gland failed to demonstrate the presence of an adenoma. Spiral computed tomography of her chest only revealed the presence of a non-specific 7 mm lesion in her left inferobasal lung segment. Functional imaging, including a positron emission tomography scan using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and gallium-68-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide, also failed to show increased metabolic activity in the lung lesion or in her pituitary gland. Our patient was commenced on medical treatment with ketoconazole and metyrapone to control the clinical features associated with her excess cortisol secretion. Despite initial normalization of her urinary free cortisol excretion rate, levels began to rise eight months after commencement of medical treatment. Repeated imaging of her pituitary gland, chest and pelvis again failed to clearly localize a source of her excess adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. The bronchial nodule was stable in size on serial imaging and repeatedly reported as having a nonspecific appearance of a small granuloma or lymph node. We re-explored the treatment options and endorsed our patient's favored choice of resection of the bronchial nodule, especially given that her symptoms of cortisol excess were difficult to control and refractory. Subsequently, our patient had the bronchial nodule resected. The histological appearance of the lesion was consistent with that of a carcinoid tumor and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor stained strongly positive for adrenocorticotropic hormone. Furthermore, removal of the lung lesion resulted in a normalization of our patient's 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion rate and resolution of her symptoms and signs of hypercortisolemia.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case report demonstrates the complexities and challenges in diagnosing the causes of adrenocorticotropic hormone -dependent Cushing's syndrome. Functional imaging may not always localize the site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The diagnostic efficacy of biochemical and imaging modalities for localizing the anatomical site of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion are limited. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), using the ligand 111-indium-pentetreotide, has traditionally been the functional imaging technique used, but it's usefulness has been questioned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using gallium-68-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC) has been reported to be a superior modality for detecting neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, here we describe a case where this functional imaging technique failed to localize the site of ectopic ACTH secretion.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 37-year-old Arabian woman was referred to our endocrinology clinic with 12 months of progressive weight gain of 30 kg, hirsutism, acne, alopecia, lethargy, amenorrhea and marked anxiety. An examination revealed features of Cushing's syndrome with rounded face, buffalo hump, abdominal striae and proximal muscle weakness. Investigations confirmed excess cortisol production. Her 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion was 1870 nmol/day (normal range 40-450 nmol/day), her midnight salivary cortisol level was 121 nmol/L (normal range < 9 nmol/L) and after a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test her serum cortisol level was 597 nmol/L (expected value < 50 nmol/L). Her serum ACTH level was elevated at 55.8 and 55.1 ng/L on two separate occasions (normal range 7-63.2 ng/L), consistent with a diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her pituitary gland did not reveal the presence of an adenoma.\n\n【12】Localizing the source of excess ACTH secretion was challenging. Inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) sampling was difficult due to a left petrosal sinus anatomical variation. However, it demonstrated a central to peripheral ACTH gradient of less than three, consistent with ectopic ACTH secretion. This diagnosis was supported by failure of cortisol suppression (472 nmol/L) after an 8 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Computed tomography (CT) of her chest, abdomen and pelvis only revealed a well circumscribed 7 mm left inferior basal lung segment lesion. This was reported to most likely represent a benign granuloma or a small lymph node 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】**Transverse image of a chest CT scan showing a small 7 mm inferobasal segment lesion (arrow) in the left lower lobe** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】Due to the wide range in sensitivity and specificity of the high dose dexamethasone suppression test (59-92% and 67-100%, respectively) and the inability to successfully catheterize her left IPS, further dynamic biochemical tests were performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. A five-hour intravenous dexamethasone test suppressed her serum cortisol level at five hours to less than 70% of basal values and a peripheral corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) test showed a 58% increase in ACTH levels from baseline. Contrary to preceding results, these findings could be interpreted to suggest the presence of a pituitary source for her excess ACTH secretion. However, PET scanning using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and gallium-68-DOTATOC failed to show increased metabolic activity in the lung lesion or in her pituitary gland.\n\n【17】Serial CT scanning of her chest, abdomen and pelvis over 18 months failed to definitively localize a source of ectopic ACTH production. The well circumscribed 7 mm left inferior basal lung segment lesion was reported as stable in size over this time. A repeat MRI of her pituitary gland once again did not reveal the presence of an adenoma.\n\n【18】Given the failure of biochemical or imaging techniques to localize the site of excess ACTH secretion, medical therapy was initiated with ketoconazole. However, combination treatment with metyrapone was required after eight months due to rising 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and progressive symptoms of weight gain, lethargy, depression and anxiety. Despite combination medical therapy there was still a progressive rise in 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. As a result, our patient again developed florid symptoms of weakness, depression and anxiety which limited her daily activities and interpersonal relationships.\n\n【19】**Figure 2**\n\n【20】**Pattern of 24-hour urinary free cortisol secretion (normal range: 25-360 nmol/day) in response to various treatment modalities** . Note the horizontal axis is not to scale.\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Given the failure of medical therapy to control her symptoms, other potential treatment options were discussed with our patient. These included progressing to bilateral adrenalectomy or resection of the lung lesion, which was the only possible anatomical site of ectopic ACTH secretion located so far. Unfortunately, the lung lesion was reported to be lying adjacent to the pericardium which negated a minimally invasive surgical approach to remove it. Despite this our patient still strongly favored proceeding to resection of the lung lesion even though this would require an open procedure. Hence, an open thoracotomy to remove the lung lesion was performed 18 months after her initial presentation.\n\n【23】Histological examination of the resected nodule showed a 9 mm well circumscribed tumor surrounding a bronchus, with features consistent with a carcinoid tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor stained strongly positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin and ACTH. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and perioperative corticosteroid replacement was progressively weaned. Clinically, her symptoms of Cushing's syndrome slowly abated. She achieved a normal 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion off all treatment four months after surgery. Our patient remains well with no clinical or biochemical evidence of cortisol excess seven months after her surgery.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】This case illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing a pituitary or an ectopic source of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. A wide variability in the sensitivity and specificity of current biochemical dynamic tests has been reported 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. None of the current diagnostic tests are able to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic ACTH syndrome with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Thus there is a need for a combination of tests to help determine the cause of Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【26】**Table 1 Reported sensitivity and specificity of commonly utilized dynamic biochemical diagnostic tests for determining the site of excess ACTH secretion**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】Furthermore, functional imaging may not always assist in localizing an anatomical site of excess ACTH secretion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>. In some instances, ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors can be detected by SRS using 111-indium-pentetreotide, or as highlighted in a recent case reported in this journal, with technetium-99 m-labelled octreotide acetate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, the sensitivity of SRS for detecting occult tumors that secrete ACTH only ranges from 30 to 53% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In contrast, some preliminary reports have suggested that PET scanning using gallium-68-DOTATOC yields a higher detection rate of neuroendocrine tumors compared to SRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Despite this, the limitations of even this technique to localize an ectopic source of ACTH secretion are highlighted by this case.\n\n【29】**Table 2 Reported sensitivity of current imaging modalities for localizing the site of ectopic ACTH secretion**\n\n【30】Full size table\n\n【31】When all modalities fail to localize a source of ectopic ACTH, the role of clinical judgment plays a significant role. Ongoing monitoring of the patient, combined with a relevant discussion of risks and benefits of different therapeutic options led to a decision to proceed to removal of the small bronchial nodule. This nodule was subsequently confirmed to be an ACTH-secreting carcinoid tumor. Embarking on this decision despite there being no definitive preoperative confirmation that the nodule was the source of her ectopic ACTH production resulted in a cure of our patient's Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】We have shown the limitations of the currently available diagnostic tools in differentiating pituitary or ectopic sources of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Furthermore, despite significant advances in radiological and nuclear medicine imaging modalities, the localization of the site of ectopic ACTH may still not be possible.\n\n【34】Consent\n-------\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of spontaneous abortion the incidence is 1:16,000 among live deliveries. Pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and syndromic associations. Among the teratogenic exposures, maternal diabetes is a well-established risk factor associated with a 200-fold increased incidence of holoprosencephaly.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a case of a delayed diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who presented to us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor weight gain. He was born to a type 1 diabetes mellitus mother at 39+ weeks by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. A physical examination done at 12 months of age revealed a small-for-age child with a developmental age of 2 months. He had normal facies but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable. Hematological and biochemical investigations revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia. The child also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of his brain which revealed distinctive features of semilobar holoprosencephaly. He was treated for iron deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily, ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was offered to his parents.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】In conclusion, although rare, holoprosencephaly is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally, classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy may be implicated.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Congenital structural malformations of the central nervous system are responsible for a considerable morbidity and mortality in childhood with resultant long-term psychological, social, and financial implications for the survivors and their families. Holoprosencephaly (HPE) encompasses a continuum of brain malformations characterized by a failed or incomplete cleavage of the embryonic forebrain into distinct cerebral hemispheres often occurring by the fourth week of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 8 \\]</u>. It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of spontaneous abortion the incidence of HPE is 1:16,000 among live deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 – 8 \\]</u>. Classically, HPE is categorized into three main subtypes in order of decreasing severity: alobar, semilobar, and lobar.\n\n【10】The etiopathogenesis of HPE is multifactorial involving the interplay of various environmental and genetic factors. Neurodevelopmental delay is present in virtually all affected children while other manifestations including hypotonia, seizures, aspiration pneumonia, pituitary dysfunction, and failure to thrive are not uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Owing to a shared embryonic origin between the forebrain and midface (that is, prechordal mesoderm), over three-quarters of individuals with HPE have concomitant craniofacial anomalies some of which are incompatible with life (for example, cyclopia) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 6 , 8 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of HPE is usually made by prenatal transabdominal ultrasound or a computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its management is basically supportive. Survival and developmental outcome is generally poor and is dictated by the HPE subtype and the degree of the accompanying craniofacial dysmorphism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. We report a case of semilobar HPE in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who was born to a mother with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 12-month-old baby boy of African descent presented to us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor weight gain. He was the first born to a 28-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed at the age of 9. The mother attended antenatal clinic from the 16th week of gestation and received all routine antenatal care as per the Tanzanian protocol (antihelminthics, antimalarial medications, hematinics, and tetanus toxoid). She tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, and syphilis. The mother denied history of toxoplasmosis, other (syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes (TORCH) infections, trauma, or chronic drug use; however, she had a urinary tract infection during her first trimester which was successfully treated with oral cephalexin 500 mg four times a day for 5 days. Apart from the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, no other history of familial genetic disorders was elicited. Sonographic evaluation at 16th and 36th week of gestation revealed a normal singleton pregnancy. Despite a fairly good sugar control before pregnancy, the mother had poor glycemic control during pregnancy and her glycated hemoglobin (HbA <sub>1C </sub> ) taken at 7 and 29 weeks of gestation was 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. She gave birth at 39+ weeks by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. His head circumference at birth was 38.9 cm (97th percentile). Chromosome analysis (karyotyping) is not a routine practice in Tanzania and it was not performed.\n\n【13】The boy weighed 8.5 kg at 6 months, which was the exact same weight measured during his visit to our institution at 12 months of age. His head circumference at 1 year was 49.1 cm (99th percentile). He had stable vital signs but a physical examination revealed a small-for-age child with conjunctival and palmar pallor. All his growth parameters were below the 5th percentile and he had a developmental age of 2 months. He scored 4 on neurocognitive assessment using the Carter Neurocognitive Assessment Severity Scale. He had normal facies but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable. He underwent a series of blood work-up, cardiac echocardiography (ECHO), and renal ultrasound all of which revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia: hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21 pg/cell, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 69 fL, and red cell distribution width (RDW) 15.1%. The child also underwent MRI of his brain which revealed an incompletely formed interhemispheric fissure, a monoventricle with partially developed temporal and occipital horns, partial fusion of his frontal lobe, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and volume loss bilaterally at temporal lobes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 )</u>. His cerebellum and brain stem appeared normal. Based on the clinical presentation and MRI findings the diagnosis of semilobar HPE was entertained. The child was treated for iron deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily, ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was offered to his parents.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) displaying an incompletely formed interhemispheric fissure ( _arrow 1_ ) and partial fusion of the frontal lobe ( _arrow 2_ )\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) displaying a mono ventricle with partially developed temporal and occipital horns ( _arrow 1_ )\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】Brain magnetic resonance imaging (T2 weighted) displaying a partially formed corpus callosum ( _arrow 1_ )\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】The child continued to be attended by a developmental pediatrician and pediatric dietician on a regular basis at our institution. An assessment conducted at 12 months post-initial visit showed improvement in his neurocognitive status (Carter Neurocognitive Assessment Severity Scale score = 2). Furthermore, he had attained an acceptable weight for his age (12.6 kg) and his sleeping pattern was stable. In the long run, he is scheduled for both physical and occupational therapy aiming to enhance his motor skills and maximize functional independence.\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】HPE is a rare spectrum of cephalic disorders resulting from a failure or incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain into distinct cerebral hemispheres. In the semilobar HPE subtype, the cerebral hemispheres separate posteriorly but not anteriorly. The pathogenesis of HPE is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 – 11 \\]</u>, teratogenic exposures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 – 17 \\]</u>, and syndromic associations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 – 23 \\]</u>. Among the teratogenic exposures, maternal hyperglycemia is an established risk factor for HPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 , 24 \\]</u>. Barr _et al_ . found a 200-fold increased risk for HPE among babies born to diabetic mothers compared to those of diabetes-free mothers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>. In the case presented, the mother was known to have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and her glycemic control during pregnancy was poor. Long-term use of drugs including aspirin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, statins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, misoprostol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, methotrexate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, retinoic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>, and alcohol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> have shown increased risk in the animal model, results which are yet to be replicated in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>. However, in the case presented the mother denied chronic use of medications apart from insulin injections for her diabetes. Moreover, TORCH infections early in pregnancy may potentially affect cerebral embryogenesis leading to HPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 8 \\]</u>; a possibility of such infections in our case was, however, ruled out. Although craniofacial anomalies frequently coexist with HPE, they are usually mild or absent in the semilobar subtype as was witnessed in this case. Such anomalies include microcephaly, single central maxillary incisor, cleft lip and palate, flat nose, absent nasal bridge, microphthalmia, absence of lateral philtral ridges, absence of the superior lingual frenulum, iris coloboma, and cyclopia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Diagnosis of HPE is usually made prenatally in women with a high index of suspicion. Our case, however, was not diagnosed until the age of 1 year despite evidence of hyperglycemia exposure _in utero_ and infancy symptomatology suggestive of HPE. However, HPE prognosis remains generally poor, with the type of HPE and coexisting craniofacial anomalies as key prognostic indicators. For instance, less than 20% of patients with the alobar subtype will survive to 12 months while approximately 50% with the isolated semilobar form will survive beyond 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Management of HPE although mainly supportive requires a multidisciplinary approach aiming at managing symptoms and complications, and avoiding added disability to improve the overall quality of life. This case despite its typical presentation was actually the first case of HPE to be diagnosed and documented in Tanzania. It is the authors’ hope that upon its publication this case report will sensitize practitioners especially in resource poor settings to raise an index of suspicion for HPE particularly in women of high risk.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】In conclusion, although rare, HPE is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally, classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy may be implicated. Furthermore, in cases with somewhat better prognosis, thorough counseling is crucial to prepare expectant parents to understand, accept, and prepare for the challenges in raising a child with HPE.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ECHO:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Echocardiography</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hb:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hemoglobin</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HbA <sub>1C </sub> :</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Glycated hemoglobin</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HPE:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Holoprosencephaly</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCH:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular hemoglobin</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCV:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular volume</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RDW:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Red cell distribution width</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TORCH:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Toxoplasmosis, other (syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

After a year of follow-up, a clinical examination and imaging findings were unremarkable.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】A bilateral duplex collecting system with refluxing upper pole moiety ureter is a very rare entity. The diagnosis should be suspected when exploring any flank pain with recurrent urinary tract infections to avoid subsequent renal impairment. Furthermore, this case shows how some common symptoms may lead to finding an unexpected urinary tract abnormality.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】A bilateral duplex collecting system is an unusual renal tract abnormality. Duplication occurs when two separate ureteric buds arise from a single Wolffian duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Based on the degree of fusion, it can present as bifid renal pelvis, partial ureteric duplication, incomplete ureteric duplication with ureters joining near or in bladder wall, and complete ureteric duplication with separate ureteric orifices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. According to the Weigert–Meyer law, the upper pole ureter typically opens medially while the lower pole ureter opens laterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The incidence of ureteral duplication has been reported as 1 in 125 or 0.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The case that is presented does not seem to fit this law. Although bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and bilateral duplex collecting system may be seen, their association with refluxing upper pole ureter is a rarely encountered entity. The aim of this observation is to present a rare case and its therapeutic aspects in a young married woman.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 24-year-old married Arab woman had been admitted to a local health center 2 months prior to referral to our urology department. She had been hospitalized there four times in 1 year for acute pyelonephritis. The fourth episode raised the suspicion for an underlying problem and justified her referral to our urology department after management of the acute pyelonephritis.\n\n【13】On admission, she complained of ascending left-sided flank pain during micturition but did not have dysuria or hematuria. She also had a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) as a young adult.\n\n【14】She was perfectly asymptomatic on the right side. A physical examination was normal. Her temperature was 37.4 °C, her blood pressure was 128/84 mmHg, and her pulse rate was regular at 76 beats per minute. Laboratory tests were normal; in particular, a urine examination showed no leukocyturia or bacteriuria.\n\n【15】She underwent an abdominal ultrasound which showed an asymmetric size of the kidneys and a bilateral chronic pyelonephritis aspect. Her right kidney measured 10 cm while the left measured 12 cm.\n\n【16】A voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed and showed grade IV VUR on the left side and grade I VUR on the right 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 and 2 )</u>.\n\n【17】**Fig. 1**\n\n【18】Voiding cystourethrography imaging showing bilateral reflux grade IV vesicoureteral reflux on the left ( _white arrow_ ) and grade I vesicoureteral reflux on the right ( _black arrow_ )\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】Voiding cystourethrography imaging showing left grade IV VUR ( _arrow_ )\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】An abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan detected a left completely duplicated collecting system with hydroureteronephrosis and poor opacification of the upper pole moiety. In addition, the parenchyma of the upper pole moiety was atrophied with secretory and excretory delay. In association with VCUG findings, it appeared that the refluxing ureter was the one that drains the upper pole moiety and inserts lower into the bladder. On the right, a duplex collecting system was detected with hypotonic calyces, pelvis, and ureter of the upper pole moiety. An atrophic parenchyma and poor opacification of the upper pole moiety was also detected 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 3 and 4 )</u>. Renal scintigraphy was not available.\n\n【24】**Fig. 3**\n\n【25】Coronal view of computed tomography scan with poor opacification of left upper pole moiety ( _arrow_ )\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】**Fig. 4**\n\n【28】Excretory phase of computed tomography scan. **a** A 3/4 left view showing the upper pole moiety ( _white arrow_ ) and the lower pole moiety ( _black arrow_ ). **b** Bilateral duplex collecting system with hydroureteronephrosis of the left upper collecting system.

On the right side she underwent dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux®) injections. Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux®) was injected submucosally below the ureteral orifice at the 6 o’clock position to create a prominent bulge and raise the distal ureter and ureteral orifice.\n\n【31】**Fig. 5**\n\n【32】Intraoperative picture during left heminephrectomy showing left duplicated collecting system with the upper pole ureter ( _white arrow_ ) and the lower pole ureter ( _blue arrow_ )\n\n【33】Full size image\n\n【34】A year after the surgery she has no complaints. The symptoms are completely resolved. Biological and radiological follow-up is unremarkable. A timeline of the case is presented in Figure 6 .\n\n【35】**Fig. 6**\n\n【36】Timeline of the case. _CT_ computed tomography, _VCUG_ voiding cystourethrography\n\n【37】Full size image\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】In this case we present a bilateral duplex collecting system and bilateral VUR. The limitation of our approach is the duration of the follow-up which is only approximately a year. The discussion has two sections: first, we will point out the originality of the abnormality; second, we will talk about the therapeutic aspects.\n\n【40】### An exceptional abnormality\n\n【41】Bilateral duplex collecting system is a rare abnormality. It occurs in 1 in 500 persons and is found in 0.3% of excretory urograms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Some cases have been reported on bilateral duplex collecting system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. There are not much data about it. The cases reported in the literature are mostly related to unilateral duplex collecting system.\n\n【42】In keeping with the Weigert–Meyer law, the upper pole ureter typically opens medially while the lower pole ureter opens laterally. Complete ureteral duplication may be associated with other congenital anomalies such as a short lower moiety intramural ureter causing VUR or an upper moiety ureter with an ureterocele causing obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】VUR almost always occurs into the lower pole moiety due to its lateral displacement within the bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. In the case that is presented, the refluxing ureter on the left side is the one that inserts lower into the bladder. Furthermore, there is no ureterocele. These situations are not common. Some rare cases of refluxing upper pole moiety have been mentioned in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, the association of bilateral duplex collecting system, bilateral VUR, and refluxing upper pole moiety is not clearly described in the literature to the best of our knowledge.\n\n【44】### Therapeutic challenge\n\n【45】We had a case of bilateral VUR and recurrent UTIs associated with renal parenchyma destruction of left upper pole moiety in a 24-year-old married woman. She may develop these UTIs during pregnancy. Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy significantly increases the risk of anemia, septicemia, acute renal failure, respiratory distress, spontaneous preterm birth, and low birthweight birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The main goal then was to protect our patient from these eventual consequences and most importantly to prevent renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. On the left upper pole moiety a heminephrectomy was performed. In most cases this surgery contributes on the one hand to stopping the symptoms and on the other hand to avoiding kidney damage. An upper pole heminephrectomy is best applied to patients with non-functioning upper pole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【46】On the right side we had a grade I VUR on the upper pole moiety ureter. This side was perfectly asymptomatic. The majority of lower grades of VUR spontaneously resolve as the child grows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This woman was 24-years old. We did not expect a spontaneous regression in this patient. To correct the reflux, an endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Deflux®) was performed.\n\n【47】Several bulking agents have been used over the past two decades in the treatment of VUR. In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid as the first FDA-approved subepithelial injectable treatment for VUR in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【48】Finally, we may note that a bilateral duplex collecting system with refluxing upper pole ureter is rare. Furthermore, its association with recurrent UTIs in a young woman remains a therapeutic challenge.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【50】A bilateral duplex collecting system is a rare anatomic abnormality. Furthermore, the fact that the left refluxing ureter drains the upper moiety pole makes this case an exceptional case. The recurrent UTIs that are associated may cause renal damage. The therapeutic aspects of this are very important because our patient is a young, married, and procreative woman. A diagnosis and early treatment before any renal impairment seem to be the best approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It may occur anywhere along the primitive embryonic milk lines, which extend from the axilla to the groin. Accessory breast tissue can potentially undergo the same physiological and pathological processes as the normally located breast, including lactational change, fibroadenoma, and carcinoma. Although common in the normally located breast tissue, the incidence of fibroadenoma in accessory breast tissue is rare. Furthermore, if the swelling occurs in the axilla or groin, it may present a diagnostic challenge by clinically mimicking a lymphoma or other causes of lymphadenopathy. Owing to its rarity and its tendency to pose a clinical diagnostic challenge, we decided to report a case of fibroadenoma in axillary accessory breast.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 28-year-old Ethiopian female patient came to University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital with a complaint of left axillary swelling of 3 years duration. There was no history of cough, fever, weight loss, or night sweating. On physical examination, there was an approximately 5 × 4 cm, firm, well-defined, mobile, nontender solitary mass in the left axilla that was completely separated from the left breast. Fine-needle aspiration cytology suggested a diagnosis of fibroadenoma in axillary accessory breast tissue. The mass was completely excised, and histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis. Her recovery was uneventful. She was informed about the diagnosis, reassured, and discharged from care.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】In the clinical evaluation of a patient with axillary swelling, accessory breast tissue disorders such as fibroadenoma must be considered as a differential diagnosis for early diagnostic workup and management. Moreover, this case underscores the fact that, similar to normal breast tissue, accessory breast tissue is also susceptible to the same pathologic disease processes including neoplasms such as fibroadenoma.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Mammary gland (breast) development begins in the early embryonic period as ectodermal thickening. During the 6th week of embryonic development, the mammary milk lines, which represent two ectodermal thickenings, develop along the sides of the embryo, extending from the axillary region to the groin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This line represents the location of the embryonic mammary ridges. In normal development, most of the embryologic mammary ridges along the milk line involute, except for two segments in the pectoral region, which later become breasts. When any of these ridges fail to involute, accessory breast develop. This is synonymous to supernumerary breast, ectopic breast, and polymastia, and usually occurs along the “milk line” or mammary line 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The prevalence of accessory breast tissue has been shown to be dependent on various factors, including gender, geographical area, race, and inheritance. On average, occurrence ranges from 0.22% to 6% of the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Although fibroadenoma is a common benign lesion of normal breast tissue, its occurrence in accessory breast tissue is very rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. They are clinically significant as they are associated with other congenital anomalies of the urinary and cardiovascular systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Furthermore, if the swelling occurs in the axilla or groin, it may clinically mimic other tumorous lesions such as lymphoma or other causes of lymphadenopathy. Therefore, depending on their anatomic location, they can pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Herein, we report a case of fibroadenoma in the axillary accessory breast that was clinically considered as a lymphoma. We are reporting this case of uncommon occurrence owing to its rarity as a seat of origin in this anatomic location. Additionally, as is evident in our case presentation, the condition can pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians by resembling lymphoma or other causes of lymphadenopathy. As a result, we report the case to emphasize the importance of considering accessory breast as well as its associated pathology in the differential diagnosis of axillary mass. Moreover, we also need to recognize the importance of evaluating the patients to rule out renal or cardiovascular anomalies, as these have an important association.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 28-year-old Ethiopian female came to University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwestern Ethiopia, with a complaint of left axillary swelling of 3 years duration. The swelling was small initially and progressively increased in size to attain the current size. She had visited a nearby health center on multiple occasions for this complaint and took unspecified antibiotics, but experienced no improvement. Apart from the local mild pain and discomfort, there was no history of cough, fever, weight loss, night sweating, or other constitutional symptoms. She has no family history (first-degree relatives) of diabetes, hypertension, or any other remarkable noncommunicable disease including cancer. Her past medical history is not significant, except for occasional mild dyspeptic symptoms; she took unspecified over-the-counter anti-acids a couple of times for her dyspepsia as the symptoms arose. She has no history of admission to hospital. She has no history of any form of surgical procedure. She has no history of smoking. Except for the mild-to-moderate amount of local alcohol beverages she consumed on holidays, she has no history of excess alcohol consumption. She is a janitor in a public school. She is unmarried and lives with her parents. She has a fiancé and uses a combination of natural calendar method and male condom for contraception. She has no history of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or injectable or intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use. She has no history of pregnancy. She reported that she has regular menstrual cycles and no significant past obstetric or gynecologic history.\n\n【14】On physical examination, her general appearance was stable, healthy looking, and ambulating. Vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 82 beats per minute; blood pressure, 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; temperature, 36.2 °C. She has pink conjunctiva, non-icteric sclera, and no abnormal finding on head and neck examination. On lymphoglandular system (LGS) examination, there was an approximately 5 × 4 cm solitary mass in the left axilla 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. It was firm in consistency, nontender, well defined, mobile, and completely separated from the left breast. Skin over the mass was normal with no nipple, areola, or ulceration. There were no clinically significant findings detected on examination of breasts, right axilla, or the other externally accessible lymph node regions. On chest examination, it was symmetrical and moved with respirations, and clear breath sounds were heard on auscultation. On precordial and cardiovascular examinations, the normal _S_ <sub>1 </sub> and _S_ <sub>2 </sub> heart sounds were heard, there was no murmur or gallop, and all the peripheral arterial pulses were palpable with strong and regular pulse. Abdomen was soft to palpation. No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or mass was detected, and there were no signs of fluid collection. No costovertebral angle tenderness or abnormal finding was detected on genitourinary system (GUS) examination. No pedal or other subcutaneous edema was identified on musculoskeletal examination. No palmar pallor or skin lesions were seen on integumentary system examination. On neurologic examination, she was conscious, alert, and fully oriented to time, place, and person. Cranial nerve examination revealed normal findings. No motor or sensory deficit was detected, and deep tendon reflexes were normal. On the basis of the above findings, a provisional clinical impression of axillary lymphadenopathy due to either lymphoma or tuberculosis was considered.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Firm nodular mass in the left axilla\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Laboratory investigations done on the same day of her presentation including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and chest X-ray were noncontributory. On CBC, white blood cell (WBC) count was 5900/mL with 53% granulocytes, 42% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 4% monocytes. Platelet count was 247,000/mL. Hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 89 fL. ESR was 13 mm/hour. Renal function test revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 13 mg/dL, and serum creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL. On liver function test, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, serum albumin was 4.4 g/dL, and serum aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) were 29 and 33 IU/L respectively. All of these laboratory test results were within the normal reference range of our laboratory. Urinalysis was also done, and it was normal.\n\n【19】Owing to the limited number of pathologists and long waiting list of patients, she was scheduled for fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Two weeks after her initial presentation, FNAC from the mass was done and smears were stained with Wright’s stain following the standard procedures. Microscopic examination revealed cellular aspirates of tight cohesive clusters of bland ductal cells in branching stag-horn-like pattern along with numerous scattered bare nuclei on the background and fibromyxoid stromal fragments 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Lymphoid cells were not seen. Fibroadenoma (in axillary accessory breast tissue) was suggested on the basis of these FNAC features. Abdominopelvic ultrasound and echocardiography were normal.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】Low-power microscopy of fine-needle aspiration cytology from the mass showing tight cohesive clusters of bland ductal cells in branching pattern, fibromyxoid stromal fragments, and numerous scattered bare nuclei on the background (Wright’s stain)\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】After discussion with the patient, we agreed to undergo surgical intervention for multiple indications, including discomfort, difficulty reaching full range of shoulder movement, cosmetic and hygienic reasons, and patient request. We opted to perform lumpectomy of the left axillary mass under general anesthesia. After securing an intravenous line and putting her on maintenance fluid, ketamine 30 mg plus diazepam 10 mg was prepared and administered intravenously. After light sedation, we infiltrated the skin incision area with 4 mg/kg lidocaine, and then underwent the lumpectomy under all aseptic precautions. The intraoperative finding was a firm, mobile, well-capsulated solitary gray-whitish 5 × 4 × 4 cm mass in the left axillary fossa. The mass was located superficially in the subcutaneous tissue separated from the left breast parenchyma. Postoperatively, we put her on intravenous diclofenac 50 mg, which was later switched to 100 mg is taken orally when needed (PO PRN) discharge. As she had a smooth postoperative course, she was discharged on the same day with appointment scheduled for follow-up and wound care. The wound healing process was uneventful, and she only took the antipain medication for only a couple of days.\n\n【24】The excised mass was subjected to histopathologic evaluation following the standard tissue processing and staining procedure. Gross and microscopic histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of fibroadenoma in axillary accessory breast 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 3 , 4 )</u>. The histopathology report was issued 3 weeks after the day of her operation as there was a long biopsy waiting list and few pathologists were available in the hospital. She was informed about the pathology result, reassured, and discharged from care after 3 months of follow-up. The difficulty of shoulder movement and discomfort associated with the mass as well as other complaints were relieved. She was very much satisfied with the intervention and care given.\n\n【25】**Fig. 3**\n\n【26】Excised tissue that is nodular and well circumscribed\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 4**\n\n【29】Low-power microscopy showing histopathologic features of a fibroadenoma\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】Discussion\n----------\n\n【32】In this report, we presented a case of fibroadenoma in the axillary accessory breast in a 28-year-old female after she presented with a chief complaint of left axillary swelling of 3 years duration. The initial clinical impression was an axillary lymphadenopathy secondary to lymphoma to rule out tuberculosis. The diagnosis of fibroadenoma in the axillary accessory breast tissue was suggested by FNAC and later confirmed by histopathology after excisional biopsy. Although fibroadenoma is a common benign lesion of normal breast tissue, its occurrence in accessory breast tissue is very rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, if the swelling occurs in the axilla or groin as seen in the current case report, it may clinically mimic other tumorous lesions such as lymphoma or other causes of lymphadenopathy. Therefore, as evident in our case presentation, depending on their anatomic location in the milk line, they can pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. In addition to its rarity and its potential to pose a diagnostic challenge to physician, we present this case report along with brief literature review to underscore the importance of evaluating such patients to rule out renal or cardiovascular anomalies as it has an important association.\n\n【33】Two hypotheses have been proposed on the development of accessory breast. One attributes the condition to the failure of involution of the milk line, while the other believes it develops from the modified apocrine sweat glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. The first one is the most widely known hypothesis and is linked to the embryogenesis of normal breast. Breast development begins in the early embryonic period as ectodermal thickening. During the 6th week of embryonic development, the mammary milk lines, which represent two ectodermal thickenings, develop along the sides of the embryo, extending from the axillary region to the groin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This line represents the location of the embryonic mammary ridges. In normal development, most of the embryologic mammary ridges along the milk line involute, except for two segments in the pectoral region, which later become breasts. Accessory breast (ectopic breast/ supernumerary breast) develops when any of these extrapectoral mammary ridges fails to involute. Therefore, on the basis of this hypothesis, accessory breast may occur anywhere along the primitive embryonic milk lines. In support of this hypothesis, epidemiologically, the majority of accessory breast occurs in the milk line. However, atypical localizations are also described in literature, including face, posterior neck, thigh, shoulder, and upper extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Accessory breast tissue in these atypical locations is partly explained by the second hypothesis, that is, from the modified apocrine sweat glands. Accessory breast tissue can occur with or without a nipple–areola complex. Clinically, it may be visible and palpable or very small and not palpable. In our case, breast tissue was not palpable in axilla, but the presence of fibroadenoma in the axilla indirectly indicates the existence of accessory breast. Moreover, its location in the axilla is in line with the first hypothesis.\n\n【34】Kajava developed the accessory breast classification system in 1915, which is still in use today 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 11 , 12 \\]</u> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Since we only have a glandular tissue (detected as fibroadenoma) without any nipple–areola complex, our case belongs to class IV. Moreover, it is a rare occurrence of fibroadenoma in a nonpalpable axillary accessory breast tissue. The fibroadenoma originates from the nonpalpable accessory breast tissue located at the axilla in the milk line. Similar reports of fibroadenoma in a nonpalpable axillary accessory breast tissue were also put forward by Goyal _et al._ and Singh _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 13 \\]</u>\n\n【35】**Table 1 Kajava classification**\n\n【36】Full size table\n\n【37】Cases of accessory breasts are usually sporadic, but familial presentations associated with urogenital and congenital cardiac abnormalities have been described, although the association has been challenged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. As stated specifically by some authors, patients with polythelia have been associated with urinary tract abnormalities such as supernumerary kidneys, failure of renal formation, renal adenocarcinoma, hydronephrosis, polycystic kidney disease, duplicate renal arteries, and ureteric stenosis. This association can be partly explained by the parallel development of mammary structure and genitourinary system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 8 , 15 \\]</u>. Other congenital anomalies such as pyloric stenosis, epilepsy, and cardiac abnormalities are also seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Radiologic evaluation in our patient showed no urogenital or cardiac abnormalities. Accessory breast tissue is subject to hormonal response and may develop benign and malignant pathologic processes similar to those seen in normally located breast tissues, including fibrocystic disease, intraductal papilloma, lactating adenoma, fibroadenoma, and carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 16 \\]</u>. Of these, carcinoma is reported as the common pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Fibroadenoma is a benign biphasic tumor featuring a proliferation of both epithelial and stromal elements. It typically presents as a painless, firm, slow-growing, mobile, and well-defined breast mass. Fibroadenomas are among the most common benign tumors of the normally located breast in women under 30 years of age. In the adolescent population, the overall incidence of fibroadenoma is 2.2%. They account for 68% of all breast masses and 44–94% of biopsied breast lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 , 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Although fibroadenoma is a common benign lesion of normal breast tissue, its occurrence in accessory breast tissue is very rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. Fewer than 40 cases of fibroadenoma in accessory breasts have been reported in the literature. In keeping with our case, the most common anatomic location was in the axilla, but it can occur anywhere in the milk line. However, cases have also been reported in other locations, including perineum, face, and back 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 , 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Differential diagnoses for a mass in the axillary region include lymphadenopathy (due to neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious etiology), lipoma, neuroma, skin lesions (various cystic and tumorous lesions), axillary tail of Spence, and accessory breast tissue and lesions arising from it. In our case, the clinical impression was a lymphadenopathy, but FNAC suggested a fibroadenoma arising from accessory breast tissue, which was later confirmed by histopathology.\n\n【41】The diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for tumors in accessory breast tissue like in this case is similar to that of a normal breast mass. However, owing to its rarity and lack of suspicion, diagnosis may be delayed or even ignored, thus making timely treatment more difficult. When tumors or nodules are found along the mammary line, the presence of breast tissue should be considered during the investigation. As a quick and cost-effective procedure, FNAC is recommended to rule out the other differential diagnosis mentioned, to suggest the definitive diagnosis, and to guide the appropriate surgical intervention. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 15 , 16 , 20 \\]</u>\n\n【42】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【43】For early diagnosis and management, accessory breast tissue disorders like fibroadenoma must be considered as a differential diagnosis while evaluating a patient with axillary swelling. This case underscores the fact that, similar to normal breast tissue, accessory breast tissue is also susceptible to the same physiologic and pathologic disease processes including neoplasms. Surgical intervention with excision is the mainstay of management, and FNAC can be used as a rapid and reliable procedure to facilitate early diagnosis. Moreover, genitourinary and cardiac evaluation for possible malformations is recommended.\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data sharing does not apply to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>**Ethics approval and consent to participate**</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Written informed consent for participation was obtained from the patient.

In the present case report, we describe a rare variation of the azygos venous system and discuss its clinical importance.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】During the dissection of the thoracic part of a 70-year-old Iranian male cadaver, a variation of the azygos venous system was observed. The hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins passed ventral to the aorta. These veins crossed ventral to the aorta to open into the azygos vein on the right side. The azygos vein was located on the left side of the vertebral column, then, at the top, it moved toward the right side of the vertebral column to drain into the superior vena cava vein. Also, we encountered an enlarged heart. No other abnormalities were observed. The various arrangement of these veins is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 .\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Photograph showing variations of the posterior mediastinum. **a** Superior vena cava vein. **b** Azygos vein. **c** Preaortic interazygos vein that was a direct continuation of the accessory hemiazygos vein. **d** Descending aorta. **e** Preaortic interazygos vein that was a direct continuation of the hemiazygos vein. **f** Thoracic duct. **g** Sympathetic trunk. **h** Greater splanchnic nerve. **i** Lesser splanchnic nerve. **j** Least splanchnic nerve\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Schematic illustration of the variations. **a** Right brachiocephalic vein. **b** Left brachiocephalic vein. **c** Superior vena cava vein. **d** Azygos vein. **e** Accessory hemiazygos vein. **f** Hemiazygos vein. **g** Descending aorta. **h** Preaortic interazygos vein that was a direct continuation of the accessory hemiazygos vein. **i** Preaortic interazygos vein that was a direct continuation of the hemiazygos vein. **j** Right superior intercostal vein. **k** Left superior intercostal vein. **m** Median line\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】Discussion\n----------\n\n【20】The azygos venous system consists of the azygos, hemiazygos, and accessory hemiazygos veins. This system is located on each side of the vertebral column that drains deoxygenated blood from the back and the walls of the thorax and abdomen into the superior vena cava vein.\n\n【21】Recent reports showed that the azygos system is very various in formation, location, and course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. These variations can be explained through embryological development. The azygos vein originates embryologically from the right subcardinal vein and the hemiazygos vein from the left subcardinal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>. Morton reported that the hemiazygos veins pass from the right side of the body and cross from the anterior aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Sahinoglu _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u> presented a variation with absence of the right superior vena cava and the presence of a superior vena cava on the left. The right brachiocephalic vein crossed the front of the aortic arch. Keskin _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> reported that, on the CT scan of a 52-year-old woman, the right azygos vein was present and poured into the superior vena cava. Moreover, a left azygos vein existed. It was developing the left aspect of the thoracic aorta and drained into the left subclavian vein. Instead, the left hemiazygos vein was not present. Also, there was an aneurysmatic ascending aorta that had pressured the superior vena cava.\n\n【22】Azygos system anomalies may be isolated or associated with other anomalies. For example, azygos continuation is common in patients with polysplenia (left isomerism) but rare in patients with asplenia and also associated with abnormal abdominal situs and a left or duplicated inferior vena cava.\n\n【23】In our cadaveric case, the azygos vein was on the left side of the vertebral column, and also hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins were located on the left side and crossed the front of the aorta and the back of the esophagus and opened into the azygos vein at the level of the T7 and T9 vertebrae, respectively. The crossing of these structures from the front of the aorta may cause dysfunction. These variations usually occur during embryological development.\n\n【24】Our knowledge of the exact anatomy of the azygos system and its variations can prevent surgical mistakes. This awareness is also important in radiography because these structures may be misinterpreted as tumor, lymph node, aneurysm, iatrogenic hemorrhages, or an erroneous diagnosis in the evaluation of radiographs and MRI scans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Using CT or contrast-enhanced CT techniques will help to diagnose such abnormalities. However, due to the high prevalence of variation in the azygos venous system, surgeons should pay attention to this during surgery.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The remarkable findings of a physical examination were port-wine stains and varicose veins on his limbs and part of his torso 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 )</u>, and hypertrophy of both lower extremities: status after amputation of the digits of his left foot and soft tissue resection of plantar surface with auto-skin plastic; and arteriovenous fistula in both legs.

A CT scan in 1998 revealed phleboliths in his pelvis around his colon and bladder. Dynamic renal scintigraphy in 2016 showed slowed excretion due to minor disorder of vascularization of both kidneys with weakened renal function. Laboratory results displayed pancytopenia consisting of normochromic normocytic anemia (Hb, 9 g/dL), neutropenia (1.24 × 103/uL) and thrombocytopenia (107 × 103/uL). Biochemical tests revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (10.67, normal range 30 to 100 ng/ml), fibrinogen (1.1, normal range 1.8 to 3.6 g/l), calcium (1.95, normal range 2.08 to 2.65 mmol/l), and normal creatinine and parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Hypoalbuminemia (27, normal range 35 to 52 g/l), hyperlipidemia (2.31, normal range < 1.7 mmol/l), and proteinuria (6.85 g/L) described the main criteria for nephrotic syndrome.

However, an unusual presentation of KTWS was also displayed: KTWS and nephrotic syndrome combined with hypersplenism, which was probably caused by numerous hemangiomas found in his spleen and liver. Splenectomy was suggested due to multiple transfusions of red blood cells, which were prescribed during his hospitalization and did not lead to long-term improvement. A renal biopsy, which is performed to verify cause of nephrotic syndrome, was delayed due to his severe condition. The connection between KTWS, hypersplenism, and nephrotic syndrome is still unclear due to the rare presentation of KTWS itself. A renal biopsy could help to identify the cause of nephrotic syndrome, leading to a better comprehension of the unclear connection between KTWS, hypersplenism, and nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】Signs like port-wine stains, varicose veins, hypertrophy of lower extremities, and arteriovenous fistula are typical of KTWS.

Predictive factors for poor outcome are a young age and the presence of multiple abscesses. We report a case of a 15-month-old girl with cyanotic congenital heart disease who developed multiple brain abscesses caused by _Streptococcus intermedius._ The patient was treated with a combination of surgical aspiration and antimicrobial therapy without apparent neurological sequelae. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest such patient to have been reported in the literature. We explore the possible causes of her good outcome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】At the age of 15 months, the Japanese patient initially was presented to our hospital with transient eye deviation to the left and vomiting. In a blood examination, her white blood cell count (12,720 per mm <sup>3 </sup> with a left shift) and C-reactive protein level (1.23 mg/ml) were slightly elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed three mass lesions. These were 1.5-cm, 1.9-cm, and 1.2-cm rim-enhancing lesions with extensive surrounding edema. Brain abscesses were diagnosed, and vancomycin (50 mg every 12 hours) and meropenem (40 mg every 8 hours) were started empirically. However, because each brain abscess was enlarged at 8 days after admission, surgical aspiration was performed at 10 days after admission, and cultures of the aspirated pus grew _S. intermedius_ . Penicillin G (0.7 million units every 4 hours) and ceftriaxone (280 mg every 12 hours), to which this isolate is susceptible, were then administered, and the brain abscesses reduced in size. After 1 month of ceftriaxone and 3 months of penicillin G treatment, all of the brain abscesses disappeared. Apparent neurological sequelae were not observed at 6 months after onset.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】A good outcome can be obtained if multiple brain abscesses develop in infancy or early childhood in cases without unconsciousness at admission, meningitis, or sepsis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be started immediately after diagnosis, with surgical aspiration performed to identify the causative pathogen and avoid intraventricular rupture of the brain abscesses.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Brain abscesses occur infrequently, with an incidence of 4 cases per 1 million 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>; however, they are a potentially life-threatening condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. In children, mortality has been reported as 3.7–24%, and 19–34.8% of patients have neurological sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. According to past reports, predictive factors for poor outcome are age younger than 5 years and the presence of multiple abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) is the most common predisposing factor for brain abscess development. The number of patients with brain abscess who are older than 10 years of age is currently decreasing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 3 \\]</u>; thus, the age of onset of brain abscesses might be becoming younger. Brain abscesses in patients with CCHD tend to present as multiple lesions because a hematogenous spread of bacteria is associated with CCHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. On the basis of the above, brain abscess in patients with CCHD might have a worse prognosis. Therefore, the prognosis of brain abscess in patients with CCHD needs to be improved. However, there are currently no effective prophylactic therapies or guidelines for the management of brain abscess in children. Reports of patients with good outcomes may therefore be important for improving patient prognosis.\n\n【11】We report a case of a 15-month-old girl with CCHD who developed multiple brain abscesses caused by _Streptococcus intermedius_ that were treated with a combination of surgical aspiration and antimicrobial therapy. To the best of our knowledge, she is the youngest reported patient with CCHD to develop multiple brain abscesses caused by _S. intermedius_ , and she was successfully treated without apparent neurological sequelae. We consider the possible causes of this good outcome.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our patient was a 15-month-old Japanese girl with CCHD (complete transposition of the great arteries, bilateral pulmonary artery stenosis, and ventricular septal defect), cleft lip and palate, and duplicate ureter. In our hospital, she had a balloon atrioseptostomy at the age of 5 days, bidirectional Glenn surgery and a Damus–Kaye–Stansel anastomosis at the age of 4 months for her CCHD, and cleft lip plastic surgery for her cleft lip and palate at the age of 3 months. At age of 15 months, transient eye deviation to the left and vomiting were present once per day for 2 consecutive days, and she visited our hospital on day 2. She had no history of falls or trauma, and she did not have dental caries or otitis media. She was standing without support and could speak. An examination showed normal body temperature (37.6 °C) and blood pressure (88/46 mmHg). The patient’s heart rate (138 beats/minute) and respiration rate (38 breaths/minute) were slightly elevated. Her oxygen saturation (83% on room air) was reduced, as usual. A neurological examination showed generalized hyperreflexia. On admission to our hospital, a computed tomographic scan of the patient’s head showed a hypodense mass (1.5 cm in diameter) with adjacent edema in the left occipital lobe. In a blood examination, her white blood cell count (12,720 per mm <sup>3 </sup> with a left shift) and C-reactive protein level (1.23 mg/ml) were slightly elevated. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a colorless, transparent fluid with a white cell count of 2 per mm <sup>3 </sup> and 22.5 mg/dl of protein. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed three mass lesions. These were rim-enhancing lesions with hyperintense signal on a diffusion-weighted image and extensive surrounding edema, and they had diameters of 1.5 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.2 cm in the right occipital, left occipital, and left parietal lobe areas, respectively. Imaging features suggested that these lesions were abscesses 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 and 2 )</u>. Vancomycin (50 mg every 12 hours) and meropenem (40 mg every 8 hours) were started empirically.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Clinical course of the lesions as seen on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Brain abscesses were located in the right occipital lobe (1a–4a), left occipital lobe (1b–4b), and left parietal lobe (1c–4c) on the day of admission (1a–1c), at 8 days after admission (2a–2c), at 13 days after surgical aspiration (3a–3c), and at 4.5 months after onset (4a–4c).

Very hyperintense lesions were revealed in the right occipital lobe (1a–4a), left occipital lobe (1b–4b), and left parietal lobe (1c–4c) on the day of admission (1a–1c). These lesions all enlarged before surgical aspiration (2a–2c). The left occipital lesion disappeared immediately (3b), and the other lesions reduced after surgical aspiration (3a, c) and eventually disappeared (4a, c)\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Within the first 48 hours, the patient’s temperature was elevated to 39.5 °C and then subsided. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, taken on admission, did not grow any fungi. Because each brain abscess was enlarged at 8 days after admission, surgical aspiration was performed on day 10 after admission, and cultures of the aspirated pus were found to grow _S. intermedius_ using the API Rapid ID 32 STREP System (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Penicillin G (0.7 million units every 4 hours) and ceftriaxone (280 mg every 12 hours), to which this isolate is susceptible, were then administered, and the brain abscesses reduced in size. After 1 month of ceftriaxone and 3 months of penicillin G, all of the brain abscesses disappeared. The results of immunological function analysis were normal (serum immunoglobulin G, 319 mg/dl; CD4/CD8 ratio, 2.88; neutrophil phagocytosis function, 97.1%; and sterilization ability, 84.5%).\n\n【21】At 2.5 months after admission, the patient’s developmental quotient was measured using the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development. Her developmental level for the cognitive–adaptive domain (nonverbal reasoning or visuospatial perception assessed using materials \\[for example, blocks, miniature cars, marbles\\]) was 80, and for the language–social domain (interpersonal relationships, socialization, and verbal abilities), it was 99. The patient’s Postural–Motor domain (fine and gross motor function) level was not measured, because she was hospitalized.\n\n【22】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【23】We report a case of a 15-month-old girl with CCHD who developed multiple brain abscesses caused by _S. intermedius_ that were successfully treated without apparent neurological sequelae. To the best of our knowledge, she is the youngest reported patient with CCHD to develop multiple brain abscesses caused by _S. intermedius_ .\n\n【24】In patients with CCHD, the incidence of brain abscess is declining. According to an investigation in Boston, which compared patients treated between the years 1981–2000 and 1945–1980, CCHD is the most common predisposing factor for brain abscess; however, the percentage of the total has decreased from 50% to 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In a 2010 investigation in Israel, the most common predisposing factors for brain abscess were reported to be sinusitis, meningitis, and traumatic brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The number of patients older than 10 years of age with brain abscess is decreasing, and early surgical interventions in developed countries may be causing this decline in incidence. However, in patients in early childhood and infancy, the incidence might not have changed. Felsenstein _et al._ reported that children with brain abscesses who had a neurological deficit after 6 months of age were younger than those who fully recovered and that an age younger than 5 years was associated with a poor outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Brain abscesses in patients with CCHD tend to present as multiple lesions, because a hematogenous spread of bacteria is associated with CCHD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It has been reported that many of the complications and deaths in children with brain abscesses can be attributed to multiple abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】The reasons for our patient’s good outcome were explored. In previous papers, potential predictors of poor outcome in children with brain abscesses, other than a younger age and multiple lesions, have been reported as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a lower level of consciousness at admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the development of meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> antimicrobial therapy not started immediately after diagnosis, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> lesions localized near ventricles or large in size, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> surgical aspiration is not implemented.\n\n【26】Felsenstein _et al._ reported that a Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8 at admission was associated with poor outcome in children with brain abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, Ciurea _et al_ . reported that the rate of disability in children with brain abscesses resulting from CCHD was lower than that in children with brain abscesses resulting from sepsis or meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Our patient’s level of consciousness was normal at admission, and she did not develop sepsis or meningitis.\n\n【27】A delay in the initiation of antimicrobial therapy can result in a poor outcome, as indicated by a retrospective study in which the median interval between diagnosis and the start of antimicrobial therapy was 2 days. In our patient, both diagnosis and the initiation of antimicrobial therapy occurred on the day she visited our hospital. Cephalosporin and metronidazole or meropenem are recommended as empirical treatments for brain abscesses, and vancomycin should also be added if a staphylococcal infection is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Because _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus_ spp. are the most frequently isolated microbes in previous reports of patients with CCHD, appropriate antimicrobial therapy was started early in our patient.\n\n【28】Regarding the location and size of brain abscesses, in a previous Japanese report, intraventricular rupture of brain abscess (IVROBA) was a strong risk factor for poor outcome in 62 patients with CCHD in a multivariate logistic analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Brain abscess that measures at least 1 cm in diameter is amenable to surgical aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In our patient, the lesion was located far from the lateral ventricles and measured more than 1 cm in diameter. Surgical aspiration could be performed, and enlargement of the abscesses was thus prevented. The authors of the previous Japanese report recommended that IVROBA should be aggressively treated with a combination of aspiration and microbial therapy.\n\n【29】Surgical aspiration is vital to identify the causative pathogen and avoid IVROBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 \\]</u>. Hematoma and rupture of the abscess into the ventricles can occur as surgical complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. In our patient, the brain abscesses decreased in size after surgical aspiration, and _S. intermedius_ was able to be isolated from pus obtained by surgical aspiration. In addition, no surgical or postsurgical complications occurred.\n\n【30】Our patient had no apparent neurological sequelae, although we have as yet only conducted follow-up of her for 6 months, and higher brain dysfunction and learning difficulty were not able to be evaluated. In a previous study, Carey _et al._ reported that, when tested 6 years after treatment, 70% of children had impaired scholastic ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The development of our patient thus needs to be followed up long-term.\n\n【31】In conclusion, our patient was a 15-month-old girl with CCHD who developed multiple brain abscesses, which were treated with a combination of surgical aspiration and antimicrobial therapy, without apparent neurological sequelae. We conclude that, even if multiple brain abscesses develop in infancy or early childhood, a good outcome may be obtained in cases without unconsciousness at admission, meningitis, or sepsis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be started immediately after diagnosis, with surgical aspiration performed to identify the causative pathogen while avoiding IVROBA.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CCHD:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cyanotic congenital heart disease</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IVROBA:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intraventricular rupture of brain abscess</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common form of oral cancers in adults and is related to risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In this article, we present three case reports of oral squamous cell carcinomas with delayed diagnosis. The first patient was a 52-year-old Turkish man, the second patient was a 61-year-old Turkish man and the third patient was a 60-year-old Turkish woman. All were referred to the Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry with pain, swelling and various complaints in their jaws.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Early diagnosis is of vital importance for the prognosis of the patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas. For this reason, dentists play a crucial role in the early detection and prevention of oral cancers.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for approximately 3% of all malignancies and more than 90% of cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. The reported etiological agents and risk factors for oral cancer include tobacco use, frequent alcohol consumption, the use of areca nut, a compromised immune system and a history of dietary habits that can cause cancer, as well as less established factors such as infection with certain types of human papillomaviruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. OSCC mostly affects adult men between the sixth and seventh decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 \\]</u>. The most affected sites, in decreasing order, are the tongue, oropharynx, lips, floor of the mouth, gingiva, hard palate and buccal mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Clinical stages (tumor, node and metastasis, or TNM) of OSCCs at diagnosis have an important influence on the survival and prognosis of patients. Unfortunately, approximately 60% to 65% of oral cancer patients are in TNM stages III and IV. Delay in diagnosis consists of either patient delay or professional delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The treatment of choice for OSCCs is wide _en bloc_ excision of the tumor in the soft tissue, with the involved bone and post-operative radiotherapy depending on the final histopathological results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Three patients with OSCCs, along with the clinical and radiological findings, are described in this case presentation.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Case 1\n\n【12】A 52-year-old Turkish man was referred to the Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry with complaints of pain and swelling in his left mandible and difficulty swallowing. The patient's anamnesis revealed that during a six-month period, he had been to two dentists in his own country, and they had implemented palliative treatment such as the use of mouthwash and antibiotic therapy. Because of the late diagnosis, the lesion was fairly enlarged when he presented to our faculty. His medical history revealed that he had no systemic health problems but had been a smoker for 30 years. His clinical examination revealed a hyperemic, ulcerated area with exophytic enlargement to the buccal and lingual sides 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1a )</u>. Because of his lack of oral hygiene, food debris had accumulated on the surface of the lesion and his tongue was hairy. He had an enlarged, painless, fixed lymph node in the submandibular area. A panoramic radiological evaluation revealed a radiolucent area and bone loss with irregular borders in the third molar region of the left mandibula 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1b )</u>. Upon an intra-oral and radiological examination, we observed a lesion approximately 6 cm in size. The diagnosis after histological examination of the biopsy specimen was invasive squamous cell carcinoma, and, based on the histopathological evaluation, the lesion was deemed to be at grade 3 level. On the basis of our clinical, radiological and histopathological evaluations, we made the diagnosis of a stage III lesion. The patient was referred to an oncology hospital. According to recently received information, the patient has undergone chemotherapy after surgery and is now in the control period.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】**(a) Intra-oral view showing the clinical aspect of case 1** . **(b)** Panoramic radiograph showing bone loss in the left mandibular third molar region of case 1.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】### Case 2\n\n【17】A 61-year-old Turkish man was referred to the Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry with complaints of pain and swelling in his left mandible. His medical history revealed that he had no systemic disorder. He did not have any habits such as smoking or alcohol intake. The patient's anamnesis showed that he refused to be examined for nine months. His clinical examination revealed an ulcerated, hyperemic enlargement with an irregular surface in the left retromolar region 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2a )</u>. He had no sign of the lymph node in the submandibular area. The patient's radiographic examination showed excessive bone loss, including the second and third molar teeth in the left mandible, with irregular borders 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1b )</u>. Upon clinical and radiological examinations, the lesion size was determined to be approximately 5 cm to 6 cm. The diagnosis rendered after the histological examination of the biopsy specimen was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma at the grade 2 level. On the basis of the clinical, radiological and histological evaluations of the lesion, it was deemed to be in stage II. The patient was referred to an oncology hospital. According to recently received information, the patient underwent surgery and was awaiting a decision regarding the initiation of radiotherapy.\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】**(a) Intra-oral view showing the clinical aspect of case 2** . **(b)** Panoramic radiograph showing bone loss in the left mandibular molar region of case 2.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】### Case 3\n\n【22】A 60-year-old Turkish woman was referred to the Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry with a complaint of continuous pain for three months after tooth extraction in her maxillary palatal region. During this time period, she had used antibiotics given by her dentist. Her medical history revealed that she had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She did not have any habits such as smoking or alcohol intake. Her clinical examination showed swelling in her palate with an ulcer in the center of the lesion and a pseudomembrane on it 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3a )</u>. Also, she had halitosis. The patient had an enlarged, painless, fixed lymph node in the submandibular area. A radiological examination revealed a considerable expansive area in which the margins of the radiolucent lesion could not be visualized on the panoramic radiograph 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3b )</u>. Upon clinical and radiological examinations, the lesion size was determined to be approximately 7 cm. The diagnosis rendered after histological examination of the biopsy specimen was invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the grade 3 level. On the basis of our clinical, radiological and histological evaluations, we determined that the lesion was in stage III. The patient was referred to an oncology hospital.\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】**(a) Intra-oral view showing the clinical aspect of case 3** . **(b)** Panoramic radiograph showing the destruction of bone with extensive indefinite borders in the maxillary molar region of case 3.\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】After undergoing surgery, she was treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Oral cancer is an important health problem worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, oral cancers have increased in the past few decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. The major risk factors for OSCC are smoking and alcohol consumption. The other etiologic factors are genetic pre-disposition, viral pathogens and nutritional habits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Data published in several reports have indicated that the exposure of women to both tobacco and alcohol causes a change in the susceptibility to oral tumors from a larger ratio of men to women to a larger ratio of women to men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 – 11 \\]</u>. In two patients in the present series, one of whom was a woman, their oral tumors were not associated with any habits such as tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption, so their presentations may be attributed to other etiological factors of OSCCs, such as certain viruses (such as human papillomavirus), low consumption of fruits and vegetables, genetic pre-disposition and so forth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】The survival ratio of patients with head and neck cancers is 76% in cases of early diagnosis without metastasis, 41% in cases involving cervical lymph node metastases and 9% if there is metastasis under the neck region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Dysplastic oral mucosal lesions may develop into OSCCs without early diagnosis and treatment. The survival duration of patients with OSCCs may be lengthened to five years in stages I and II compared with stages III and IV. Patients in stages III and IV are reported to have a mean six months or maximum one year survival duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Posterior localized tumors demonstrate a worse prognosis, since these often remain unnoticed in screening examinations, and once symptoms arise from regional lymph node metastases, the tumors are at an advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. An early diagnosis is not necessarily easy, because patients and health care professionals underrate the initial lesions, which are generally asymptomatic. This reality suggests that physicians have gaps in their knowledge of pathology, that patients delay seeking medical care and that access to and the quality of medical care are deficient, all of which reflect the absence of preventive public health programs and an effective health care system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 – 10 , 13 \\]</u>. All of our patients' diagnoses in this report were delayed. The patients in the present study were referred to an oncology hospital because of their metastases.\n\n【31】In patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and OSCC, delays in diagnosis of more than one month may contribute to an increased chance of the diagnosis of later-stage disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Furthermore, Fortin and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> found that treatment delays of more than 40 days in early-stage HNC were associated with an increased risk of locoregional failure and an effect on survival. These authors recommended that patients with HNC should be treated within 30 days of diagnosis to achieve improved outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The results of a survey of North American radiation oncologists showed a consensus that delays in initiating radiation therapy of approximately one month from the time of referral were excessive and likely to affect patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】OSCC and its treatment directly affect patients' health-related quality of life. The most basic functions of speech, chewing and swallowing are frequently altered, while symptoms such as pain and psychosocial issues like appearance and emotional functioning can also be problematic. If these tumors are at an advanced stage, aggressive therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy and, if needed, chemotherapy may be used to treat patients with the worst prognoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】In terms of quality of life, survival probability and treatment of the patient, early diagnosis of OSCC is very important. Dentists should have enough knowledge about clinical and radiological forms of anatomic structures to diagnose cancer in the oral region. Also, dentists should not overlook any abnormality in the oral region. One of the most important duties of a dentist is good follow-up of patients, especially in the diagnosis period. If indicated, dentists should request a biopsy, and in the presence of metastasis, the patient should be directed to the appropriate related department.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from all three patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

{"seq_id": "dd65b9e4-552a-47f9-af57-9a615889e3b6", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor are commonly used to treat macular diseases, including diabetic macular edema. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs can enter the systemic circulation after intravitreal injections and appear to suppress circulating vascular endothelial growth factor levels. However, whether this can cause any systemic adverse events remains unknown.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 70-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with diabetic macular edema in both eyes was treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injections. One month after receiving two intravitreal injections of aflibercept 1 week apart for diabetic macular edema in both eyes, he complained of a severe acute headache. The patient was diagnosed with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage of the occipital lobe based on an elevated blood pressure of 195/108 mmHg and the results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of his brain. The patient was treated with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride to lower his systemic blood pressure. Two days after the stroke, the patient began oral treatment with 80 mg/day telmisartan, which was continued for 3 days, and the telmisartan dose was reduced to 40 mg/day thereafter. His blood pressure promptly dropped to 130/80 mmHg, and his severe headache disappeared. One year after the cerebrovascular stroke, the telmisartan was discontinued because his blood pressure stabilized at a normal level. His plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels were measured via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the intravitreal injections of aflibercept. Immediately before the injections, the vascular endothelial growth factor level was 28 pg/ml, but it rapidly fell below the detection limit within 1 week, where it remained for over 2 months. Two days before the cerebral hemorrhage, his plasma vascular endothelial growth factor level was below the detection limit, and 2 months later after the stroke, his plasma vascular endothelial growth factor level recovered to 41 pg/ml.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This case suggests that hypertension and resultant cerebral hemorrhage can occur in patients with diabetic macular edema when plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels are systemically decreased below the detection limit for a prolonged time after local injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents into the vitreous cavity. Therefore, severely reduced plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels could be a higher risk factor to develop generally infrequent stroke. Ophthalmologists should be aware of possible severe reduction of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels and resultant increase in blood pressure after intravitreal injections of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drug. If the plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels could be monitored more easily and quickly during the treatment, it would help to prevent adverse events.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an essential role in normal and abnormal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and migration, which are necessary to form new blood vessels during embryonic development and wound healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that VEGF plays a central role in the pathogenesis of tumor growth and metastasis and in retinopathy associated with several blinding eye diseases, including diabetic macular edema (DME) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, was approved as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Anti-VEGF therapy is also widely recommended to maintain visual functioning in patients with age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, myopic choroidal neovascularization, and DME 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Large clinical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\]</u> have confirmed the safety of anti-VEGF therapy, but some meta-analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> indicate a high risk of systemic adverse events after repeated intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for DME. This inconsistency may result from the study design strategy because large studies are often limited to patients with relatively fewer and minor complications and exclude patients at risk for the worst adverse events such as cerebrovascular and arteriothrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>. Because patients with DME generally exhibit systemic complications, investigating the direct adverse events of anti-VEGF therapy for DME is difficult. Blockage of the VEGF pathway in cancer patients can cause adverse events such as hypertension, arterial thromboembolic events, cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, renal toxicity, and compromised wound healing and tissue repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Previous studies demonstrated that plasma VEGF levels were suppressed after local intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and continued to be decreased for several weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Other studies of age-related macular degeneration have reported elevated blood pressure after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. However, evidence of a direct relationship between decreased plasma VEGF levels and adverse events, such as hypertension and resultant cerebral hemorrhage, is lacking.\n\n【10】Here, we report a case of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage after intravitreal injections of aflibercept for bilateral DME, in which the plasma VEGF levels remained below the detection limit before and after the stroke. We also present a comprehensive review of the relevant literature.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 70-year-old Japanese man without any major family and psychosocial history was referred to our hospital to continue treatment for DME. At the patient’s former hospital, his major symptom was repeated visual disturbance of both eyes due to DME, and he received sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injections were once in both eyes, and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were 12 times in both eyes every 2–3 months (4 times with 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 7 times with 2  mg aflibercept in the right eye and once with aflibercept in the left eye) during the 2.5-year follow-up period. At the patient’s former hospital, the last anti-VEGF therapies were injected in the left eye in July 2016 and the right eye in December 2016.\n\n【13】At the patient’s first visit to our hospital in January 2017, his body height and weight was 160 cm and 52 kg \\[body mass index (BMI) 20.3\\], respectively. His HbA1c level was 6.3 %, and he has been suffering from diabetes mellitus for 10 years with only diet therapy. His blood pressure was 120/61 mmHg, and he had no hypertension. Although he had hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol 244 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 148 mg/dl), he did not receive any pharmacological treatments for it. He has been treated with donepezil hydrochloride for mild cognitive impairment in the neurology department of Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. However, because he works regularly and can attend a hospital by himself, he has no hindrance to daily life. In addition, there was no issue on financial and language/cultural challenges. A dilated fundus examination showed mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, with several small hemorrhages without macular edema, and his best corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes. The central subfield macular thickness (CMT) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was 279/320 μm (right eye/left eye).\n\n【14】Five months later, he noticed blurred vision in both eyes (visual acuity was 0.8 in both eyes), and a fundus examination showed significant macular edema in both eyes (CMT, 404/478 μm). In June 2017, for the first time at our hospital, the patient received 2-mg intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (6 June in the right eye and 13 June in the left eye). No laser therapy was applied. After short-term anti-VEGF therapies to both eyes, his systemic condition remained the same. The treatment was effective in both eyes, and 1 month later, his CMT recovered to 277/321  μm, and his blurred vision disappeared (visual acuity was 1.0 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye). Three months after the first treatment at our hospital (1 September 2017), significant macular edema relapsed in both eyes 通用删除1(英):<u>(CMT, 403/463 μm; Fig. 1 )</u>, visual acuity was 0.8 in right eye and 1.0 in left eye, and he desired continuous treatment for both eyes. In October 2017, he received intravitreal aflibercept injections in both eyes 1 week apart (3 October in the right eye and 10 October in the left eye). One month after treatment (10 November), his subjective complaint of blurred vision disappeared (0.8 in right eye and 1.2 in left eye), and the CMT decreased to 280/315 μm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. During this period, his HbA1c levels were measured and kept at 6.5% (3 October, 10 October, and 10 November).\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings from 1 September 2017. **a** Right-eye thickness map; **b** left-eye thickness map; **c** right-eye line scan; **d** left-eye line scan.

Yellow arrows indicate disappearance of the cystoid macular edema\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Upon initiating the intravitreal injection in the operating room, we measured his blood pressure as 141/69 mmHg (3 October) and 135/70 mmHg (10 October) without blood-pressure-lowering drugs 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u>. However, on 12 November, just 2 days after a follow-up visit to our hospital, he complained of a severe headache and walked to the emergency department at Tokyo Takanawa Hospital. He complained of a severe headache on the right back side of his head and visual disturbance of the left visual field with no other systemic neuropathological symptoms. He had no external injury presumed as trauma antecedent and no other apparent causes leading to cerebral hemorrhage. His blood pressure was elevated at 195/108 mmHg, and computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed the presence of a high-density area (2.5 × 3.0 cm) in the right occipital lobe indicating a subcortical hemorrhage 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 a)</u>. The patient was treated with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride to lower his systemic blood pressure to < 140 mmHg for 2 days. On 13 November, CT showed no enlargement of the high-density area (data not shown). On 15 November, 3 days after the stroke, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a peripheral low-intensity zone in the same region 通用删除1(英):<u>(T2\\*-weighted MRI, Fig. 4 b)</u> and a low-intensity area 通用删除1(英):<u>(diffusion-weighted MRI, Fig. 5 a)</u> in the occipital lobe that was consistent with the CT results. Additionally, magnetic resonance (MR) angiography revealed no vascular anomalies or malformation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 b)</u>, and T2\\*-weighted MRI revealed no cerebral microbleeds, thus ruling out cerebral amyloid angiopathy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 b)</u>. He was therefore diagnosed with a hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage of the occipital lobe. On 14 November, 2 days after the stroke, the patient began oral treatment with 80 mg/day telmisartan, which was continued for 3 days. Starting 17 November, the telmisartan dose was reduced to 40 mg/day. During this period, his blood pressure was maintained at < 130/80 mmHg, and his symptoms of severe headache disappeared, and visual disturbance of the left visual field was alleviated. Ten days later, he was discharged from Tokyo Takanawa Hospital, and 20 days after discharge he visited our hospital to receive a follow-up ophthalmological examination. Two months after the stroke (5 January 2018), visual field tests with Goldmann perimetry at our hospital showed no apparent left homonymous hemianopsia 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6 )</u>. Follow-up CT 通用删除1(英):<u>(14 February 2018; Fig. 4 c)</u> and T2\\*-weighted MRI 通用删除1(英):<u>(24 July 2018; Fig. 4 d)</u> examinations revealed that the cerebral hemorrhage had been absorbed, and the lesion had decreased in size. One year after the cerebrovascular stroke, the telmisartan was discontinued because his blood pressure had stabilized to a normal level and remained around 110/60 mmHg.\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( **a** ) and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels ( **b** ) of the patient before and after binocular anti-VEGF therapies 1 week apart. More than 2 months after anti-VEGF therapy in both eyes, the plasma VEGF levels fell below the detection limit (< 20 pg/ml). On 12 November 2017, cerebral hemorrhage occurred owing to acute hypertension, and the patient was treated with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride for 2 days to lower his blood pressure, which promptly returned to a normal level within the same day. On 14 November, 2 days after the stroke, the patients began oral treatment with 80 mg/day telmisartan, which was continued for 3 days. Starting 17 November, the telmisartan dose was reduced to 40 mg/day and continued for 1 year\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 4**\n\n【26】Computed tomography (CT) of the brain on 12 November 2017 ( **a** ) and 14 February 2018 ( **c** ), and T2\\*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on 15 November 2017 ( **b** ) and 24 July 2018 ( **d** ).

We happened to determine his plasma VEGF levels before and after the intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (October 2017) via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 通用删除1(英):<u>(SRL, Tokyo, Japan; Fig. 3 b)</u>. The patient’s plasma VEGF level was 28 pg/ml on 3 October, just before the intravitreal injection of aflibercept in the right eye. However, the level rapidly decreased to below the detection limit (< 20 pg/ml) on 10 October, just before the injection in his left eye. Notably, the levels on 10 November (2 days before the cerebral hemorrhage) and 10 December were also below the detection limit. On 25 January 2018, we confirmed that his plasma VEGF level had recovered to 41 pg/ml. Thereafter, we continued to follow the patient for DME and diabetic retinopathy, and no cerebral hemorrhage recurred.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】This is the first report of a patient who experienced hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage when plasma VEGF levels were below detection limit before and after stroke, on a patient receiving intravitreal injection of aflibercept for bilateral DME. Decreased plasma VEGF levels are possibly suspected to have a causal relationship with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage because VEGF is expressed in nearly all organs and tissues and is essential in normal and abnormal endothelial vasculogenesis and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 16 \\]</u>. VEGF induces new blood vessel formation by increasing the capillary and arteriolar density and releasing nitric oxide and prostaglandin I <sub>2 </sub> , which inhibit platelet activation, via endothelial cells to promote vasodilation in arterioles and venules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 16 \\]</u>. In the absence of VEGF, normal blood vessel formation by endothelial cells is impaired and weakened and thus more susceptible to hypertension and resultant hemorrhage. However, clarifying a direct causal relationship is difficult because DME patients generally have systemic complications. Although several trials revealed that intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents does not increase the risk of systemic vascular events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>, uncertainty still remains for DME patients who are at high risk for vascular disease and were not included 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. High blood pressure is thus considered to increase the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, but in this patient the most critical key incident was likely the prolonged absence of plasma VEGF together with the resultant high blood pressure due to the anti-VEGF treatment in both eyes over a short interval. To more clearly reveal a causal relationship between VEGF plasma levels and such adverse events, further rigorous clinical trials are necessary.\n\n【37】Plasma VEGF levels are not routinely monitored, but we investigated the plasma VEGF levels of 15 patients with DME from October 2017 to September 2018 and found that almost all patients showed decreased plasma VEGF levels after treatment with anti-VEGF agents (data not shown). Among them, two patients, including the patient described herein and a younger patient (a 45-year-old woman), received anti-VEGF agents to both eyes 1 week apart. In May 2013, the younger patient developed a cerebral infraction, and it turned out that she has also diabetes mellitus. When she started the treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab), she was treated with teneligliptin hydrobromide hydrate, bezafibrate, and aspirin, and her HbA1c level and blood pressure was 6.4% and 119/76 mmHg, respectively. Her plasma VEGF levels fell below the detection limit 1 day after the second treatment, which was 1 week after the first treatment, and 2 weeks after the treatment her VEGF levels recovered to detectable levels (21 pg/ml, and 1 month later 22 pg/ml). However, the present patient developed hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage with severely reduced plasma VEGF levels that had been below the detection limit for more prolonged time after the second treatment with the anti-VEGF agent to both eyes than those in the younger patient. Follow-up CT and T2\\*-weighted MRI examinations 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig 4 b, d)</u> suggested that the patient healed as normal because his blood pressure promptly dropped to the normal level within the same day after immediate treatment with an intravenous injection of nicardipine hydrochloride, which was maintained with oral telmisartan thereafter 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Consequently, the plasma VEGF level was recovered by 25 January 2018 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Although this report presents only one case, clinicians should consider that adverse events, including hypertension and resultant cerebral hemorrhage, can occur if plasma VEGF levels fall below the detection limit for a prolonged time during anti-VEGF therapy for DME.\n\n【38】Plasma VEGF levels that systemically fall below the detection limit after local intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents pose risks similar to those seen in cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The three most common anti-VEGF agents are bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab. Owing to their molecular properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>, bevacizumab and aflibercept were reported to greatly reduce plasma VEGF levels 1 and 4 weeks after a single intravitreal injection, whereas ranibizumab had no significant effect on these levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, ranibizumab presented a possible risk for cerebrovascular events when used monthly for 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. There is no difference among the treatments with these anti-VEGF agents in the risk of myocardial infraction, acute cerebrovascular disease, and major bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 20 , 21 \\]</u>. Importantly, intraocular VEGF levels were recently correlated with retinal neovascularization and consequently DME resolution but were unrelated to the DME severity or diabetic retinopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 22 , 23 \\]</u>. Therefore, decreased plasma VEGF levels are unnecessary for treating DME, and the total anti-VEGF agent amounts should be minimized to avoid prolonged decreases in plasma VEGF levels and possible resultant systemic adverse events in DME patients.\n\n【39】Risk factors for DME are high hemoglobin A1c levels and a long duration of diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>, and many patients with DME have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy improves visual outcomes and decreases macular edema, but the response is more gradual than that of other retinal diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u>. Patients with diabetes require more intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF medications to attain maximal improvement of visual outcomes. These injections must be given more often because DME is often binocular. Thus, to treat DME, clinicians might be better to combine anti-VEGF injections with other therapies (direct photocoagulation of microaneurysms or sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone acetonide injection and vitrectomy) as well as systemic improvement of diabetes control with the inclusion of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 26 \\]</u> and lipid metabolism. If anti-VEGF therapy must be frequently repeated, changes in plasma VEGF levels and resultant blood pressure together with other systemic pathological objective conditions should be monitored at every treatment in addition to the patient’s self-reported health status, especially in concomitant binocular treatment. Thus, severely reduced plasma VEGF levels could be another higher risk factor to develop generally infrequent stroke. Improving the technique for determining plasma VEGF levels would enable easier and faster measurements, thus making anti-VEGF therapy for DME safer. This could determine a more effective treatment schedule and may lead to better and safer vision and life quality for patients with diabetes.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】Hypertension and resultant cerebral hemorrhage can occur as adverse events in patients with DME when plasma VEGF levels systemically fall below the detection limit for a prolonged time after locally injecting anti-VEGF agents into the vitreous cavity. Therefore, severely reduced plasma VEGF levels could be a higher risk factor to develop generally infrequent stroke. Ophthalmologists should be aware of possible severe reduction of plasma VEGF levels and resultant increase in blood pressure after intravitreal injections of an anti-VEGF drug. If the plasma VEGF levels could be monitored more easily and quickly during the treatment, it would help to prevent adverse events.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CMT:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Central subfield macular thickness</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DME:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diabetic macular edema</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VEGF:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Vascular endothelial growth factor</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SD-OCT:</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is defined as an exocrine pancreatic neoplasia that mainly affects women between the second and third decade of life, and its management is not well defined. Endoscopic ultrasound offers a key anatomical advantage in accessing the pancreas and endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration has become the gold standard method for the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】**Case 1:** A 31-year-old white Hispanic woman presented with epigastric pain for 5 months. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a single 2 cm nodule in the uncinate process of her pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a regular, well-defined solid lesion with alternating cystic areas at the uncinate process of her pancreas, measuring 1.7 × 1.4 cm; endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration was then performed with cytopathological analysis compatible with solid pseudopapillary tumor.\n\n【5】Body computed tomography confirmed the absence of metastases and she underwent conventional duodenopancreatectomy. However, she died 4 days after surgery due to postoperative surgical complications.\n\n【6】**Case 2:** A 35-year-old Hispanic woman presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain for 3 months, associated with a palpable mass at this region. A computed tomography scan showed a solitary nodule in the pancreatic body. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a regular, well-defined, homogeneous lesion with small anechoic (cystic) areas, measuring 2 × 2 cm, in between the pancreatic body and neck. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration was performed and cytopathological analysis was suggestive of a pseudopapillary solid tumor. She underwent a body-tail laparoscopic pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Nine months after the diagnosis, she remains asymptomatic, continuing regular follow-up in the oncology out-patient clinic.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare pancreatic malignancy.

It accounts for approximately 8 to 16% of pancreatic tumors in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】Symptoms of SPT depend on the location and size of the tumor but usually are nonspecific, with abdominal pain being the most common in approximately one-third of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Several imaging techniques can be used to diagnose pancreatic masses, such as abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). EUS has assumed a very important role in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, providing a better evaluation of the morphologic characteristics of the lesions and the possibility of guiding fine-needle aspiration (FNA) punctures for tissue sampling with a low risk of complications and increased diagnostic accuracy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.

She did not present with any other symptoms. An abdominal US revealed a 2 cm, single nodule in the uncinate process of her pancreas. EUS showed a well-defined hypoechoic solid lesion with regular, clear, and precise margins with alternating cystic areas measuring 1.7 × 1.4 cm, located in the uncinate process of her pancreas; the lesion had no communication with her main pancreatic duct 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a, b )</u>. EUS-FNA was performed with a 22 gauge needle (Expect™ Slimline; Boston Scientific) obtaining a representative tissue sample without complications.

It is a very rare type of pancreatic neoplasm with a low rate of progression to malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Under 2800 cases have been reported until the year 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, with the largest single institution case series of 37 patients who underwent surgical resection of SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. It affects mainly young women (approximately 90% of cases), but can affect men and women of any age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The most commonly affected areas are the body and tail of the pancreas, corresponding to approximately 60% of the diagnosed cases. Unlike most reported cases, our patients presented lesions at the uncinate process and at the transition between the body and neck of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The symptoms of SPT are usually nonspecific, with abdominal pain being the most common, accounting for approximately 37.6% of the cases. Other signs and symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal fullness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss may also be present. Approximately one-third of the patients are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As reported in the literature, our patients presented with nonspecific symptoms. With the recent advances of radiologic diagnostic imaging methods, SPT has been increasingly diagnosed in general clinical practice. US, CT, MRI, and EUS are the most widely used methods for pancreatic masses evaluation. Over the years, EUS-FNA has become the gold standard method for the diagnosis of pancreatic solid masses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms ranges from 80 to 90% and from 85 to 96%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. EUS commonly identifies SPT as a well circumscribed, solid, hypoechogenic, heterogeneous tumor with cystic components and calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】In our two cases, EUS showed solid hypoechoic lesion with cystic components with regular contours but it was not heterogeneous. Since EUS-FNA is considered the gold standard for pancreatic lesions, EUS-FNA was performed with histopathological diagnostic confirmation of SPT.\n\n【34】The diagnosis of SPT with EUS-FNA has been increasing in popularity as shown in a case series of 34 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, where EUS-FNA improved the preoperative diagnostic yield of SPT, correctly identifying 82% of patients when compared to CT scan findings (23.5%) and EUS (41.2%). These findings suggest that patients who do not have a clear diagnosis of an SPT using only image studies may benefit from EUS-FNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. The operating characteristics of EUS-FNA for diagnostic solid pancreatic masses were: sensitivity 95% (95% CI, 93.2–95.4), specificity 92% (95% CI, 86.6–95.7), positive predictive value 98% (95% CI, 97–99), and negative predictive value 80% (95% CI, 74.9–82.7). The overall accuracy of EUS-FNA was 94.1% (95% CI, 92.0–94).\n\n【35】Complications related to EUS-FNA are only reported in approximately 1% of patients. The most common complication is acute pancreatitis; other reported complications are abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Both of our cases presented no complications related to the EUS-FNA procedure.\n\n【36】An anatomopathological study revealed pseudopapillary areas with fibrovascular stems or rosette-like structures secondary to the low cohesion of neoplastic cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. An immunohistochemical study stained positive for beta-catenin, vimentin, progesterone receptor, CD56, neuron-specific coil, CD10, cyclin D1, E-membranous, and E-cadherin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Unlike other pancreatic tumors, the most sensitive specific marker for SPT is the abnormal nuclear expression of beta-catenin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The Ki-67 index has been suggested as an indicator of malignant potential and poor prognosis in SPT. A low Ki-67 index (≤ 5%) indicates slow tumor growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Microscopic evaluation of the two reported cases revealed intact papillary structures with fibrovascular stems. In the second case, diagnostic confirmation was still necessary through an immunohistochemical study, confirming the suspected diagnosis of SPT through the expression of beta-catenin. Immunohistochemistry also showed a low mitotic Ki-67 index, suggesting good prognosis.\n\n【37】Surgical treatment of SPT offers an excellent overall survival rate, greater than 95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The surgical procedure to be performed will depend on the topography and level of tumor invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. After diagnostic confirmation by EUS-FNA, our two patients underwent different surgical procedures according to lesion topography. Patient 1 underwent duodenopancreatectomy, while patient 2 underwent a body-tail pancreatectomy with splenectomy. The outcomes of our two case reports were different, with one patient presenting a favorable evolution, while the other patient died due to postoperative complications. The different evolutions of the cases may justify the view that more aggressive surgery (duodenopancreatectomy) could have been performed on the patient with uncinated pancreatic process neoplastic invasion. The reported mortality rate related to postoperative complications after SPT resection is only 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Neither of our patients had neoplastic metastases, although it is known that despite the low malignant potential, up to 15% of cases of SPT develop distant metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. The most common sites of metastasis are the liver and lymph nodes. Tumor recurrence may occur in approximately 6% of cases, requiring rigorous follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】In this context, EUS-FNA is a very important method that presents excellent diagnostic rates and provides material for cytological and histological evaluation of SPT.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【41】SPT is a rare pancreatic neoplasia. Anatomopathological study is necessary for treatment and prognosis evaluation. EUS-FNA is the gold standard method to characterize and diagnose these type of pancreatic lesions, making this an invaluable tool to help guide clinical management, decide a patient’s surgical candidacy, and improve the preoperative diagnostic yield.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EUS:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Endoscopic ultrasound</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FNA:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fine-needle aspiration</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SPT:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Solid pseudopapillary tumor</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>US:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ultrasound</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Oral lesions are considered to be an important extraintestinal manifestation. Granulomatous cheilitis has been recognized as an early manifestation of Crohn's disease. It may follow, coincide with or precede the onset of Crohn's disease. The aim of this presentation is to describe a rare case of a patient with Crohn's disease in whom significant swelling of the lower lip not only preceded the diagnosis of Crohn's disease for two years, but it manifested as an early clinical index of the recurrence of the intestinal disease as well.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A man aged 25 was admitted in our department on August 1999 with chronic diarrhea and loss of weight. His bowel symptoms started in 1998 at the age of 24. However, two years previously (June 1996) he noticed a swelling of the lower lip, which contrasted significantly with the previously normal appearance of his mouth. A lip biopsy performed at that time was compatible with granulomatous cheilitis. Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum and large bowel was diagnosed in 1998 and confirmed on the basis of colonoscopy, enteroclysis and histology findings of the small and large bowel. Conservative treatment resulted in clinical and laboratory improvement of the bowel symptoms and lip swelling. During the following years the disease was active with exacerbations and remissions of mild to moderate severity. The swelling of the lower lip occurred in parallel with the exacerbations of the bowel disease, returning to normal during periods of remission.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Significant swelling of the lower lip due to granulomatous cheilitis could be the first manifestation of Crohn's disease, preceding intestinal symptoms. Exacerbation of the lip lesion could be an early clinical sign of a relapse of the underlying intestinal disease.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Oral lesions are well-documented clinical features in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 4 \\]</u>. The spectrum of these lesions described so far in the medical and dental literature is quite large and includes oral ulceration, labial, buccal and gingival swelling, buccal abscesses, mucosal inflammatory hyperplasia, mucosal tags and fissuring, gingivitis, granulomatous inflammation of minor salivary glands, granulomatous cheilitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 10 \\]</u>, candidiasis, angular cheilitis, lichen planus, pyostomatitis vegetans, lymphadenopathy, perioral erythema, orofacial granulomatosis, midline lip fissuring, cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, and dental caries. The prevalence of oral lesions in newly diagnosed patients has been estimated to be up to 48% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】It is of interest that, like other extraintestinal manifestations, oral lesions may precede the onset of the underlying intestinal inflammatory disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. However, it is difficult to determine exactly which oral manifestation is certainly related to CD although it is logical to hypothesize that some of these lesions are in fact consequence of the disease or a secondary reaction to medical treatment.\n\n【11】Orofacial granulomatosis is a term used to describe swelling of the orofacial area, mainly the lips, secondary to an underlying granulomatous inflammatory process. Granulomatous cheilitis is the histopathological description of such inflammation occurring in the lips and surrounding tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. It has been recognized as an early manifestation of CD following, coinciding with or preceding the onset of CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>. This extraintestinal manifestation could significantly affect the quality of life of patients with CD.\n\n【12】Therefore, the aim of this presentation is to describe the long-term clinical course of the underlying CD in relation to the clinical behavior of the oral lesion in different time periods.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】The patient was a man aged 25. He was a smoker (20 cigarettes per day) since the age of 19. His symptoms started on June 1998 at the age of 24, with chronic diarrhea not accompanied by mucus or blood in the stools, abdominal pain, fever, or loss of weight. Two years previously on June 1996, he had noticed a slight swelling of the lower lip which contrasted with the previously normal appearance of his mouth 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. He consulted a specialist in oral medicine, who performed a lip biopsy. The histology of the specimen (13 × 7 × 7 mm) showed a multilayer squamous epithelium covering the tissue specimen, scattered clusters of lymphocytes and histiocytes resembling non-caseating granulomas, as well as infiltration of the small vessel walls of the underlying connective tissue by monocytes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. The diagnosis was compatible with granulomatous cheilitis. Colonoscopy performed in 1998 revealed large ulcers in the terminal ileum and caecum. Enteroclysis confirmed the involvement of the terminal ileum in a total length of 50 cm. Administration of methylprednisolone, mesalazine and cholestyramine, resulted in prompt improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】**Lip swelling before the appearance of bowel symptoms (June 1996).**\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Figure 2**\n\n【19】**Histological picture of the patient's lip before the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.** Multilayer squamous epithelium covering the tissue specimen, scattered clusters of lymphocytes and histiocytes resembling non-caseating granulomas, and infiltration of the small vessel walls of the underlying connective tissue by monocytes are seen.\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】During the subsequent years the disease course included at least two clinically evident recurrences of moderate severity that responded well to the administration of corticosteroids and mesalazine. Six years after diagnosis a new recurrence of CD of moderate severity (CDAI 226 points) was noticed, accompanying by lip swelling as well 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u>. Enteroclysis and colonoscopy plus ileoscopy showed active disease confined to the terminal ileum and the cecum.\n\n【22】**Figure 3**\n\n【23】**Oral lesion during exacerbation of Crohn's disease (July 2005).**\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】The characteristic of the clinical course of the patient was the fact that during the exacerbations of CD, the enlargement of the lip was more evident, returning to almost normal during the periods of remission and that the administration of corticosteroids resulted in prompt improvement of the lip swelling.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Orofacial granulomatosis is a term generally used to describe swelling of the orofacial area, mainly the lips, secondary to an underlying granulomatous inflammatory process. It is a heterogeneous clinical condition that presents with chronic swelling of the oral or facial tissues due to granulomatous inflammation. Granulomatous cheilitis is a very rare disorder of unknown etiology, characterised by recurrent swelling of the labial tissues. The typical histological picture is the formation of scattered aggregates of non-caseating granulomas and epithelioid histiocytes. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (a triad of orofacial swelling, facial paralysis and a fissured tongue) is one manifestation of orofacial granulomatosis, which more commonly presents as granulomatous cheilitis alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 – 10 \\]</u>. Most reported cases of orofacial granulomatosis have been in adults and some in adolescents. Orofacial granulomatosis in the paediatric population may be an initial manifestation of CD.\n\n【28】The interesting points regarding the clinical manifestations and the course of our patient were the fact that granulomatous cheilitis preceded the diagnosis of CD by two years, the fact that the enlargement of the lower lip occurred in parallel with the clinical exacerbations of CD and that the administration of corticosteroids resulted not only in improvement of bowel symptoms but also in diminishment of the size of the lip swelling. Another point of interest was the fact that granulomatous cheilitis was the only extraintestinal manifestation in our patient, a fact not mentioned in other descriptions.\n\n【29】It has been suggested that histological oral inflammation could be more common in patients with active than inactive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. According to a relevant description, patients with active CD tended to have higher scores of gingivitis than patients with inactive disease. It has also been found that smoking habit – a well established risk factor for the development of CD – and duration of disease do not have any influence on the incidence of this lesion in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【30】The etiology of this lesion is unknown although various factors including levels of vitamins and trace elements, other nutritional components, and certainly the underlying inflammatory bowel disease could be involved. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis has not been found to be implicated in the pathogenesis of orofacial granulomatosis or oral CD as was suggested previously. In the absence of mechanical irritation or other mucosal disease, the oral lesions in CD could be attributed to the inflammatory bowel disease itself. It is of interest that patients with oral lesions have a significantly higher proportion of involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus) with CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Concerning treatment of granulomatous cheilitis and oral lesions of inflammatory bowel disease patients in general, it seems that topical application of corticosteroids, in conjunction with systemic treatment of the bowel disease, could be of benefit as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】This case emphasizes the fact that orofacial granulomatosis may be misdiagnosed since its clinical manifestations may be independent of or even precede the appearance of CD. Thus, patients with possible granulomatus cheilitis should be carefully asked about the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Those with suspicious symptoms should have a careful gastrointestinal evaluation, including enteroclysis or imaging capsule as well as complete gastrointestinal endoscopic examination. Once granulomatus cheilitis is diagnosed the patient should be followed up carefully and investigated for CD when gastrointestinal symptoms develop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. However, not all authors agree completely with this assumption. Van der Waal et al found a low chance of developing CD in their patients with granulomatus cheilitis and thus they suggest that patients with a negative history of gastrointestinal complaints should not be exposed to routine investigations of the gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】From the clinical course of this patient we suggest that granulomatous cheilitis manifesting as a significant swelling of the lower lip could be the first clinical sign of CD. This lesion could well be correlated with the activity of the intestinal disease, being quite prominent in periods of exacerbation of CD and retuning to almost normal appearance during periods of remission.\n\n【35】Consent\n-------\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The epithelial component is mainly high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC), and the mesenchymal malignant component consists of osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and so forth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also referred to as _inflammatory pseudotumor_ , _pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor_ , and _post-operative spindle cell nodule_ , is an unusual, benign, myofibroblastic spindle cell lesion that can arise from various organs, including the urinary bladder. IMT of the bladder manifests prominent nucleoli, mitoses, chromosomal abnormalities, necrosis, and muscularis propria invasion, resembling malignant spindle cell tumors, including pure RMS, leiomyosarcoma, and SC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Clinically, proper differential diagnosis of adult rhabdomyosarcomatous tumors of the urinary bladder, including pure RMS, SC, and IMT, can be a challenge. In this report, we present a case of recurrent low-grade UC with extensive rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation in an elderly man. The lesion presented as a large mass due to a rhabdomyosarcomatous component at the first medical examination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of low-grade UC as the epithelial component of SC.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 52-year-old Asian man underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of stage I (T1N0M0) low-grade UC (transitional cell carcinoma \\[TCC\\]) in the anterior wall of the bladder at a nearby hospital. He was referred to our hospital 4 months after undergoing TUR. Cytoscopic examination performed at our division showed scar formation after TUR with negative biopsies, and he did not wish to undergo further treatment. Although we planned follow-up studies, he stopped visiting our hospital just after the cytoscopic examination. At the age of 64, 12 years after undergoing TUR, he visited our department with complaints of frequent urination and macroscopic hematuria without painful micturition. During his physical examination, a pelvic mass and superficial lymph nodes were not palpable, but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large mass (3.8cm×2.9cm) with infiltration into the muscle layer (T2b), which was located in the anterior wall of the urinary bladder. The mass intensity was the same as in the rest of the bladder wall on T1-weighted images and slightly greater than in the bladder wall on T2-weighted ones 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a, b )</u>. Urinary cytology was positive and suggestive of UC (TCC). Cytoscopic examination revealed a large pedunculated polyp with a surrounding papillary appearance. The patient subsequently underwent a transurethral biopsy of the tumor. The pathological diagnosis was low-grade, non-invasive papillary UC (Ta), and there was no evidence of metastasis on CT or MRI. Although muscularis propria invasion was not observed in the transurethral biopsy specimens, the patient was diagnosed with stage II (T2bN0M0) UC on the basis of MRI findings of tumor infiltration into the muscle layer. Therefore, tumor tissue was removed by total cystectomy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1c )</u>, and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection of external iliac and obturator regions with ileal conduit urinary diversion was performed. In total, eight lymph nodes were dissected. No post-operative complications were observed.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Magnetic resonance imaging scans obtained at presentation ( **a** and **b** ) and of the resected urinary bladder ( **c** ). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large mass (3.8cm×2.9cm) with fragmentation of muscularis propria ( _arrows_ ), which was located in the anterior wall of the urinary bladder. The mass intensity was the same as in the rest of the bladder wall on T1-weighted images ( **a** ) and slightly greater than in the bladder wall on T2-weighted ones ( **b** ). The resected urinary bladder showed a large pedunculated polyp with a surrounding papillary appearance\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】The final diagnosis of low-grade UC (TCC) with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation (INFa, pTa \\[epithelial component\\]/pT2b \\[mesenchymal component\\], LVI0, RM0, u-rt0, u-lt0, ur0, N0, M0) was established on the basis of immunohistochemical studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay of the resected neoplastic tissue. The pedunculated polyp was made up mainly of a sarcomatous component with a spindle cell–like appearance, which was characterized by severe nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a )</u>, and scattered areas of necrosis. Some strap- and racket-shaped cells with eosinophilic elongated cytoplasm were present in a dispersed manner 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a )</u>. Spindle-like cells were positive for vimentin 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2b )</u>, myogenin, and desmin, suggesting rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. In contrast, these cells were negative for cytokeratins recognized by AE1/AE3 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2c )</u>, chromogranin, synaptophysin, α-smooth muscle actin, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2d )</u>. Rearrangements and copy number gain of the _ALK_ gene were not detected by FISH 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2e )</u>. Muscularis propria invasion (T2b) was observed in the sarcomatous lesion without lymph node metastasis. The epithelial component of the tumor, which was consistent with a papillary lesion surrounding the pedunculated polyp, was low-grade, non-invasive UC (TCC) without necrosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2f )</u>. The rate of positivity of urinary cytology in patients with low-grade UC (TCC) is about 25% at our institute. The status of X chromosome inactivation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in both the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components was not analyzed. No evidence of recurrence was detected by whole-body CT during a 2-year follow-up period without further treatment.\n\n【17】**Fig. 2**\n\n【18】Pathological specimens of the resected neoplastic tissue. **a–e** Pedunculated polyp. **f** Papillary lesion. **a** , **f** Hematoxylin and eosin staining. **b–d** Immunohistochemical staining. **e** Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a dual-color break-apart probe for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The 5′ end of the _ALK_ gene was labeled with Vysis SpectrumGreen, and its 3′ end was labeled with Vysis SpectrumOrange (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA). The pedunculated polyp consisted mainly of a sarcomatous component with a spindle cell–like appearance, which was characterized by severe nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Some strap- and racket-shaped cells with eosinophilic elongated cytoplasm were present in a dispersed manner ( **a** ). Spindle-like cells were positive for vimentin ( **b** ) but negative for cytokeratins recognized by AE1/AE3 ( **c** ) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( **d** ). Rearrangements and copy number gain of the _ALK_ gene were not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A total of 94% of tumor cells showed pseudo-color signals ( _yellow color, arrowheads_ ) without deletion of red signals ( **e** ). The papillary lesion was a low-grade, non-invasive urothelial carcinoma without necrosis ( **f** )\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】In our patient, transurethral biopsy revealed UC but not a sarcomatous component, owing to inadequate sampling. However, the reverse situation has been reported by others. Depending on the circumstances, a small focus of carcinomatous component may be detectable only by extensive, multiple sampling. Therefore, in the case of adult rhabdomyosarcomatous tumor, the diagnosis of pure RMS should be made very carefully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】The other difficulty is differentiating this case from IMT. Although both epithelial and myogenic markers can be expressed in IMT, a morphologically typical epithelial component is not interwoven with IMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the majority of IMT express ALK protein, and FISH analysis has identified _ALK_ gene alterations within myofibroblastic spindle cells of IMT, suggesting an etiology of a low-grade mesenchymal neoplasm other than primary inflammatory reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 6 \\]</u>. However, our patient’s tumor was a typical epithelial carcinoma, and ALK protein expression and _ALK_ alterations of the rhabdomyosarcomatous component were both negative.\n\n【23】The accurate histogenesis of SC has not been clarified in detail. Although multiclonal theory and monoclonal theory have been discussed, molecular and genetic research using LOH, comparative genomic hybridization, and X chromosome inactivation analysis substantiate a common origin with divergent differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Previous studies have suggested that the epithelial component of SC of the bladder precedes the mesenchymal component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The tumor in our patient may initially have exhibited epithelial differentiation as UC and then mesenchymal differentiation with the appearance of RMS. However, it is not clear whether the origin of the tumor was residual cancer cells after TUR or de novo generation.\n\n【24】In most reported cases, the epithelial component of SC of the bladder is high-grade UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, low-grade UC as the epithelial component of SC has not been reported before for the present case. At times, SC occurs in patients who have undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a situation in which cell replication error was induced. However, our patient had not received any anti-cancer treatment except for TUR of low-grade UC. It has been reported that past history of non-invasive cancer correlates with the malignant grade in secondary UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. In addition, the role of inflammation in urothelial cell carcinogenesis has lately been receiving considerable attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Inflammation caused by TUR for low-grade UC might have influenced the mesenchymal differentiation in UC of our patient. Indeed, others reported two cases of SC with a history of recurrent bladder cancer and subsequent TUR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, although their report and the case of our patient do not refute the safety of TUR.\n\n【25】Owing to the extreme rarity of SC of the bladder and the absence of randomized controlled studies, the standard treatment for SC of the bladder has not been defined. SC usually presents at a higher T stage with more frequent regional metastases than UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Therefore, radical cystectomy seems to be preferable even in superficial disease. Although total cystectomy followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy has been recommended by some groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 , 15 \\]</u>, the therapeutic efficacy of these treatments is still controversial owing to the varying results. Because muscularis propria invasion was observed in the sarcomatous lesion in our patient, we considered systemic chemotherapy (e.g. cisplatin plus gemcitabine regimen) as a treatment option. However, our patient did not wish to undergo adjuvant treatments after the total cystectomy. Nevertheless, no evidence of recurrence was detected during a 2-year follow-up period.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】UC of the urinary bladder with extensive rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is rare, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis even when UC coexisting with a rhabdomyosarcomatous component is of low grade, especially in cases of a tumor that is unexpectedly large for low-grade UC. More molecular biological research is needed to obtain insight into the pathogenic factors involved in rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation in UC to improve the management of this disease.\n\n【28】Consent\n-------\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

She had the classical features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy: short stature (138cm), obesity (body mass index 49.5kg/m2), bilateral shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpals, short neck, round and wide face with bombed front and small eyes. Before the gastric bypass was performed, biochemical determination revealed a slightly low serum calcium level (2.09mmol/L; normal range 2.1 to 2.5mmol/l), and an elevated parathyroid hormone level (87ng/L; normal range 10 to 70ng/L) associated with low vitamin D level (19μg/L; normal range 30 to 50μg/L). Vitamin D supplementation was prescribed before surgery. After the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, she achieved a progressive substantial weight loss, from 94kg (body mass index 49.5kg/m2) to 49kg (body mass index 25.9kg/m2) in one year. Her weight then stabilized at 50kg (body mass index 26kg/m2) during our three years of follow-up. Before the operation and every three months after it, she was screened for nutritional deficiencies, and serum markers of bone turnover and renal function were monitored. Considering the deficiencies in zinc, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D and vitamin B12, appropriate supplementation was prescribed. Before and two years after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of bone density was performed that showed no changes on her lumbar column (0.882g/cm <sup>2 </sup> and both T-score and Z-score of −1.5 standard deviation). In addition, bone microarchitecture with a measurement of her trabecular bone score was found to be normal.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】This is the first case of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass described in a patient with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism showing that such a procedure seems to be safe in obese patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism if appropriately followed up. As obesity is a prominent feature of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, such patients might seek bariatric surgery. After a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy associated with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism need long-term follow-up on nutritional and metabolic issues.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is a disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in _GNAS_ , the gene encoding the alpha chain of the stimulatory G protein and is associated with short stature, obesity, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, dental abnormalities and cognitive impairment. Because _GNAS_ is paternally imprinted (silenced) in certain hormone target tissues, patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy with _GNAS_ mutations on maternally inherited alleles often manifest resistance to multiple stimulatory G protein-coupled hormones (for example, parathyroid hormone (PTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH), and/or growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)), a variant termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. The patients who inherit mutations on the paternal allele have the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy developmental defects and phenotype alone without hormonal resistance, a variant termed pseusopseudohypoparathyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The severity of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype is extremely variable, even among members of the same family and generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Classically, the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy obesity phenotype has been viewed as part of both conditions since first described by Fuller Albright in the mid-1950s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Bariatric surgery still remains the most effective treatment for morbid obesity, leading to a reduction of comorbidities in the long term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most frequently performed procedures in the United States and Europe. A small gastric pouch is formed, the jejunum is divided at the midsection, and the distal portion of the small intestine is anastomosed to the pouch, thus allowing nutrients to bypass the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Because these are the preferred sites for the absorption of calcium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, patients frequently suffer from calcium and vitamin D deficiencies after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass, which might cause secondary hyperparathyroidism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Long-lasting secondary hyperparathyroidism is believed to be an important contributing factor for increased bone turnover, consequent bone loss and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. It has been known for more than 50 years that osteomalacia and osteoporosis are frequent complications of gastric surgery and small bowel malabsorptive disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Significant increase in serum markers of bone turnover has been documented in patients with reduced bone density after bariatric surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】We describe, for the first time, a three-year follow-up of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】This case concerns a 26-year-old Caucasian woman, known to have Albright hereditary osteodystrophy with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism who presented herself to our department for treatment of her obesity. Her molecular analysis showed heterozygous mutation (L272F) in _GNAS1_ exon 10. She had a previous history of congenital hip dysplasia, interventricular communication, strabismus, delayed growth, renal failure stage 3 and type 2 diabetes. She had never had a fracture.\n\n【13】A physical examination showed a weight of 77.7kg with a stature of 138cm (body mass index (BMI) 40.8kg/m2). She had the classical features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy: short stature, obesity, short neck, round and wide face with bombed front and small eyes. An examination of her hands revealed a bilateral shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpals 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】**Hands of the patient.** ( **A** ) right hand. ( **B** ) left hand.\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Biochemical determination revealed normal levels of pituitary hormones TSH, human growth hormone (HGH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). As she had regular menses and no signs nor symptoms of cortisol deficiency, we did not measure adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), FSH and LH. She had mild hypocalcemia (2.09mmol/L; normal range 2.1 to 2.5mmol/L), low vitamin D level (19μg/L; normal range 30 to 50μg/L), and elevated PTH level (87ng/L; normal range 10 to 70ng/L), which was probably secondary to vitamin D deficiency. Phosphate and magnesium were in the normal range. Her karyotype was 46 XX.\n\n【18】Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) assessment of bone density showed osteopenia: 0.812g/cm <sup>2 </sup> and both T-score and Z-score of −1.4 standard deviation (SD) on her lumbar column L1-L4. Proximal femur bone density was measured at 0.854g/cm <sup>2 </sup> and T-score and Z-score were both at −0.7 SD. Beta-CrossLaps were high at 869 ng/L (normal range: 25 to 573ng/L), signaling an increase in bone turnover 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We assessed the bone microarchitecture with a measurement of her trabecular bone score (TBS), which is a novel gray-level texture measurement that can be extracted from DEXA images and correlates with three-dimensional parameters of bone microarchitecture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The TBS on the patient’s lumbar column showed a degraded skeletal microarchitecture (TBS of 1.189).\n\n【19】As she had hypovitaminosis D with osteopenia, vitamin D was prescribed.\n\n【20】As far as her obesity is concerned, her eating disorder was treated first, using group and individual psychological support, as well as dietetic and medical consultations. After two and a half years of therapy, our patient managed to improve her eating behavior and lifestyle. After a progressive weight gain, she could finally stabilize her weight at 92Kg (BMI 49.5Kg/m2). She was therefore ready to undergo a Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass.\n\n【21】During the first year after the procedure, she gradually achieved a substantial weight loss: from 94kg (BMI 49.5kg/m2) to 49kg (BMI 25.9kg/m2). Afterwards, her weight stabilized at 50kg (BMI 26kg/m2) during our three-year follow-up. Every three months after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a screening for nutritional deficiency was performed, as well as a measurement of markers of renal function and bone turnover, as shown in Table 1 . Considering the deficiencies in zinc, magnesium, calcium, vitamin D and vitamin B12, intramuscular vitamin B12 supplementation and oral zinc, magnesium, calcium and D vitamin were introduced. The doses were adjusted every three months, according to the serum vitamin level.\n\n【22】**Table 1 **Blood test results before and after gastric bypass****\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】Two years after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a DEXA assessment of bone density was performed, which showed no changes on her lumbar column (0.882g/cm <sup>2 </sup> and both T-score and Z-score of −1.5 SD), significant bone loss on her proximal femur (from 0.854g/cm <sup>2 </sup> to 0.754g/cm <sup>2 </sup> and a reduction of both T-score and Z-score from −0.7 SD to −1.5 SD). This apparent bone loss on the proximal femur is an artifact due to the significant weight loss of the patient, and consequent fat estimation error due to variation in soft tissue hydratation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We assessed the bone microarchitecture with a measurement of TBS, which showed normal bone microarchitecture on her lumbar column (TBS of 1.373). It is interesting to notice a substantial improvement in her TBS, which showed a degraded skeletal microarchitecture in the pre-operative measurement and normal bone microarchitecture two years after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which is partially due to the weight loss. In the analysis of TBS, obesity often leads to underestimation of the TBS score. The level of Beta-CrossLaps remained high at 682ng/L (normal range: 25 to 573ng/L), slightly lower than in the pre-operative assessment.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】This is the first case of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass described in an obese patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. Observations during the three-year follow-up shows that bariatric surgery seems to be safe in such patients. As obesity is a prominent feature of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, these patients are prone to seek bariatric surgery. After a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, such patients need long-term follow-up on nutritional and metabolic issues, as does every other patient undergoing the same surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Our patient needed calcium and vitamin D supplementation before and after the surgery. A comparison in the DEXA assessments of bone density before and two years after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed no changes on her lumbar column.\n\n【27】Bone abnormalities of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism are not well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u> as calcium metabolism and skeletal health after bariatric surgery are not well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 15 \\]</u>. In our case, the elevation of PTH before and after surgery was identical, as well as the beta-crosslabs level. Further long-term prospective studies are critical to confirm if bariatric surgery in obese patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is indeed safe.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【29】We present the first published case of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in a patient with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism showing that such a procedure seems to be safe in obese patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism if appropriately followed up. Obesity is a prominent feature of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, and such patients may seek bariatric surgery. After a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy associated with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism need long-term follow-up for nutritional and metabolic issues.\n\n【30】Consent\n-------\n\n【31】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

A physical examination showed coarse breath sounds in bilateral lungs with moist rales in the lower lobe of his right lung. The tumor marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) was 45.84 U/ml (0 to 35.0) and cytokerantin-19-fragment (CYFRA21-1) was 17.79 ng/ml (0 to 3.3). A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple plaques and nodules with air bronchograms in bilateral lungs; infectious lesions were suspected.\n\n【15】He fasted for at least 6 hours before an intravenous injection of <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( <sup>18 </sup> F-FDG) at a dose of 0.2 mCi/kg. After resting for 60 minutes, he was given 300 to 500 mL of pure drinking water followed by bladder emptying before a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT examination (Discovery® VCT; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee WI, USA). Before PET scanning, full body CT scanning from his skull base to his mid-femurs was acquired for attenuation correction and anatomic localization with the following scanning parameters: voltage, 120 kV; current, 130 mA; slice thickness, 3.75 mm; and interlayer spacing, 3.27 mm. The PET scanning conditions were as follows: during quiet breathing, the scan time for each bed position was 3 minutes. For the diagnostic chest CT scan, he was trained in breath holding before the examination, and the scan was conducted from his thoracic inlet to the level of his adrenal glands with inspiratory breath hold 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【16】Irregular subpleural nodules and plaques accompanied by air bronchograms involved the lower lobe of his right lung 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a , b )</u>.

Multiple irregular nodules accompanied by air bronchograms involved the subpleural regions of bilateral lungs with slightly increased radioactivity uptake and SUV <sub>max </sub> was 1.7. A soft tissue density lesion was found in the left adrenal gland with increased radioactivity uptake and SUV <sub>max </sub> was 4.1 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1﻿d , e )</u>.\n\n【17】He underwent transthoracic needle biopsy of the lesion of the lower lobe of his right lung. On histological examination, the lesion was composed predominantly of pools of mucin and we suspected colloid adenocarcinoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1f )</u>. CDX2, MUC2, CK7, and TTF-1 were positive in this case.\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】Colloid adenocarcinoma originates from columnar epithelial cells or goblet cells, and can secrete a large amount of mucus, resulting in increased mucus in the alveoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In 2004, Rossi _et al_ . summarized the imaging manifestations of 18 cases of colloid adenocarcinoma, and concluded that the most common imaging manifestation was ill-defined solid peripheral nodules (eight cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Other manifestations included consolidation accompanied by air bronchograms and ground-glass opacities (six cases and four cases, respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. A study conducted by Sawada _et al_ . also showed solid or partially solid nodules with air bronchograms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The chest CT in this case showed multiple bilateral subpleural nodules and plaques accompanied by air bronchograms, most concentrated in the lower lobe of our patient’s right lung. The potential pathological basis is that the tumor cells grew along the alveolar and bronchial walls and a one-way valve effect caused the alveoli to distend with air, resulting in air bronchograms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】The PET in this case showed that the radioactivity uptake of the lesions in our patient’s bilateral lungs and his left adrenal gland was slightly increased with SUV <sub>max </sub> of 3.5 and 4.1, respectively. We suspected colloid adenocarcinoma in the lower lobe of his right lung with intrapulmonary and left adrenal gland metastases. The radioactivity uptake of colloid adenocarcinoma was relatively lower. This may be due in part to: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> large amounts of mucus in the tumor; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> and the metabolism of slow-growing tumors is generally low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Colloid adenocarcinoma has a higher frequency of metastasis than other types of lung cancer, including intrapulmonary metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, and lymphatic metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Studies have shown that colloid adenocarcinoma tends to spread along the airway mucosa and results in intrapulmonary metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. A follow-up study conducted by Oka _et al_ . for 13 cases of colloid adenocarcinoma confirmed after surgery or biopsy indicated that primary tumors with diameters ≤3 cm had a better prognosis, while larger tumors tended to recur and develop intrapulmonary metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This case indicated that the colloid adenocarcinoma from the lower lobe of our patient’s right lung metastasized to bilateral lungs and his left adrenal gland. PET/CT combined with the diagnostic chest CT were valuable for diagnosis and staging of colloid adenocarcinoma although colloid adenocarcinoma had a relatively lower FDG uptake.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【23】Proper staging is of significant value for the evaluation of patient prognosis as well as the selection of treatment protocols.

The histopathological diagnosis was large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the submandibular gland.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】To the best of our knowledge, only eight cases of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in the salivary glands, including our case, have been reported. This report indicates total biopsy and immunohistochemistry are necessary for diagnosing large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma properly.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is defined as a variant form of large cell carcinoma, and is classified in the wide spectrum of primary neuroendocrine tumors together with small cell carcinoma (SCC) and atypical carcinoid tumor. Travis _et al_ . proposed a distinctive clinicopathological entity of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has poor prognosis like SCC. Although the lung is the most common location of this tumor, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas have been found in other organs, including the thymus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, gall bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, uterine cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, urinary bladder, and so on. In the salivary glands, neuroendocrine carcinoma is sometimes seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, but large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is extremely rare, and only seven cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 12 \\]</u>. Their biological behaviors are still unknown. Recently, we have encountered large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the submandibular gland that was diagnosed at autopsy, but was difficult to distinguish from metastatic tumor. Here we describe this rare case and present a review of the literature.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 68-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for thorough investigation of right hypochondriac pain and painless swelling on the right side of his neck. He had a past history of a transverse colon cancer operation about 18 years earlier and underwent distal gastrectomy and cholecystectomy due to duodenal ulcer 30 years earlier. He had gone to another hospital for diabetes mellitus follow up. One month earlier, he was referred to the same hospital because of right hypochondriac pain and anorexia. Plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed a low density area in his liver segment 8. At first, because of his cervical swelling, hepatic carcinoma with neck metastasis was suspected. He was admitted into an affiliated hospital for further examinations. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed, but both revealed no malignancy. Enhanced abdominal CT scanning showed no tumor in his liver and other abdominal organs. Enhanced thoracic CT scanning showed enlargement of right cervical lymph nodes 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>, but no primary tumors could be detected. <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) could not be taken because of the patient’s poor systemic condition and there was no instrument in our hospital. Subsequently, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the right cervical mass was performed, and it suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma. Metastatic carcinoma was suspected, but primary organs could not be detected. For further examinations, he was transferred to our hospital after 3 weeks. He had a poor systemic condition and showed multiple metastases of the spine. Then, disseminated intravascular coagulation gradually developed. He died of cancer 5 days after his transfer to our hospital.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】**Computed tomography showed enlargement of lymph nodes on the right side of the neck (arrow).**\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Because the primary carcinoma was unknown, autopsy was performed after his death. At autopsy, a tumor of about 5cm was found in the right submandibular gland. No other primary malignant tumor was detected, except metastasis to the bone marrow and spine. Histological examination of the submandibular tumor revealed a solid growth formed of large polygonal atypical cells. An organoid structure, and palisading, rosette growth were seen, and the tumor had focal squamous differentiation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. The tumor showed diffuse necrosis and many mitoses (about 40 cells/10 high-power field). It was difficult to distinguish poorly differentiated SCC, basal cell adenocarcinoma, mixed SCC, and basaloid SCC. Immunohistochemically, CD56 and synaptophysin were positive 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u>, whereas chromogranin A, p63, alpha smooth muscle actin, and thyroid transcription factor-1 were negative. There is no report of salivary basaloid SCC. And basal cell adenocarcinoma or mixed SCC were ruled out because of positive synaptophysin which is expressed on neuroendocrine tumors. Based on these findings, the tumor was finally diagnosed as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the submandibular gland.\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】**Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed solid growth of large polygonal atypical cells, organoid structure, palisading, and rosette growth.** **A** : 40-fold, **B** : 200-fold.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Figure 3**\n\n【20】**A: On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show positive for CD56.** **B** : The tumor cells show positive for synaptophysin.\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】Salivary gland carcinoma is a rare neoplasm accounting for 0.3% of all human cancers. The treatment for salivary gland carcinoma is mainly surgery, including primary tumor resection with or without neck lymph node dissection and adjuvant therapy. Salivary gland carcinoma is mainly diagnosed by CT or MRI and echo-guided FNAC. Recently, FDG-PET has become a useful modality for detecting salivary gland carcinoma. And FDG-PET has been reported to be superior to CT and/or MRI in detecting neck cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a poorly differentiated, high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm that has several morphological and biological features between SCC and atypical carcinoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The lung is the most common location of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The main features of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are those of neuroendocrine cancer, such as organoid nesting, palisading, rosette trabeculae, large cells with a polygonal shape, a relatively low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, frequent necrosis mimicking non-SCC, and positive neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers. To confirm the neuroendocrine features, the tumor cells were stained with antibodies to CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Recently, various immunohistochemical techniques have been performed to diagnose neuroendocrine tumors, like neural cell adhesion molecule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】This tumor is very rare, and hence there is no consensus on management guidelines. As large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is sometimes mistaken for a poorly differentiated carcinoma or SCC, immunohistochemistry is important in making the diagnosis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. For pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, surgery is the main treatment and can be complemented with postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The prognosis of pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is poor. The prognosis of salivary gland large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma seems to be poor, too. Early diagnosis and early treatment are desirable for improvement of the outcomes. More studies are needed to better define the therapeutic alternatives and prognostic factors of salivary gland large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\n【26】Our review of the medical literature in PubMed between 1975 and 2011 revealed seven cases of salivary gland large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 12 \\]</u>. The details of all eight reported cases, including our present case, are shown in Table 1 . There were five men and two women, and their mean age was 75 years (ranging from 68 to 88 years). The most commonly presenting symptom was painless swelling of the neck. The location of the tumors was: five in the parotid and two in the submandibular and none in the sublingual gland. Moreover, five were on the right side and two were on the left side. FNAC was performed in five cases. The pathological findings of FNAC were undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma. The size varied greatly from 2cm to 9cm. Synaptophysin was positive in six cases, and chromogranin A was positive in three cases. Five cases underwent surgery and radiation therapy postoperatively. One case underwent a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The outcome varied; three cases died after surgery (5 months, 8 months, and 4 years), whereas three cases had a good outcome with improvement of tumor and free from tumor recurrence after treatment (8 months, 27 months, and 3 years). In our case, the patient died of cancer, and the autopsy revealed large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the submandibular gland.\n\n【27】**Table 1 **Previously reported cases of salivary gland large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma****\n\n【28】Full size table\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】In this report we presented a rare case of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the submandibular gland. Diagnosis based on FNAC findings was difficult because of the small samples of tissue. If a patient presents with enlargement of the neck, then total biopsy or operation and immunohistochemistry are needed to diagnose salivary gland tumor. Since salivary gland large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is rare and has a poor prognosis, similar to the pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, early diagnosis is necessary to improve the prognosis of this disease.\n\n【31】Consent\n-------\n\n【32】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

On the 15th hospital day, the patient underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement and was then treated with antibiotics for more than 1 month. On the 57th hospital day, the patient was discharged. His urinary abnormalities and renal function were gradually recovering. Four months after being discharged, his proteinase-3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels had returned to the normal range.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】The findings in this study update and expand current understanding of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity in patients with both infective endocarditis and hepatitis B virus.

Renal biopsy is suggested if the patient’s condition allows. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing should be repeated after therapy, because some cases might require more aggressive treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) comprise a family of autoantibodies that react with proteins predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Indirect immunofluorescence assays can distinguish ANCAs with cytoplasmic (c-ANCA) or perinuclear (p-ANCA) staining patterns; autoantibodies with specificity for myeloperoxidase, referred to as “MPO-ANCA,” and those against proteinase-3, referred to as “PR3-ANCA,” can be further characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The c-ANCA pattern is, in most cases, caused by antibodies to PR3, and MPO can be responsible for the p-ANCA pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The presence of these autoantibodies is an important diagnostic marker for small-vessel vasculitic syndromes (i.e. granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis, and polyangiitis), which are commonly referred to as “antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis” (AAV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. However, ANCA positivity can be seen in a variety of infectious diseases and in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including infective endocarditis (IE), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV, respectively) infection, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Because AAV and infectious diseases may present similarly, ANCA positivity must be carefully interpreted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Moreover, patients with either IE or HBV can present with ANCA positivity, leading to more difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. This case report describes a 46-year-old man with chronically untreated HBV infection who was admitted to our hospital with IE and was found to be c-ANCA-positive. We also summarize the literature of previously published cohort cases concerning ANCA induction in IE and HBV infection.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】In July 2017, a 46-year-old man of Han Chinese ethnicity was referred from a local community hospital with complaints of fever of 2 weeks’ duration, along with hematuria, proteinuria, and rapidly deteriorating renal function. He was being treated with intravenous antibiotics and expectant treatment for his kidneys without any improvement. The patient had a 5-year history of hypertension without treatment (peak blood pressure 145/110 mmHg). In February 2017, he was diagnosed with pancreatitis, and he recovered after treatment. He denied any history of diabetes, alcohol intake, intravenous drug abuse, and smoking. He had no history of familial disease and no known environmental exposure. He was a farmer, was married, and had a daughter. He had not undergone any examination for infectious diseases, including HBV, HCV, or HIV.\n\n【12】On admission to our hospital, his mental status was normal. His body temperature was 36.9 °C, pulse rate was 92 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 116/78 mmHg. His physical examination revealed a systolic murmur (Levine classification 3/6) in the apex area and a diastolic murmur (Levine classification 2/6) in the aortic area. The result of his neurological examination was normal. A series of laboratory tests was performed after admission.\n\n【13】On the day of admission, laboratory results indicated 1+ proteinuria (1.28 g/24 h), 3+ urine occult blood with 2959.9 red blood cells per high-power field, a white blood cell count of 6.22 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin of 81 g/L, albumin level of 32.3 g/L, globulin level of 48.7 g/L, serum creatinine level of 196 μmol/L, and blood urea nitrogen level of 7.7 mmol/L. His hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B core antibodies were positive. His DNA level of HBV was 1.38 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> IU/ml. The findings for rheumatoid factor, HCV antibody, and HIV were negative. The level of MPO-ANCA was normal, whereas that of PR3-ANCA was 170.4 relative units/ml (normal range, < 20). Blood cultures were obtained three times, and examination revealed the presence of _Abiotrophia defectiva_ . Ultrasound cardiac examination revealed aortic and mitral valve vegetation (13 × 10 mm, 11 × 6 mm). Moderate regurgitation and turbulence could be seen in the diastole of the aortic valve orifice and the systole of the left atrial side of the mitral valve orifice 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a–c)</u>.

However, it was difficult to determinate whether HBV or more acute IE was the main cause of this patient’s ANCA positivity. Due to the patient’s rapidly deteriorating renal function, he was supposed to undergo kidney biopsy to clarify the type of glomerulonephritis (GN), but the results of echocardiography stopped us from performing a biopsy. The patient’s echocardiogram revealed mitral and aortic valve vegetation (11 × 6 mm, 13 × 10 mm) and regurgitation. Doctors in the cardiothoracic surgery department suggested valve replacement surgery be considered to avoid systemic bacterial emboli. Severe regurgitation and heart failure due to valvular destruction was another consideration. Because of these complex conditions, the patient’s diagnosis was a challenge.\n\n【21】When the patient was admitted to our hospital, he had a fever the first night. He was treated with antibiotics because blood culture results indicated _A. defectiva_ infection. The patient’s temperature decreased gradually 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Meanwhile, he was given other medications, including niferex (150 mg once daily by mouth), folic acid (5 mg three times daily by mouth), and medicinal charcoal tablets (1.2 g three times daily by mouth). On the 15th hospital day, the patient underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement and was then treated with warfarin (2.5 mg once daily by mouth) and antibiotics for more than 1 month 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. On the 57th hospital day, the patient was discharged. His urinary abnormalities and renal function were gradually recovering. Four months after being discharged, his PR3-ANCA levels had returned to the normal range.

It was easy to imagine the diagnosis of vasculitis. However, the patient had both untreated chronic HBV infection and IE, and ANCA positivity could be present in both diseases. Because more than one factor was affecting the ANCA positivity in this patient, it was necessary to identify the main factor to determine the appropriate treatment.\n\n【33】ANCA is a biomarker for certain forms of small-vessel vasculitis, but specificity is limited, especially when detected with indirect immunofluorescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Apart from vasculitis, ANCA with different specificities occurs in a wide range of conditions requiring very different actions, such as IE, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, HBV or HCV infection, and HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Diagnosis may be hampered by nonspecific symptoms and can be made more difficult by association with autoantibodies. Therefore, a careful diagnostic workup is warranted.\n\n【34】IE, a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, is classified as “acute” or “subacute chronic” on the basis of the tempo and severity of the clinical presentation and the progression of the untreated disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The incidence of IE in the general population ranges from approximately 2 to 7.9 per 100,000 individuals per year and has a short-term mortality rate of 10% to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Bacterial colonization of the cardiac valves may lead to local meltdown with abrupt-onset cardiac failure as well as systemic spread of infectious particles covered with antibodies and complement. The latter may stimulate multiple immunological abnormalities and develop into a subacute inflammatory condition mimicking systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 10 \\]</u>. The treatment is urgent administration of combinations of antibiotics; sometimes surgery is necessary to restore the integrity of the valves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, the development of ANCA-mediated disease during the course of IE raises the difficulty of determining the specific treatment. Treatment with immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of septic death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Also, treatment of the endocarditis with appropriate antibiotics usually leads to abolition of the immunological abnormalities and their clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Controversy has been generated regarding appropriate treatment in ANCA-positive patients with IE. Our case report describes a cure of an ANCA-positive patient with IE who had appropriate antibiotic treatment and valve replacement surgery. The patient started with fever, hematuria, and proteinuria, and then his renal function gradually deteriorated. Examination of antibodies showed c-ANCA and PR3-ANCA. It has been reported that kidney disease is a common manifestation of IE, involving nearly 40% to 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Endocarditis-associated GN can show significant variability in histopathologic appearance, including pauci-immune GN, postinfective GN, or subendothelial membranoproliferative GN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Because of this variability, a patient’s renal disease could be misdiagnosed as vasculitis rather than IE-mediated GN, and the differentiation can be very challenging. For this reason, the patient was supposed to undergo kidney biopsy, but the results of echocardiography stopped us from performing it. The patient’s echocardiogram revealed mitral and aortic valve vegetation (11 × 6 mm, 13 × 10 mm) and regurgitation. Blood culture results indicated _A. defectiva_ infection. Doctors from the cardiothoracic surgery department suggested that valve replacement surgery as soon as possible should be considered to avoid systemic bacterial emboli due to the size of the vegetation and fast aortic blood flow as well as severe regurgitation and heart failure due to valve destruction. Therefore, surgery was performed, and two artificial valves were used. We were unable to perform a kidney biopsy, because anticoagulation drugs were used after the valve replacement. So, the type of GN was not clear in this case. However, by 6 months after surgery and with appropriate antibiotic treatment, the urinary abnormalities had improved, and the patient’s PR3-ANCA level was normal. Therefore, it was not necessary to provide treatment with long-term immunosuppression.\n\n【35】Another ANCA-associated infection present in our patient was HBV infection. Because ANCA induction is more common in chronic infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>, it was difficult to determinate whether HBV or more acute IE was the main cause of this patient’s ANCA positivity. Moreover, it is important to determine whether HBV stimulates ANCA formation without triggering vasculitis or other immune-related manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Vasculitis is one type of extrahepatic manifestation of HBV infection, and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is the most common vasculitis associated with acute or chronic HBV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. The frequency of HBV-associated PAN has been reported to range from 17.4% to 48.8% and has come down over the years because of screening of blood products before transfusion and increasing vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 , 20 \\]</u>. HBV-related PAN is an acute disease, and patients often present with gastrointestinal tract involvement, vascular nephropathy, malignant hypertension, and orchitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 21 \\]</u>. Our patient had no clinical manifestations other than renal damage. HBV is considered to contribute to vasculitis development through at least two mechanisms: viral replication induces direct damage to the blood vessel wall leading to viral arteritis, and vascular damage could be associated with immune-complex reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 22 \\]</u>. The DNA level of HBV in our patient was 1.38 × 10 <sup>4 </sup> IU/ml; his liver function was normal; and he had no evidence of liver cirrhosis. Therefore, antiviral therapy was not recommended according to the guideline of prevention and treatment for chronic HBV suggested by the Chinese Society of Hepatology, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Society of Infectious Diseases, and the Chinese Medical Association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u>. The patient’s condition was relieved, and his level of PR3-ANCA returned to normal by means of surgery and anti-infective treatment, which further proved that the ANCA positivity was associated with IE rather than HBV.\n\n【36】To date, over 70 ANCA-positive patients with IE have been reported, the majority of which were described in single-case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. In order to further investigate the prevalence and characteristics of ANCA in patients with IE and patients with HBV, we performed a literature search of previously published cohort cases via PubMed and Medline using the keywords “infective endocarditis,” “IE,” “ANCA,” “antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies,” “hepatitis B,” and “HBV.” We list the results of our literature search in Table 1 , describing the clinical features of IE and HBV in cases with ANCA positivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 \\]</u>. The results showed that the prevalence of ANCA positivity was higher in patients with IE than in patients with HBV (26.64% vs. 18.83%; _P_ \\= 0.04). The types of ANCA were also different between the two diseases. The study highlighted that patients with IE more often developed c-ANCA, whereas those with HBV had both c-ANCA and p-ANCA, with the proportion of p-ANCA being more common in patients with HBV. The implication of the presence of c-ANCA in IE remains unclear. However, the infectious process may induce the production of c-ANCA, possibly polyclonal B-cell activation stimulated by bacterial unmethlylated oligodeoxynucleotides via Toll-like receptor 9 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. Jennette _et al._ reported that the release of neutrophil extracellular traps was involved in initiating the ANCA-associated autoimmune response, which was associated with a high titer of c-ANCA with anti-PR3 specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 \\]</u>. Compared with IE, the pathogenesis of ANCA positivity in patients with HBV is thought to be a little different. It has been suggested that persistent antigen load secondary to chronic infection and a high viral replication rate lead to excessive formation of immunocomplexes containing cellular and/or humoral immunity, and these circulating immunocomplexes, deposited in intermediate- and small-sized vessels, initiate vasculitic processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 32 \\]</u>. Vasculitic lesion development in HBV is believed to be associated with the HBeAg antigen or viral replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 33 \\]</u>. The majority of patients with IE and HBV were males; however, it was unclear whether a sex predilection for ANCA positivity exists in the two diseases. Previous case reports have described that more ANCA-positive patients with IE were found to be males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. IE occurs in 30% to 60% of patients with _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia and carries a mortality rate of 40–50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 34 \\]</u>. HBV is a chronic disease, and the mortality rate increases only when liver failure occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 35 \\]</u>. The results showed that there was no direct relation between the deaths of the patients with IE and ANCA positivity (including 10 ANCA-positive and 27 ANCA-negative, 10/73 vs. 27/201; _P_ \\= 0.96). Four patients with HBV-related PAN died of other causes after clinical recovery, including pancreatitis, cerebral bleeding, and sudden death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】**Table 1 Characteristics and outcomes in patients with infective endocarditis and patients with hepatitis B virus with and without antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies among all previously reported cohort studies**\n\n【38】Full size table\n\n【39】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【40】The findings in this study update and expand current understanding of ANCA positivity in patients with IE and HBV. Although PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are serological markers for AAV, the interpretation of PR3-ANCA and/or MPO-ANCA positivity should consider the possibility of protracted infection. Identification of the causative pathogen is very important for successful treatment of IE. However, blood cultures can sometimes be negative because of preceding antibiotic treatment or pathogens difficult to detect with common culture methods. In addition, HBV-related vasculitis should be considered, especially HBV-related PAN, in a patient complicated with HBV infection. There are a variety of treatments, including surgery, antibiotics, corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, antiviral agents, and even plasma exchange. As a result, how to choose the appropriate treatment will be challenging when several diseases present together, because if a patient with IE is administered a high dose of corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, the consequences can be devastating. Therefore, renal biopsy is suggested if the patient’s condition allows. ANCA testing should be repeated after specific effective therapy, because some cases might require more aggressive treatment.\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AAV:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ANCA:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>c-ANCA:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ELISA:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GN:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Glomerulonephritis</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HBeAg:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatitis B e-antigen</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HBV:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatitis B virus</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HCV:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatitis C virus</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HIV:</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Human immunodeficiency virus</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IE:</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Infective endocarditis</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IIF:</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Indirect immunofluorescence</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MPO:</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Myeloperoxidase</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PAN:</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Polyarteritis nodosa</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>p-ANCA:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SLE:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Systemic lupus erythematosus</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

It is endemic to the tropics and subtropics. Sri Lanka has a 0–1.6% prevalence rate. _S_ . _stercoralis_ infection was identified in a 33-year-old Sri Lankan male patient treated with corticosteroids for borderline lepromatous leprosy with adrenocortical dysfunction.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In March 2020, a 33-year-old Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) male patient presented with watery diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and post-prandial abdominal fullness. Previously, he was diagnosed with borderline lepromatous leprosy and was treated with rifampicin, clofazimine, and prednisolone 60 mg daily since July 2019. After developing gastrointestinal symptoms, he had defaulted leprosy treatment including the prednisolone for 3 months. Duodenal biopsy revealed numerous intraepithelial nematodes within the lumina of glands in the duodenum whose appearance favored _Strongyloides_ . Fecal wet smear revealed numerous _Strongyloidis stercoralis_ L1 rhabditiform larvae. Larval tracks were seen in the agar plate culture. L3 filariform larvae of _Strongyloidis stercoralis_ were seen in the Harada–Mori culture.\n\n【5】In addition, the short synacthen test revealed adrenocortical insufficiency, and oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were started with albendazole treatment against strongyloidiasis. Fecal wet smear and culture repeated after treatment with albendazole were negative for _Strongyloidis stercoralis_ . The patient was discharged in July 2020 on oral hydrocortisone. One month later his condition was reviewed and the repeated fecal wet smear and agar plate culture was normal. He is being followed up every 3 months.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】This is the first case of strongyloidiasis diagnosed in a patient with borderline lepromatous leprosy from Sri Lanka. The patient manifested symptoms of strongyloidiasis while on high-dose steroid therapy for his lepromatous reaction. Subsequently, the patient not only discontinued his steroid therapy, but also developed adrenocortical insufficiency as a complication of leprosy. Therefore, although diagnosis of strongyloidiasis was delayed, his subsequent low steroid levels probably protected him from disseminated disease. This is an interesting case where symptomatic strongyloidiasis was diagnosed in a patient who was initially treated with high-dose steroids but subsequently developed adrenocortical insufficiency. We emphasize the need to screen all patients prior to the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【8】Peer Review reports\n\n【9】Introduction\n------------\n\n【10】Strongyloidiasis is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis mainly caused by _Strongyloidis stercoralis_ and, on rare occasions, by _Strongyloides fuelleborni fuelleborni_ and _Strongyloidis fuelleborni kelleyi_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

He later developed severe adrenocorticoid insufficiency, which necessitated placing him on lifelong steroids.  This is an interesting case where strongyloidiasis was diagnosed in a patient who was previously on high dose steroids but then developed adrenocorticoid insufficiency and therefore had a low steroid level. To our knowledge this is also the first case report of strongyloidiasis in a patient with leprosy in Sri Lanka.Together with a literature review, this case reports _S_ . _stercoralis_ infection that was identified in a 33-year-old male patient who was on corticosteroids while being given anti-leprosy drugs.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】In March 2020, a 33-year-old Sri Lankan (Sinhalese) male patient presented with watery diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and post-prandial abdominal fullness to a rural hospital in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka. He was a member of the Civil Defense Force. Although the patient was transferred to a District General Hospital from the rural hospital, they were unable to diagnose the cause of his severe gastrointestinal symptoms. After 3 months he was transferred to a tertiary hospital in the Central Province, which was 170 km away. The patient had 3–4 episodes of loose stools per day, mainly of food particles without any blood or mucus. Previously, he was diagnosed with borderline lepromatous leprosy and was treated since July 2019 with rifampicin, clofazimine, and 60 mg prednisolone daily. While he was on those drugs, he developed severe gastrointestinal symptoms and therefore defaulted leprosy treatment for 3 months.\n\n【14】The patient had severe loss of appetite and lost 15 kg of body weight during these 3 months. He did not have vomiting or nausea but had lower abdominal pain with post-prandial abdominal fullness. He denied cough, fever, shortness of breath, night sweats, urinary symptoms, dysuria, and joint pains. On examination, the patient was cachectic and pale. His body weight was 32 kg and he had no skin rashes. There was mild left iliac fossa tenderness with no hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【15】His white blood cell count was high (14.54 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL) with neutrophil predominance (10.2 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). The eosinophil count was normal. Hemoglobin level was marginally low (10.20/ µL) and the platelet counts were normal (436 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /µL). C-reactive protein was normal (2.8 mg/L), sodium (Na <sup>+ </sup> ) level was low (119 mmol/L), and potassium (K <sup>+ </sup> ) was in the lower margin of the normal range (4.20 mmol/L). Urinary Na <sup>+ </sup> (47 mEq/L) and urinary K <sup>+ </sup> (23.5 mEq/L) were high. His serum creatinine was normal (50.4 µmol/L). Total protein was low (38.4 g/L) with a very low albumin level (17.5 g/L). Aspartate aminotransferase test (AST), alanine aminotransferase test (ALT), and international normalized ratio (INR) were normal. The blood picture was compatible with anemia of chronic disease.\n\n【16】His Mantoux test was negative, and Hepatitis B and C, as well as human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) tests were also negative. His CD4, CD8, and CD19 cell counts were normal. The short Synacthen test was positive (9.00 am—24 nmol/L; 9.30 am—12 nmol/L) and adrenocortical insufficiency was diagnosed. A short Synacthen test is used for diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency on the basis of the measurement of serum cortisol before and after injection of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A cortisol level of more than 420 nmol/L at 30 min post-Synacthen indicates an adequate adrenal response. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen was normal except for bilateral small adrenal glands, which did not show any calcifications.\n\n【17】The patient was started on oral steroids (oral hydrocortisone 35 mg daily and fludrocortisone 100 µg daily) in June 2020. Complement factors C3 was normal (71 mg/dL), C4 was marginally low (19 mg/dL), immunoglobulin G (IgG) was normal (966 mg/dL), immunoglobulin M (IgM) was low (39 mg/dL), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) was normal (209 mg/dL).\n\n【18】Owing to persisting diarrhea, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE), duodenal biopsy, colonoscopy, and biopsy were performed. A severely inflamed oedematous duodenum was noted. The ileum was not inflamed and the gross appearance was normal. Duodenal (D2) biopsy revealed numerous intraepithelial nematodes within the lumina of glands in the duodenum, and the appearance was that of parasitic infestation favoring _Strongyloides_ spp. 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Biopsies taken from the ileum, caecum, and the rest of the colon were normal. Fecal wet smear revealed numerous _S. stercoralis_ L1 rhabditiform larvae 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. Coproculture using the Harada–Mori technique yielded L3 filariform larvae, which confirmed the species identification by its long esophagus and the tail with a notched tip 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. Larval tracks were seen in the agar plate culture of feces. The patient was diagnosed with strongyloidiasis and was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice a day for 7 days according to the CDC, USA treatment guidelines.\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】Intraepithelial nematodes are indicated with arrowheads observed in the duodenal (D2) biopsy within the lumina of glands in the duodenum.

Oral hydrocortisone (daily dose 35 mg) and fludrocortisone 100 µg daily were continued. Fecal wet smear and agar plate culture repeated after treatment with albendazole were negative for _S. stercoralis_ . The patient was discharged on 20 July 2020 on oral hydrocortisone (daily dose 25 mg). One month later, in August 2020, his condition was reviewed. The repeated fecal wet smear and culture did not reveal _S.stercoralis_ larvae. Fecal smears and agar plate cultures carried out on the patient’s wife and child were also normal. Patient continues to be followed up every 3–6 months as he is on lifelong steroid therapy. He was also advised to use footwear.\n\n【27】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【28】_Strongyloides stercoralis_ is a unique intestinal helminth species with a self-perpetuating life cycle. This is responsible for its potential lifelong infection and capacity to kill its human host. It is estimated that 30–100 million people are infected worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Potentially life-threatening disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients results in mortality rates of up to 85% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Strongyloidiasis is usually asymptomatic and often only indicated by a raised eosinophil count. However, it can present with dermatological or gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Steroids administered to treat underlying conditions represent the main trigger predisposing to _Strongyloides_ hyperinfection syndrome (SHS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. SHS represents the increased number of larvae within the traditional reproductive route (skin, GI tract, lungs), while disseminated strongyloidiasis involves widespread dissemination of larvae outside the GI tract and lungs (liver, heart, brain, urinary tract) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Increased number of larvae in stool and sputum is the hallmark of SHS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The gastrointestinal manifestations include severe abdominal cramping, pain, watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, occasionally gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel obstruction, and pulmonary manifestations with cough, wheezing, pulmonary hemorrhage, pleural effusion, and acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Bacteria carried with the larvae into the bloodstream can lead to gram-negative sepsis which may be fatal, especially in immunosuppressed patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】This patient is on 25 mg hydrocortisone daily. A high dose of steroids is defined as more than 15–20 mg for longer than 2–4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. However, dose, duration, or route of administration of drugs is not related to SHS, as even a short course of steroids (6–17 days) in immunocompetent patients can be associated with fatal SHS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Previous cases reporting _Strongyloides_ infection in patients with leprosy undergoing steroid treatment have been identified from Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Patients with leprosy and _S. stecoralis_ infection have developed SHS due to steroids being administered to patients with leprosy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 \\]</u>. The patient that we report in this case discontinued his leprosy treatment, including prednisolone, owing to his severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Thereafter, he developed adrenocortical insufficiency. The resulting low cortisol levels probably protected him from developing SHS. Thus, suffering a complication of leprosy protected this patient from complications due to infection with _S. stercoralis_ . Subclinical adrenocortical insufficiency has been reported in patients with leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. This patient, however, developed severe adrenocortical insufficiency with reduced volume of bilateral adrenal glands, which necessitated long-term steroid therapy.\n\n【32】_Strongyloides stercoralis_ can cause chronic eosinophilia in humans owing to auto-infection within the human host 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Although this patient had increased neutrophils, his eosinophil count was normal. Corticosteroids can reduce the levels of circulating eosinophils by inhibiting their proliferation and increasing apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Fecal examination for _Strongyloides_ larvae and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibodies, as well as eosinophilia in peripheral blood, are recommended to screen kidney donors and recipients. Since _S. stercoralis_ can be dormant in an infected person and can cause SHS when the patient becomes immunocompromised, patients with strongyloidiasis should be treated before transplantation and commencement of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. Therefore it is important to continue investigating for strongyloidiasis in this patient, as he is on lifelong treatment for adrenocortical insufficiency and longstanding chronic infection is well recorded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 , 24 , 25 \\]</u>.\n\n【34】Strongyloidiasis is mainly diagnosed by the detection of larvae found in feces.

These techniques are used to specifically differentiate _S. stercoralis_ infection from other intestinal nematode infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 27 , 28 \\]</u>.

Fecal examination for _S. stercoralis_ was done only after the duodenal (D2) biopsy showed intraepithelial nematodes within the lumina of glands in the duodenum 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【35】This patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg twice a day for 7 days while continuing his steroid therapy. Several drugs have been recommended for the treatment of strongyloidiasis, such as albendazole, mebendazole, thiabendazole, and ivermectin. Ivermectin is more effective for SHS, primarily when associated with predisposing conditions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 \\]</u>. A previous case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> in Sri Lanka highlighted the importance of careful follow-up of cases after treatment. The patient in this case was reviewed after 1 month and the repeated fecal wet smear and culture were normal. We plan to continue to follow-up with him every 3 months, as he will be on lifelong steroid therapy owing to adrenocortical insufficiency.\n\n【36】This is the first case of strongyloidiasis diagnosed in a patient with borderline lepromatous leprosy from Sri Lanka. Strongyloidiasis was not considered in the differential diagnosis until the duodenal biopsy showed nematode larvae. If there is greater awareness of strongyloidiasis among clinicians, the patient could have been treated in the rural hospital where he was initially admitted. As it is, he had to suffer for 3 months until he was finally transferred to a hospital 170 km away.\n\n【37】This case also highlights an interesting situation where, in spite of the delay in diagnosis of strongyloidiasis, the patient was protected from disseminated disease owing to developing adrenocorticoid insufficiency as a complication of leprosy.\n\n【38】Although Sri Lanka is an endemic country for strongyloidiasis, the recorded prevalence is very low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA guidelines state that physicians should screen for strongyloidiasis prior to starting corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 30 \\]</u>. This case emphasizes the need for such screening.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The low prevalence rate of strongyloidaisis reported in Sri Lanka is due to poor diagnosis.

Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. Filamin A, encoded by the _FLNA_ gene, is a widely expressed protein that regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes, and second messengers, thus mutations in the gene encoding filamin A ( _FLNA_ ) lead to diseases with high phenotypic diversity including the following: periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), skeletal dysplasia, otopalatodigital spectrum disorders such as Melnick-Needles syndrome and frontometaphyseal dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>, cardiovascular abnormalities that include patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), valvular disease, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-like phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 – 8 \\]</u>, and coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Recently, Masurel-Paulet _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, de Wit and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>, and Lord _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> reported associations between pulmonary diseases in both sexes with substantial heterogeneity in manifestations and lethality. Here, we report the case of a female child with a novel _FLNA_ gene mutation who developed significant lung disease and unique angiogenesis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient is a 1-year-old Saudi female child who was referred from another hospital after PDA ligation, left inguinal hernia repair, accidental fracture of her right ulna and radius, and prolonged mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient was sent to our hospital for further evaluation due to ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxemia. Our patient was the third child of nonconsanguineous Saudi parents and was born via cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation due to fetal distress. The child was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for 5 days because of respiratory distress and was ventilated for 36 hours. The mother has epilepsy and the father has been diagnosed with Behcet's disease. Since the age of 2 months, the child had multiple lengthy admissions in different hospitals (for 1 to 3 months at a time) for recurrent cyanotic events, respiratory distress, frequent choking with feeding, and significant vomiting. The child had accumulated the following diagnoses: severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), failure to thrive requiring prolonged nasogastric tube feeding, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, anoxic convulsions, chronic lung disease with prolonged oxygen dependency, reversible bronchospasm, left external iliac vein thrombosis, and developmental delay. She had two prior prolonged stays at our institution.\n\n【12】The first admission was due to rhinovirus infection and clinically diagnosed recurrent aspiration secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery (dysphagia lusoria) with prolonged oxygen therapy. The second admission was for respiratory failure that required prolonged intubation including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation complicated by recurrent lung atelectasis and right lung pneumothorax. She failed multiple trials of extubation and unfortunately died of cardiac arrest due to sepsis while receiving maximal supportive therapy. An initial physical examination during the first admission revealed a baby girl in poor health with the following clinical values: moderate respiratory distress and a respiratory rate of 70/min, heart rate of 144/min, blood pressure of 101/47 with saturation of 95% on 1.5 L/min, body weight of 5.9 kg (below the third percentile), and height of 69 cm (at the tenth percentile).The child had diminished breath sounds bilaterally with a prolonged expiratory phase, wheezing, and scattered crackles posteriorly, mild hypotonia, and significant hyperlaxity. Investigations showed normal sweat chloride level, and immune function testing was normal. A chest X-ray 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> showed multiple subsegmental atelectasis and areas of air trapping. Computed tomography and angiography of her chest 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u> revealed bilateral lower lobe airspace disease, hyperinflation of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe including the lingual, and an enlarged main pulmonary artery. The sagittal view 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u> showed a right aberrant subclavian artery causing posterior compression to the esophagus at the level of the T4 vertebra and minimal compression in the posterior trachea. An echocardiogram showed no residual PDA or significant evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Barium administration 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u> showed external compression along the posterior wall of the proximal third of the esophagus, which was causing significant narrowing of the esophageal lumen. The pH probe showed no significant GERD. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed there was a narrowed and compressed area located 18 cm into the esophagus at T4, and was identified with marked pulsation. The flexible bronchoscopy showed complete ring and narrowing of the lower third of the trachea. A lung biopsy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u> showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification, in which alveoli do not show age-appropriate normal architecture, compared with the normal alveolar architecture 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6 )</u>. There was no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain because our patient's condition did not allow it.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Chest X-ray anteroposterior view shows multiple subsegmental atelectasis, areas of air trapping and osteopenia\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Computed tomography angiography axial view below bifurcation of carina shows basal lung atelectasis, lung hyperinflation, and enlarged main pulmonary artery\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 3**\n\n【20】Computed tomography angiography sagittal view shows right aberrant subclavian artery posterior compression to the esophagus at level of T4 vertebra and minimal compression in the posterior trachea\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 4**\n\n【23】Barium meal shows external compression noted along posterior wall of proximal third of the thoracic esophagus causing significant narrowing of esophageal lumen\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】**Fig. 5**\n\n【26】Alveolated lung parenchyma (black arrows) with alveolar simplification. _Small yellow arrow_ : from the microscope that is probably not relevant\n\n【27】Full size image\n\n【28】**Fig. 6**\n\n【29】Normal alveolar septation\n\n【30】Full size image\n\n【31】### Gene analysis\n\n【32】Molecular testing for _FLNA_ \\-related disorders in our patient showed a new pathogenic variant of one copy of c.3153dupC in exon 21 in the _FLNA_ gene. This variant has not been reported in individuals with _FLNA_ \\-related disorders but is expected to cause disease.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】In this case report, we describe another confirmatory mutation in the gene encoding filamin A ( _FLNA_ ) in a female child with lung disease. Our patient was a female child who was confirmed to have a pathogenic variant of the _FLNA_ gene c.3153dupC. This mutation has not been reported in individuals with _FLNA_ \\-related disorders but is expected to cause disease. Similar to other reported cases, our child also manifested clinical symptoms at an early age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. She had respiratory distress at birth and then had recurrent lower respiratory tract infections/bronchiolitis, bilateral lung emphysema with basal atelectasis, bronchospasm, pulmonary artery hypertension, and long oxygen and mechanical ventilatory dependency after 2 months of age. A lung biopsy showed alveolated lung parenchyma with alveolar simplification similar to the finding by Lord _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This child also manifested associated clinical features reported with other filamin gene mutations including patent ductus arteriosis (PDA), hypotonia, joint laxity, and developmental delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. These clinical and histological features are similar to cases reported with the pulmonary phenotype of _FLNA_ 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. However, an unusual clinical manifestation in our case is severe reflux that caused recurrent aspiration symptoms and dysphagia lusoria (secondary to aberrant right subclavian artery that caused significant esophageal compression). This abnormal angiogenesis has been reported only in _FLNA_ \\-null mice, which have vascular endothelial cells that show defective cell–cell contacts and adherens junctions. The result is abnormal angiogenesis with disorganized blood vessels and aberrant branching 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 12 \\]</u>. There are other possible pulmonary phenotypes of _FLNA_ gene mutation suggested due to its role in T cell activation, interleukin production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, inflammatory signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, and interaction with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. There has been no specific sensitivity to infections observed in _FLNA_ patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, our patient was noted to have severe prolonged courses of viral or bacterial infections. The pathogenic variant of _FLNA_ gene mutation in our reported case is not confirmed to have association with periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH), and our patient was too ill to complete brain MRI. The patient’s mother has epilepsy beginning in the third decade of life. The patient’s father has Behcet’s disease, which is highly consistent with other reports of PNH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】**Table 1 Features of reported cases of filamin A mutation**\n\n【36】Full size table\n\n【37】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【38】In conclusion, we support the three previous reports in the literature, stating that there is an association between _FLNA_ gene mutation and lung disease. The lung disease is a lethal condition likely manifested by early onset of pneumonia and recurrent bronchiolitis, subsequent asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and long-term oxygen dependency with underlying lung emphysema or lung cysts. _FLNA_ mutation is also associated with airway anomalies such as tracheal stenosis (as in our patient) or tracheobronchomalacia. In addition, there are other diverse associated clinical manifestations.\n\n【39】Consent\n-------\n\n【40】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

The patient underwent radiological examinations, and thoracic scoliosis of 70° was diagnosed. A right thoracotomy for anterior spinal fusion from the sixth rib and posterior spinal fusion were performed successfully. Two months later, he was readmitted because of winging of the right scapula due to serratus anterior palsy. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity confirmed long thoracic nerve injury. Conservative treatment was provided. Ultimately, the patient recovered completely in the last follow-up visit 6 months after the surgery.\n\n【5】### Discussion\n\n【6】This is the first report of ipsilateral winged scapula after thoracotomy.

Scoliosis occurs in approximately 50–70% of patients with MFS and differs from idiopathic adolescent scoliosis with regard to curve pattern, progression, and symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Overall, cases with curves greater than 40–50° require surgical intervention that may be associated with surgical complications such as scapular winging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Scapular winging is a painful and progressive disease. Weakness of scapular mechanics can cause problems with elevating the arm and lifting objects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is the result of numerous causes, most often resulting in nerve injury and paralysis of either the serratus anterior from long thoracic nerve injury causing medial winging or trapezius dysfunction from spinal accessory nerve injury causing lateral winging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. The incidence of long thoracic nerve injury was reported to be between 0.0026% and 0.21% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. We report a rare case of Marfan syndrome with scapular winging complication after thoracotomy for right thoracic scoliosis. The clinical summary, imaging findings, and surgical procedures are discussed\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An 18-year-old Persian man (60 kg, 180 cm) with a case of Marfan syndrome (MFS) identified from family history and genetic assessment was referred to our center. He presented mainly with right thoracic scoliosis of 70° and excessive joint laxity, without any previous disease history 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Scoliosis of 70° and the deteriorating condition of our patient led to the decision to perform surgery. In April 2016, a right thoracotomy for anterior spinal fusion (ASF) was performed from the sixth rib under general anesthesia in the left lateral decubitus position. After 3 days, posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation (PSF) was done successfully. He was discharged with a total contact body brace. On the 2 months postoperative visit, he complained of weakness of the right upper limb during overhead activities. On physical examination, the right upper limb was intact for both sensory and motor innervation, but the right scapula was winged and he was not able to flex his arm forward over 60° 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) confirmed long thoracic nerve injury. A conservative treatment, physiotherapy, was provided for 3 months. Ultimately, the patient recovered completely in the last follow-up visit 6 months after the surgery. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity revealed a return to normal position. However, scapula is more prominent than normal due to the hyperlaxity of MFS 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Initial radiograph.

Winging of the right scapula in the last follow-up visit 6 months after surgery\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】This is the first case in the literature with the unusual complication of scapular winging following thoracotomy in MFS. Scoliosis is the most common major skeletal deformity encountered in MFS patients that requires intervention. Bracing can be considered in patients with mild scoliosis. However, most patients with MFS will have significant curve development and progression that ultimately warrants surgical intervention. Overall, cases with curves greater than 40–50° or with associated abnormal sagittal curvature deformities require surgical intervention. Scoliosis in patients with MFS can be corrected similarly to the way it is corrected in idiopathic scoliosis. These patients often require anterior fusion and posterior instrumentation and fusion, which was confirmed in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The serratus anterior is a broad muscle that originates in the first to ninth ribs. The serratus anterior muscle function is to stabilize the scapula against the chest wall while elevating the arm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. The serratus anterior and trapezius muscles rotate the scapula concurrently so that the arm can be raised to the vertical position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Several reasons for long thoracic nerve damage have been reported in literature, such as closed trauma, stretching, compression, traction, penetrating injury, direct extrinsic force, inappropriate surgical technique, electrocution, chiropractic manipulation, and various sports-related injuries. Also, scapular winging can result from repetitive or sudden external biomechanical forces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 \\]</u>. In the anterior approach, when a patient is under general anesthesia, there is less control of the shoulder girdle muscles. Also, passive adduction of the arm may cause the scapula to shift anteriorly, for example, when a patient’s arm is raised and crossed over his or her chest. This could cause creasing of the muscle and compression of the long thoracic nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Especially in MFS, because of joint laxity, intraoperative stretching on the ribs and scapula can cause injury to the nerve that is greater than in other patients.\n\n【26】In this study, it seems that, due to thoracotomy from the sixth rib and scapular traction during surgery, iatrogenic injury to the long thoracic nerve and winged scapula was observed. The recommended treatment for winged scapula following surgery is initially nonsurgical, that is, physical therapy. Different results have been attained using braces, standard arm slings, and other orthotics. Some propose that nonoperative treatment may be the best course of action for patients with minimal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, which is in line with this study. This case was unique insofar as there is no prior report of this in a Marfan patient undergoing scoliosis repair. Hence, it may play a role in medical research and evidence-based medicine. Importantly, it informs the decision-making process, allowing other clinicians to gain a broader understanding of clinical diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes of their cases.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】This report describes an MFS case with the unusual complication of scapular winging following thoracotomy for right thoracic scoliosis. Attention needs to be paid to surgical techniques in patients with hyperlaxity, especially in MFS.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The aetiology of lip injuries includes human bite as interpersonal violence. Bite wounds are always considered to be complex injuries contaminated with unique polymicrobial inoculum. A classification of facial bite injuries has been included and the surgical management of these lesions has also been discussed. We report a rare bite injury on the lower lip that resembled an ulcerative process.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 30-year-old African man presented with a severe tissue defect on his lower lip to a Dental and Oral Department in Tanzania. He explained that 12 days ago he had been involved in a fight and someone had bitten his lower lip. An orofacial examination confirmed a serious loss of lip tissue that resembled a chronic ulcerative process. Accurate assessment of the lesion was made by a thorough evaluation of some parameters such as size, depth, presence of granulation tissue, fibrin coverage, wound edges, exudates and/or necrosis. A surgical debridement under local anaesthesia was carried out. Afterwards a layered suture was performed. Eventually the healing was complete and satisfactory.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】A severe bite avulsive wound on the lower lip, despite the elapsed time before treatment, may have an excellent prognosis after a simple surgical procedure.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Traumatic lip injuries present major challenges in terms of reconstructive options and the outcome of surgical management通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The aetiology of lip injuries varies, depending on socio-environmental factors. These include road traffic accidents, human bite, animal bite, burns and electrical injuries, as well as interpersonal violence通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 3 \\]</u>. Commonly, human bites by an assailant occur extra-orally but on a few occasions they also occur intra-orally. The size and severity of the injuries vary, ranging from small lacerations, punctures or cuts to total avulsion and loss of relatively big chunks of tissue通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Because of their location human bites in the maxillofacial region compromise function and aesthetics; as a consequence social and psychological effects are most likely通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The prevalence of human and animal bite injuries is around 1% of all emergency injuries. The frequency by affected areas, varies from cervicofacial region (36%), lower extremity (31%), upper extremity (19%) and chest (14%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】Bite wounds are always considered to be complex injuries contaminated with unique polymicrobial inoculum. Human bites are as serious as animal bites because they induce a higher incidence of infectious complications. Human saliva is considered to be a virulent inoculum, with bacterial loads at the order of 10 <sup>8 </sup> per millimetre, which significantly increase in cases of periodontal disease and oral sepsis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【12】In bite wounds to the face, infectious complications can create more difficulties than the initial tissue damage itself for the task of restoring an aesthetic appearance. The management should aim to neutralize this potential for infection and provide an infection-free environment for wound healing通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【13】An atypical orofacial traumatic wound type IIIA, according to Lackmann’s facial bite injuries classification, is presented. The appearance of the lesion because of the elapsed time between the trauma and the patient’s attendance adds interest.\n\n【14】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【15】A 30-year-old African man presented with a severe tissue defect on his lower lip 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u> to a Dental and Oral Department in Tanzania. He had no past medical history of note.\n\n【16】**Figure 1**\n\n【17】**Clinical image: A human bite injury.** Notice the severe lip tissue defect mimicking an ulcerative chronic process.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】He explained, while covering his mouth with a scarf, that 12 days ago he had been involved in a fight and someone had bitten his lower lip. After initial emergency first aid and several topic cures at a local dispensary, he was referred to the regional hospital. An orofacial examination confirmed a serious loss of lip tissue that resembled a chronic ulcerative process. Accurate assessment of the lesion was made by a thorough evaluation of some parameters such as size, depth, presence of granulation tissue, fibrin coverage, wound edges, exudates and/or necrosis.A surgical debridement and manual irrigation with normal saline under local anaesthesia was carried out. Afterwards a layered suture was performed with what we only had available at that service, catgut for muscular/subcutaneous tissues and silk for skin/oral mucosa. There was some over tension around the vertical mattress sutures as it was important to get a correct primary wound closure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. Postoperative medical treatment included oral analgesics (ibuprofen 400mg 8 hourly for 5 days) and broad spectrum oral antibiotics coverage (amoxicillin 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days in combination with metronidazole 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days). In order to avoid a possible cicatrization failure, silk sutures were removed after 2 weeks. Eventually the healing was complete and satisfactory 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 3 )</u>.\n\n【20】**Figure 2**\n\n【21】**Surgical procedure. (a)** and **(b)** .

However, in agreement with the vast majority of African studies, the most common aetiology of lip injury is human bite.\n\n【28】The lower lip is the site most commonly involved, followed by the ear. This could be explained by the position of the lower lip in the face, which makes it among the most prominent parts in the face and therefore easily grabbed by the attacker’s teeth通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】After initial stabilization the facial wounds need to be assessed for the type, size and depth of the wounds and presence of infection. Lackmann’s classification of facial bite wounds based on the extent appears in Table 1 . The case described could be classified as type IIIA with some tissue loss on the labial area通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】**Table 1 **Lackmann’s classification of facial bite injuries****\n\n【31】Full size table\n\n【32】The management of these injuries has undergone a transformation from allowing the wounds to heal by secondary intention to a more aggressive approach that optimizes aesthetic results by primary closure. After several years of debate there seems to be some consensus on the guidelines for the management of facial bite wounds通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. The principle steps are as follows:\n\n【33】*   Proper surgical toilet of the wound by irrigation\n\n【34】*   Meticulous but not overzealous debridement of devitalized tissue\n\n【35】*   Primary closure of the wound except in high-risk cases\n\n【36】*   Appropriate antibiotic therapy\n\n【37】*   Tetanus and rabies immunization where required\n\n【38】The current practice emphasizes that thorough irrigation of contaminated bite wounds would considerably decrease the bacterial load, remove particulate matter and reduce infection rate. Irrigation techniques range from manual irrigation using a 20 to 35mL syringe (18 to 20G needle) to pulsatile jet lavage (pressure of 50 to 70psi). Normal saline is the preferred irrigant as it does not interfere with the normal wound healing as most antiseptics do通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【39】Human bite injuries carry the risk of being infected with the bacteria flora of the oral cavity and these infections are polymicrobial in nature. This often leads surgeons to consider initial debridement and delayed closure because of the fear of wound infections通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【40】Prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotic treatment and primary closure of bite wound remain areas of controversy. Nevertheless, delayed closure should only be reserved for certain high risk or already infected wounds通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 6 \\]</u>. The fact that most patients have good healing of the wound after primary sutures is because of the good blood supply in the facial region which increases the host resistance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission by human bites has been reported. Consequently, some authors have advocated routine HIV test for both victims and assailants通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【41】Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue should be kept to a minimum in the facial area because the residual partially necrotic tissues of this anatomical region can survive on small pedicles due its rich vascularity. Landmark areas, such as the vermillion border, nasolabial fold and eyebrows should not be inadvertently trimmed通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【42】The surgical reparative techniques are similar despite the aetiology of the defect. The corrective procedures in some cases are challenging and laborious. Basic principles for lip reconstruction include the remaining portions of the lip, borrowing of tissue from the opposite lip and/or the cheek, and advancement of adjacent flaps通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Subcutaneous sutures are kept to a minimum as they act as foreign bodies and precipitate infection. However, in avulsive wounds subcutaneous sutures may be required to get a primary closure even with the presence of a severe tissue defect通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. The main goals of reconstruction remain the restoration of oral competence, maintenance of oral opening, and the restoration of normal anatomic relations with an acceptable aesthetic outcome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【44】A human bite wound in the orofacial region, despite its severity and elapsed time before treatment, may have an excellent prognosis after a simple surgical procedure. At first sight, the aspect of this atypical traumatic lip injury resembled a chronic ulcerative process. A careful anamnesis and inspection will aid in characterizing the cause of any rare lip lesion.\n\n【45】Consent\n-------\n\n【46】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Molecular studies have been the gold standard modality for patient assessment since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In spite of that, there are cytogenetic abnormalities that can render the disease unresponsive to conventional therapy, thus making cytogenetics an important component of patient management guidelines.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a case of a Tajik, Afghan patient with chronic myeloid leukemia with del通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome who, despite having typical clinical and hematological disease with initial response to therapy, progressed to blast crisis very early and thus required special interventions.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Cytogenetic monitoring is an important pillar in the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia that cannot be ignored. It should therefore be a part of patient management not only during diagnosis but also during management. We present an unusual cytogenetic abnormality in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia that resulted in early disease progression.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】BCR-ABL1, the oncogenic driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), results from a balanced translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene ( _ABL_ ) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region ( _BCR_ ) gene on chromosome 22q11.2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This fusion gene is the main molecular target in the management of CML, and, since its first introduction in early 2000s, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has been very effective in improving outcome and prognosis in affected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The first agent with TKI activity that acquired license for treatment of patients with CML was imatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Then the new-generation drugs were added, including nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The current therapeutic protocols are all based on cytogenetic and molecular genetic predictors of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. For instance, the first tool to identify patient response with a great level of confidence was quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BCR-ABL1, aiming to assess patients for major molecular response, which was the deepest scrutiny into a disease process for its time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Since then, scrutiny of the disease process has grown deeper and deeper, with more agile and accurate methods of identifying abnormal clones with ratio of 1:10,000 versus normal clones, called the deep molecular response (DMR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Now, patients who have achieved DMR and are able to maintain it for a specific time period are even entitled to be allowed complete discontinuation of TKI therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In spite of all the above-mentioned molecular progress in diagnosis and monitoring of CML, the role of cytogenetics is still undeniably very significant because molecular modalities, though very useful, might still be unable to identify extra Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) abnormalities, including the major route cytogenetic abnormalities that can affect management as well as prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. We present a case of a patient with CML who was diagnosed in chronic phase (CP) and subsequently started on TKI therapy with initial hematological response; however, within 5 months, the patient experienced a blast crisis due to acquisition of extra Ph abnormalities.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】Our patient was a 42-year-old Tajik, Afghan man with no known medical illness who presented to our institution with lethargy, anorexia, pallor, and progressive abdominal distension that had developed over a duration of 4 months. On examination, the patient was pale, not in distress, and had no lymphadenopathy. His abdominal examination revealed gross splenomegaly crossing the midline with the liver just two finger breadths in the subcostal region. His complete blood count revealed moderate anemia, thrombocytosis, and hyperleukocytosis (450,000 white blood cells per microliter), showing predominance of granulocytes with a bimodal peak of mature neutrophils (68%) and myelocytes (33%). The patient’s blast count was 4% with normal basophil count. The clinical impression at that time was CML in CP based on the initial clinical and hematological evaluation. The patient was counseled to proceed with cytogenetic analysis for confirmation and prognostication of disease, but, due to financial constraints, he opted to start on TKI therapy. Accordingly, the patient was started on conventional imatinib therapy 400 mg/day. Initially, he responded well with resolution of hyperleukocytosis and improvement in hemoglobin and platelet count toward normal, but he did not achieve complete hematological remission. A repeated complete blood count analysis revealed moderate anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and the presence of >90% blast cells in a total white cell count of 62,000/μl. After detailed counseling, the patient agreed to proceed with cytogenetic analysis, in which the analyzed metaphases of all 20 cells revealed 45,XY, presence of Ph chromosome (9q34;22q11.2), and additional complex chromosomal abnormalities, including deletion of chromosomes 6q23.3 to q27, monosomy 11, monosomy 12, insertion 12p13.3, and a marker chromosome, as shown in Fig. 1 . Ultimately, the patient and his family were advised to proceed with allogeneic bone marrow transplant, considering the patient’s complex karyotype and nonresponsiveness to TKI therapy.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Karyogram of one of the two cells assessed, showing 45,XY with del通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome labeled as (mar)\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】CML, once an indolent but indefinitely progressive disease of the hematopoietic system, has now become a success story in the field of hemato-oncology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Almost all patients now achieve complete remission in a matter of months, and this success is attributable to the discovery of TKI agents and progress in the field of molecular genetics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The field of molecular genetics has enabled physicians not only to identify the disease burden but also to tailor management in accordance with measurable residual disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 13 \\]</u>. All the guidelines since the advent of quantitative real-time PCR for BCR-ABL1, just two decades ago, include close patient monitoring with consideration of molecular targets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 14 \\]</u>. Quantitation of disease burden with consideration of established guidelines not only has enabled identification of patients for whom TKI therapy needs to be switched from one agent to a more potent one during therapy but also has made it possible to identify patients for whom a higher class of TKI must be considered right from the start 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】Targeting deep molecular response has enabled identification of individuals who can successfully achieve complete molecular remission with successful discontinuation of therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Novel, highly sensitive quantitative PCR analysis methods are now implemented to monitor patients who discontinue TKI therapy after successful achievement of molecular targets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Mutational studies have now become a commonplace practice in the management of patients with CML 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. The presence of mutation(s) of bad prognostic value implies that the patient needs commencement with expensive but more specific tyrosine kinase domain targeting agents, such as dasatinib and ponatinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 17 \\]</u>. In such cases, it has been demonstrated that ponatinib, the newest agent in the market, is the agent that is effective in almost all the mutant forms of BCR-ABL1 demonstrated so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【22】Despite all the mentioned progression in molecular studies, cytogenetics plays a very important role and thus has always been incorporated in CML management guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. Chromosomal abnormalities that are acquired during either the pathogenesis or the treatment of CML have a deep impact on disease progression, prognosis, and thus shift the paradigm of management. Although even patients with the mutations of worst prognostic significance can benefit from third-generation TKI therapy, such as ponatinib, patients who harbor cytogenetic markers of prognostic significance have to be considered for alternative therapeutic modalities, especially allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>. This is because it has been demonstrated that such clones that acquire additional cytogenetic abnormalities are resistant to conventional TKI inhibitor therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>.\n\n【23】Our patient, despite having the characteristic clinical and hematological profile of CML, progressed to blast crisis early during therapy for harboring complex chromosomal abnormalities that were in addition to the pathognomonic Ph. Thus, the role played by cytogenetic analysis in the management of patients with CML along with the modern molecular modalities is absolutely not replaceable. Therefore, when feasible, cytogenetic studies must be included in the analysis of patients for whom molecular tests are being done.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【25】We present a case of a patient with CML who had an unusual “complex” cytogenetic abnormality in addition to Ph that resulted in early blast crisis. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with CML harboring del通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>(q23.3q27), t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), monosomy 11, monosomy 12, and marker chromosome in addition to Ph.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the generated data are included in this article.</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABL1:</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abelson gene 1</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BCR:</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Break point cluster region</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CML:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Chronic myeloid leukemia</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CP:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Chronic phase</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PCR:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Polymerase chain reaction</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ph:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Philadelphia chromosome</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TKI:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Tyrosine kinase inhibitor</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Therapeutic decisions are based heavily on receptor tissue characterization. Even though the vast majority of metastatic sites do not have receptor conversions, they can occur at the time of metastasis and/or during the course of treatment. However, multiple receptor conversions are uncommon.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present an unusual case of a Caucasian patient originally diagnosed with an estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative primary breast cancer who had a recurrence after 15 years of therapy. Her metastatic tumor had a different receptor status than the original tumor. During the course of therapy, at the time of progression, a new biopsy showed that her tumor had changed once more.\n\n【5】### Conclusion/Discussion\n\n【6】Tracking receptor conversions is important in metastatic breast cancer treatment. Single receptor conversions have been documented to occur, but not much is known of multiple receptor conversions. This case sheds light on the possibility of patients having multiple receptor conversions and the importance of performing multiple biopsies during the course of metastatic treatment.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer affecting women in the USA, and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women after lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The American Cancer Society estimates that 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in 2022 among American women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative is the most common type of BC, accounting for 65% of cases in women less than 50 years old and 75% of cases for older women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The use of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for 5–10 years is highly effective in reducing recurrence rate and death, yet endocrine resistance and late relapse may still occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Pan _et al_ . conducted a meta-analysis that showed that BC recurrences steadily occurred 20 years after the original diagnosis in patients that completed 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, metastatic BC (MBC) was strongly linked to the original tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), with recurrence risks ranging from 10% to 41% depending on tumor grade and TN status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Although strides have been made in treating BC in recent years, MBC is still considered to be essentially incurable. It is of interest, however, that in the CLEOPATRA trial, a small subset of HER2 MBC patients that remain progression free for 8 years are believed by some observers to effectively be cured by the use of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】The status of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 are vital in guiding clinicians in their therapeutic decisions. In the past, these decisions were largely based on tissue characterization of the primary site and not always the metastatic sites. However, it has been shown that changes in ER, PR, and HER2 status from the primary breast tumor to distant metastatic sites do occur, affecting the choice of systemic therapy. These receptor conversions are hypothesized to be the result of tumor heterogeneity and clonal selection as a result of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. To our knowledge, there is limited information on multiple receptor conversions in one single patient.\n\n【11】Herein we present a case of a patient who had changes in her receptor status twice during the course of her disease, and how repeating a biopsy at the time of disease progression was key to determining her therapy.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 49-year-old Caucasian woman was originally diagnosed with an ER-positive (3+), PR-positive (1–2+), HER2 (2+), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative cancer in 2003. It was a grade 3, T2N2M0, left-breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma. _BRCA1_ and _2_ analyses were negative. She was treated with four cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and subsequently had a left mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Repeat biomarkers showed that it was ER positive (3+), PR negative, and HER2 (2+), negative by FISH. The patient completed adjuvant radiation therapy. She then received adjuvant tamoxifen for 2 years followed by aromatase inhibitors continuing for 13 years until recurrence.\n\n【14】In 2018, at the age of 64 years, while still on anastrozole, she presented with acute left back pain. Images showed recurrent disease with a new left subpectoral mass and left scapular lesion. A biopsy of the mass showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with ductal carcinoma of mammary origin expressing AE1-3, GATA3, and mammaglobin. However, this time the tumor was ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative (FISH copy number 2.1 and ratio 1.4) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2 )</u>. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) showed several mutations: _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F of 9.3%, _TP53_ Q104 of 0.1%, _TP53_ H178fs of 3.7% 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 B)</u>.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Timeline and treatment history after metastasis with circulating tumor DNA in a tumor response map (the map and table below illustrates the variant allele fraction detected of the observed somatic variants during each sample submission of liquid biopsy)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Left subpectoral mass. **A** Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) ×40 image of the fine needle aspiration of the left subpectoral mass involving poorly differentiated metastatic ductal carcinoma. **B** Negative estrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **C** Negative progesterone receptor (PR) immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells. **D** Negative Her2Neu immunohistochemistry staining of tumor cells\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】A biopsy of the left scapular lesion showed metastatic carcinoma consistent with breast primary.

Androgen receptor positive (5–10% weak), GATA3 positive, PD-L1 positive.\n\n【22】She started zoledronic acid and atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel because of a positive PD-L1 assay and had a partial response by June 2019 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 D and E)</u>. By September 2019, she showed a mixed response in her follow-up images, with improvement in her left subpectoral lymph node and the lesion in the left coracoid process, but a new lesion at T1 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 F)</u>. The ctDNA at that time showed _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F 3.8%, _TP53_ H178fs 1.9%, and _CDH1_ R87fs 0.1% 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 G)</u>.\n\n【23】A repeat positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) scan showed improvement of the subpectoral lesion and stable bone metastasis by November 2019 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 H)</u>. She additionally received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the left coracoid process and the T1 vertebral body to consolidate the therapeutic response 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 I)</u>. The ctDNA done in May 2020 showed _ERBB2_ (HER2) S310F 0.5% and _TP53_ H178fs 0.4% 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 J)</u>.\n\n【24】By August 2020, she had two small liver lesions. A fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy of the liver showed an ER negative, PR negative, HER2 2+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and positive by FISH group 3 by ASCO CAP 2018 (copy number 7.9 and ratio 1.61) tumor 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 K and Fig. 3 )</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. This tumor was also AR positive 1%, PD-L1 SP142 positive 2%, PTEN positive 90%, CK7 positive, GATA3 positive, and mammaglobin positive.

Therefore, her therapy was switched to trastuzumab, capecitabine, and tucatinib 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 N)</u>. A follow-up PET–CT showed a complete response of measurable disease with non-PET fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid residual lesions viscerally and in bone by January 2021, with sclerotic bone lesions still seen on scan 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 O)</u>. The ctDNA did not detect any somatic alterations in her blood that correlated to the response seen on the PET-CT 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 P)</u>. Her PET–CT done in November 2021 still showed no evidence of active disease 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 Q)</u>.\n\n【29】Conclusion/Discussion\n---------------------\n\n【30】Receptor conversions are known to occur during the treatment of MBC, but multiple conversions are not well documented. A meta-analysis by Schrijver _et al_ . found that receptor conversions of ER, PR, and HER2 from positive to negative were 22.5%, 49.4%, and 21.3%, respectively, while receptor conversions from negative to positive were 21.5%, 15.9%, and 9.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. This shows that HER2 conversions, especially from negative to positive, are relatively rare when compared with the hormone receptor (HR) status. Meng _et al_ . performed a retrospective review looking at the ER and PR receptor status of primary tumors and metastatic sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. They found that a conversion occurred in 26.3% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Some patients had additional biopsies and they were able to reassess for re-conversions. They reported that ER and PR had a re-conversion in 26.8% and 35.4% of cases, respectively, but there was no mention of HER2 re-conversions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】A study by Hoefnagel _et al_ . showed that discordance of diverse metastatic sites within the same patient for ER was 7.3% or 10.9% (using, respectively, a 10% or 1% threshold for positivity), for PR it was 29.1% or 30.9%, and for HER2 it was 3.6% on IHC but 0% for gene amplification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Thus in 10.9–14.5% of the patients, this discordance might have clinical relevance indicating a potential need to change treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Additionally, this study demonstrated that there was minimal discrepancy within metastatic lesions (for example, heterogeneity) for HER2, making this case that much more uniquely valuable. Since receptor conversions can occur in the course of disease progression from the primary tumor to subsequent metastatic sites, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend a biopsy of the metastatic site at presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. During the course of our patient’s treatment, we biopsied at presentation and at multiple progressions to reassess receptor status and the presence or absence of actionable mutations to optimize treatment.\n\n【32】Receptor conversions can change the patient’s prognosis. While HER2 conversions from positive to negative are associated with a poor prognosis, HER2 conversions from negative to positive are associated with better outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be helpful in certain circumstances, but it will not detect a change in HR status and is not as sensitive as a tissue biopsy in detecting HER2 amplification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Tissue biopsies are still the gold standard for molecular analysis and have better sensitivity for assessment of amplification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】The receptor status of the patient is important in providing the clinician with the most accurate information for choosing appropriate treatment. If the receptor status changes, then the patient may be receiving ineffective treatment and additional toxicity without therapeutic benefit. The question then becomes how often or when should one be biopsying the patient’s lesions to potentially change therapeutic treatment? In this case, we decided to track her ctDNA along with obtaining multiple metastatic biopsies at the time of progression. We tracked her metastatic response to treatment through imaging examinations, and when it was evident that she had disease progression, we biopsied her lesions and found, once again, she had a receptor conversion.\n\n【34】Circulating tumor DNA offers fast and accurate genotyping in patients with MBC, which helps in the selection of therapies in patients with actionable mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. The use of ctDNA was interesting in that she had an _ERBB2_ mutation that later disappeared. Nevertheless, it missed the HER2 amplification. This shows that even though ctDNA can sometimes be useful to track how well a patient is responding to treatment, it can still miss some changes in the tumor. A tissue biopsy of the metastatic lesion, when appropriate, is the best test to assess changes. Given the invasive nature of a tissue biopsy, it should be considered when clinically there is some suggestion of a differing disease process, as in our case. As previously shown, our patient’s ctDNA was going down while she developed a new liver lesion.\n\n【35】A study by Nayar _et al_ . found that HER2 mutations and ER mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting a separate mechanism of acquired resistance for each one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Moreover, HER2 mutations are relatively rare, accounting for 1.6% of primary BC’s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. For women with HER2 mutations, the SUMMIT basket trial demonstrated encouraging clinical results for the use of neratinib alone or in combination with fulvestrant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>.\n\n【36】Metastatic BC shows high mutational burden and clonal diversity when compared with early BC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. This could be due to selective spread across metastatic sites of positive and negative clones from the primary lesion, clonal selection during disease progression possibly due to therapeutic treatment, genomic evolution during the course of metastasis, biological drift, or small undetectable subclones in primary tumors that only become evident once metastasis has occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 20 \\]</u>. It is possible that this is what happened to our patient. She could have had heterogeneity within the initial MBC tumor that was not originally detectable. Her original BC diagnosis was HR+ HER2− then her initial soft-tissue MBC lesion biopsy was HR− and HER2− by FISH. At the time of progression, her liver was biopsied and the tumor was HER2+ by FISH.\n\n【37】Molecular imaging could help target which lesions to biopsy. In a meta-analysis by Kurland _et al_ . they recommend the integration of PET with 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (F-FES) as an image biomarker tracer to identify areas of ER metastatic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. Hopefully in the future, additional tracers are integrated to determine areas of marker diversities to minimize random metastatic biopsy selection.\n\n【38】This report describes a case where multiple conversions occurred. It is therefore extremely important to not only perform a biopsy at the time of metastatic diagnosis, but also during the course of metastatic treatment.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BC:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Breast cancer</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ER:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Estrogen receptor</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HER2:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MBC:</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Metastatic breast cancer</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PR:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Progesterone receptor</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FISH:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fluorescence in situ hybridization</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TAC:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ctDNA:</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Circulating tumor DNA</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PET–CT:</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positron emission tomography–computed tomography</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SBRT:</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Stereotactic body radiation therapy</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IHC:</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Immunohistochemistry</u>\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IRE:</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Irreversible electroporation</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FDG:</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fluorodeoxyglucose</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HR:</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hormone receptor</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NCCN:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National comprehensive cancer network</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>F-FES:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>F-fluoroestradiol</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Despite numerous previous publications regarding the variants of renal veins, we did not find any that resemble the anomaly reported here, even after an extensive literature search. We report a case of bilateral anomalous drainage of the posterior divisions of renal veins into the azygos venous system in a 20-year-old woman from Tanzania who presented with a 12-year history of recurrent anemia.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 20-year-old woman of African descent from Tanzania was referred to us from an upcountry hospital with a 12-year history of recurrent anemia accompanied by effort intolerance, palpitations, chest pain, and yellowish discoloration of sclera. She had been on long-term use of hematinics (folic acid and ferrous sulfate), had been hospitalized five times, and had been transfused three times in her lifetime. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for conjunctival pallor. Her vital signs during admission were blood pressure 98/54 mmHg, pulse rate 64 beats/minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, temperature 37.0 <sup>o </sup> C, oxygen saturation 100% in room air, and she had a body mass index (BMI) of 20.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. She underwent several blood work-ups which revealed normal findings except for a normocytic normochromic anemia: hemoglobin (Hb) 8.88 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 91.2 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 30.5 pg/cell, and red cell distribution width (RDW) 21.6%. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (ECHO) revealed normal findings. She had a positive sickling test and Hb electrophoresis revealed a sickle cell trait (AS). She also underwent computed tomography (CT) angiography and venography of her chest and abdomen to rule out the presence of arteriovenous malformations.

The advent of multi-detector computed tomography has increased the detection rate and improved the assessment experience of anatomic variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In general, persons with renal vein anomalies are asymptomatic but, rarely, they may present with a blunt pain, intermittent hematuria, and/or varicocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Preoperative knowledge of such variants is important in several angiographic procedures including adrenal or renal venography, renal vein sampling, and spermatic embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Moreover, awareness of these anomalies is also crucial in retroperitoneal surgeries especially renal transplantation or when a distal portal decompression is anticipated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. If unrecognized, these variations may lead to significant complications or death during abdominopelvic operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】In normal anatomy, the anterior and posterior divisions of renal veins receive blood from the anterior and posterior portions of the kidneys, respectively. The two divisions then unite to form a single renal vein that drains directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC) at a right angle on either side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In the case presented, the anterior divisions drained normally into her IVC but the posterior divisions drained into the azygos and hemiazygos veins on the right and left side, respectively 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 1 and 2 )</u>. As a result, her azygos venous system was tortuous and dilated due to venous congestion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【25】The clinical picture of vascular anomalies is extremely protean. These aberrant venous connections have the potential to cause venous congestion and compression and/or thrombosis with consequential hemodynamic compromises. In the case presented the anomaly was rather benign and had no contribution to the current symptomatology. However, despite it being an incidental finding, preoperative unawareness of the existence of such benign vascular anomalies can result in surgical trauma and its associated complications in the event that abdominopelvic surgery is indicated.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】Although venous anomalies are relatively infrequent and generally lack a clinical significance, a thorough understanding of embryologic development and its associated errors is of immense importance in equipping angiographers and surgeons to: (i) select appropriate interventional/operative techniques, (ii) anticipate risks and prevent intervention-related complications, and (iii) provide proper postoperative management.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BMI:</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Body Mass Index</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ECG:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Electrocardiogram</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ECHO:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Echocardiography</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hb:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hemoglobin</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IVC:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Inferior vena cava</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCH:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular hemoglobin</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCV:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean corpuscular volume</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RDW:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Red cell distribution width</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This article presents the case of a 42-year-old pregnant woman, diagnosed with a rare 270° uterine torsion, in whom proper management led to good maternal outcomes but, unfortunately, severe prematurity and metabolic acidosis led to neonatal death. Moreover, the mother was clinically suspected for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】In December 2020, a 42-year-old pregnant Iranian woman, Gravid 3 para2 live2, at 30 weeks of gestation presented to the obstetric emergency department of Vali-Asr Hospital (Birjand, Iran) suffering from acute severe generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness while she was hemodynamically unstable. After resuscitation, owing to persistent fetal bradycardia on fetal heart rate monitoring, she underwent an emergency cesarean section. Infra-umbilical midline skin incision was made, and when the abdominal cavity was opened, owing to abnormal appearance of the uterus, we further investigated the abdominopelvic cavity. Surprisingly, the uterus was dextrorotated by 270°. After uterine detorsion through a Kerr incision, a nonvigorous male baby was born with severe metabolic acidosis that led to his death soon after birth. Interestingly, we could find no predisposing factors such as pelvic abnormalities during surgery. Nevertheless, as her postoperative detailed physical examination revealed skin hyperextensibility, joint laxity, pelvic organ prolapse, and trivial exophthalmos, connective tissue disorders, mainly Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, were suspected. Unfortunately, for significant financial, cultural, and religious reasons, the patient refused to undergo further investigations. Additionally, despite severe congested uterus and subsequent uterine atony, timely diagnosis and anatomical correction of the gravid uterus before uterine incision prevented iatrogenic complications. The mother was discharged 2 days later without any postpartum complications.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Although uterine torsion is an extremely rare condition during pregnancy, based on severe associated maternal and perinatal complications, it is important to take this diagnosis into consideration as an differential diagnosis.

Surprisingly, most obstetricians and gynecologists may encounter this obstetrical emergency only once in their lives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.

Owing to nonspecific and vague symptoms that can mimic other obstetrical complications, mainly placental abruption, its diagnosis is elusive and is almost always postponed to the operating room 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Delayed diagnosis can also result in serious iatrogenic injuries to the uterus and/or adjacent organs, especially the urinary system. Hence, strong clinical suspicion, especially when the patient has an underlying risk factor, can reduce both maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Various conditions have been mentioned as predisposing factors, but to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on uterine torsion being associated with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) as a leading cause. In this current paper, we present a case of uterine torsion in a clinically suspected pregnant woman with EDS at 30 weeks of gestation.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 42-year-old pregnant Iranian woman, Gravid 3 para2 live2, at 30 weeks of gestation was referred to the obstetric emergency department of Vali-Asr Hospital (Birjand, Iran) by the emergency service in December 2020. She was suffering from acute-onset severe abdominal pain followed by nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and dizziness. She had two healthy children, her previous pregnancies were uneventful, and she declared no postpartum complications during her previous gestations. She had no history of cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption, and her marriage was consanguineous. Moreover, she was living in a deprived remote village around Birjand City (Southern Khorasan Province, Iran) with very low socioeconomic status.\n\n【12】Upon her arrival, her body mass index, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature, and peripheral oxygen saturation in room air were 22.6 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , 70 mmHg, 130 beats per minute, 14 breaths per minute, 36.9 °C, and 98% ,respectively. Her skin and mucosal membranes were completely pale, and urinary output was less than 50 cc per hour. She was lethargic, but neurological examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficit and corneal reflex was symmetrically present in both eyes. Obstetrical examination revealed increased fundal height in excess of a term uterus and also uterine hypertonicity. No evidence of ruptured membranes or external vaginal bleeding was evident. Although on digital vaginal examination the cervix was too high posteriorly positioned to be touched by digits, it seemed unripe and closed. Moreover, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring revealed fetal bradycardia.\n\n【13】As the patient was hemodynamically unstable, resuscitation was initiated with a bolus of 2 L Ringer’s lactate solution immediately and blood tests were sent. Two units of packed cells were cross-matched. After stabilization, owing to persistent fetal bradycardia, as low as 80 beats per minute, she was emergently transferred to the operating room for cesarean section delivery by impression of massive occult placental abruption. Under general anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was accessed through a low midline incision. We encountered with lateral wall of the uterus and left broad ligament. As the uterus was levorotated approximately 90°, a severely congested dark-purple uterus with many dilated tortuous vessels on its lower segment was seen and no uterovesical peritoneal reflex could be identified. Subsequently manual exploration revealed an additional 180° uterine dextrotorsion. Hence, abdominal wall skin incision was expanded to upper umbilical level and the uterus was detorted. Subsequently, a male baby weighing 1150 g was born through a Kerr uterine incision. Unfortunately, the 1-minute Apgar score was 0 and resuscitation was unsuccessful. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.95) and base excess of 16 mmol/L.\n\n【14】It is worth noting that, after detorsion, maternal central and peripheral circulation began to improve rapidly and myometrial layer color changed to near normal, but when the uterine wound was closed, the uterus became atonic. Uterotonic agents (0.2 mg of intramuscular methylergonovine plus 30 international units of intravenous oxytocin)were administered, and owing to moderate anemia (hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL) detected in her initial laboratory tests, 2 units of packed cells were transfused. Platelet count, coagulation study (prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, and fibrinogen level), and liver and kidney function tests were all unremarkable. Fortunately, despite anemia, all other laboratory tests, including serum electrolytes, serum aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and coagulation study, were within normal limits post-operation period, and her hemoglobin level reached 10 g/dL.\n\n【15】Interestingly, we could not find any pelvic abnormalities such as congenital anomalies, uterine fibroids, pelvic or adnexal masses, adhesion bands, fetal malpresentation, or any report of vigorous fetal movements prior to symptom onset. However, parietal peritoneum and broad ligaments seemed too loose. In the postoperative period, physical examination and detailed history were taken. No additional significant data were found out except for moderate low back pain; magnetic resonance imaging had revealed lumbar disc herniation 2 years ago. Moreover, her height and body mass index were 1.7 m and 22.6 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , respectively; she showed increased skin elasticity, joint hypermobility in upper extremities, and trivial exophthalmos. On vaginal examination based on pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) classification, third-grade anterior and second-grade posterior compartment prolapse were evident; vaginal wall had increased elasticity, and no episiotomy scar or perineal lacerations were observed. In fact, no episiotomy had been made in either vaginal birth, and her previous newborns weighed nearly 3 kg. She received low-molecular-weight heparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily after 24 hours postoperation. On the basis of these systemic manifestations, connective tissue disorders, mainly Ehlers–Danlos, were highly suspected. However, as she was illiterate and living in a remote deprived village, she refused any further investigation, and on the second day postpartum, she was discharged from the hospital on her own request without any complication and was recommended to continue thromboprophylaxis for an additional 7 days. Subsequently, skin sutures were removed on the 12th postoperative day, and she did not come back thereafter. Unfortunately, we were not even able to contact her via phone to have an interview-based follow-up visit. It should be emphasized that, despite refusing to have her pictures taken and undergo further assessments, she gave us informed consent to publish this information.\n\n【16】Discussion\n----------\n\n【17】Here we presented a rare case of 270° gravid uterine torsion manifesting with hemodynamic instability and a clinical picture mimicking extensive occult placental abruption but without evidence of obvious coagulopathy. The patient had systemic clinical features of connective tissue disorders, mainly Ehlers–Danlos syndrome; however, definite diagnosis of Ehlers–Danlos could not be made as the patient refused genetic testing. In summary, the degree of uterine torsion, the shock status despite lack of external or internal bleeding, and accompanying clinical findings in favor of Ehlers–Danlos were all interesting points to be considered.\n\n【18】In fact, uterine torsion is an extremely rare event, especially in nonpregnant women, and often occurs in uncomplicated pregnancies, most commonly in the third trimester. It is associated with serious maternal and perinatal outcomes, and mortality rate reaches up to 12–18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 \\]</u>. In line with this, in the presented case, uterine torsion occurred in the 30th week of gestation and led to neonatal death. The precise etiology is not well known, but presence of uterine myomas, congenital anomalies, pelvic or adnexal masses or adhesions, abnormal fetal presentation, vigorous fetal movements, and abdominal trauma and high-ordered parities account for 70–84% of uterine torsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 \\]</u>. As mentioned before, relevant systemic signs and symptoms indicate that connective tissue disorders, most likely Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), are the only potential leading cause in our patient. There are 13 subtypes of EDS according to the International EDS Consortium, and the very rare vascular subtype predisposes pregnant women to more significant and life-threatening complications such as arterial dissection and/or rupture and uterine rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 28 \\]</u>, whereas pregnant women with hypermobile or classic subtypes of EDS are more susceptible to obstetrical complications such as pelvic organ prolapse, postpartum incontinence, abnormal wound healing, and atrophic scar formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 29 , 30 \\]</u>. Still, there is no evidence in the literature of EDS association with gravid uterus torsion. However, owing to the patient’s refusal of further investigations and lack of genetic testing, a definite Ehlers–Danlos diagnosis and subtype specification could not be confirmed. This is the main limitation of our report.\n\n【19】Degree of uterine torsion usually varies between 45° and 180°. Owing to the natural right-side deviation of gravid uterus, dextrorotation is more common and rotation greater than 180° is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. In this presented case, the uterus had rotated in excess of 270°. Uterine torsion manifestation can vary significantly. Mild-to-severe abdominal pain accompanied by neurologic or hypovolemic shock is the most common feature, as seen here. Vaginal bleeding, nausea and vomiting, hemodynamic instability, uterine hypertonicity, increased fundal height, decreased fetal movements, fetal distress, intrauterine fetal death, obstructed labor, and dystocia are other possible manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 32 \\]</u>. Surprisingly, our patient had fulfilled almost all these symptoms (hemodynamic instability, nausea and vomiting, severe acute abdominal pain, uterine hypertonicity, increased fundal height, and fetal distress). The diagnosis is difficult and almost always occurs during laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 33 \\]</u>, as this patient was transferred to operating room with presumed diagnose of severe occult placental abruption. However, imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can facilitate diagnosis before surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 31 , 34 , 35 \\]</u>. Nevertheless, because uterine torsion presents as an obstetrical emergency, definite diagnosis is almost always delayed until surgery time and there is not enough time to perform any imaging modalities. In line with this, the patient also manifested shock status and massive occult placental abruption was suspected initially. Moreover, she was referred to the emergency department during night, which makes access to imaging facilities even more difficult in some health centers.\n\n【20】Uterine torsion can obliterate ovarian and/or uterine veins. Subsequently, venous congestion and increased placental cotyledon pressure may result in placental abruption. Furthermore, torsion can compress uterine arterial flow and reduce placental perfusion, leading to fetal distress or even intrauterine death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Surgery is considered the main treatment option, while concomitant cesarean delivery is done in near-term or term pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 32 \\]</u>. Maternal prognosis is usually acceptable, but perinatal mortality is still high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 36 \\]</u>. If detorsion is impossible or torsion is not diagnosed before uterine wall incision, lower posterior uterine segment incision may damage uterine vasculature and cause severe adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>. Fortunately, in this patient, definite diagnosis was made before uterine incision. Detorsion was followed by a transverse low anterior uterine wall incision. In rare cases, owing to prolonged or irreversible ischemia and subsequent necrosis of the uterus or adjacent pelvic organs, hysterectomy or oophorectomy may be inevitable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 37 \\]</u>, although it is worth noting that, in a necrotic uterus, detorsion can cause sudden distributive shock and/or serious coagulopathy as a result of reperfusion syndrome or amniotic fluid emboli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, as Cook _et al_ . stated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 38 \\]</u>. Interestingly, as hypovolemic shock was due to obstructed uterine venous flow return in this case, by early uterine detorsion before onset of irreversible ischemia, obvious improvement in both peripheral and central circulation occurred. Furthermore, increased fundal height was due to obliterated venous return without any evidence of concealed retroplacental hematoma formation, and absence of clot formation may explain why no coagulopathy was observed. Fortunately, early laparotomy and detorsion of uterus subsequently resulted in full recovery of uterus circulation and hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【22】Although uterine torsion is an extremely rare condition among pregnant women, because of its severe associated maternal and perinatal complications, it should be suspected in every patient presenting with its associated vague and nonspecific symptoms. In fact, delayed diagnosis even at the time of surgery, can lead to severe additional iatrogenic complications and even mortality. Moreover, as we could not confirm Ehlers–Danlos diagnosis through genetic testing, we highly recommend further investigations on possible association between Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and/or other connective tissue disorders and uterine torsion. We also strongly suggest physicians pay more attention to this potential risk factor when related systemic signs and symptoms are evident in a patient.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All relevant data are available at Vali-Asr Hospital, South Khorasan Province.

PP is extremely rare (2%) in healthy individuals; it usually occurs in patients with nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, ascites, immunosuppressive status, or inflamed peritoneum due to pre-existing autoimmune and/or oncological conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>. The physiopathology of PP is not completely understood, but increased translocation of intestinal bacteria, retrograde diffusion from the genitourinary tract in females, or hematogenous infectious pathways have been discussed. Historically, PP has been related to Gram-negative bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria, excluding _Enterococcus_ species, are rarely involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u> and, therefore, PP was seldom misdiagnosed. We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian woman operated on due to acute abdomen with a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department complaining of acute onset of severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant that began approximately 48 hours earlier; she had a temperature of 39.1 °C and heart rate of 98/minute. She denied any recent fever, chills, hemoptysis, hematochezia, or change in bowel habits. She had no history of trauma or surgery; she did not take any regular medication; she did not use an intrauterine device (IUD) or other local contraceptive. She had normal sex activity with the same partner (last sexual relationship 20 days before surgery). No relevant history of infection in her family was reported. On her presentation to our emergency room, a physical examination revealed a localized peritonism in the right lower quadrant. At rectal examination, a normal sphincter tone was found with no palpable masses and normal stool. Other features were unremarkable. Laboratory values on admission showed an hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, 36.4% hematocrit, with 19.00 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> /uL white blood cells (WBC). C-reactive protein (CRP) value was 5 mg/dl (normal value < 0.5). A computed tomography (CT) scan 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> revealed no pathognomonic signs of appendicitis. Due to the diagnosis of acute abdomen, with provisional clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis and secondary peritonitis, antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate 2 .2 g three times a day was initiated and she was taken to our operating room. During the operation, a small amount of free intra-abdominal fluid was found with uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes being macroscopically normal. Appendicitis was therefore suspected and appendectomy was performed. Ascitic fluid culture was sent to the Microbiology Laboratory in suitable means of transport. The sample was processed with the classic method by sowing on culture-enriched media, searching for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was isolated after 24 hours of incubation in CO <sub>2 </sub> . The organism was identified as _S. pneumoniae_ 99.9% with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (bioMérieux Clinical Diagnostics). An antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using E-test method and interpreted using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines 2017 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The organism was susceptible to antibiotics tested with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of benzylpenicillin 0.01 μg/ml, ampicillin 0.02 μg/ml, linezolid 1 μg/ml, ceftriaxone 0.01 μg/ml, meropenem 0.50 μg/ml, levofloxacin 0.5 μg/ml, clindamycin 0.02 μg/ml, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 0.5 μg/ml, and vancomycin 0.1 μg/ml while blood cultures were negative. Our patient’s postoperative course was unremarkable and the antibiotic therapy was stopped after 4 days. She was discharged on the fifth postoperative day asymptomatic with a good performance status. In order to understand the source of this rare form of peritonitis we performed an evaluation of serum oncological markers and immunological status (procalcitonin, interleukin 5, interleukin 10), which were all negative. We also tested markers for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) that gave negative results. A chest CT scan was also performed without any evidence of an active source of infection. Furthermore, histological examination of her appendix did not show signs of appendicitis but revealed a form of peritonitis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 2 and 3 )</u>. A 30-day follow-up was performed. At day 10 an evaluation of our patient’s immunological status was performed and the results were negative; at day 20 a chest CT was done and results were negative for any source of infection.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Computed tomography scan image.

While pneumococcal peritonitis in children has been recognized for almost 100 years, our review shows, according with the findings of Dugi _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>, that primary pneumococcal peritonitis without pre-existing peritoneal disease is uncommon in healthy adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 \\]</u>. Without predisposing conditions, the virulence of some pneumococcus serotypes may contribute to the onset of this rare infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 44 , 54 \\]</u>. The physiopathology of primary pneumococcal peritonitis remains controversial. Pneumococci may gain entry to the peritoneal cavity via the genital tract, the gastrointestinal tract, or by hematogenous spread from the respiratory tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 57 \\]</u>. Hemsley and Eykyn 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 40 \\]</u> reported an increased prevalence in female adults, with the genital tract being the most common source of pneumococcus. In fact, occasionally, vaginal commensals can presumably cause ascending infection also without predisposing factors such as the presence of an IUD or history of recent delivery. However, all the cases reported in their paper have evidence of a presumptive sepsis focus and therefore are not definable as PP.\n\n【26】**Table 1 Review of the literature**\n\n【27】Full size table\n\n【28】Of interest, a peculiarity of this condition is the absence of mixed organisms. In fact, no case reported an association of multiple infective agents.\n\n【29】There is no definite clinical pattern or features which might help in the diagnosis. Usually the clinical picture closely resembles that of appendicitis or secondary peritonitis with or without sepsis which, in most cases, is the presumptive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 58 , 59 , 60 \\]</u>.\n\n【30】Management of this condition is strictly linked to the diagnosis. While PP can be suspected in patients with comorbidities in the presence of a negative radiologic investigation, it is hardly recognizable in young and immunocompetent patients with no risk factors, like in our case. This confirms the fact that, based on an erroneous diagnosis, most of these patients are operated on despite negative results from imaging.\n\n【31】The best diagnostic algorithm is, in our opinion, Westwood and Roberts’ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 63 \\]</u>. Antibiotic therapy remains the first step in treatment of PP in patients with active comorbidities. The real clinical challenge arises with young, healthy, and immunocompetent patients. How can we suspect PP in those cases? In our opinion, with a negative CT scan, antibiotic therapy seems to be the first approach for 36–48 hours, despite several studies underlining that there seems to be little consensus regarding the antibiotic treatment for pneumococcal peritonitis and only little information has been published about the antibiotic regimens chosen for the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 65 \\]</u>. For patients infected by penicillin-susceptible organisms, penicillin remains the preferred treatment, while in areas where the prevalence of resistant pneumococci is high, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is the empirical therapy of choice, as antibiotic-resistant strains of _S. pneumoniae_ have been identified worldwide, and the prevalence of these resistant strains is as high as 57% in some countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 61 , 64 \\]</u>. In _non-responders_ and in patients with sepsis, exploratory laparotomy is a well-accepted treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 65 , 66 \\]</u>. The laparoscopic approach is pivotal, related to its low invasiveness and high diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, with peritoneal lavage or drainage being the diagnostic tool of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 67 \\]</u>. It remains unclear, however, whether surgical exploration and lavage of the abdominal cavity with or without appendectomy is beneficial or detrimental for patients with primary pneumococcal peritonitis. One could assume that removal of infectious ascites and reduction of intra-abdominal bacterial load would support the healing process, while, in patients with cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, surgery does not improve the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 68 \\]</u>. Laparotomy with abdominal debridement and visceral resection is a rare choice selected for advanced cases with complex peritoneal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 69 , 70 \\]</u>. Based on all these findings it can be assumed that the management of pneumococcal peritonitis involves timely surgical intervention and treatment with antibiotics.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】Primary pneumococcal peritonitis without pre-existing peritoneal disease is rare and represents a cultural and clinical challenge, especially for surgeons, because of its subtle and non-specific clinical findings. The interest in our case lays in the rare diagnosis of PP mimicking acute appendicitis in a healthy woman, without history of recent acute pneumonia or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the isolation of pneumococcus in its capsulated form. This case report reinforces the need for an appropriate clinical algorithm in those patients without medical history and active comorbidities when the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is not clear at the time of operation, especially for female patients. No direct diagnosis is possible. The treatment of choice is the fast initiation of antibiotic therapy. Although surgical therapy is generally not required for the treatment of primary pneumococcal peritonitis, it may be necessary to exclude secondary peritonitis or in non-responders.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CRP:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>C-reactive protein</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EUCAST:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HCV:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatitis C virus</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>IUD:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intrauterine device</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MALDI-TOF:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MICs:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Minimum inhibitory concentrations</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PID:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pelvic inflammatory disease</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PP:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Primary peritonitis</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cells</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Acquired von Willebrand disease associated with autoimmune disease in addition to pulmonary hypertension during emergency room presentation is a rare condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case reported in the literature treated with success; the first one was reported in 1987.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 28-year-old mestizo man with a 3-year history of inflammatory arthritis was admitted to our hospital. An overlap of rheumatoid arthritis with systemic lupus erythematosus was suspected; therefore methotrexate was initiated, and later changed to leflunomide because of liver toxicity. Prothrombin time, international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin times were normal (11/10.4 seconds; 1.2; 31.1/26.9 seconds, respectively), von Willebrand factor activity was observed with low ristocetin cofactor at 33.6UI/dL, high von Willebrand factor antigen >200UI/dL, and a low von Willebrand factor: ristocetin cofactor to von Willebrand factor antigen ratio. He was admitted to the emergency room with a 24-hour evolution of progressive dyspnea, cough, thoracic pain, and palpitations, 104 beats/min, 60/40 mmHg, temperature of 38°C, pulse oximetric saturation 88% and 30 breaths/minute. Cold, pale and mottled skin was also observed. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit. The placement of a pulmonary artery catheter was made. The initial patterns showed a precapillary pulmonary hypertension; acute pulmonary embolism was the first choice for diagnosis. Pulmonary angiography was conducted, and when no clot was discovered, pulmonary artery hypertension associated with connective tissue disease was considered. Serum protein electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a massive polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and no paraproteinemia or monoclonal cell population was found from the electrophoretic pattern of the patient’s plasma. Hypergammaglobulinemia was the cause of hyperviscosity syndrome associated with autoantibodies. Three sessions of plasma exchange therapy were made, and clinical improvement was observed. He was then discharged from the intensive care unit and hospital, respectively. He is now attended by an external consult and has no respiratory symptomatology.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Hyperviscosity syndrome with pulmonary arterial hypertension presentation in a patient with acquired von Willebrand disease in an autoimmune context is a rare condition that can be treated successfully with plasmapheresis and critical care support.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Acquired von Willebrand disease (aVWD) is initiated by autoantibodies and hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) caused by a massive polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. AVWD associated with autoimmune disease in addition to pulmonary hypertension during emergency room (ER) presentation is a rare condition. Plasma cell neoplasm is the most common cause of HVS, mainly Waldenström macroglobulinemia and multiple myeloma, diseases characterized by a monoclonal paraprotein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Three mechanisms for aVWD have been proposed: a) aggregation of immunoglobulins (Igs) dependent upon the factor region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, b) interaction between IgM rheumatoid factor and intermediate complexes formed by IgG aggregates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and c) IgG intermediate complexes alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Viscosity refers to resistance to flow, or stickiness, and is measured by the time required for a serum or plasma sample to flow through a capillary tube (Ostwald tube) under the influence of gravity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia, and human immunodeficiency virus infection are rarely associated with HVS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】According to the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis registry, autoimmune disorders are the cause of aVWD in only 2% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. RA diagnosis and the presence of antinuclear antibodies could be an epiphenomenon, which has been previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. However, the pathophysiology of aVWD is heterogeneous, and in most cases there is an increased clearance, inhibition or proteolysis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the plasma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The first two mechanisms had been reported in SLE due to circulating IgG antibodies directed against either nonfunctional or functional domains of VWF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】In addition, it has been reported that during pulmonary hypertension, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels are high, suggesting a loss of fibrinolytic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, however, PAI-1 was not determinate in our patient. The hemodynamic pattern has also been described by Condliffe _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> who studied patients with connective tissue diseases and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as well as 28 patients with isolated SLE and PAH. Murata _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> reported a case of PAH with Raynaud phenomenon and relative polycythemia where the right cardiac catheterization showed PAH with pulmonary artery pressures of 93/39mmHg (mean pressure 60mmHg), cardiac index of 2.2L/minute/m <sup>2 </sup> , and a pulmonary vascular resistance index of 1219dyne·second/(cm <sup>5 </sup> ·m <sup>2 </sup> ). Patients with SLE and PAH not related with an incidence of hyperviscosity were found to have 1-year and 3-year survival rates of 78% and 74%, respectively, and patients with RA had 1-year and 3-year survival rates of 83% and 63%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Here, we present a rare association of aVWD, PAH and RA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case reported in the literature treated with success. The first one was reported by Eaton and colleagues in 1987 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>; they treated a patient with RA, serum hyperviscosity and secondary pulmonary hypertension, with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 53mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance of 707dyne·second/cm <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】A 28-year-old mestizo man with a 3-year history of inflammatory arthritis and dry mouth and eyes was admitted to our hospital. He was admitted to our hospital at the request of an external consultant in January 2008; the initial laboratory evaluation is listed in Table 1 . Methotrexate was initiated with good response; 1 year later methotrexate was changed to leflunomide because of liver toxicity. Globulin levels at admission and 1 year after were 5.2 and 7.2g/dL, respectively. Of interest, although he also had positive anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and anti-nucleosomes antibodies, which normally have a higher specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, at admission we could not make a diagnosis because of the absence of clinical manifestations other than arthritis and sicca.\n\n【14】**Table 1 **Laboratory data at hospital: external consultant admission****\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】Hyperemia and mild eye pain appeared in March 2009, and a diffuse scleritis was diagnosed. Therefore leflunomide was suspended and he received prednisone (1mg/kg), tapered to 5mg/day in 1 month and suspended after another month because a mouth ulcer appeared.\n\n【17】Multiple important mucosal bleeding episodes (epistaxis and gingival hemorrhage) started in 2009, and coagulation tests were conducted through 2010, with the following results: prothrombin time, international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin times were normal (11/10.4 seconds; 1.2; 31.1/26.9 seconds, respectively), VWF activity was observed with low ristocetin cofactor (RCo) at 33.6UI/dL, high VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) >200UI/dL, and a low VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag ratio. Furthermore, an Ivy bleeding time test of more than 15 minutes and normal factor VIII activity (70UI/dL) were observed. An _in vitro_ test showed that the patient’s IgG inhibited the VWF:RCo of normal plasma, therefore the RCo activity inhibition test was positive, although this was not necessary for the diagnosis. A characteristic aVWD laboratory test with the identification of a causal underlying disease, integrated the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【18】The patient was admitted to the ER in April 2011 with a 24-hour evolution of progressive dyspnea, cough, thoracic pain, and palpitations, 104beats/minute, 60/40mmHg, temperature of 38°C, pulse oximetric saturation 88% and 30 breaths/minute. Cold, pale and mottled skin was also observed; laboratory values at ER admission are listed in Table 2 . There were no signs of arthritis or bleeding. Initial crystalloid reanimation was made with partial response, and persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen = 245.7) precluded a rapid intubation sequence. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) 12 hours later. Initial laboratory ER patient data are listed in Table 2 ; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment values at ICU admission were 11 and 27 points respectively.\n\n【19】**Table 2 **Laboratory data at emergency room admission****\n\n【20】Full size table\n\n【21】An electrocardiogram showed an incomplete right bundle block not previously detected.

The placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) was made under the indication of a differentiation between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic shock 通用删除1(英):<u>(see Table 3 )</u>. The initial patterns showed a precapillary pulmonary hypertension; therefore, in the autoimmune context of the patient, although serial negative antiphospholipid antibodies were noted in his history, acute pulmonary embolism was the first choice for diagnosis. Pulmonary angiography was conducted, and when no clot was discovered, PAH associated with connective tissue disease was considered because pulmonary hypertension has been historically associated with connective tissue diseases.\n\n【22】**Table 3 **Pulmonary artery catheter patterns****\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】These PAC parameters were the same as observed by Condliffe _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> and Murata _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u> except for the pulmonary vascular resistance index, which was greater in our patient in comparison to the Condliffe _et al_ . cases (715 versus 1525 dyne·second/(cm <sup>5 </sup> ·m <sup>2 </sup> )). Because connective tissue disease may cause PAH because of the vasculature pathology, the difference in more severe resistance may be explained by the changes in the rheological properties (1 poise (P) = 1g·(second·cm) <sup>-1 </sup> \\= 1dyne·second/cm <sup>2 </sup> ) present in the HVS, where a decrease in the blood flow can explain the resistance increase. Laboratory blood samples hinted about the thickness of blood, so viscosity was measured and found to be 65.8cP (<1.9cP).\n\n【25】Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly were ruled out. A bone marrow biopsy did not show clonality of plasma cells. Serum protein electrophoresis confirmed the presence of a massive polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and no paraproteinemia or monoclonal cell population was found from the electrophoretic pattern of the patient’s plasma. Hypergammaglobulinemia was the cause of HVS associated with autoantibodies. Three sessions of plasma exchange therapy were made. Albumin and frozen fresh plasma were used as the expander, and one circulating blood volume was utilized. Significant mental, hemodynamic recovery and clinical outcomes became evident. A negative Q value was observed in the HVS in this patient after taking into account the Starling vascular permeability formula, where the microvasculature is influenced by protein content and transcapillary fluid flux, specifically, where Q is equal to volume of flow across the capillary wall. This finding led to the conclusion that dilution of protein content may alleviate the HVS, and the fluid administration was considered supportive therapy with judicious consideration of the compartment shift of the solutions. His renal function returned to basal state and he was extubated on day 7 of ICU admission. He was then discharged from the ICU and hospital, respectively with good prognosis (Charlson comorbidity index of 0 points).\n\n【26】The patient now attends external consult without respiratory symptoms. One month after hospital discharge his arthritis returned and methotrexate was resumed with good clinical response. Hydroxychloroquine with steroids were initiated because of persistent elevated anti-double stranded DNA (last value at February 2013, 20.2U/mL), no bleeding sign had been present with persistent positive VWF:Ag values.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【28】HVS with PAH presentation in a patient with aVWD in an autoimmune context is a rare condition that can be treated successfully with plasmapheresis and critical care support.\n\n【29】Consent\n-------\n\n【30】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.

It plays an indispensable role in a number of neurological disorders, including trigeminal neuralgia (TN).\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We report a unique case of a 58-year-old Han female patient with TN caused by PTA associated with craniosynostosis. Preoperative three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D-TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) and 3D constructive inference in steady state (3D-CISS) imaging showed that the PTA run though Meckel’s cave.

For patients deemed suitable for percutaneous balloon compression, PTA should be ruled out. Preoperative 3D-TOF and 3D-CISS MR imaging were essential to identify PTA neurovascular conflicts.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) is the most common abnormal arterial anastomosis between the basilar artery (BA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>, and usually originates from the cavernous segment of the ICA. The incidence of PTA has been reported to be < 1%, and the reported incidence of PTA as culprit vessel of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is 0.2–0.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Craniosynostosis is a rare skull malformation that is caused by premature closure of cranial sutures, with an incidence of 1:2000–2500 among newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Surgery on such patients is extremely difficult given cerebellopontine angle cistern crowding. We report here the first case of TN caused by compression of the PTA associated with craniosynostosis. Our aim is to share our experience in treating TN caused by PTA.\n\n【10】This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Approval Number IIT-2021-378) and has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. Details that might disclose the ID of the patient were omitted. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 58-year-old Han woman presented to our department in November 2020 complaining of typical TN of the second and third branches of the nerve in the right side of the face for the past 20 years. The pain started during physical activities. She took carbamazepine and had gradually increased the dose to 1200 mg per day, but severe pain remained and the high doses caused severe side effects. TN had been diagnosed 12 years previously at another hospital, where microvascular decompression (MVD) was carried out but failed to exposed the trigeminal nerve. Neurological examinations showed no other abnormalities of the cranial nerve. Three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D-TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) and three-dimensional constructive inference in steady state (3D-CISS) imaging showed obvious neurovascular conflicts (NVCs) due to PTA and the trigeminal nerve and that the PTA originated from the junction of the C3 and C4 segments of the ICA and went up around inner margin of Meckel’s cave, eventually to terminate into the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA) which anastomosed with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Following multidisciplinary consultation, we determined that the patient had a narrow head and made a diagnosis of scaphocephaly 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】PTA originated from the junction of the C3 and C4 segments of the ICA and went up around the inner margin of Meckel’s cave, eventually terminating into the right SCA which anastomosed with the AICA. _PTA_ Persistent trigeminal artery, _ICA_ internal carotid artery, _SCA_ superior cerebellar artery, _AICA_ anterior inferior cerebellar artery\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Three-dimensional reconstruction of the patient’s skull shows a narrow skull.

The SCA, which is the terminal branch of PTA, compressed the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve, and the AICA compressed the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone (REZ). Teflon patches were inserted between the trigeminal nerve and vessels deemed to be responsible for the pain, to achieve complete decompression and release of all culprit vessels 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. The patient achieved full pain relief after MVD, without facial numbness and other complications. No recurrence was recorded at the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【20】**Fig. 3**\n\n【21】The SCA, which is the terminal branch of the PTA, compresses the trigeminal nerve at Meckel’s cave, and the AICA compresses the ventral lateral and head lateral nerves. _V_ Trigeminal nerve, _VII_ facial nerve, _VIII_ vestibulocochlear nerve; all other abbreviations as defined in Fig. 1 caption\n\n【22】Full size image\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】In our case, TN was caused by compression of the PTA, which is an abnormal arterial anastomosis between the ICA and BA. As PTA originates from the ICA, it usually runs medially to the first branch of the trigeminal nerve and extradurally beneath the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, following which it passes the petroclinoidal ligament or perforates the dura around the clivus to join the BA. Only rarely does the PTA enter the posterior cranial fossa, either from Meckel’s cave or from the dural foramen, and cause cerebellum vascularization with no anastomoses with the BA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. We suspect the coexistence of craniosynostosis and PTA may complicate the anatomical relationship and increase the possibility of NVCs.\n\n【25】### PTA and TN\n\n【26】During the developmental stage of a 4-mm embryo, the ICA supplies the longitudinal neural arteries via the trigeminal artery, optic artery, hypoglossal artery and proatlantal intersegmental artery. In subsequent developmental stages the arteries normally regress and disappear, but if there is incomplete regression or the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery does not develop properly, a persisting anastomosis, such as PTA, may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Both the REZ and cisternal part of the nerve are reported to be the responsible sites of TN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Chidambaranathan et al. reported that PTA originated from the posterolateral margin of the posterior bend of the cavernous segment of the ICA, ran posterolaterally and inferiorly around the dorsum sellae and communicated with the BA in the prepontine cistern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. They also reported that the PTA compressed and distorted the REZ of the trigeminal nerve laterally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our case, the PTA ran across Meckel’s cave and compressed the cisternal segment of the nerve caudally. de Bondt et al. found that PTA played a vital important role in TN, reporting that the incidence of PTA among patients with TN was 2.2%, which was much higher than that found in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Owing to its abnormal blood pattern, the PTA could be large and potentially tortuous compared to the SCA, which is the most common culprit vessel of TN. Compression of the PTA could lead to chronic compression and microtrauma, resulting in hyperactivity of the nerve and ultimately to TN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Some studies found that branches of the PTA can also be culprit vessels of TN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. PTA-related aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u> have also been reported to negatively affect the trigeminal nerve.\n\n【28】Hemorrhage has been reported to be a severe complication in percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Also, PBC might injure the PTA in the Meckel’s cave, the balloon catheter could puncture the PTA and/or shearing compression could tear PTA during the formation of “pear head”. Consequently, preoperative 3D-TOF and 3D-CISS MR imaging are essential to identify the PTA to rule out PBC for the patients.\n\n【29】### Craniosynostosis and TN\n\n【30】Exposure of the trigeminal nerve, especially the REZ of the nerve, is largely confined to patients with narrow posterior cranial fossa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. However, in our patient, we exposed the trigeminal nerve and achieved complete decompression of the nerve, freeing the patient from pain without any complications. The methods we used included full exposure of the margin of the retrosigmoid and transverse sinus and dynamic retraction of the cerebellum using suction and bipolar. Elevation of the head of the bed and mannitol can be used to decrease intracranial pressure and ease the effects of the operation.\n\n【31】The CT imaging of our patient indicated that the osteoclasia around the foramen oval on the right side does not form a complete bony boundary, thus greatly increasing the possibility of ICA injury during PBC. The incomplete bone boundary might attribute to craniosynostosis.\n\n【32】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【33】We report the first case of TN caused by PTA associated with craniosynostosis. MVD was a feasible option for complex TN combined with other abnormalities. For patients awaiting PBC, PTA should be ruled out. Preoperative 3D-TOF and 3D-CISS MR image were essential to identify PTA NVCs.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data of the patient are recorded in the manuscript in detail.

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease. More than 120 mutations have been reported in the transthyretin gene with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity and geographic diversity. Among them, a sporadic case of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiac-predominant phenotype is very rare, progressive, and potentially fatal if left undiagnosed. However, a clinical diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis still remains challenging due to non-specific symptoms, and less sensitivity and specificity of medical examinations.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 60-year-old Japanese man with a history of embolic stroke and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy visited our department for heart failure. The present case exhibited only cardiomyopathy without any clinical signs of systemic amyloidosis manifested as carpal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy, or autonomic dysfunction. An echocardiogram revealed severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, biatrial dilatation, pericardial effusion, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% with severe diastolic dysfunction. Technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy indicated marked diffuse myocardial uptake of technetium pyrophosphate, strongly suggesting transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, which was firmly confirmed by a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Genetic analysis demonstrated a transthyretin C70T (Pro24Ser) heterozygous mutation. Tafamidis, a transthyretin stabilizer, was started. His cardiac symptoms remained unchanged for 12 months.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Here we report the case of a patient with hereditary cardiac amyloidosis associated with a Pro24Ser mutation in transthyretin, which is the first case reported in Japan. Technetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy was extremely useful for definitive diagnosis. Thus, we propose that the nuclear imaging technique should be taken into account even for an exploratory diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a systemic disorder caused by extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in peripheral and autonomic nerves, heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. A TTR gene product is one of the components of amyloid, which is a plasma protein predominantly produced in the liver, acting as a transporter of thyroxine and retinol-binding protein. Hereditary amyloid TTR (ATTR) amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant disease in which gene mutations lead to changes in the protein TTR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】More than 120 mutations have been reported in the _TTR_ gene with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity and geographic diversity. A substitution of 30th valine by methionine (Val30Met) is the most common genetic variant found in endemic areas in Portugal, Sweden, and Japan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The Val30Met variant induces progressive neurological symptoms, such as axonal sensory autonomic and motor neuropathy, whereas other mutations (Val122Ile, Thr60Ala, Leu111Met, and Ile68Leu) predominantly show infiltrative cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】A sporadic case of hereditary ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is very rare, progressive, and potentially fatal if left undiagnosed; thus, early diagnosis is critical. However, the clinical diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis remains challenging because neurological symptoms are less recognized in a sporadic case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Therefore, development of an appropriate strategy to reach correct diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis has been long overdue.\n\n【12】Here we report the case of a patient with cardiac amyloidosis associated with a single mutation in TTR, which is the first case in Japan. In addition, we propose a new diagnostic strategy of cardiac amyloidosis, which may contribute to establishing an early and differential diagnosis of this rare cardiac disease.\n\n【13】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【14】A 60-year-old Japanese man visited our department for heart failure. He did not smoke tobacco; he had two histories of cardioembolic cerebral infarction at ages 47 and 59. Also, he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at age 58, but had no coronary risk factors including hypertension. His blood pressure was 107/72 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute. He had a grade 2/6 systolic murmur and mild pretibial edema. Carpal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction were unremarkable. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with QS waves in inferior leads, and with low QRS voltages in leads V1 to V4 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a)</u>. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b)</u>. An echocardiogram demonstrated severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; the interventricular septum and the posterior wall were 13 mm and 16 mm, respectively), biatrial dilatation, pericardial effusion, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. Increased right ventricular wall thickness was also seen. There was grade III diastolic dysfunction 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. The unexplained LVH led us to suspect cardiac amyloidosis. Technetium pyrophosphate ( <sup>99m </sup> Tc-PYP) scintigraphy indicated marked diffuse myocardial uptake of <sup>99m </sup> Tc-PYP 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a)</u>, which strongly suggested TTR cardiac amyloidosis. In addition, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed wide-spreading transmural late gadolinium enhancement at the ventricular and atrial walls, also supporting this notion 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 b)</u>. A left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy confirmed TTR-related amyloid deposits 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated a TTR C70T (Pro24Ser) heterozygous mutation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 a)</u>. Therefore, we assume that the Pro24Ser mutation is responsible for cardiac amyloidosis. Further genotyping of TTR of the family members of our patient revealed that his third son has the identical mutation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 b)</u>, while he showed no clinical signs. Our patient was ineligible for heart transplantation due to his age (over 60) and renal dysfunction; thus, a combined usage of diuretics and tafamidis, a TTR stabilizer, was administered. His cardiac symptoms remained unchanged for 12 months.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】**a** A 12-lead electrocardiogram. **b** Chest X-ray\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Transthoracic echocardiography in apical four chamber ( **a** , _left panel_ ) and short axis view ( _right_ ).

Also, we demonstrated that nuclear imaging is effectively useful for definitive diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【32】A rare case of hereditary amyloidosis associated with the TTR mutation (Pro24Ser) has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. All siblings of the single family had similar, late-onset symptoms of systemic amyloidosis manifested as carpal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and cardiomyopathy. Note that these phenotypes were located at both the nervous system and cardiac muscle. On the other hand, the patient described in this report exhibited an isolated cardiac-predominant phenotype despite having the same mutation. In general, mutations that cause genetic disease strongly correlate with many aspects of phenotype, including onset, location, and the degree of progression. It has been reported, however, that there are several cases exhibiting inconsistency in terms of genotype-phenotype correlation. For instance, TTR Val30Met yields a variety of phenotypes including age of onset, severity, genetic penetrance, and regional specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In Japan and Portugal, the TTR Val30Met mutation is frequently found in endemic familial history, presenting neurological-predominant phenotypes that begin at an early age. In contrast, the mutation found in Sweden is rather sporadic, and is associated with late onset and cardiac-predominant phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. This heterogeneity may be explained by several possibilities, such as epigenetic configuration around _TTR_ gene, additional mutation in another gene not yet identified, or transcriptional regulation mediated by non-coding RNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】A definitive diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is significantly difficult because LVH is a common symptom in hypertension, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This case had been considered to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy because of asymmetric hypertrophy. He had several episodes of cardioembolic infarction despite normal sinus rhythm, followed by heart failure. Intrinsic atrial dysfunction induced by amyloid deposition to the heart muscle may result in atrial thrombi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. These clinical signs may provide a critical clue to early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Therefore, cardiac amyloidosis should be taken into account when LVH is accompanied by embolic stroke or heart failure.\n\n【34】Infiltration of the heart by amyloidogenic proteins induces several types of cardiac amyloidosis, including amyloid immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. Limited specificity in diagnostic techniques and poor sensitivity of noncardiac biopsy or abdominal fat aspiration may result in delayed diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Recently, a nuclear imaging technique employing <sup>99m </sup> Tc-PYP has been described as a reliable diagnostic tool for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, which is distinguished from AL amyloidosis with high specificity, and cardiac TTR deposition can be detected at an early asymptomatic stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 , 14 \\]</u>. In fact, we demonstrated in this report that cardiac radioisotope examination was very effective in the diagnosis of hereditary ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. This is the first case of hereditary cardiac amyloidosis associated with a TTR mutation (Pro24Ser) in Japan. We propose that an exploratory diagnosis utilizing nuclear imaging is highly reliable to identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【36】We report a case of isolated cardiac amyloidosis associated with a Pro24Ser mutation in TTR, which is the first case reported in Japan. We demonstrated that <sup>99m </sup> Tc-PYP scintigraphy is extremely useful for definitive diagnosis of this rare disease.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用删除4(英):<u><sup>99m </sup></u> Tc-PYP:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Technetium pyrophosphate</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AL:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Amyloid immunoglobulin light-chain</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ATTR:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Amyloid transthyretin</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LVH:</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Left ventricular hypertrophy</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TTR:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transthyretin</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Few of them are associated with adverse obstetric outcome (Reyes-Muñoz _et al._ in Diagnostics. 2019;9:4. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics9040149 ). Genital outflow tract obstructive uterine anomalies invariably present in the adolescent age group.\n\n【3】### Case details\n\n【4】We report a case series of uterine anomalies. Ten such cases presented like a “cluster” within a short span of just one month. Eight of these ten cases were diagnosed intraoperatively during cesarean section. One case was diagnosed during laparoscopic sterilization, and the other case was diagnosed before doing manual vacuum aspiration. There were four cases of bicornuate uterus, two cases each of unicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys, and one case each of septate uterus and arcuate uterus. All eight babies were healthy and without any obvious congenital anomalies. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, literature regarding these anomalies has been mentioned mostly as case reports (Bruand _et al._ in Cureus. 2020;12:3. https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7191 ) and a few case series (Ross _et al._ in BMJ Case Rep. 2018. https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2017-221815 ). All women were of Kannadiga ethnicity and in the age range of 19–35 years. They were from places nearby to our institute within a range of approximately 250 km.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】We describe herein almost all types of uterine anomalies. These rare uterine anomalies presented in a short span of just four weeks like a “cluster”. This incidental finding is unusual. We need to design studies to understand the reasons for clustering of such cases in our clinical practice.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Uterine malformations are as result of agenesis, hypoplasia, abnormal fusion, or resorption of Müllerian ducts. The causes of uterine malformations are multifactorial. Some of them are ionizing radiations, viral infections, drug induced and genetic mutation involving _BCL2_ gene. The incidence of Müllerian anomaly is 0.2%–3.8% in fertile women and 3.5%–6.3% in infertile women. In one study, it was 4.4%, with septate uterus leading the anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Women with uterine malformations who are asymptomatic and are not operated remain undiagnosed. Some of the anomalies in these women may be diagnosed during imaging, Lower segment cesarean section (LSCS), laparotomy, or laparoscopy, as in our last case 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Müllerian duct anomalies are classified according to the 1988 American Fertility Society classification. We mention here the number of cases in our series in each category of the classification.\n\n【10】**Table 1 Clinical data and management of index cases**\n\n【11】Full size table\n\n【12】The number of cases in each group is as follows. Class I: agenesis/hypoplasia (nil); class II: unicornuate (two cases); class III: didelphys (two cases); class IV: bicornuate (four cases); class V: septate (one case); class VI: arcuate (one case); class VII: drug induced (nil).\n\n【13】As per our thorough literature search, most of these anomalies have been reported as isolated case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, while case series mention a very small number of cases with anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Our series of ten cases presenting in a span of just one  month is like a “cluster”. In this cluster, we were able to identify almost all the uterine malformations. Eight out of the ten cases were diagnosed intraoperatively during LSCS/laparoscopy. In epidemiology, a cluster is defined as an aggregation of cases of a disease or a health-related condition, such as a cancer or birth defect, closely grouped in time and place. Here, we could not find any geographic or demographic similarities among this cluster of women with uterine malformations. We therefore call it a cluster, although it does not fit the exact definition. Yet in our practice, we see clustering of similar types of cases especially in the labor room, which cannot be explained by anything but chance occurrence. But, by attributing it to chance occurrence, are we missing something that needs to be understood or discovered? Appropriate studies need to be planned and carried out to determine the cause of such occurrence of events in clusters, which at present appear to be just due to chance.\n\n【14】Case details\n------------\n\n【15】A total of ten cases admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology during November and December 2020 in a tertiary care hospital in South India had various uterine malformations. For all these cases written informed consent for the specific intervention of surgery and anesthesia was taken. Consent for photographing/recording of events and for publications (if done) was also taken, and patients consented to the same. Institutional review board approval of the Medical Research Unit of our institute (Karnataka Institute Of Medical Sciences Hubballi) was taken. Eight cases admitted near term underwent LSCS . One case with 9 weeks of gestation underwent manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). One case was admitted for laparoscopic sterilization. The demographic and clinical data are presented in Table 1 . All women were of Kannadiga ethnicity and in the age range of 19–35 years. They were from places nearby to our institute within a range of approximately 250 km.\n\n【16】The mean age was 24.7 years (median 23.5 years, range 19–35 years). Eight cases presented in the third trimester. One case presented at 9 weeks for MVA, and another case was admitted for laparoscopic sterilization. Median gestational age was 38 weeks, ranging from 9 to 40 weeks. Four of these cases had history of spontaneous abortion in first trimester. There is no history of interventions for uterine anomaly correction before pregnancy in any of these cases. None of these cases had past history of known uterine anomalies (they were undiagnosed/ or intraoperative history not available). None had any past history of diabetes, hypertension, endocrine disorders, or Anti Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLA) syndrome. One of the women had undergone cardiac surgery in the past. Family history of any other congenital anomalies was absent. There was no other significant family history. Menstrual history was regular and uneventful in all cases. The indications for LSCS in these cases were antepartum eclampsia, breech presentation, previous LSCS with threatened scar rupture, fetal growth retardation, oligohydramnios, cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), footling presentation, and preterm breech as shown in the table.\n\n【17】Antenatal diagnosis of uterine malformation by USG was available in only two cases. One case showed single live intrauterine gestation (SLIUG) of 7 weeks + 6 days with bicornuate uterus 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 , case 6)</u> while another case 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 , case 3)</u> showed SLIUG of 9 weeks with uterine didelphys. Per vaginal examination findings of bicornuate uterus (case 6) were appreciated only after first trimester ultrasonography diagnoses was available. The rest of the cases were diagnosed intraoperatively during LSCS (seven cases) and one during laparoscopic sterilization. The significant antenatal details of all the cases is summarized in the table. Figures 1 and 2 show photographs of the cases. All these cases did not have any problems during their stay in the hospital. Eight cases who delivered had healthy babies without any obvious congenital anomalies.\n\n【18】**Fig. 1**\n\n【19】**a** USG image of uterine didelphys (USG image) and **b** longitudinal vaginal septum (on per speculum examination) in the same patient; **c** intraoperative image of uterine didelphys; **d** intraoperative image of unicornuate uterus\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 2**\n\n【22】Intraoperative images of **a** unicornuate, **b** bicornuate, **c** bicornuate, and **d** arcuate uterus\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】Müllerian ducts are the primordial anlage of the female reproductive tract that differentiates to form the fallopian tubes, body of uterus, cervix, and the upper part of vagina. Müllerian duct anomalies may lead to adverse obstetric outcome.\n\n【26】The mean age of presentation is typically in adolescence for girls with genital tract outflow obstructive anomalies. In contrast, the mean age of presentation in our series as obstetric cases is 24.7 years, which is comparable to studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, showing slightly higher age, which can be explained by the few who suffered poor obstetric history. Due to the close embryologic relationship between paramesonephric and mesonephric ducts, failure of development in both of them may result in the coexistence of congenital uterine and renal anomalies. Congenital ipsilateral renal agenesis was reported in literature in 16–38% of women with unicornuate uterus. None of our cases had associated renal congenital anomalies. USG helps early identification of uterine anomalies. One of the previous case series mentioned that four out of seven cases were diagnosed by USG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. In contrast, we had only two cases with USG diagnosis of uterine anomalies in the antenatal period. Intraoperative diagnosis during cesarean section was reported in three out of seven cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Similarly, in the present study, eight out of ten cases were diagnosed during caesarean section or laparoscopic sterilization. In our study, most of the cases were diagnosed intraoperatively and not antenatally could be explained due to difficulty or inability to diagnose antenatally.\n\n【27】As described in many studies, uterine anomalies result in adverse obstetric outcomes including early pregnancy loss, malpresentation, and preterm labor. These adverse effects are related to specific types of uterine anomalies. Among these adverse outcomes, malpresentation (predominantly breech presentation) are common and lead to cesarean delivery. It has been reported that rates of cesarean delivery are increased in cases of uterine anomalies. This finding is similar to our case series, in which 80% of cases were diagnosed intraoperatively during LSCS.\n\n【28】Such clinical presentation of uterine anomalies as a cluster and within a short period has not been described previously. Our case series included almost all uterine anomalies in a significant number, presented in a short span of time like a cluster at a single institute. This is an unusual occurrence. This might be a rare incidental finding worth mentioning as a rare cluster of uterine anomalies. We need to devise studies to study the cause of such clustering of cases that appear like chance occurrences.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】The present case series describes almost all types of uterine anomalies within a very short span of four weeks like a cluster (whereas it usually takes more time to accumulate such a number of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and most of them were diagnosed intraoperatively. Diagnosis of uterine malformations is usually missed, but they should be considered in cases of poor obstetric history or women presenting with infertility. Quite a number of times, we have found noninfectious events of a particular nature occurring repeatedly over a period of time in our clinical practice, which we attribute to chance occurrence. We need to identify such clustering and formulate studies to determine the reason for such events in our clinical practice. This would be useful if the events are life threatening or need prior preparation.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Supporting data in the source document and study file are available and can be provided if necessary.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome has been described in association with many autoimmune diseases, but its association with mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) is very rare. After an extensive review of the literature, we found only three cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in association with mixed connective tissue disorder. But unlike other cases, in our patient, PRES is the presenting manifestation of mixed connective tissue disorder which is first of its kind.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】We present a 30-year-old female from Southern India who had initially reported with complaints of fever, multiple episodes of vomiting and cough with expectoration. She had accelerated hypertension and moderate thrombocytopenia. Two days later, she developed sudden onset of visual disturbances and had a drop in sensorium. Neuroimaging done was suggestive of atypical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and autoimmune workup was positive for mixed connective tissue disorder. With prompt blood pressure control and anti-seizure medications, she recovered completely.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Early diagnosis and prompt control of blood pressure, along with anti-seizure measures, play a crucial role in management. Awareness about this rare association is essential for early diagnosis and treatment, and therefore reducing the risk of permanent neurologic deficits. This case is being reported because of its rarity.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is defined by a range of neurological symptoms of acute onset, focal vasogenic oedema on neuroimaging and reversibility of clinical and radiological findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Its causes are diverse, but common precipitants include acute elevations of blood pressure, renal decompensation, fluid retention, and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The symptoms of PRES evolve rapidly over hours to days. Early diagnosis and prompt control of blood pressure along with anti-seizure measures play a key role in the management and outcome of the case, by preventing further brain damage. PRES has been described in association with many autoimmune diseases, but its association with mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) is very rare. In this report, we describe a case of PRES in a young female who was subsequently diagnosed to have MCTD.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient was a 30-year-old female from Southern India who had initially reported to a local general practitioner with complaints of fever, multiple episodes of vomiting and cough with expectoration for 5 days. She was treated with oral antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 625 mg oral twice daily), but she continued to have fever spikes (mild to moderate grade with Tmax of 102.6℉). On admission and evaluation in a local hospital, she was diagnosed to have accelerated hypertension (200/110 mm of hg), moderate thrombocytopenia (60,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). While she was being managed with intravenous fluids and antihypertensive medications (labetalol 2 mg/min intravenous infusion), she developed sudden onset of visual disturbances and had a drop in sensorium. Computed Tomography scan brain revealed ill-defined areas of parenchymal oedema in left parieto-temporal lobe white matter, left ganglio-capsular and left hippocampal regions 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Computed Tomography (CT) scan.

All these features were suggestive of atypical PRES or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis.\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Brain with features suggestive of Atypical PRES\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】She was treated with anti-epileptics (levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily), antihypertensive medications (labetalol 100 mg twice daily oral) and glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously for 1 day). She was shifted to our hospital for further management. Her past medical history was notable for an aborted twin pregnancy and gestational hypertension about three years ago. She denied a history of any other co-morbidity. Her family history and psychosocial history was unremarkable. Physical examination was notable for pallor, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure (190/100). She was drowsy but arousable with Glasgow coma scale/score of 14/15 (E3V5M6) at the time of admission. Neurological examination was notable for bilateral extensor plantar response. Cranial nerves, motor, sensory and other deep tendon reflexes examination were normal. Baseline blood investigations were notable for anaemia (Haemoglobin—8.2 g/dl), moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count—51,000/mm <sup>3 </sup> ), and mild hypokalemia (serum K+—3.1 meq/l).\n\n【26】Blood and urine cultures were sent, and she was started on empirical antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 g twice-daily intravenous and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily), antihypertensives (labetalol 2 mg/min infusion followed by 100 mg twice daily oral) and anti-epileptics (levetiracetam 500 mg orally twice daily). Infective workup done was negative (Dengue, malarial parasite (quantitative buffy coat test), H1N1 polymerase chain reaction test and Scrub typhus IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test). Guarded lumbar puncture was done to rule out infective causes of encephalomyelitis after discussing with the neurologist and infectious diseases specialist. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) was non-contributory. (CSF was colourless, clear, no red blood cells or white blood cells were seen, Glucose was 64 mg/dl, protein was 41.1 mg/dl, GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, Herpes simplex virus 1 & 2 real time polymerase chain reaction test were negative and CSF culture did not show any significant growth). Blood and urine cultures did not show any significant growth. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome workup was negative. Antinuclear antibody by indirect immunofluorescence assay was positive (1:40 dilution, Intensity—4+, pattern nuclear coarse speckled). Anti-double-stranded DNA was negative, and extractable nuclear antigen antibodies profile was positive for Sm/RNP and negative for Sm. She was finally diagnosed to have posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with underlying mixed connective tissue disorder. She recovered completely with antihypertensives (T. Metoprolol XL 25 mg PO BD) and anti-epileptics (T. Levetiracetam 500 mg PO BD). Repeat platelet count done on Day 4 of admission was normal (2, 64,000 cells/mm <sup>3 </sup> ). She was discharged with a plan to continue antihypertensive medications (T. Metoprolol XL 25 mg oral twice daily). She was reviewed as an outpatient after 6 weeks, and she was doing well. Follow-up MRI of Brain done after six weeks as outpatient showed resolution of oedema 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u>. After discussing with patient and family in detail, our plan, in this case, was strict blood pressure control, watch out for MCTD manifestations by regular follow up.\n\n【27】**Fig. 5**\n\n【28】Follow-up MRI brain showing. Resolution of oedema\n\n【29】Full size image\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was first described by Hinchey and his colleagues as Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, in a series of 15 patients in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. PRES is characterised by neurological manifestations of acute onset headache, visual disturbances, seizures, altered sensorium; vasogenic oedema on neuroimaging mostly in the posterior regions and reversibility of clinical and imaging findings. Women are more commonly affected than men, even after excluding eclampsia as a cause. Our patient was a young female.\n\n【32】PRES most commonly presents as subcortical oedema in parieto-occipital areas. Other atypical regions that may be affected include deep gray nuclei, brainstem/cerebellar hemispheres, and exceptionally the spinal cord without cerebral hemispheric involvement. These findings may lead to a diagnostic dilemma, with a delay in diagnosis and reversal of the offending condition potentially leading to a poor patient outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In our patient, subcortical oedema was seen in the frontoparietal and parieto-temporal region, which is atypical of PRES.\n\n【33】PRES is associated with hypertension, renal failure and eclampsia, in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy and in patients with underlying autoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Though many autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, cryoglobulinemia have been described in association with PRES, its association with MCTD is very rare. Neurological involvement as such is rare in MCTD as compared with other system involvement. It more commonly manifests as trigeminal neuralgia, aseptic meningitis and headache. After an extensive review of the literature, we found only three case reports till now of this rare association, as described in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. All the cases reported till now are between 15 and 30 years of age.\n\n【34】**Table 1 Case reports of PRES with MCTD reported till now**\n\n【35】Full size table\n\n【36】Possible pathological mechanisms that could result in PRES with the background of MCTD include endothelial cell damage resulting from different autoantibodies in MCTD, vasculopathy and autonomic dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【37】Treatment for PRES is mainly aimed at blood pressure control, anti-seizure measures and other supportive measures. Blood pressure should be managed with easily titratable medications like intravenous labetalol, nitroprusside and nicardipine etc. The rapid decrease in blood pressure could cause cerebral ischemia, which is why a goal of mean blood pressure between 105 and 125 mmHg is suggested, without exceeding 25% of this reduction in the first hour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. As with other conditions, blood pressure fluctuations should be avoided, and the continuous administration of antihypertensive drugs under hemodynamic monitoring should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. In our patient, we managed her blood pressure with parenteral labetalol followed by oral medications and also with anti-epileptic mediations. PRES is the first presentation of MCTD in our patient, unlike the other reported cases till now.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】Cases of PRES have been increasingly reported off late. It has been described to be associated with various etiopathological factors, including autoimmune conditions, but its association with MCTD is very rare. Treatment depends mainly on the underlying pathology and outcome depends on early diagnosis and treating the underlying condition. Awareness about this rare association is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment, and therefore reducing the risk of permanent neurologic deficits. Autoimmune disorders like MCTD should be considered as one of the differential diagnosis in a young female presenting with accelerated hypertension and acute onset neurological symptoms suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MCTD:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mixed connective tissue disease</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PRES:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CSF:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cerebrospinal fluid</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Six months later, she developed gradually ascending numbness and weakness of both lower limbs. On examination, she had flaccid paraparesis (power 3/5) with a sensory level to pinprick at thoracic level 9. Joint position sense was preserved. Her cranial nerves and upper limbs were neurologically normal. Nerve conduction studies confirmed peripheral neuropathy with conduction slowing and a magnetic resonance imaging of her spine did not show cord or root compression.

It commonly presents with enlarged lymph nodes at one or more different sites. Castleman disease occurs in 11–30% of patients with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal band, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome which is considered to be a paraneoplastic manifestation of a lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Peripheral neuropathy is a common presenting feature and an essential criterion in the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, in approximately 5% of cases, patients present with a plasma cell dyscrasia such as Castleman disease prior to the development of neuropathy and other features of POEMS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】We report the case of a patient with Castleman disease who progressed to POEMS syndrome at which time she presented with a pseudosensory level.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 59-year-old Tamil woman with a 10-year history of adequately controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with a gradually enlarging painless lump in the right inguinal region over a period of 8 months. It was not associated with constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite.\n\n【13】On examination, the lump was consistent with an enlarged, non-tender, firm inguinal lymph node that was not attached to the underlying structures. She did not have any other palpable lymph nodes or organomegaly. She was not pale or icteric.\n\n【14】A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed mild hepatomegaly and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy in addition to inguinal lymphadenopathy. Her complete blood count, liver functions, renal functions, inflammatory markers, and coagulation screen were within normal limits. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were normal. An excisional biopsy of the enlarged lymph node showed evidence of Castleman disease of the plasma cell type with CD3 and Bcl-2 stained reactive pattern of follicles. She was treated with intravenously administered rituximab 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly for 4 weeks. There was reduction in the size of her inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n【15】Six months later, she developed gradually ascending numbness and weakness of her lower limbs. These symptoms progressed in a symmetrical manner without upper limb or sphincter involvement. An examination revealed flaccid paraparesis with a proximal power of grade 4/5 and distal power of grade 3/5 associated with diminished lower limb deep tendon reflexes. Plantar responses were bilaterally flexor. She had impaired pinprick sensation up to thoracic 9 (T9) level with intact joint position sense and normal anal sphincter tone. There were no obvious spinal deformities or tender areas along her spine. A neurological examination of her cranial nerves and upper limbs did not reveal any deficits.\n\n【16】A nerve conduction study of her lower limbs diagnosed a moderately severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy with conduction slowing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine with gadolinium enhancement did not show compression of nerve roots or the thecal sac.\n\n【17】A summary of our patient’s hematological and biochemical investigations are shown in Table 1 .\n\n【18】**Table 1 Summary of the hematological and biochemical investigations**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】Serum protein electrophoresis showed a faint monoclonal band in the fast gamma region without immunoparesis. However, urine protein electrophoresis was within normal limits. Immunofixation of the monoclonal band was not performed at the time due to unavailability. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed a hypercellular marrow with 30% plasma cells. A rectal biopsy showed normal rectal mucosa with focal ulceration. Congo red stain on the rectal biopsy did not reveal any amyloid deposits. A repeat contrast-enhanced CT scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed mild hepatomegaly, pericardial effusion, generalized subcutaneous tissue edema, multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, and multiple sclerotic bony lesions involving the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, sternum, anterior ribs, and sacrum. A repeat MRI of her thoracolumbar spine was performed with gadolinium enhancement which showed altered signal intensity in multiple cervical and lumbar vertebral bodies in both T1 and T2 MRI sequences without destruction or collapse.\n\n【21】Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome was established. She was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, in addition to lower limb physiotherapy. Each 21-day cycle consisted of intravenously administered cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> infusion on day 1 and intravenously administered dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1 to 4.\n\n【22】Following three cycles of treatment, she demonstrated a remarkable improvement in her neurological deficits with recovery of muscle power and sensation to near normal.\n\n【23】Discussion\n----------\n\n【24】We report the case of a patient with POEMS syndrome presenting with a sensory level. Loss of all modalities of sensation below one level on the trunk is pathognomonic of a lesion in the spinal cord. Rarely, lower motor neuron lesions affecting spinal nerves can present with a similar sensory loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. A sensory level associated with a lower motor neuron lesion is known as a pseudosensory level. POEMS syndrome is characterized by polyneuropathy. Thus, the sensory level in our patient with POEMS syndrome was a pseudosensory level. POEMS syndrome has not been previously reported to present with a pseudosensory level.\n\n【25】The diagnosis of Castleman disease is made by histopathological examination of enlarged lymph nodes. It is a lymphoproliferative disorder which is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Our patient had multiple enlarged intra-abdominal and inguinal lymph nodes, which is in keeping with the diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Castleman disease is known to occur in isolation or progress to POEMS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 6 \\]</u>. Furthermore, it can also mimic lymphoproliferative neoplasms such as lymphoma and inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. However, our patient’s bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy did not show evidence of lymphoma and her anti-nuclear antibodies were negative.\n\n【27】Multiple treatment modalities have been used in multicentric Castleman disease. These include rituximab, anti-IL-6 therapies such as tocilizumab, antivirals such as ganciclovir and zidovudine, and proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. After confirming the diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease of plasma cell type, she was treated with rituximab, to which there was a minimal response with reduction in the size of the inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n【28】Six months after the completion of rituximab therapy, this patient presented with lower motor neuron-type paraparesis and a pseudosensory level. Several possibilities were considered for this presentation; these included paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), rituximab-related peripheral neuropathy with an element of diabetic neuropathy, and POEMS syndrome.\n\n【29】The severity and rapidity of the peripheral neuropathy in a background of Castleman disease favored a paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy. However, her bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy did not show evidence of tumor infiltration and contrast-enhanced CT of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show solid organ tumors. The clinical progression of the neuropathy in this patient was not in keeping with classic CIDP and her nerve conduction studies ruled out this diagnosis. This patient’s clinical progression and nerve conduction findings were not in keeping with diabetes-related distal symmetric polyneuropathy alone. Hence, the possibility of an additional factor such as a drug-related neuropathy was considered. Rituximab is not well known to cause neuropathy. However, there have been reports of worsening of neuropathy after treatment with rituximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. This has, however, been associated with anti- myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)-associated neuropathy and the worsening was noted to be transient and reversible after several weeks to months. Therefore, a severe neuropathy due to rituximab was unlikely.\n\n【30】Our patient developed polyneuropathy and was found to have a monoclonal band on serum protein electrophoresis. Further imaging showed mild hepatomegaly, pericardial effusion, generalized subcutaneous tissue edema, and multiple sclerotic bony lesions involving the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, sternum, anterior ribs, and sacrum. These findings fulfilled the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Her bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed 30% plasma cells. However, clonality of the plasma cells could not be established due to the inaccessibility to such a facility. POEMS syndrome is at present considered to be a paraneoplastic manifestation of an underlying plasma cell disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Several factors differentiate POEMS syndrome from multiple myeloma such as prominent neuropathy, absence of renal involvement, sclerotic rather than lytic bone lesions, and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. POEMS syndrome has shown better survival than multiple myeloma.\n\n【32】Although cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of POEMS syndrome, the current treatment modalities target the underlying clonal plasma cell disorder. Corticosteroids, thalidomide, lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, bevacizumab, radiation, and allogenic stem cell transplantation have all been tried alone or in combination, with varying degrees of success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【33】Intravenously administered dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was used in our patient. This regimen has demonstrated significant clinical improvement in at least 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Following three cycles of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide pulses together with intense lower limb physiotherapy, there was improvement in the weakness and numbness.\n\n【34】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【35】Castleman disease can, rarely, progress to POEMS syndrome despite treatment and therefore long-term follow-up is warranted. Furthermore, lower motor neuron syndromes, such as POEMS syndrome, can, rarely, present with a pseudosensory level and should not be confused with a myelopathy.\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All necessary data and material are provided.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Lumbar vertebral involvement of _Actinomyces israelii_ is extremely rare; this is the first case report of lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis and psoas abscess caused by _Actinomyces israelii_ after an operation under general anesthesia.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 66-year-old Japanese man with end-stage renal disease was admitted to our hospital for an operation for cervical canal stenosis. After the operation under general anesthesia, during which tracheal intubation and nasogastric tube insertion were performed, he developed low back pain. During a second hospitalization, computed tomography revealed osteolysis of the lumbar endplates of L2 and L3, swelling of the intervertebral disk of L2/L3, and swelling of the left psoas major muscle. Percutaneous drainage of the intervertebral disc was performed, and the culture of the aspirate grew _Actinomyces israelii_ . Based on the susceptibility, ampicillin was administered but his condition did not improve. We changed the antibiotics to ampicillin-sulbactam for coverage of unidentified oral commensals, and his symptoms and signs finally improved.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Our patient’s long-term end-stage renal disease had made the oral and gastrointestinal mucosal barriers very fragile. Under these conditions, even mildly invasive procedures such as tracheal intubation and nasogastric tube insertion could be the cause of infectious complication by oral commensals, including _Actinomyces_ .\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Actinomycosis is a chronic, slowly progressive infection caused by the _Actinomyces_ species, which are commensals of the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. _Actinomyces israelii_ is the most common human pathogen. The organism is a filamentous, branching, Gram-positive, pleomorphic non-sporeforming bacillus. Cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common form of the disease, followed by thoracic, abdominopelvic, and central nervous system diseases. Vertebral involvement of actinomycosis is rare and often secondary to an infection of contiguous tissue, such as cervicofacial or thoracic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】We experienced an extremely rare case of lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis and psoas abscess caused by _A. israelii_ in a patient with end-stage renal disease after an operation under general anesthesia, during which a tracheal tube and a nasogastric tube were inserted.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 66-year-old Japanese man was referred to the orthopedic department of our hospital because of progressive weakness of his legs, difficulty in walking, and frequent falls. He also had bilateral weakness of upper extremities. Myelography performed 3 years before had already revealed severe cervical spinal canal stenosis. His symptoms and signs were considered to be caused by the deterioration of the cervical myelopathy. He was admitted for the surgical treatment of cervical spinal canal stenosis.\n\n【13】He had end-stage renal disease dependent on hemodialysis caused by lupus nephritis for 32 years. He had received laminoplasty of lumbar spine from L2 to L5 8 years before and laminectomy and posterior fixation of lower lumbar spine and sacrum from L4 to S2 2 years before. Seven years before he had also received pacemaker implantation and catheter ablation of atrioventricular node against refractory atrial fibrillation, which had persisted despite multiple catheter ablations of left atrium. Two years before he had received upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for routine screening, which showed ectopic gastric mucosa at cervical esophagus and nonspecific erosive gastritis. These findings looked the same as findings from previous examinations and a biopsy was not performed. His other medical history included peripheral arterial disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. His other surgical history included coronary artery bypass graft for severe left anterior descending artery stenosis, right total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, multiple surgeries for bilateral carpal tunnel syndromes and amyloid arthropathies, and bilateral cataract surgeries. He had no remarkable history of dental and periodontal diseases. His medications were lanthanum carbonate, lansoprazole, warfarin, bisoprolol, cinacalcet, calcitriol, cilostazol, levothyroxine, sennoside, and vitamin E supplementation.\n\n【14】He received laminectomy of cervical spine from C4 to C6 and laminoplasty of C3 and C7 under general anesthesia on admission day 5. During the operation, a tracheal tube and a nasogastric tube were inserted. Cefazolin was administered intravenously as a perioperative prophylaxis. Weakness in his bilateral arms and legs was somewhat improved. However, his postoperative course was complicated with back pain and elevated C-reactive protein. On postoperative day (POD) 10, his back pain deteriorated, and ceftriaxone was administered. His back pain improved, and ceftriaxone was continued for 5 days. He was discharged on POD 34.\n\n【15】After discharge, his back pain gradually increased and he was unable to walk up stairs. He was readmitted to our hospital 12 days after discharge. Tramadol, acetaminophen, and loxoprofen were prescribed in the same manner as before the discharge. On day 4, his back pain worsened further, and a blood test showed white blood cell count of 22,400/μL, with neutrophils 85.5%, lymphocytes 9.5%, monocytes 4.0%, eosinophils 1.0%, and basophils 0.0%, and C-reactive protein 29.52 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast material revealed osteolysis of the lumbar endplates of L2 and L3, swelling of the intervertebral disk of L2/L3, and swelling of the left psoas major muscle 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>, without any finding indicative of surgical site infection of cervical spine. There was no sign of the involvement of the lower lumbar spine instruments. Magnetic resonance imaging was not performed since he had a cardiac pacemaker. Meropenem and vancomycin were initiated.\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】Computed tomography of lumbar spine and psoas abscess on day 5, the day after meropenem and vancomycin were initiated. **a** A coronal image showing low density area in the lateral part of left psoas major; **b** a sagittal image showing several bone pieces in the intervertebral area of L2/L3 and swelling of the disc. Although he had received two prior surgeries in his lower lumbosacral spine from L4 to S2, there was neither fracture nor abscess around the instruments\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】On day 6, percutaneous drainage of the intervertebral disk of L2/L3 was performed. A Gram stain of the aspirate revealed thin filamentous Gram-positive rods, and an anaerobic culture showed _Actinomyces_ species 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. Our university laboratory was consulted for further identification, and 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequence analysis identified this bacterium as _A. israelii_ . The antibiotics susceptibilities of the strain are shown in Table 1 . Meropenem and vancomycin were de-escalated to intravenously administered ampicillin based on a susceptibility test of _A. israelii_ on day 16.\n\n【20】**Fig. 2**\n\n【21】Gram stain and culture of the aspirate from L2/L3 intervertebral disk. **a** Gram stain showed multiple neutrophils and a few thin filamentous Gram-positive rods, and **b** small whitish colonies on sheep blood agar.

The culture of the exudate did not grow any organism. We thought that the causative organisms of his symptoms and signs were a mixture of oral bacterial flora, which could not be identified because of the antibiotic exposure before the aspiration. Intravenously administered ampicillin-sulbactam was substituted for ampicillin for coverage of beta lactamase-producing bacteria. Thereafter his back pain improved and the exudate diminished. Follow-up CT scans showed gradual reduction of the left psoas abscess 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. On day 63, ampicillin-sulbactam was switched to orally administered amoxicillin-clavulanate. There was no recurrence of back pain and exudate. Three weeks later, he was transferred to a long-term care hospital, while amoxicillin-clavulanate was continued. He reportedly died of aspiration pneumonia 8 months after the transfer.\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】Computed tomography showed the gradual reduction of the left psoas abscess. **a** Day 5, the day after meropenem and vancomycin were initiated, **b** day 49, and **c** day 88\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】Actinomycosis is an endogenous infection. Risk factors of actinomycosis include poor oral hygiene, alcoholism, the use of intrauterine devices, and an immunocompromised condition such as diabetes mellitus and the use of immunosuppressive agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Vertebral involvement of _A. israelii_ is very rare, especially in the lumbar spine. Only a few cases have been reported for lumbosacral _A. israelii_ infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>. Although in one case the patient had poor oral hygiene and metastatic prostate cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, in the other cases no obvious risk factor was reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our case, a tracheal tube and a nasogastric tube were inserted during an operation on our patient’s cervical spine, which could have led to a mucosal lesion of his oral cavity and pharynx. Our patient had received hemodialysis for over 30 years. He had received an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy 2 years before presentation, which showed erosive gastritis. It has been reported that chronic kidney disease increases the permeability of the mucosa by loosening the tight junction of the epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In addition, he had taken lanthanum carbonate and proton pump inhibitor. A recent report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> showed combined deposition of lanthanum and amyloid in the gastroduodenal mucosa of hemodialysis-dependent patients, which may cause fragility of the gastrointestinal barrier. The portal of _A. israelii_ in this case could be the oral lesion or a more distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract, such as esophagus or stomach, although it could not be confirmed.\n\n【33】_A. israelii_ is usually susceptible to penicillin G and aminopenicillins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. However, in our case, our patient’s back pain and exudate were deteriorated after the de-escalation to ampicillin. It has been reported that _Actinomyces_ are often isolated with other normal commensals, such as _Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans_ , _Eikenella corrodens_ , _Capnocytophaga_ , fusobacteria, _Bacteroides_ , staphylococci, streptococci, or _Enterobacteriaceae_ , depending on the site of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 15 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. Oral anaerobes such as _Prevotella_ and _Fusobacterium_ species have a high rate of resistance to ampicillin, whereas they are almost always susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. In a classical case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>, two cases are reported in detail, who were initially treated with penicillin but eventually needed more broad-spectrum antibiotics because of concomitant other microbes. Since we initiated meropenem and vancomycin before the aspirate of the intervertebral disk was obtained for bacteriological studies, we probably could not identify the concomitant species which were susceptible to meropenem or vancomycin but resistant to ampicillin.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】Lumbar vertebral involvement of _Actinomyces_ is extremely rare. Even mildly invasive procedures, such as tracheal intubation and nasogastric tube insertion, and predisposing gastrointestinal mucosal fragility could be the causes of infectious complication by oral commensals, including _Actinomyces_ .\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the data are available in Kyoto Min-Iren Chuo Hospital.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>POD:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Postoperative day</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>rRNA:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ribosomal ribonucleic acid</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

During the routine evaluation, microscopic hematuria was detected without proteinuria or active sediments. She denied any painful micturition, previous similar episodes, or abdominal pain. Further evaluation revealed a hypokalemia with biochemical evidence of hypercortisolism and high testosterone levels with suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. On imaging, there was evidence of a right suprarenal mass 7 cm × 3 cm × 6 cm in size that was hypoechoic and lobulated and suggestive of a lipid-poor tumor. She underwent adrenalectomy.

We report a case of adrenal carcinoma presenting with microscopic hematuria.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 67-year-old Sri Lankan lady with a history of diabetes and hypertension and ischemic heart disease presented to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) with a history suggestive of ischemic chest pain. While she was being treated for an acute coronary event, microscopic hematuria with 50–60 red cells without proteinuria or casts was noted. She denied any painful episodes of micturition, abdominal pain, or previous similar episodes. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Urine for dysmorphic cells was negative. She also had hypokalemia (serum potassium 3.1 mEq/l). Her cardiac function was satisfactory. Renal, liver, and thyroid functions were normal. Ultrasound scan revealed a right-sided, 7 cm × 3 cm × 6 cm, suprarenal mass that was hypoechoic and lobulated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen was done and revealed a well-defined oval-shaped, soft-tissue-density lesion in the right suprarenal region suggestive of a lipid-poor adenoma. Her 9 am cortisol was 628 通用删除7(英):<u>(166–507)</u> nmol/l, serum free testosterone was 14.3 (0.1–1.7) pg/ml, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHES) was 3.91 (0.03–5.8) μg/ml. Cortisol was not suppressed with high-dose dexamethasone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was < 5 通用删除7(英):<u>(10–50)</u> pg/ml. Renin–aldosterone ratio and urine vanillylmandelic acid were normal. While awaiting surgery for adrenal carcinoma, in 3 weeks’ time, significant weight gain was noted with an increase in body mass index (BMI) from 26.5 to 30 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> . Gradually she developed hirsutism, thin skin, and easy bruising. However, there were no features of virilization or proximal muscle weakness. During the investigation, she developed hypertensive heart failure with recurrent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions, which was treated in the intensive care unit. With greatest precautions, adrenalectomy was performed. Histology revealed right-sided adrenal carcinoma with vascular and capsular invasion. Following the surgery, her cushinoid features were abated. Latest 9 am cortisol was 485 通用删除7(英):<u>(166–507)</u> nmol/l, serum free testosterone was 1.1(0.1–1.7) pg/ml, and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was suppressed to 46 通用删除7(英):<u>(50)</u> nmol/l. Hematuria settled. She was referred for further specialized oncological care with the histology report.\n\n【12】Discussion\n----------\n\n【13】Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with an incidence of 0.5–2 cases/million/year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. ACC can occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years and women being more often affected (55–60%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. ACC may present as a functionally active adrenal gland in about 50–60% of patients. Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) or mixed Cushing and virilizing syndromes are observed in the majority of these patients. Compressive symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and back pain may be present in 30–40%. In 10–15% of patients, the diagnosis is an incidental finding. Constitutional symptoms are rarely present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Unusual clinical manifestations reported include hematuria, lower-extremity edema, Budd–Chiari syndrome, acute abdominal pain, pelvic pain, urinary obstruction, and paraplegia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Early diagnosis is vital owing to its poor overall prognosis. Five-year survival is 60–80% for tumors confined to the adrenal space, 35–50% for locally advanced disease, and much lower in case of metastatic disease with reported percentages ranging from 0% to 28% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. It is critical to know whether the adrenal mass is malignant or not. Suspicion of ACC might arise if the patients rapidly develop features of adrenocortical hormone excess such as weakness, hypokalemia, wasting and constitutional symptoms, or features of a large abdominal mass. Hirsutism or virilization in women or recent onset gynecomastia in men might be due to excess sex hormone production by an ACC. Evidence of co-secretion of different steroids raises suspicion of ACC (especially if sex hormones are involved). ACCs are usually large (> 4 cm) and of inhomogeneous appearance, and characterized by low fat content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Our patient had a lipid-poor tumor larger than 4 cm, though she did not have features of local invasion on imaging. However, definite differentiation between adenoma and carcinoma should be done after pathological assessment.\n\n【14】Advanced adrenal carcinomas present with vascular invasion mainly into renal vein and inferior vena cava (IVC). Since this patient had histologically proven vascular invasion, this is the most likely explanation for the hematuria. Right-sided ACC may grow into the IVC more frequently than left-sided tumors. Left-sided ACC extends into the IVC through the renal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. There is a similar presentation of right-sided ACC without radiological evidence of local invasion reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】However, hematuria being the initial presentation of the ACC before the onset of features of hyper functioning adrenal gland is an unusual presentation.\n\n【16】Definitive cure requires adrenalectomy with intra- and postoperative glucocorticoid replacement in all patients with autonomous cortisol secretion followed by mitotane treatment if indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. To date, mitotane has been the only drug that has proven effective in treating patients with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Adjuvant mitotane treatment is recommended in patients without macroscopic residual tumor after surgery but who have a perceived high risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【18】This case illustrates a rare presentation of a case of adrenal carcinoma. Our patient had a right-sided ACC with histologically proven local vascular invasion that may have caused the hematuria with possible micrometastasis. Since this is a rare condition with poor overall prognosis, awareness of this rare presentation may facilitate early evaluation and management.\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACC:</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Adrenocortical carcinoma</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NHSL:</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>National Hospital of Sri Lanka</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ACTH:</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Adrenocorticotropic hormone</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BMI:</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Body mass index</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DHES:</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dehydroepiandrosterone</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Preoperative evaluation had failed to reveal any respiratory or cardiac problem. After evidence of a low arterial oxygen saturation, blood gas analysis from the central venous line correctly inserted in the right internal jugular vein revealed a higher oxygen saturation than in the arterial compartment. A thoracic computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion, lobar pulmonary embolism, and a drainage of a left pulmonary vein into the left innominate vein. This unique combination resulted in an uncommon cause of platypnea–orthodeoxia syndrome.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Often associated with right-to-left shunting, platypnea–orthodeoxia syndrome may be observed in complex clinical conditions with several factors influencing the ventilation/perfusion ratio. The paradoxical finding of a higher oxygen saturation in a central venous line than in an arterial line should prompt the clinician to look at the possibility of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Chest x-ray examination and arterial blood gas analysis are first-line tests aiming to exclude the most common pulmonary or cardiac causes. Significant information can also be obtained by looking at the arteriovenous difference in oxygen (O <sub>2 </sub> ), with blood samples obtained from an arterial and a central venous line (CVL). The finding of a low arterial O <sub>2 </sub> saturation together with a high O <sub>2 </sub> venous saturation is quite unusual and should prompt further investigations.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 57-year-old Caucasian woman was recently diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer. Otherwise healthy, she had initially consulted her general practitioner simply for abdominal distension. Further investigations \\[abdominal computed tomography (CT), serum CA125determination and laparoscopy\\] revealed a peritoneal carcinomatosis. The diagnosis of stage III (FIGO classification) ovarian cancer was established and the patient received a carboplatin-paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimen in a neoadjuvant setting. The indication of a debulking surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) was retained by our institutional tumor board. A CVL was inserted via the right jugular vein into the superior vena cava in prevision of surgery and the appropriate positioning of the catheter was verified by chest x-ray. An implantable central venous catheter (Port-a-Cath) was already in place 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【12】The first 48 postoperative hours were marked by difficult pain management, hypotension, and transient hyperlactatemia responding to fluid replacement and norepinephrine. On postoperative day 3, she presented acute onset dyspnea when transferred from the bed to a chair, and a major drop in pulse oxygen saturation (from SpO <sub>2 </sub> 96% to 83%) justified the administration of oxygen (5 L/min) via a nasal cannula. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.4 °C, blood pressure 135/81 mmHg, heart rate 122 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min. No chest pain was reported. Pulmonary examination revealed a bilateral reduction of basal breath sounds with dullness at percussion. Chest x-ray examination 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> showed bilateral pleural effusions that could largely explain patient’s dyspnea and oxygen desaturation. After switching from a nasal cannula to a nonrebreather mask (FiO <sub>2 </sub> 0.40), the patient’s condition seemed to stabilize in supine position.

A transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with bubble test failed to show a right-to-left shunt, atrial septum was intact. No pulmonary hypertension was detected and right ventricle was not dilated. A CT pulmonary angiography 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u> showed large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of both lower lobes, acute pulmonary embolism in the right middle and upper lobe pulmonary arteries, and ultimately an anatomical variant of the left upper pulmonary vein draining into the left innominate vein. Following bilateral chest drainage, the patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin twice daily. There was no evidence for deep venous thrombosis. This was followed by a significant clinical improvement, a disappearance of the platypnea–orthodeoxia complaints and a reduction of oxygen requirement over the following days.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】Left anterior oblique view of a three-dimensional reconstruction of CT pulmonary angiography.

From an oncological perspective, stability was also observed during her niraparib maintenance therapy, with absence of new lesions at a 1-year follow-up abdominal CT.\n\n【23】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【24】Platypnea–orthodeoxia syndrome (P-OS) is an uncommon clinical manifestation that consists of breathlessness that aggravates in the upright position and relieves in recumbent position. Since its description by Burchell _et al_ . in 1949, a vast majority of the reported P-OS seems to be linked to a right-to-left circulatory shunt, usually by means of a cardiac anatomic defect such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, in some rare instances, P-OS seems to be solely associated to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio mismatch. This could occur in patients with a history of chronic lung disease such as severe obstructive lung disease, postpneumonectomy and pulmonary vascular shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】In the present observation, several factors might have contributed to a V/Q mismatch 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【26】**Fig. 3**\n\n【27】Possible mechanism for ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio mismatch leading to PO-S. ① Pulmonary embolism ② Pleural effusion with passive atelectasis ③ Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】First, there was a documented acute pulmonary embolism (PE) involving the right middle and upper lobes. In the few reported cases of PO-S following PE, the presence of an intracardiac shunt was usually demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 \\]</u>. In patients with PE and PFO, right-to-left shunting is very likely related to the acute increase in pulmonary artery pressure that determines the reversal of the shunt direction or the development of a right-to-left shunt while sitting upright, in the absence of a left-to-right shunt in a supine position. In the clinical observation reported by Brenner _et al_ . however, no evidence of intracardiac shunt was documented in a 56-year-old man who presented with PO-S after bilateral lower-lobe pulmonary emboli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. As in our observation, the patient was investigated by TTE and CT with angiography, and the possibility of a transient PFO could not be excluded.\n\n【30】Second, the patient presented with major bilateral pleural effusion with passive atelectasis of both lower lobes. This would have resulted in significant V/Q mismatch due to hypoventilation of normally perfused segments. More pronounced anatomical or functional intrapulmonary shunting in the lower parts combined with a reduced potential for compensation in the upper parts of the lungs will then result in significant deoxygenation. Furthermore, in the present case, perfusion was reduced in the right middle and upper lobe following PE.\n\n【31】Third, the thoracic CT demonstrated a partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) without associated septal defect. The diagnosis of PAVPR is often made incidentally or postmortem, as most adult patients will remain asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. Occasionally, it can be obtained by the chest x-ray examination showing a malposition of a recently inserted CVL, particularly when CVL was supposed to be inserted in the left internal jugular vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In the present observation, both Port-a-Cath and CVL catheter were correctly inserted in the right internal jugular vein. As in other previously published cases, the simultaneous determination of the arterial blood gas from the CVL and arterial line was helpful as the partial pressure in oxygen was paradoxically higher from the CVL compared with the arterial line 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 \\]</u>. This precluded the correct interpretation of the arteriovenous difference in oxygen that is usually extremely helpful for the management of a critically ill patient. Logically, PAPVR is associated with a left-to-right shunting effect but not with PO-S. There was here no evidence of elevated pulmonary pressure and subsequent right-to-left shunting through a PFO. The exact influence of the change from supine to upright position on the V/Q ratio of the physiologically preserved left upper lobe is not known. There is no objective reason for a worsening of PO-S.\n\n【32】In conclusion, while PO-S is often associated with right-to-left shunting, it may be observed in complex clinical conditions with several factors influencing the V/Q ratio. The paradoxical finding of a higher oxygen saturation in a CVL than in an arterial line should prompt the clinician to look at the possibility of PAPVR.

We report a case of oxaliplatin-induced interstitial pneumonia in which eosinophilia and high-grade fever with relative bradycardia were useful presenting signs for the early diagnosis.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 76-year-old Japanese woman with postoperative recurrent rectal cancer (peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis) was admitted to our hospital because of productive cough and consolidation on thoracic computed tomography (CT) images. Two months prior to the consultation, she had started chemotherapy (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab). After finishing three courses of chemotherapy, she developed fever and was noted to have relative bradycardia. After another two courses of chemotherapy, she developed productive cough, chest discomfort, and high-grade fever. At this time, thoracic CT revealed patchy areas of consolidation distributed predominantly in the periphery. Despite the administration of tazobacterium/piperacillin, the consolidation seen on CT scans gradually worsened. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis showed increased lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total cell count but a low CD4/ CD8 ratio. No specific pathogen was identified. With a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia, prednisolone was started and chemotherapy was temporarily discontinued. Her productive cough gradually decreased, and the infiltrative shadows on the thoracic CT scans improved.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】Although cases of oxaliplatin-related pneumonia with complicating relative bradycardia are not uncommon, drug-induced interstitial pneumonia should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis. In this case, an increased circulating eosinophil count and high-grade fever with relative bradycardia were the first signs of drug-induced interstitial pneumonia.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Drug-induced interstitial pneumonia is well known as a major adverse effect of chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, but its detection in the early phase remains difficult. Here we report the case of a patient with rectal cancer who developed oxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia. Oxaliplatin is currently used for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Although drug eruptions, hypersensitivity, and sensory disturbance of the limbs are well-known adverse effects of oxaliplatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>, drug-induced interstitial pneumonia is also possible. In fact, various cases of oxaliplatin-induced interstitial pneumonia have been reported in the past few decades. In the case reported here, eosinophilia and high-grade fever with relative bradycardia were the first signs of interstitial pneumonia; however, these signs are believed to be rare in this context. Brucellosis, typhoid fever, and drug-induced fever are other known causes of relative bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, but the relationship between drug-induced interstitial pneumonia and high-grade fever with relative bradycardia remains uncertain. In this report, we focused on interstitial pneumonia and relative bradycardia.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 76-year-old Japanese woman who was being treated for rectal cancer consulted our outpatient clinic with 1-week history of productive cough and fever. She was a never smoker. Two years earlier, she had undergone rectal cancer resection (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, stage IIB, T4aN0M0). Two months prior to the consultation, she started chemotherapy with FOLFOX6 (fluorouracil \\[5-FU\\], oxaliplatin) + bevacizumab for peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis from the rectal cancer. After the third course of FOLFOX6 with bevacizumab therapy, she noted fever as high as 39.0 °C without any other symptoms. Physical examination at that time showed a body temperature of 39.1 °C, blood pressure of 138/82 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and intact level of consciousness.  The totally implantable central venous port was palpable on the subclavicular region, without skin inflammation. Although her eosinophil count had increased form 171 to 607/µL, it rapidly decreased to 324/µL 3 days later. Her high-grade fever resolved within a few days without any medications. She then underwent her fourth course of chemotherapy with FOLFOX6 + bevacizumab; the high-grade fever recurred but resolved spontaneously within a few days.\n\n【12】After careful observation, the fifth course of chemotherapy was administered; there was recurrence of high-grade fever, along with productive cough and chest discomfort. These symptoms persisted. Physical examination at this time revealed coarse inspiratory crackles on the back. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 5660/µL, eosinophil count of 736/µL hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, platelet count of 288,000/mL, and C-reactive protein of 9.92 mg/dL. The laboratory data showed liver dysfunction (aspartate transaminase \\[AST\\] 15 IU/L, dysfunctionalanine transaminase \\[ALT\\] 19 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase \\[LDH\\] 236 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase \\[ALP\\] 401 IU/L, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase \\[γ-GTP\\] 21 IU/L). Serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D) was 250 U/L and KL-6 was 538 U/L (normal range: 0–499 U/mL). Urine antigen tests for Legionella and _Streptococcus pneumonia_ were negative. Bilateral subpleural-predominant areas of consolidation were visible on chest x-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. At this point, we highly suspected bacterial pneumonia, rather than interstitial pneumonia, and tazobacterium/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) (12.5 g per day) for 5 days was administered. However, her symptoms and the findings on the chest x-ray and CT images gradually worsened 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest showed early inspiratory coarse crackles. Blood laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count 8960/µL, eosinophil count of 8.8% (788/µL), red blood cell count of 3,310,000/µL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.8%, platelet count of 349,000/µL, AST of 13 IU/mL, ALT of 10 IU/mL, LDH of 353 U/mL (normal range 106–211 U/mL), C-reactive protein of 4.2 mg/dL, carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) of 5.5 ng/mL; SP-D was 287 U/L and KL-6 was 1409 U/L.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Chest x-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) on admission. **a** Chest x-ray shows bilateral, multiple-nonsegmental consolidation. **b** , **c** Thoracic CT performed at the same time shows areas of consolidation, predominantly in the subpleural areas.\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Chest x-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) before corticosteroid treatment. Chest x-ray ( **a** ) and thoracic CT scans ( **b** , **c** ) show worsening consolidation\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】To rule out interstitial pneumonia and opportunistic infections, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis showed lymphocytes at 17.0%, eosinophils at 4.0%, neutrophils at 5.0%, alveolar macrophages at 74.0%, and total cell count of 1.90 × 10 <sup>5 </sup> /mL. The CD4/CD8 ratio of the BAL fluid was 1.6 (normal range 2.0–3.0). PCR for _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ was negative, and no specific pathogen was identified in the BAL fluid. Cytomegalovirus antigenemia was absent. Cell pathological examination of BAL cells showed no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【20】A clinical diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia as an adverse effect to chemotherapy was then suspected. The drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) was positive for oxaliplatin but negative for 5-FU and bevacizumab. Because the chest CT findings were similar to those of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (COP/BOOP), prednisolone at 30 mg daily (0.5 mg/kg/day) was started, and chemotherapy was temporarily discontinued. Her productive cough gradually decreased, and the consolidation seen on chest x-ray and thoracic CT scans improved gradually 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. Moreover, the eosinophilia and increased serum SP-D and KL-6 improved. The clinical course of the presenting case is shown on Fig. 4 . After 3 months of treatment with tapering doses of prednisolone, there was no recurrence of interstitial pneumonia.\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】Chest x-ray and thoracic CT after corticosteroid treatment.

In this case, because the relationship between drug-induced pneumonitis and relative bradycardia is uncertain, we did not have sufficient cause to discontinue chemotherapy before the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was ascertained. Notably, we continued the patient‘s chemotherapy because her high-grade fever after the third course of chemotherapy resolved spontaneously within a few days. On hindsight, that time may have been the optimal point to discontinue chemotherapy. Because the pneumonia was associated with relative bradycardia, intracellular infections, such Legionella pneumonia, could be excluded in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, only a few reports have previously described relative bradycardia in oxaliplatin-induced interstitial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. Based on the patient’s medical history, and confirmed by the patient, there was no medication or medical condition affecting her heart rate. Therefore, we speculated that relative bradycardia might be relevant to the presenting signs.\n\n【29】As we could not prove that oxaliplatin was the only drug that could have induced interstitial pneumonia in its strict definition, we diagnosed as oxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia—not oxaliplatin-induced interstitial pneumonia. For this case, we did not try a challenge test. DLST is only one of the ancillary tools and does not confirm the diagnosis of drug-induce pneumonitis. However, if only one drug is positive for DLST, such as in this case, the possibility of that drug being the cause is more likely. For this reason, we found the DLST to be a useful tool in the present case.\n\n【30】Several cases of oxaliplatin-induced interstitial pneumonia have been reported to have shown a NSIP-like pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 \\]</u>. Although results from the BAL fluid analysis and the CT pattern of drug-induced pneumonitis vary widely, the findings in this case were consistent with those reported in these earlier cases. Moreover, the patient’s response to corticosteroid therapy was useful in supporting our speculation. Because of temporary hypoxia during bronchoscopy, transbronchial lung biopsy was not performed in this patient; therefore, we could not differentiate between NSIP and COP/BOOP. Moreover, the pathological finding could not rule out the possibility of drug-induced pneumonitis. Nevertheless, this did not affect the choice of treatment for this case. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was considered in the differential diagnosis, based on the CT findings, but it was ruled out based on the results of BAL fluid analysis.\n\n【31】In summary, we report a case of oxaliplatin-related interstitial pneumonia that was successfully treated with corticosteroid. When a finding of nonresolving pneumonia is seen on chest x-ray during chemotherapy for rectal cancer, the possibility of an adverse effect to oxaliplatin should be considered. Nonsegmental and multiple areas of consolidation distributed predominantly in the periphery were the characteristic findings in the present case. Moreover, an increased circulating eosinophil count and high-grade fever with relative bradycardia may be useful for the early diagnosis of this condition.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BAL:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bronchoalveolar lavage</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DLST:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NSIP:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>COP/BOOP:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/ bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SP-D:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Surfactant protein-D</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>TAZ/PIPC:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Tazobacterium/piperacillin</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Filarial elephantiasis of the female genitalia is extremely uncommon; a rough estimate of its incidence would be no more than one to two percent of the total cases of filarial elephantiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Elephantiasis of the female genitalia due to other causes is rarer still. We present two unusual cases of vulval elephantiasis as a consequence of extensive lymph node destruction by tuberculosis.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Case report 1\n\n【12】A 40-year-old Indian woman presented with progressively increasing vulval swellings over a period of five years. She also described a loss of appetite and weight. There was a history of fever with a rise in the evenings, night sweats and vaginal discharge, although her menstrual periods were normal. Eight years prior to presentation, she had generalized lymph node tuberculosis with discharging cervical and inguinal sinuses, for which she received a full course of anti-tubercular therapy. Her tuberculosis was completely cured by the anti-tubercular therapy and she did not show any evidence of a recurrence. Her genital swellings were extremely large and caused her to experience difficulty in walking. Sexual intercourse was not possible.\n\n【13】Our examination revealed that she was poorly nourished, with a marked pallor. There was no lower limb edema. She had two giant vulval swellings measuring 35 × 25 cm on the right side and 45 × 30 cm on the left side 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 and 2 )</u>. In the standing position, the left vulval swelling extended below her knees. While walking, she had to tuck the swellings between her buttocks. The skin overlying the swellings was thick and rugose.\n\n【14】**Figure 1**\n\n【15】**Vulval elephantiasis involving both labia majora (35 × 25 cm on the right side and 45 × 30 cm on the left side) with well-healed scars of previously discharging inguinal sinuses** .

The rest of our physical examination, including her vaginal wall, chest and abdomen was normal.\n\n【21】She was found to be severely anemic (Hb 6 gm%) with a normal leucocyte count. Our other investigations, including blood urea nitrogen, serum electrolytes, creatinine, Mantoux test, night blood smear, chest X-ray, ultrasonography of her abdomen and pelvis, and pap smear were normal.\n\n【22】She was taken up for surgery after the correction of her anemia. A wide local excision with a primary closure was performed. Part of the fibro-fatty tissue of her labia majora was preserved to give them a natural bulging appearance 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 )</u>. There was considerable oozing of lymph during surgery and in the post-operative period, but healing occurred with primary intention. The swellings removed from her right and left labia weighed 20 lb and 16 lb respectively. The immediate post-operative period was uneventful. Nearly six years of follow up revealed a satisfactory recovery, although in the immediate post-operative period and in the early follow-up period she presented with seroma formation under the skin flaps that was managed by aspiration and pressure bandaging. She also experienced episodes of serous discharge from the site that was self limiting and was managed by pressure bandaging.\n\n【23】**Figure 3**\n\n【24】**The resected specimen (the left weighing 20 pounds and the right weighing 16 pounds) (Case report 1)** .\n\n【25】Full size image\n\n【26】**Figure 4**\n\n【27】**Post-operative appearance after resection of the lesions (Case report 1)** .\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Figure 5**\n\n【30】**The specimen bisected, showing grayish-white tissue loaded with lymph (Case report 1)** .\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】### Case report 2\n\n【33】A 27-year-old Indian woman presented to our hospital with a very similar history and findings to that of case report 1, although her swellings were not as large.

Her menses were normal. Seven years prior to presentation, she also had generalized lymph node tuberculosis with discharging cervical and inguinal sinuses, for which she had received a full course of anti-tubercular therapy. Her tuberculosis was completely cured by the anti-tubercular therapy and she did not show any evidence of a recurrence.\n\n【34】Her general physical examination was normal and there was no lower limb edema.

Both of her labia majora were given a natural soft and bulging appearance. There was slight oozing in the post-operative period, but healing occurred with primary intention (i.e.the incisions that were closed with sutures healed normally). Her post-operative period was uneventful. A follow-up period of six years revealed a satisfactory recovery and, unlike case report 1, she experienced minimal discharge from the wound site and her recovery was uneventful.\n\n【46】A histopathological examination of the specimen in both cases showed changes of lymphedema. The features were suggestive of non-specific inflammation. There was, however, no clear evidence of tuberculosis in the specimens (in the form of granulomas and/or acid fast bacilli), malignancy, filariasis or donovanosis通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 5 )</u>.\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】Lymphedema occurs due to an inability of the existing lymphatic system to accommodate the protein and fluid entering the interstitial compartment at tissue level. In the first stage of lymphedema, impaired lymphatic drainage results in protein-rich fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment. Clinically, this manifests as soft-pitting edema. In the second stage, there is an accumulation of fibroblasts, adipocytes and macrophages in the affected tissues, culminating in a local inflammatory response. This results in a deposition of the connective tissue and adipose elements at the skin and subcutaneous level, leading to non-pitting edema. In the third and most advanced stage, the affected tissues sustain further injury as a result of both the local inflammatory response and recurrent infections. Such repeated episodes injure the remaining, incompetent lymphatic channels, progressively worsening the underlying insufficiency of the lymphatic system. This eventually results in excessive subcutaneous fibrosis and scarring with associated severe skin changes characteristic of lymphostatic elephantiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【49】Lymphedema is generally classified as primary when there is no known etiology, and as secondary when its cause is a known disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Primary lymphedema with onset before two years of age is referred to as congenital; the familial version of which is known as Milroy's disease. Primary lymphedema with onset between two and 35 years of age is called lymphedema praecox. It is the most common form of primary lymphedema, accounting for 80 percent of the cases. The familial version of lymphedema praecox is known as Meige's disease. Primary lymphedema with onset after 35 years of age is called lymphedema tarda. In general, primary lymphedema progresses more slowly than secondary lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【50】The most common form of lymphedema is secondary lymphedema. In developed countries, the most common causes of secondary lymphedema involve resection or ablation of the regional lymph nodes by surgery, radiation, tumor invasion, direct trauma, or, less commonly, an infectious process. Globally, filariasis, caused by infestation of the lymph nodes by the parasite _Wuchereria bancrofti_ , is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【51】Vulval tuberculosis leading to pseudoelephantiasis - direct infiltration of the vulva by tuberculosis - is rare; however a few cases have been previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. Vulval elephantiasis as a consequence of extensive lymph node destruction by tuberculosis in the inguinal region is rarer still. Sharma _et al_ . reported two cases of vulval elephantiasis as a consequence of tubercular lymphadenitis, however, both the cases had smaller-sized vulval swellings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. In our case reports, the absence of a tubercular histology from the vulva rules out direct infiltration; that is, pseudoelephantiasis. Moreover, both of our cases had a past history of lymph node tuberculosis, with evidence of the puckered scars of healed sinuses in their inguinal regions. The etiology in both of our cases was the extensive destruction of the inguinal lymph nodes and their channels as a result of past tuberculosis, leading to a blockage of lymphatic drainage and resulting in vulval elephantiasis.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【53】Vulval elephantiasis is very rare, and vulval elephantiasis as a consequence of lymph node destruction by tuberculosis, as evidenced in our case reports, is rarer still. We present our cases to draw attention to this rare condition.\n\n【54】Consent\n-------\n\n【55】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of these case reports and any accompanying images.

We report a woman with sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. This case suggests that even in the absence of brainstem or cerebellar signs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) should be performed since such studies may reveal signs of life-threatening vertebrobasilar artery occlusion.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 73-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation who suffered bilateral deafness with vertigo and vomiting was transferred from a local hospital to our department. On admission her consciousness was clear and vertigo was absent. Neurological examination revealed only bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Head computed tomography (CT) returned no significant findings. The next morning she gradually developed severe drowsiness. Diffusion-weighted MRI demonstrated acute cerebral infarction in the brainstem and bilateral cerebellum; MRA showed basilar artery occlusion due to a cardioembolic thrombus. Revascularization was obtained by endovascular treatment. However, her condition worsened progressively during the following hours. CT revealed new brainstem lesions, massive cerebellar swelling, and obstructive hydrocephalus. She died on the second day after her admission.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】When hearing loss is due to vertebrobasilar occlusive disease, the prognosis is very poor. We suggest that vertebrobasilar stroke be suspected in patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who present with risk factors for stroke such as atrial fibrillation and other neurologic signs.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】The prognosis of patients with sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss, an inner ear disorder, is relatively good. It tends to be due to idiopathic sudden deafness, Meniere's disease, or a perilymphatic fistula. More rarely it is attributable to vertebrobasilar ischemia. The incidence of vertebrobasilar ischemia in sudden sensorineural hearing loss is approximately 1.2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The anterior-inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) which originates from the basilar artery (BA) is implicated in acute audiovestibular dysfunction. Sudden bilateral deafness due to AICA ischemia is associated with multiple brainstem signs or symptoms and rarely with a single factor.\n\n【10】When hearing loss is due to vertebrobasilar occlusion, the prognosis is very poor. We report a woman who presented with only bilateral hearing loss without vertigo and vomiting. Consequently, initially we did not suspect specific anomalies including vertebrobasilar impairment. However, angiography revealed occlusion of lower third of the BA. Based on the experience reported here, we suggest that patients with sudden bilateral hearing loss be subjected to MRI and MRA studies because they may reveal signs of life-threatening vertebrobasilar artery occlusive disease.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 73-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 3 developed bilateral hearing loss with vertigo and vomiting and was brought to a local hospital. Her home medications included 5 mg daily of atorvastatin. The diagnosis was sudden deafness and she was transferred to our emergency department. At that time her consciousness was clear. She had no significant family, social, environmental, or employment history. She did not smoke or take alcohol. Her blood pressure was 147/72 mmHg, her pulse rate was 78 beats/minute with AF, and her temperature 36.8 °C. One year earlier she interrupted anticoagulant therapy because she experienced recurrent epistaxis.\n\n【13】She reported only bilateral hearing loss without vertigo and vomiting. Dysarthria, weakness, ataxia, diplopia, dysphagia, and Horner syndrome were absent. As computed tomography (CT) returned no specific findings 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> she returned home and was scheduled for audiometry on the next day.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1.**\n\n【15】Brain computed tomography showed no new lesions in the area of the cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】The next morning her consciousness decreased progressively and she returned to our hospital. At the time of admission she was severely drowsy. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7 (E2V1M4) and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 33. We found the normal pupil reflexes, symmetrical facial responses and withdrawal of both arms and legs to painful stimuli. Her general physical examination was unremarkable. Her blood pressure was 170/90 mmHg, her pulse rate was 80/minute with AF, and her temperature 36.4 °C. Her laboratory test results showed a white blood cell count of 8.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l, hemoglobin of 14.7 g/dl, platelet count of 268 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l, blood urea nitrogen 11.3 mg/dl, and creatinine of 0.58 mg/dl, as well as a normal liver function test result. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed acute multifocal lesions involving the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and pons and the posterior circulation. The DWI posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (DWI-pc-ASPECTS) was 7 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a, b)</u>. The susceptibility vessel sign was noted in the BA on T2\\*-weighted images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 c)</u>. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 3D CT angiography (CTA) showed occlusion of the V3–4 segments of the bilateral vertebral arteries (VA) and the BA 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig .2 d, e)</u>. As conservative treatment was thought to be ineffective we started edaravone infusion (30 mg intravenously, twice a day) and performed endovascular treatment.\n\n【18】**Fig. 2.**\n\n【19】Diffusion-weighted brain MRI showing acute multifocal lesions involving the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres ( **a** , **b** ). The susceptibility vessel sign was noted in the middle portion of the basilar artery on the T2\\*-weighted image ( **c** ). The V3 segment of the right VA, the V4 segment of the left VA, and the lower third of the BA were occluded on MRA and 3D-CTA images ( **d** , **e** )\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】Transfemoral cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the V4 segment of the left VA just proximal to its union with the BA 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 a, b)</u>. Left common carotid angiography demonstrated retrograde blood flow into the BA and the bilateral superior cerebellar artery (SCA) via the left posterior communicating artery (PcomA); the proximal side was obstructed to the union area.

Anteroposterior left common carotid angiograms showed reverse flow into the BA and SCA through the PcomA ( **b** ). Post-thrombectomy, the last anteroposterior left vertebral angiogram demonstrated total recanalization of the BA trunk and residual occlusion of the right AICA and SCA ( **c** )\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Her past history of untreated AF and current angiographic findings strongly suggested a cardioembolic thrombus-induced basilar artery occlusion; we did not perform echocardiography. Postoperatively she was comatose; brain CT showed a large brainstem infarct and upward herniation 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u> and she died on the second day after admission. Whole body and brain autopsy was not performed.\n\n【26】**Fig. 4.**\n\n【27】Postoperative brain CT demonstrated progressive infarction and transtentorial upward herniation\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】We showed a woman who presented with only bilateral hearing loss without vertigo and vomiting caused by embolic occlusion of lower third of the BA. When hearing loss is due to vertebrobasilar occlusion, the prognosis is very poor. We suggest that patients with sudden bilateral hearing loss be subjected to MRI and MRA studies because they may reveal signs of life-threatening vertebrobasilar artery occlusive disease.\n\n【31】Sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss usually suggests an inner ear disorder, e.g. Meniere disease, acute labyrinthitis, autoimmune inner ear disease, or a perilymphatic fistula. Most sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss is unilateral. The reported incidence of vertebrobasilar ischemia in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss is approximately 1.2–8.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Vertebrobasilar artery occlusion was implicated in 6% of patients with acute sensorineural hearing loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>; 1.4% of patients with vertebrobasilar impairment presented with bilateral hearing loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Strokes associated with BA occlusion elicit numerous neurological symptoms or signs. Huang _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> reported 7 patients with bilateral sudden deafness due to vertebrobasilar occlusive disease, 4 of them suffered vertigo only at onset. We suspect that vertebrobasilar ischemia is often overlooked.\n\n【32】Our patient had no symptoms of brainstem and cerebellar involvement. Among vascular causes, ischemic stroke in the territory of the AICA, a branch of the BA, is the leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Usually the internal auditory artery (IAA) originates from the AICA and the inner ear receives its sole supply from the IAA. Strokes in the AICA territory have been shown to be associated with occlusion of a BA branch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 , 8 , 9 \\]</u>. At the time of admission to our hospital, our patient presented with only bilateral hearing loss without vertigo and vomiting, consequently, initially we did not suspect specific anomalies including vertebrobasilar impairment. However, angiography revealed occlusion of lower third of the BA.\n\n【33】Misery perfusion in the bilateral AICA territories was due to insufficient supply from the PcomA-mediated retrograde collateral pathway. Because the inner ear requires a high-energy metabolism and the IAA is an end artery with little collateral circulation from the otic capsule, the inner ear is particularly vulnerable to ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. The vestibular structure is relatively well supplied by a rich network of anastomosing vessels from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), the SCA, and the VA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>. AICA hypoperfusion associated with BA occlusion can result in selective damage and elicit cochlear dysfunction, leading to bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Our patient suffered acute progression of ischemia to the bilateral cerebellum and the pons of the posterior circulation and she manifested severe symptoms of brainstem involvement.\n\n【34】Many patients with vertebrobasilar occlusive disease have a poor outcome and experience truncal ataxia, quadriplegia, locked-in syndrome, coma, and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 18 , 19 \\]</u>. Before the onset of transient vertigo, nausea and/or tinnitus, 8–16% of patients with AICA territory infarction manifest acute audiovestibular disturbance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 , 20 \\]</u>. Therefore, especially older patients with sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss and episodic central nervous system symptoms or signs and a history of atherosclerosis or embolism must be carefully evaluated. Our patient had a history of untreated AF. The delivery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) has been the standard of care in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, rtPA must be administered within 4.5 h of stroke onset. To address acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion, endovascular treatment by mechanical thrombectomy has been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 , 22 \\]</u>. A meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 23 \\]</u> found that endovascular thrombectomy was effective when performed within 6–24 h after the onset of ischemic stroke as long as the region was still ischemic and not yet infarcted. There is no sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of this treatment in patients with BA occlusion. We found no recommendations for using both rtPA and endovascular thrombectomy at the posterior circulation in our patient. Yoon _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u> and Kim _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 25 \\]</u> reported that they obtained a good clinical outcome when they treated patients with a DWI-pc-ASPECTS of 6 or less by endovascular reperfusion therapy. Although endovascular treatment revascularized the vertebrobasilar artery in our patient, it was too late to prevent the expansion of irreversible ischemic damage. We suggest that the early diagnosis and proper management of audiovestibular events may provide a window to prevent the progression of infarction to larger areas of the posterior circulation.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】Ours is a rare case of sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss due to embolic occlusion of the vertebrobasilar artery, the AICA, and the PICA. The delayed diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the posterior circulation can be life-threatening. Therefore, an early diagnosis and the proper management of hearing impairment may provide a window to prevent the progression of infarction to larger areas of the brainstem and cerebellum. Clinicians must consider the possibility of vertebrobasilar occlusive disorder especially in patients with sudden bilateral hearing impairment, with risk factors for stroke and the manifestation of other neurologic signs.\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

At the time of admission, the patient showed signs of urinary sepsis, a poor overall condition, hemodynamic instability, tachycardia, hypotension, and needed vasoactive drugs. Initially the patient was treated with volume control ventilation. Then, ventilation was with conventional ventilation parameters described by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network. However, hemodynamic complications led to reduced airway pressure. Later she presented intraabdominal hypertension that compromised the oxygen supply and her ventilation management. Considering these records, an esophageal manometry was used to measure distending lung pressure, that is, transpulmonary pressure, to protect lungs. Initial use of the esophageal balloon was in a volume-controlled modality (deep sedation), which allowed the medical team to perform inspiratory and expiratory pause maneuvers to monitor transpulmonary plateau pressure as a substitute for pulmonary distension and expiratory pause and determine transpulmonary positive end-expiratory pressure. On the third day of mechanical respiration, the modality was switched to airway pressure release ventilation. The use of airway pressure release ventilation was associated with reduced hemodynamic complications and kept transpulmonary pressure between 0 and 20 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O despite a sustained high positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O.\n\n【5】### Conclusion\n\n【6】The application of this technique is shown in airway pressure release ventilation with spontaneous ventilation, which is then compared with a controlled modality that requires a lesser number of sedative doses and vasoactive drugs, without altering the criteria for lung protection as guided by esophageal manometry.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Esophageal pressure (Pes) measurement is a minimally invasive monitoring method used to assess respiratory mechanics in acute respiratory distress syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.

Pressure support was titrated to keep the spontaneous volume mobilized on the P-high close to 20% of its release volume, using the esophageal pressure graph to verify that it did not rise above 20 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O of transpulmonary pressure.\n\n【49】**Fig. 7**\n\n【50】PaO <sub>2 </sub> trend, PaO <sub>2 </sub> /FiO <sub>2 </sub> ratio, oxygenation index ventilatory modality. _AC/VC_ volume-controlled assisted modality, _AC/PC_ pressure-controlled assisted modality, _APRV_ airway positive pressure release ventilation, _Pes_ esophageal pressure\n\n【51】Full size image\n\n【52】Weaning\n-------\n\n【53】On the seventh day of mechanical ventilation, the patient was in the appropriate condition to initiate supported weaning (CPAP with added support pressure), using 11 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O mean airway pressure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 4 , day 6)</u>. Under these conditions, a low-support spontaneous ventilation test was conducted, showing a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) of 34 and 57, a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of –27 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, and airway occlusion pressure in the first 100 milliseconds (P0.1) of –2 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, alongside the application of a negative cuff leak test. Considering these indicators, the patient was extubated with no complications, and weaning was consolidated with the support of a high-flow nasal cannula. Once weaning was consolidated, the patient was taken to the intermediary care unit.\n\n【54】**Table 4 Respiratory therapy record—conventional mechanical ventilation with esophageal balloon and weaning**\n\n【55】Full size table\n\n【56】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【57】Although there is a general agreement on the reduction of tidal volume, plateau pressure, and driving pressure as key objectives of pulmonary care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, the most adequate way to determine positive end-expiratory pressure is still debated, as it has been for decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【58】There have been cases where healthy animals have suffered ventilator-induced lung injuries (VILI) when ventilation produces pulmonary overdistention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Although it is rare to reach such scores in clinical practice, note that in ARDS a substantial region of the lung is heterogeneous, inducing stress and involving the doubling of locally applied pressure as a possible side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although this is noteworthy and requires consideration when titrating mechanical ventilation, beneficial effects have been reported in several clinical studies when sufficient PEEP was used to drive transpulmonary pressure at the end of the expiration from a negative (indicating the closure or collapse of expiration) to a positive transition (indicating sustained permeability in this zone) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In the present case, PEEP titration aimed to achieve these objectives 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 3 , day 2, fifth round)</u>.\n\n【59】In other cases, the use of an esophageal balloon has been criticized since it does not directly measure pleural pressure in distant pulmonary regions. Yet results from a recent study indicate that esophageal pressure is reliably close to absolute pleural pressure throughout its isogravitational plane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. In addition to the above, the restrictive component of the thoracic cage is increased by the weight of abdominal and thoracic adipose tissue (BMI 29), exposing the need to investigate the contribution of thoracic elasticity to lung mechanics.\n\n【60】On the third day of mechanical ventilation, the patient was transferred to APRV, due to the potential benefits shown in a randomized clinical trial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> and based on empirical results at our center. This modality maintains spontaneous respiration, and esophageal pressure screening in SDRA patients can be relevant, since deficient or excessive spontaneous force levels can lead to lesions on the lungs and diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Secondly, calculated transpulmonary pressure is a useful indicator for clinicians to spot excessive spontaneous force-induced damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>, which can worsen lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Furthermore, when spontaneous effort toward the end of the inspiration takes place with considerable muscle relaxation, transpulmonary pressure can reveal transalveolar pressure (namely, the component for alveolar expansion) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Figure 4 shows indicators for transpulmonary pressure below 20 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O in APRV, which means that alveolar distention is even lower, despite maintaining a PEEP high of 20 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O.\n\n【61】A recent case report on the usefulness of esophageal manometry during APRV implementation concludes that if transpulmonary pressure during release is unknown, then programming is being done blindly without knowing the frequency of alveolar collapse, as the report shows a transpulmonary pressure drop to below 0 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O during expiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. In our study, the use of APRV did not show transpulmonary pressure drops below 0 cmH <sub>2 </sub> O, maintaining the pulmonary recruitment targets with esophageal manometry 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. This also allowed the team to maintain stable oxygenation targets without considerable alterations, as had occurred prior to the use of esophageal manometry, and achieve even greater stability during APRV 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 7 )</u>.\n\n【62】APRV requires spontaneous respiratory cycles and, as such, is associated with lower sedation levels. In this study, APRV use required the suspension of continuous midazolam infusion, raising the RASS from −5 to −3, while maintaining the administration of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 5 )</u>. The reduction in sedation was related to improvements in the hemodynamic profile parameters, likely due to an adrenergic rise and the spontaneous cycles that lead to intrathoracic pressure variation. The latter could cause increased venous return and preload, which can manifest itself in indexed intrathoracic blood volume from 999 to 1335 ml/m <sup>2 </sup> . This allowed for the suspension of continuous noradrenaline infusion while maintaining indexed systemic vascular resistance scores between 1070 and 1860 dyne seconds/m <sup>2 </sup> /cm <sup>5 </sup> 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6 A)</u> and cardiac index scores above 4.1 L/minute/m <sup>2 </sup> even after discontinuing dobutamine 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 6 B)</u>. These results are in line with the benefits described in the available literature on APRV use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【63】Asynchrony can worsen pulmonary lesions, as is the case in a “double trigger” event, where two consecutive inspirations are taken after a single respiratory effort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 20 \\]</u>, thus doubling supplied tidal volume (TV). Double trigger cases are more frequent in patients with a greater respiratory impulse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>. The adverse impact of asynchrony in patients on a ventilator is becoming more widely recognized, and the literature suggests a link between the rise of asynchrony and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. Conventional pressure and flow monitoring over time can hide much of the interaction between patients and respirators, but esophageal pressure data can help detect asynchrony more easily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Hence, careful monitoring of patient/ventilator interaction can help determine mechanical ventilation programming and sedoanalgesia levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Figure 4 shows that all the patient’s spontaneous efforts (negative deflection in the transpulmonary and esophageal pressure curve) are accompanied by supported ventilation or APRV mandatory cycles.\n\n【64】There is a growing need for research on APRV configuration considering its increased use. Since APRV involves spontaneous cycles, it allows for reduced sedation levels, improving adrenergic activity and diminishing vasoactive drug requirements 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 5 , 6 )</u>. This report shows the usefulness of mechanical ventilation programming for lung protection using transpulmonary pressure monitoring. The report also suggests the usefulness of invasive mechanical ventilation Pes monitoring, both in controlled modalities and those allowing spontaneous respiration, such as APRV.\n\n【65】It is important to note that the patient’s overall medical condition, hemodynamic compromise, and the consequent fluctuating sedation levels did not allow the team to maintain a single ventilating modality and a steady programming, which in turn would have allowed for a more complete temporal assessment and description of Pes monitoring. Additionally, there was no continuous quantification of esophageal catheterization indicators in modalities that allow spontaneous respiration, and they were merely monitored. Their quantification can be established by directly measuring the Pes and Ptp pressure/time curve. However, these data were not recorded, and as such, the study only exemplifies their usefulness in APRV.\n\n【66】This report describes Pes monitoring in different modalities. Further studies are required to better understand its use in patients who require the titration of their mechanical ventilation programming, both in controlled modalities and those allowing spontaneous respiration. However, it is necessary to perform introduction, calibration, and corroboration techniques to adequately position the esophageal balloon, both through gentle external manual epigastric compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, and occlusion or Baydur tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ABGs:</u>\n\n【71】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Arterial blood gas test</u>\n\n【72】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AC/VC:</u>\n\n【73】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Volume-controlled assisted modality</u>\n\n【74】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AC/PC:</u>\n\n【75】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pressure-controlled assisted modality</u>\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>APACHE II:</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute physiology and chronic health disease classification system II</u>\n\n【78】通用结尾删除-1:<u>APRV:</u>\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Airway pressure release ventilation</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ARDS:</u>\n\n【81】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</u>\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ARDSNet:</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acute respiratory distress syndrome network</u>\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>B.E.:</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Base excess</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BPM:</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Breaths per minute</u>\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CPAP:</u>\n\n【89】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Continuous positive airway pressure</u>\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>FiO <sub>2 </sub> :</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Fraction of inspired oxygen</u>\n\n【92】通用结尾删除-1:<u>ICU:</u>\n\n【93】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Intensive care unit</u>\n\n【94】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MAP:</u>\n\n【95】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mean arterial pressure</u>\n\n【96】通用结尾删除-1:<u>NIF:</u>\n\n【97】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Negative inspiratory force</u>\n\n【98】通用结尾删除-1:<u>P.01.:</u>\n\n【99】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Airway occlusion pressure in the first 100 milliseconds</u>\n\n【100】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PEEP:</u>\n\n【101】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positive end-expiratory pressure</u>\n\n【102】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pes:</u>\n\n【103】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Esophageal pressure</u>\n\n【104】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PLend-insp:</u>\n\n【105】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transpulmonary pressure during end inspiration</u>\n\n【106】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PLend-exp:</u>\n\n【107】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transpulmonary pressure during end expiration</u>\n\n【108】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ptp:</u>\n\n【109】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Transpulmonary pressure</u>\n\n【110】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RASS:</u>\n\n【111】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale</u>\n\n【112】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RSBI:</u>\n\n【113】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rapid shallow breathing index</u>\n\n【114】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SpO <sub>2 </sub> :</u>\n\n【115】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Pulse oximetry saturation</u>\n\n【116】通用结尾删除-1:<u>SaO <sub>2 </sub> :</u>\n\n【117】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Arterial oxygen saturation</u>\n\n【118】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VILI:</u>\n\n【119】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ventilator-induced lung injuries</u>\n\n【120】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VT:</u>\n\n【121】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Tidal volume</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "54cd7a11-dccf-4d4d-97ad-f08a43bcfc6d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Therapy must be adapted for people with type 1 diabetes to avoid exercise-induced hypoglycemia caused by increased exercise-related glucose uptake into muscles. Therefore, to avoid hypoglycemia, the preexercise short-acting insulin dose must be reduced for safety reasons. We report a case of a man with long-lasting type 1 diabetes in whom no blood glucose decrease during different types of exercise with varying exercise intensities and modes was found, despite physiological hormone responses.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A Caucasian man diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 24 years performed three different continuous high-intensity interval cycle ergometer exercises as part of a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02075567). Intensities for both modes of exercises were set at 5% below and 5% above the first lactate turn point and 5% below the second lactate turn point. Short-acting insulin doses were reduced by 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. Measurements taken included blood glucose, blood lactate, gas exchange, heart rate, adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, glucagon, and insulin-like growth factor-1. Unexpectedly, no significant blood glucose decreases were observed during all exercise sessions (start _versus_ end, 12.97 ± 2.12 _versus_ 12.61 ± 2.66 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , _p_ \\= 0.259). All hormones showed the expected response, dependent on the different intensities and modes of exercises.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】People with type 1 diabetes typically experience a decrease in blood glucose levels, particularly during low- and moderate-intensity exercises. In our patient, we clearly found no decline in blood glucose, despite a normal hormone response and no history of any insulin insensitivity. This report indicates that there might be patients for whom the recommended preexercise therapy adaptation to avoid exercise-induced hypoglycemia needs to be questioned because this could increase the risk of severe hyperglycemia and ketosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】A precise match in the rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) ensures euglycemia during physical activity and exercise in healthy individuals. In people with type 1 diabetes, hormone responses and the accompanying effects on blood glucose levels are impaired because of autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, resulting in a mismatch in Ra and Rd. Shetty _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u> found an inverted U-shaped relationship between exercise intensity and glucose requirement investigated via glucose infusion rate in a euglycemic clamp. In line with valuable reviews 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>, it is suggested to adapt therapy to avoid exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Three possible strategies have been identified to reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> insulin reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> supplementation with extra carbohydrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the combination of insulin reduction and carbohydrate ingestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, stable blood glucose levels during different intensities and types of exercise, accompanied by physiological hormone responses, in people with type 1 diabetes have not been reported in any studies.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】Our patient was a Caucasian man with long-lasting type 1 diabetes (age 31 years, body mass index 23.8 kg m <sup>−2 </sup> , C-peptide 0.00 nmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 60 mmol mol <sup>−1 </sup> \\[7.6%\\], diabetes duration 24 years) was switched to insulin degludec (Tresiba®; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) for study purposes (once-daily injection, 19 U/day in the evening) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. A run-in period of 4 weeks ensured optimal ultra-long-acting insulin therapy. Before adaptation to insulin degludec, the patient was receiving insulin glargine (Lantus®; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) as a basal routine (twice-daily injections, 5 U in the morning and 18 U in the evening). The patient was treated with insulin lispro (Humalog®; Eli Lilly Australia, West Ryde, Australia) with a carbohydrate factor of 1 U of insulin lispro per 12 g of carbohydrates; a correction factor of 1 U of insulin lispro lowers blood glucose by 2.8 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> .\n\n【12】The patient showed normal signs for the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. The results of skin and lymph node palpation examinations were normal. No signs of neuropathy were found, and the patient was free of any comorbidities. The results of urine microalbumin and retinopathy screening were negative. The patient’s blood pressure after 5 minutes of resting was 118 mmHg (systolic)/74 mmHg (diastolic) at the screening visit. Laboratory assessment revealed normal results: C-reactive protein 5.71 nmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , aspartate aminotransferase 0.4 μkat L <sup>−1 </sup> , alanine aminotransferase 0.28 μkat L <sup>−1 </sup> , alkaline phosphatase 0.72 μkat L <sup>−1 </sup> , γ-glutamyltransferase 0.25 μkat L <sup>−1 </sup> , albumin 61.4%, natrium 137 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , potassium 4.4 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , magnesium 0.77 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , urea 12.14 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , creatinine 83.88 μmol L <sup>−1 </sup> , glomerular filtration rate 1.5 ml s <sup>−1 </sup> m <sup>−2 </sup> , and uric acid 392.6 μmol L <sup>−1 </sup> .\n\n【13】### Exercise testing\n\n【14】The patient performed a maximum incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer to determine exercise intensities for the continuous and interval exercise tests. The first lactate turn point (LTP <sub>1 </sub> ) and the second lactate turn point (LTP <sub>2 </sub> ) were identified by a linear regression break point analysis for the lactate concentration to power output curve. Low (L), moderate (M), and heavy (H) workload intensities for the continuous and interval exercises were set at 5% of the maximum power output (P <sub>max </sub> ) from the incremental exercise test below (L) and above (M) LTP <sub>1 </sub> and below (H) LTP <sub>2 </sub> . Intervals were set at the P <sub>max </sub> from the incremental exercise test for 20 seconds. For L, recovery duration ( _t_ <sub>rec </sub> ) was 120 seconds (work to rest ratio 1:6); for M, _t_ <sub>rec </sub> was 60 seconds (work to rest ratio 1:3); and for H, _t_ <sub>rec </sub> was 20 seconds (work to rest ratio 1:1). All exercises were performed for 30 minutes at the target workload at the same time of day, and each exercise session was separated by 1 week. The continuous and interval exercises were matched for total duration and mean workload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Short-acting insulin dose was reduced by 40% for the incremental exercise test, 25% for L, 50% for M, and 75% for H, 4 hours before the start of each exercise session. Additional details about this study were presented previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>.\n\n【15】### Measurements\n\n【16】Blood glucose and blood lactate concentrations were determined by taking capillary blood samples from the earlobe at all tests while the patient was at rest and during warmup, exercise, and recovery. Capillary blood samples were analyzed by means of an enzymatic method with amperometric monitoring (Biosen S-line®; EKF Diagnostics, Barleben, Germany). Gas exchange data were collected continuously during all tests, and 5-second average data were used for analyses (ZAN 600; nSpire Health, Oberthulba, Germany). The patient’s heart rate was measured beat-to-beat during all tests, and 5-second average data were used for calculations (PE 4000; Polar Electro Finland Oy, Kempele, Finland). Adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, insulin-like growth factor 1, and glucagon levels were measured using blood samples obtained from the cubital vein before the start of exercise, after 15 minutes of exercise, and at the end of each 30 minutes of continuous and interval exercise testing.\n\n【17】### Findings\n\n【18】The incremental exercise test resulted in a maximum oxygen uptake of 57 ml kg <sup>−1 </sup> minute <sup>−1 </sup> and a P <sub>max </sub> of 300 W. Absolute values of power output were 86 W at LTP <sub>1 </sub> and 205 W at LTP <sub>2 </sub> , respectively. Mean exercise intensities prescribed in relation to LTP <sub>1 </sub> and LTP <sub>2 </sub> , for both the continuous and interval exercises, corresponded to 71 W (24% of P <sub>max </sub> ) for L, 101 W (34% of P <sub>max </sub> ) for M, and 190 W (63% of P <sub>max </sub> ) for H. Short-acting insulin reductions at the start of the exercises resulted in blood glucose concentrations of 11.97 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (L), 15.75 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (M), and 14.43 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (H) for the continuous exercises tests, as well as 9.82 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (L), 13.87 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (M), and 11.95 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (H) for the interval exercise tests, respectively. Delta blood glucose levels (difference between start and end of the exercise) for the continuous exercise tests were 1.38 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (L), 0.00 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (M) and −0.57 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (H), as well as 0.73 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (L), −0.03 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (M), and 0.65 mmol L <sup>−1 </sup> (H), for the interval exercise tests. Normal hormone responses were found, as displayed in Fig. 1 . Furthermore, normal responses in lactate, respiratory data, and heart rate were observed, as shown in Table 1 .\n\n【19】**Fig. 1**\n\n【20】Adrenaline, glucose, noradrenaline, cortisol, glucagon, and insulin-like growth factor 1 responses for the three different exercise intensities ( _solid line_ \\= low workload, _dashed line_ \\= moderate workload, _dashed-dotted line_ \\= heavy workload) for continuous exercise and high-intensity interval exercise in a single patient with type 1 diabetes exhibiting an atypical blood glucose time course during exercise.

Adrenaline and noradrenaline have been shown to be the main regulators to target for avoiding blood glucose decreases during high-intensity exercise due to increased rates of glycogen breakdown. Contrarily, our laboratory previously found a decrease in blood glucose concentration in all intensity domains of continuous and high-intensity interval exercise, which was found to be significantly related to exercise intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】Paradoxically, in our patient, during neither low- nor moderate- or high-intensity exercise did blood glucose decrease as expected, independently of the mode of exercise applied, despite other markers being found to be within normal limits. Although the patient’s catecholamine levels were comparable to the whole group investigated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and did not reveal exaggerated counteraction, no changes in blood glucose concentrations were observed. At first sight, no plausible causes for such a paradoxical response can be suggested, because the person injected his regular basal insulin dose, did not ingest supplemental carbohydrates, and did not have any known history of insulin insensitivity.\n\n【27】One hypothetical explanation might be impaired glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) translocation during exercise. Especially during low-intensity exercise, a significant increase in myosin heavy chain, type I, has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, which enhances muscular glucose uptake, accompanied by a decrease in blood glucose concentration in type 1 diabetes. Even so, a detailed mechanism of GLUT-4 response to muscle contraction is not yet fully understood, but it is assumed that upstream signaling pathways that lead to GLUT-4 translocation include 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, Ca <sup>2+ </sup> /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and nitric oxide synthase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. If one of these signaling molecules is inhibited, this could influence the blood glucose response during physical activity and exercise.\n\n【28】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of no blood glucose decrease during different types of exercise with varying exercise intensities and modes in a man with long-lasting type 1 diabetes, despite physiologically normal hormone responses were found. Exaggerated insulin dose reductions can cause hyperglycemia and may lead to development of ketosis during physical activity. Especially in people with type 1 diabetes who are performing high-intensity exercises on a regular basis (for example, sport games, interval training, competitive sports), stable or increasing blood glucose responses during exercise might raise the risk of life-threatening ketosis.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【30】For our patient, who did not respond even to low- and moderate-intensity exercise, we discouraged preexercise insulin dose reductions to avoid severe hyperglycemia and to minimize any negative impact of regular periexercise hyperglycemia on long-term glycemic control. From a clinical point of view, the finding in our study highlights the need to perform different types of exercise tests (incremental exercise test, continuous and interval exercises) in physically active people with type 1 diabetes. Depending on individual sports, this should be performed to avoid drastic hyperglycemic blood glucose excursions because there might be glucose nonresponders to low- and moderate-intensity exercise.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CE:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Continuous exercise</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>GLUT-4:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Glucose transporter type 4</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>H:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Heavy workload</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HIIE:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>High-intensity interval exercise</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>L:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Low workload</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LTP <sub>1 </sub> :</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>First lactate turn point</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LTP <sub>2 </sub> :</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Second lactate turn point</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>M:</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Moderate workload</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>P <sub>max </sub> :</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Maximum power output</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ra:</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rate of glucose appearance</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rd:</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Rate of glucose disappearance</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RER:</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Respiratory exchange ratio</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_t_ <sub>rec </sub> :</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Recovery duration</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VO <sub>2max </sub> :</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Maximum oxygen uptake</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography demonstrated a markedly distended gallbladder, measuring 16 cm x 8 cm, with oedema and pericholecystic fluid, consistent with gallbladder empyema. After an open cholecystectomy and an uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged on the 4 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day. On cut surface, a 2cm solid mass was identified, obstructing the lumen in the neck of the gallbladder. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry offered the diagnosis of an undifferentiated, giant cell type carcinoma of the gallbladder with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation infiltrated with osteoclast-like giant cells.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Undifferentiated, giant cell type carcinoma of the gallbladder with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation infiltrated with osteoclast-like giant cells is a very infrequent neoplasm. Controversy exists over its nature, as related knowledge remains incomplete. Thorough histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation is imperative for diagnosis. Due to their rarity, the biological behaviour and prognosis of these tumours remain unclear.\n\n【7】Introduction\n------------\n\n【8】The incidence of gallbladder carcinoma is 1.2 cases per 100 000 per year, increasing with age, particularly after the fifth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Risk factors include cholelithiasis, calcified gallbladder wall, adenomatous gallbladder polyps, obesity, oestrogen, choledochal cysts and chemical carcinogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>-通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Adenoma-carcinoma sequence is highly suspected for gallbladder cancer's aetiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【9】Mainly of epithelial cell origin, the majority of gallbladder carcinomas are adeno-carcinomas of varying degrees of differentiation. Other, less common histological types include clear cell, mucinous, squamous and adenosquamous cell, signet ring cell, small cell, spindle and giant cell, as well as undifferentiated carcinomas with the latter accounting for 10.4% to 10.9% of gallbladder carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Among undifferentiated gallbladder carcinomas, giant cell type carcinomas may also rarely be encountered; in such cases, it is assumed that anaplastic giant cell components may probably represent dedifferentiation of a pre-existing, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Moreover, several types of gallbladder carcinoma may contain a variable number of osteoclast-like giant cells differentiating their biological behaviour as well as prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. Here, we present a case of undifferentiated gallbladder carcinoma exerting an unusual immunophenotype that was shown to be of giant cell type with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation infiltrated by osteoclast-like multinucleated cells.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】An 84-year-old Greek man with an unremarkable medical history was admitted to our hospital with right upper quadrant pain, high fever, rigors, anorexia and weight loss over the preceding month. Clinical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant and a palpable gallbladder. Blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count and transaminases. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a markedly distended gallbladder, measuring 16 cm x 8 cm, with oedema and pericholecystic fluid consistent with gallbladder empyema 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>. Relying on the patient's clinical picture and the results of the imaging studies, a diagnosis of gallbladder empyema was made. Due to this diagnosis and the big size of the gallbladder, an open cholecystectomy was decided upon. No other abnormality was identified intra-operatively during the assessment of the peritoneal cavity, including lymphadenopathy and liver or peritoneal pathology. Based on the pre-operative as well as the intra-operative findings, open cholecystectomy was performed; no lymph nodes were excised. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged on the 4 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day.\n\n【13】**Figure 1**\n\n【14】**Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a distended gallbladder with oedema and pericholecystic fluid** .\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】On cut surface, a 2 cm firm mass obstructing the lumen in the neck of the gallbladder was identified. The mass was solid, yellowish-grey and granular with focal areas of necrosis. Under light microscopy, the tumour demonstrated invasion of the muscularis propria in some areas, with foci of necrosis and haemorrhage 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2A )</u>. No extension to the gallbladder serosa was found. Examination of multiple regions under light microscopy did not reveal any vascular invasion. Additionally, no evidence of carcinoma was present in situ.\n\n【17】**Figure 2**\n\n【18】**(A) Diffuse infiltration by tumour cells** . Invasion of muscularis propria is also present (x20). **(B)** Notice the pleomorphic hypochromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and scattered multinucleated hyperchromatic cells. Haemorrhage and necrotic areas are also present (x200). **(C)** Total immuno-negativity to anti-epithelial membrane antigen (x100).\n\n【19】Full size image\n\n【20】The neoplastic tissue consisted of diffusely arranged and focally syncytial large and pleomorphic tumour giant cells, with a significant infiltrating population of large multinucleated hyperchromatic cells. The giant tumour cells demonstrated hypochromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and severe mitotic activity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2B )</u>. Heterologous elements, such as osteoid and cartilaginous differentiated cells, were not identified. In addition, there was no evidence of any glandular structures. Following haematoxylin-eosin study and according to the morphology of the tumour cells, our differential diagnosis was one of undifferentiated sarcomatoid carcinoma, sarcoma or carcinosarcoma of the gallbladder.\n\n【21】Immunohistochemistry was performed using commercially available antibodies against epithelial, neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers. Secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidise-labelled polymer (Envision, Dako Carpinteria,CA, USA) 3' diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen, and finally the slides were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin. The results of immunochemistry stains are presented in Table 1 . The tumour demonstrated remarkable immunonegativity to epithelial markers such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), AE1/AE3 and only mild and focal positivity to CAM5.2 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 and Figures 2C and 3A )</u>. On the other hand, mesenchymal markers (vimentin, smooth-muscle actin: SMA) were strongly positive 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 , Figures 3B and 3C )</u>. The multinucleated cells showed positivity to CD68 stains 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Osteoclast-like giant cells were considered to be of histiocytic origin because of their PGM1 and KP1 positivity. Markers for neuro-endocrine tumours, lymphomas and melanoma were negative. The entire procedure was repeated by another technician for more reliability, with exactly the same results. Electron microscopy was not performed.\n\n【22】**Table 1 Results of immunohistochemistry**\n\n【23】Full size table\n\n【24】**Figure 3**\n\n【25】**(A) Focal immunopositivity to anti-cytokeratin CAM5** .2 (x400). **(B)** Intense staining to anti-vimentin (x100). **(C)** Positively stained tumour cells against anti-smooth-muscle actin (x400).\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Despite the negativity to almost all epithelial markers based on the monophasic tumour immuno-reactivity (that is, there was no evidence of two different components that would have lead to the diagnosis of a carcinosarcoma), the absence of heterologous components, and the focal positivity to CAM5.2 (which is a strong marker for the epithelial origin of a tumour), our final diagnosis was that of a primary, undifferentiated, giant cell type carcinoma of the gallbladder with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation infiltrated with osteoclast-like giant cells.\n\n【28】Following histopathological diagnosis, further thorough investigation did not reveal any abnormality confirming, thus, the diagnosis of a primary gallbladder neoplasm. The patient died 2 months after the operation from disseminated disease; particularly, head, chest and abdominal CT scans showed multiple brain, lung and hepatic metastases.\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】The patient in this case report presented with a clinical picture of a gallbladder empyema. This clinical diagnosis was furthermore supported by the radiological as well as the intra-operative findings. The diagnosis of gallbladder neoplasm was only made following histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen. The 2 cm solid lesion obstructed the lumen in the neck of the gallbladder, thus leading to the clinical presentation and the imaging and intra-operative findings of gallbladder empyema in our patient. Incidental finding of gallbladder carcinoma following cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, gallbladder empyema or even asymptomatic cholelithiasis has also been observed by others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>-通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Our case proved difficult to classify. The final histopathological diagnosis resulted from a combination of morphology and immunohistochemistry. The morphological characteristics were those of a tumour of epithelial origin. The positive response to CAM5.2, a strong epithelial marker, was an additional characteristic for a carcinoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2000 classification, undifferentiated carcinoma lacks glandular structures; in the presented case, there was no evidence of such structures, leading to the diagnosis of an undifferentiated gallbladder carcinoma. The neoplastic tissue consisted of diffusely arranged giant cells, with scattered multinucleated cells. The multinucleated cells were morphologically and immunohistochemically compared to those of primary giant cell tumours as well as to osteoclast-like giant cells and were shown to resemble the latter more closely. The unusual feature of the immunophenotype of the presented case is that, despite the epithelioid morphology, the tumour cells demonstrated only focal immuno-positivity to cytokeratins (CAM5.2) and, at the same time, strong positivity to mesenchymal markers (e.g. vimentin). This combination, showing a sarcomatoid dedifferentiation of the tumour, is very rare. A possible explanation for this unusual feature is that keratin expression may decrease, while vimentin expression may increase, as the tumour presents sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. The final diagnosis in our patient was therefore that of undifferentiated gallbladder carcinoma of giant cell type with osteoclast-like giant cells and sarcomatoid dedifferentiation.\n\n【32】Gallbladder carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells should be distinguished from giant cell carcinomas. The latter are composed of pleomorphic, undifferentiated giant cells with bizarre nuclei, showing immunohistochemical evidence of epithelial derivation, while displaying an identifiable transition between adenocarcinoma and giant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. However, in our case, there were no demonstrable foci of adenocarcinoma in the tumour. Furthermore, the malignant giant cells were immuno-negative to epithelial staining with only the focal staining with antiCAM5.2 suggestive of their probable histogenesis. CAM5.2 is a keratin mixture, containing a range of cytokeratins between 39 kd and 50 kd, which is a strong marker for the epithelial origin of a tumour.\n\n【33】Moreover, undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells are rare, mainly pancreatic and periampulary neoplasms that morphologically mimic giant cell tumours of bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 7 \\]</u>. The terminology, histogenesis and biological behaviour of these tumours remain controversial. Several carcinomas may contain a variable number of osteoclast-like giant cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>-通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In addition, some anaplastic, spindle and giant cell carcinomas of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts show numerous osteoclast-like giant cells that may simulate giant cell tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is crucial, however, to separate these two types of neoplasm because of striking differences in prognosis. Although prognostic significance of osteoclast-like giant cells is yet to be determined, a more favourable prognosis has been suggested for carcinomas in breast and pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 13 \\]</u>. However, further studies are required referring specifically to gallbladder cancer.\n\n【34】Epithelial, histiocytic or mesenchymal metaplasia has been suggested to explain the origin of osteoclast-like giant cells. Immunohistochemical analysis has demonstrated the giant cells to be of histiocytic origin lacking of epithelial differentiation. These findings may imply that osteoclast-like giant cells are a specialised form of macrophage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】To the best of our knowledge, only 4 cases of osteoclastic-like giant cells infiltrating a gallbladder carcinoma have been reported in the literature so far. The first were presented in 1992 by Grosso et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u> and Ito et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>, respectively. The neoplasm reported by Grosso et al. was an adenosquamous carcinoma and that by Ito et al. a giant cell tumour. Subsequently, two more cases were reported by Albores-Saavedra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u> and by Akatsu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>, respectively, in 2006, with the latter being an adenosquamous carcinoma. Like our patient, in the case reported by Albores-Saavedra et al. there was also focal cytokeratin positivity to CAM5.2 of the giant cells, and the osteoclast-like giant cells showed immunoreactivity for CD68. Therefore, our case represents the 5 <sup>th </sup> reported case of a gallbladder carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells, but the 3 <sup>rd </sup> case of undifferentiated giant cell type and the 1 <sup>st </sup> case exhibiting sarcomatoid dedifferentiation.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【37】Undifferentiated, giant cell type carcinoma of the gallbladder with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation infiltrated with osteoclast-like giant cells is a very rare neoplasm. Extraskeletal carcinomas exhibiting osteoclast-like giant cells have been suggested to represent a distinct clinicopathological entity with a more favourable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>-通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 13 \\]</u>. However, the clinical importance of the phenomenon remains unclear, owing to the rarity of such cases. Our patient died 2 months after the operation from disseminated disease. Poor prognosis could not be associated with the presence of osteoclast-like giant cells, as in our case, the undifferentiated carcinoma showed dedifferentiation with sarcomatoid features probably representing a highly virulent phenotype.\n\n【38】Consent\n-------\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

Over 90% of all insulinomas are benign. Cystic insulinomas are also rare. It is not difficult to determine the site of such neoplasm, as cystic insulinomas are usually 4–10 cm in diameter. We present the case of a patient with a histologically confirmed cystic insulinoma diagnosed after approximately 10 years of hypoglycaemia symptoms. This case is unique because of the small size (2.2 cm) of the tumour. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was useful for localizing this tumour.\n\n【2】Peer Review reports\n\n【3】Introduction\n------------\n\n【4】Pancreatic endocrine tumors are rare lesions, with a reported incidence of four cases per 1 million patients a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Of these lesions, insulinomas are the most common. The majority of patients diagnosed with an insulinoma are between 30 and 60 years of age, with women accounting for 59 % of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Most insulinomas are sporadic in their origin. They are more likely to be multiple in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors rarely manifest cystic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Cystic neuroendocrine tumors are difficult to diagnose preoperatively because the majority of these tumors are non-functional, and computerized topography (CT) does not differentiate these tumors from other cystic neoplasms. Cystic neuroendocrine tumors represent a subgroup of pancreatic cystic and neuroendocrine tumors with malignant potential. Their high resectability rate further supports the role of surgical exploration and resection in the treatment of a pancreatic cystic neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Insulinoma tumors are often difficult to detect as the symptoms largely precede occurrence of a visualized tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Cystic insulinomas are rare, with only a few cases having been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【5】In our case report we point out the difficulties in diagnosing a small cystic insulinoma. Diagnosis of insulinoma could be difficult if the functional activity is incomplete, possibly leading to blunted symptoms of hypoglycemia. Our case shows the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasound for localizing a small cystic tumor from other pancreatic lesions.\n\n【6】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【7】A 51-year-old male (BMI 27.5 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) was admitted to hospital due to recurrent episodes of confusion, light-headedness, chills, palpitations and shakiness for more than eight years. He typically experienced these symptoms after extensive physical activities.\n\n【8】The patient's past medical history indicated hypertension and he was taking an ACE inhibitors. There was about a history of alcohol abuse in the past. There was no family history of hyperparathyroidism, ulcer disease or hypoglycaemia, but his father had had hypertension.\n\n【9】He underwent a 72 hour-fast test, interrupted after 36 hours due to neuroglycopenic symptoms (plasma glucose 2.4 mmol/l, insulin 21.1 mU/l (n.r. 1–20 mU/l), C-peptide 1.5 nmol/l (n.r. 0.3–0.7 nmol/l)). During the course of the fasting his blood was checked with GC-MS (Gas/Mass Chromatography) for oral hypoglycaemic drugs and was positive on tolbutamide. Both he and his family denied any intake of oral antidiabetic preparations, but there were no further hypoglycaemia attacks in subsequent days in the hospital.\n\n【10】One year later, during a second episode of hospitalization, the test on tolbutamide during the _72 hour-fast_ was repeated and the result was negative. This time the fasting was interrupted after 8 hours (plasma glucose 1.8 mmol/l, insulin 16.3 mU/l). C-peptide suppression test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u> showed good suppression of C-peptide (46%). Abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and EUS were negative. He refused surgical exploration of the pancreas and on that occasion he was prescribed diazoxide. He started the treatment but terminated it after a while on his own accord. In the meantime between the second and the third episodes of hospitalization three years later, he experienced hypoglycaemia symptoms with similar frequency and his health insurance sent him back to hospital for further assessment after a car incident.\n\n【11】During his latest hospital visit, a 72 hour-fast test was interrupted on the first day after 5 hours (glucose 1.5 mmol/l, insulin 31.4 mU/l, C-peptide 2.1 nmol/l). This time C-peptide suppression test was in favour of autonomous insulin secretion: 30 minutes 3.53% suppression, 60 minutes 3.83% suppression, 90 minutes 20% suppression. MRI was again negative. A selective pancreatic arteriography showed a focal avascular lesion in the body of the pancreas near the tail. EUS confirmed a lesion in the pancreatic body near the tail and no other lesions. It was a cystic lesion measuring 2.28 cm in diameter with a very thick wall measuring 3–4 mm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【12】**Figure 1**\n\n【13】Endoscopic ultrasonography showing a cystic tumour in the pancreatic body (Olympus GIF-130 video echo-endoscope with 7.5/12 MHz switchable radial probe).\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】He was operated on and a 2.5 × 2 × 2 cm well bounded tumour, weighing 4 grams, was removed from the pancreas body 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figure 2 )</u>. There was no evidence of gross invasion, abnormal lymph nodes or liver metastases. Pathological evaluation revealed a well differentiated insulinoma with fibrous connective tissue and cystic formation of 8 mm in diameter in the middle of the tumour. The tumour consisted of small nests of homogeneous, cylindrical tumour cells without any cytological atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of insulinoma 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig 3 )</u>. Seven days after the operation, the patient was discharged with normal glucose profiles. Ten months after the operation the patient is still free of the previous symptoms.\n\n【16】**Figure 2**\n\n【17】Postoperative finding: 2.5 × 2 × 2 cm well bounded tumour, weighing 4 grams, cystic formation of 8 mm in diameter in the middle of the tumour.\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Figure 3**\n\n【20】Insulinoma.

It is also likely that the chronic course of this disease is the consequence of the small size of the tumour. Insulinoma tumours are often difficult to detect as the symptoms largely precede occurrence of a visualizable tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In the case of this patient, all three fasting tests were positive although the time of the interruption was shortened over time. C-peptide suppression test could have been helpful but in our case on two occasions we obtained two different results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Cystic endocrine tumours of the pancreas rarely occur, and only a few cases of cystic insulinomas have been reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Diagnosis of insulinoma could be difficult if the functional activity is incomplete, possibly leading to blunted symptoms of hypoglycaemia and failure of laboratory investigations to provide evidence of hyperinsulinemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. A clinical case of cystic insulinoma was recently reported by histological examination after surgery, characterized by a high intracystic insulin concentration despite normal blood basal levels of the hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In that case it was suggested that cystic formation within a solid endocrine neoplasm may be due to haemorrhage and necrosis of tumour cells with disruption of tissue planes, leading to cyst development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> or that these slow-growing tumours develop a fibrous capsule, which eventually decreases the blood supply to the tumour leading to infarction and liquefaction necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. The evolution of cysts can occur in small tumours and suggests that haemorrhage may be the inciting event.\n\n【24】Generally ultrasound (US), CT, angiography and transhepatic portal venous sampling (THPVS) have been widely used in the preoperative localisation of such tumours with various rates of accuracy of localisation reported by investigators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The results of non-invasive-imaging techniques, in general, have been discouraging. Sensitivities ranging from 9 to 63% and from 16 to 72% have been reported for US and CT scanning, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Higher sensitivity (ranging from 36 to 91%) has been reported for angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. The best results have been obtained by THPVS along the pancreatic vein: a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91% were reported by Vinik 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Some centres use preoperative endoscopic ultrasound which has reported accuracy rates of 60–90% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Lesions in the tail of the pancreas may be missed using endoscopic ultrasound; however, these lesions are usually easily identified intraoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. Approximately, 40% of all insulinomas are not localised preoperatively, and between 3 and 10% remain occult even after intraoperative palpation and the use of intraoperative ultrasound 通用删除7(英):<u>(3,4)</u>. Portal venous sampling was not necessary preoperatively, even in the case of occult insulinoma. This invasive technique, although helpful, cannot give precise anatomical localisation and indicates only the region of the pancreas from which the excess insulin secretion emanates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Localisation of an insulinoma with laparoscopic ultrasonography has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【25】Some authors consider endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to be the single most important preoperative localisation study needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. EUS allows high resolution imaging of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. It is accurate for pre-operative localization of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, mainly insulinomas, and it is a good alternative to other more invasive methods. The images of the inner structure of cystic lesions that this modality provides are not only more accurate, but also displayed in fine detail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】However, the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions by EUS is still very difficult. Although fasting tests confirmed autonomous insulin secretion in our patient, angiography finding of a vascular area in pancreas did not indicate that the EUS visualized cystic tumour in the pancreas was an insulinoma.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【28】The differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions by EUS is still very difficult. Although fasting tests confirmed autonomous insulin secretion in our patient, the angiography finding of a vascular area in the pancreas did not indicate that te EUS visualized cystic tumour in the pancreas was an insulinoma. In our case report we point out the difficulties in diagnosing a small cystic insulinoma if the functional activity is incomplete, possibly leading to blunted symptoms of hypoglycaemia. As far as we know this is one of the few reported cases of a small cystic insulinoma.

Extraintestinal manifestations of _C. difficile_ infections, however, are rare. Here we present a case of _C. difficile_ appendicitis in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 53-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room for two days of lower abdominal pain associated with nausea and subjective fevers. He otherwise denied having diarrhea or hematochezia. He did not have any recent hospitalizations, nursing home stays, or antibiotic exposure. His past medical history was notable for stage III tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma for which he was status post tonsillectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (cisplatin 4 days prior to presentation). He was afebrile with tenderness to palpation in the bilateral lower quadrants, right greater than left. His white blood cell (WBC) count was 15.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/μL. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed marked edema and inflammation of the cecum and ascending colon as well as an enlarged appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes with a small amount of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. He was treated non-surgically with antibiotics. He did not clinically improve and on hospital day 3, he developed diarrhea for which _C. difficile_ stool polymerase chain reaction was sent. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed progression to pan-colitis and persistent appendicitis. _C. difficile_ testing later resulted positive, for which oral vancomycin was started. The patient markedly improved with medical management alone and was subsequently discharged on oral vancomycin.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Our case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for _C. difficile_ in a patient presenting with both appendicitis and colitis, with prompt diagnosis and treatment being essential.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】_Clostridium difficile_ ( _C. difficile_ ) is an anaerobic, gram-positive spore-forming bacillus that is commonly found as part of the human colonic flora. It is one of the most common causes of healthcare—associated infections in the United States, with recent estimates suggesting an estimated 450,000 individuals affected annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. While _C. difficile_ infection (CDI) is commonly associated with colitis, extraintestinal manifestations account for just 0.17% of cases, with many of these patients having significant comorbidities, a history of prior antibiotic use, and/or concurrent intestinal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Given the paucity of data, the role of _C. difficile_ in the pathogenesis of extraintestinal infections remains unclear. Here we present a rare case of _C. difficile_ appendicitis in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 53-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room for two days of lower abdominal pain associated with nausea, non-bilious vomiting, and subjective fevers. He otherwise denied having diarrhea, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria. He did not have any recent hospitalizations, nursing home stays, or antibiotic exposure. He denied recent travel, sick contacts, or dietary changes. His past medical history is notable for stage III tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma for which he was status post tonsillectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (cisplatin 4 days prior to presentation).\n\n【12】He was afebrile (36.9 °C) with a pulse of 110 beats per minute and blood pressure of 134/94 mmHg. Physical exam was notable for a non-distended abdomen, tenderness to palpation in the bilateral lower quadrants (right greater than left), and no rebound or guarding.\n\n【13】Laboratory examination was pertinent for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.6 × 10 <sup>3 </sup> cells/μL (reference range 4.5–10 cells/μL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 24 mg/dL (reference range 8–20 mg/dL), creatinine of 1.35 mg/dL (reference range 0.64–1.27 mg/dL), and lactate 2.6 mmol/L (reference range 0.5–2.2 mmol/L). Computed tomography (CT) with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis showed marked edema and inflammation of the cecum and ascending colon as well as an enlarged appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes with a small amount of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. The patient was fluid resuscitated and started on broad spectrum antibiotics with cefepime and metronidazole. Surgery was consulted due to concern for appendicitis. They deferred surgical intervention given that it was unclear if this represented colitis with secondary inflammation of the appendix rather than a direct appendiceal source. Conservative treatment with antibiotics was recommended with plans for operative management if the patient failed to improve.\n\n【14】On hospital days 1–2, the patient continued to have significant abdominal pain, which started to localize more to the right lower quadrant. He continued to deny any diarrhea and remained afebrile. His WBC count remained elevated, but his creatinine improved after fluids. On hospital day 3, the patient started having diarrhea for which _C. difficile_ testing was sent. Because the patient was not clinically improving, repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u> was performed which showed progression of his colitis, now extending from the cecum to the rectum as well as findings concerning for appendicitis as seen on the prior CT scan. _C. difficile_ testing was positive for which the patient was started on oral vancomycin. On hospital days 4–6, the patient’s symptoms and exam markedly improved with normalization of his WBC count. Surgery continued to recommend non-surgical management given significant clinical improvement with antibiotics alone. The patient was discharged on hospital day 7 with oral vancomycin.\n\n【15】**Figure 1**\n\n【16】Coronal ( **a** ) and sagittal ( **b** ) CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrating enlargement of the appendix with wall thickening and enhancement (red arrows). Periappendiceal inflammation is also present (yellow arrow)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】Discussion\n----------\n\n【19】Extraintestinal CDI is rare and has been described in only a limited number of reports. Examples of extraintestinal manifestations that have been reported include bacteremia (with one patient having _C. difficile_ isolated in an abdominal aneurysm), intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, cellulitis, reactive arthritis, osteomyelitis, brain abscess, and empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Acute appendicitis is another one of the rare extracolonic manifestation of CDI as we have described here in our case. From review of the literature, there have been very few reported cases of _C. difficile_ appendicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【20】_C. difficile_ has generally been known as a pathogen responsible for colitis, particularly in the setting of prior antibiotic or hospital exposure. Recent chemotherapy is also another important risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, which was the case in our patient as he was actively undergoing treatment for his tonsillar cancer. It has been hypothesized that the disruption of the gut microbiota allows for the proliferation of toxigenic _C. difficile_ and subsequent infection. _C. difficile_ colitis is a process mediated by bacterial release of Toxins A and B, whose role is to inactivate members of the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which leads to colonocyte death, inflammation, and loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The pathogenesis of extraintestinal CDI, however, remains unclear. However, given his concurrent pancolitis, it is likely that direct spread of _C. difficile_ from the intestinal lumen resulted in his appendicitis. This is in opposition to _C. difficile_ isolated from distant sites described in other case series, where it is thought that bacterium enters through blood circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【21】Two possible mechanisms for _C. difficile_ appendicitis have been suggested: direct infection from the toxin itself versus obstruction of the appendiceal lumen from the adjacent colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is plausible that both of these processes play a role, as the luminal obstruction can lead to ischemia and compromise of the mucosal barrier, resulting in bacterial invasion of the appendix by intraluminal bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. When this occurs, a mix of aerobic and anaerobic organisms, particularly _Escherichia coli_ and _Bacteroides_ spp. are typically implicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, as opposed to _C. difficile_ which is exceedingly uncommon as detailed in our case.\n\n【22】We should also note that the role of _C. difficile_ in causing extraintestinal infections have been questioned. One case series showed that many isolates were either part of polymicrobial flora or intra-abdominal fluid collections near the colon in the setting of recent fecal spillage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Furthermore, it has been found that not all extraintestinal _C. difficile_ isolates produce toxins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, which is essential in the pathogenesis of _C. difficile_ colitis as discussed above (therefore, culture, while the most sensitive test for _C. difficile_ infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, has largely been replaced by methods that detect toxigenic strains). While it is certainly possible that the patient’s _C. difficile_ colitis (as confirmed by stool PCR testing) and his appendicitis represented distinct and unrelated processes, the clinical presentation, radiographic features, and overwhelming response to _C. difficile_ directed antibiotic therapy suggests that _C. difficile_ was the most likely underlying etiology.\n\n【23】Given the rarity of _C. difficile_ appendicitis, no specific treatment guidelines exist. We performed a literature review to explore the demographics, management, and outcomes of those with _C. difficile_ appendicitis 通用删除1(英):<u>(see Table 1 )</u>. Using PubMed, we searched for articles with both keywords of “clostridium difficile” and “appendicitis,” which yielded 25 results. We reviewed each individual article further to ensure that the case report was of appendicitis that was attributable to _C. difficile_ . We reviewed a total of six cases of _C. difficile_ appendicitis and found that none of the patients were immunocompromised. Interestingly, five out of the six cases of _C. difficile_ appendicitis involved patients over 50 years-old. All six patients initially survived; however, one had a recurrent episode leading to septic shock and death. Three patients eventually underwent surgical intervention, two of which survived. Management was not specified in two of the cases. As described above, we, in conjunction with our surgical colleagues, opted for medical therapy alone given the patient’s significant clinical improvement. We should note, however, that given the limited number of reported cases, further studies on optimal treatment is still needed.\n\n【24】**Table 1 Literature review of cases of _C. difficile_ appendicitis**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】Acute appendicitis is a rare extraintestinal manifestation of CDI. While the exact pathogenesis remains unclear, its significance cannot be overlooked. Our case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for _C. difficile_ in a patient presenting with both appendicitis and colitis, as prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Not applicable.</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_C. difficile_ :</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Clostridium difficile</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cell</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BUN:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Blood urea nitrogen</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CDI:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>_C. difficile_ Infection</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

He had no remarkable family or medical history, except for hyperuricemia and overactive bladder. Due to a clinical suspicion of renal cell carcinoma, laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was clear cell renal cell carcinoma, sized 30 × 25 × 24 mm.\n\n【12】Follow-up computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass between the internal oblique muscle of his abdomen and transverse muscle of his abdomen in 2014.

A 5-cm skin incision was performed, and the fascia of his obliquus externus abdominis muscle was cut. The tumor was resected with his internal oblique and transverse abdomen muscles. We set the tumor margin at 5 mm using ultrasonography. Since the tumor adhered to his peritoneum, it was resected with the peritoneum.\n\n【23】The tumor was composed of cells with clear cytoplasm and contained solid cell nests that were separated by a prominent sinusoidal vascular network 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 4 )</u>. The pathological diagnosis was metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【24】**Fig. 4**\n\n【25】Microscopic findings (hematoxylin and eosin). **a** ×12.5; **b** ×200\n\n【26】Full size image\n\n【27】Discussion\n----------\n\n【28】Laparoscopic procedures have developed rapidly over the past decade. In T1 and T2 renal cell carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery now shows the same survival and recurrence rates as open surgery. Port site metastasis is sometimes reported, especially in cases of gallbladder cancer (7 to 17%), colorectal cancer (5%), and gynecological cancer (4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】In urothelial cancers, port site recurrence has been reported in a total of 13 cases, as reviewed by Micali _et al_ . in 2004: the incidence was 0.12% (13 of 10,912) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. Of these 13 cases, there were four metastatic adrenal carcinomas, four urothelial carcinomas, three nephron-ureterectomy cases of upper urothelial carcinoma, one case of retroperitoneal lymph node resection for testicular cancer, and one case of lymph node resection for penile cancer. Their study included 2604 laparoscopic radical nephrectomy cases and 555 laparoscopic partial nephrectomy cases, but no port site recurrence was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Recently, Song _et al_ . reported port site metastasis in a total of 16 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. Our case was initially diagnosed as pT1a, G1 > G2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma and carried quite a low risk compared to the previous report.\n\n【30】According to the pertinent literature, most reported cases were margin-positive cancer, no-wrap removal, or ruptured tumors. In addition, among these cases, most were high-grade carcinoma (Fuhrman grade 3). Compared with previously reported cases, our case was low-grade carcinoma and had no technical problems, and the tumor was removed using a collecting bag without rupture. Three candidate mechanisms have been proposed, as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> The cancer cells attached to the surgical devices adhere to the laparoscopic port, gradually proliferating at the port site, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> carbon dioxide gas induces immunosuppressive condition at the site, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> cancer tumors are introduced to the port site via carbon dioxide gas and attach and adhere to the site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Yasuda _et al_ . hypothesized that most cancer cells may have originated from sealing devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. To prevent the attachment of cancer cells, collecting bags are recommended. In cases with ascites, laparoscopic surgery is not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】For port site metastasis renal cell carcinoma, surgical resection, medical treatment, and radiotherapy have been reported. However, no consensus on the optimum treatment has been achieved. In general, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, when possible, complete surgical resection is suggested as the gold standard treatment. For non-organ metastatic port site metastasis, a long recurrence-free survival has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】It is important to consider the possibility of Schloffer tumors in the differential diagnosis for port site metastasis. Schloffer tumors develop due to a reaction against a foreign body, such as surgical stitches, at the site of incision. This benign inflammatory tumor builds up from a few months to a few years after surgery. PET-CT is occasionally performed to differentiate port site metastasis from Schloffer tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In the present case, due to the rare incidence of port site metastasis after radical nephrectomy, CT, ultrasonography, and PET-CT were performed to detect the nature of the tumor. The tumor showed marked size progression on CT, a hypervascular nature on ultrasonography, and the uptake of FDG on PET-CT; tumor resection was performed without a fine needle biopsy due to the hypervascular nature of the tumor.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【34】Here we reported a rare case of port site metastasis that was successfully treated 7 years after laparoscopic nephrectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The bacterium has been isolated in a few reported cases of neurosurgical infections and patients with end-stage cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, and community-acquired urinary tract infections. Limited information exists in developing countries, however, because of the lack of advanced microbiological tools for identification and characterization of this bacterium. This case report describes the isolation of a rare _Pseudomonas_ bacterium in a patient presenting with sepsis and skin infection.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 1-year-old girl was presented to a hospital in the northeastern part of Ghana with a 1-week history of pustular rashes on her scalp and neck, which occasionally ruptured, along with discharge of yellowish purulent fluid. The child is of Mole-Dagbon ethnicity and hails from the northern part of Ghana. _Pseudomonas oryzihabitans_ was identified in the patient’s blood culture using the 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing technique. The rash on the patient’s scalp and skin resolved after continuous treatment with gentamicin while her condition improved clinically.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】This finding suggests the potential of this bacterium to cause disease in unsuspected situations and emphasizes the need to have evidence for the use of the appropriate antibiotic in clinical settings, particularly in rural settings in Africa. It also brings to the fore the unreliability of conventional methods for identification of _Pseudomonas_ bacteria in clinical samples and thus supports the use of 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid in making the diagnosis.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】_Pseudomonas oryzihabitans_ is the current name of a non-lactose-fermenting bacterium that used to be called _Chromobacterium typhiflavum_ and _Flavimonas oryzihabitans_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. The species name _typhiflavum_ was originally described by Dressel and Stickl as a variant of typhoid bacillus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. The bacterium is gram-negative and oxidase-negative with typical yellow-pigmented colonies visualized on agar media. It is thought to survive in moist environments, especially rice paddies, although some researchers have cultured cases from inhalational therapy equipment and hospital sinks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 , 4 \\]</u>. The organism has rarely been implicated as pathogenic in humans and often is not given serious attention in clinical practice.\n\n【10】Since the 1970s, when the first case of bacteremia in a neurosurgical patient with extradural cerebral hemorrhage secondary to _P. oryzihabitans_ was reported, other researchers have identified the pathogen in patients with cancer, end-stage cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, and community-acquired urinary tract infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. _P. oryzihabitans,_ unlike the other forms of _Pseudomonas_ bacteria (for example, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , and _Burkholderia cepacia_ ) is susceptible to quinolones, carbapenems, β-lactamase inhibitor drugs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. Treatment algorithms for managing _P. oryzihabitans_ are not available in Ghana and many other developing countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. We report a case that is of significance because of the rare occurrence of this pathogen, the unique microbial characteristics of the bacteria, the age of the child involved, and the consequential clinical outcome.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 1-year-old girl was presented to a hospital in the northeastern part of Ghana with a 1-week history of pustular rashes on her scalp and neck, which occasionally ruptured, along with discharge of yellowish purulent fluid. The child is of Mole-Dagbon ethnicity and hails from the northern part of Ghana. The patient had also experienced recurrent episodes of fever for 3 days, which had been controlled with the use of acetaminophen. The child had no known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis, or other underlying medical condition and lived with her parents, whose primary occupation was farming. The child lives in a rural area about 20 km from the hospital. On examination, the patient weighed 8 kg, was pale and febrile with a temperature of 39.7 °C, and well-hydrated. Her heart rate was 132 beats per minute, and her heart sounds were normal. Her lungs were clear, and her respiratory rate was 35 breaths per minute. A provisional diagnosis of sepsis and malaria was made.\n\n【13】Pending the results of laboratory tests of collected blood, urine, and stool samples, the patient was empirically treated with 270 mg of intravenous cefuroxime three times daily and 40 mg of intravenous gentamicin daily for 48 hours. Intravenous artesunate 24 mg was also administered for the first 24 hours 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【14】**Table 1 Timeline of treatment**\n\n【15】Full size table\n\n【16】Complete blood count investigations showed a hemoglobin concentration of 6.6 g/dl and a total white blood cell count of 8800 cells/μl (lymphocytes 52.1%, neutrophils 37.4%). The result of a malaria rapid diagnostic test was positive for malaria. The patient was given a hemotransfusion of 240 ml of whole blood over a period of 4 hours.\n\n【17】Results of both urine and stool cultures were negative for any bacterial growth. The blood culture sample was flagged as positive after 24 hours of incubation in an automated BD BACTEC 9050 blood culture system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and a Gram stain of the culture broth revealed gram-negative rods. The broth was subcultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated at 37 °C and 30 °C. Growth characteristics at 37 °C were poor, with grayish nonhemolytic colonies on blood agar and nonlactose fermentation on MacConkey agar. Plates incubated at 30 °C showed good pure growth on MacConkey agar and nonhemolytic colonies on blood agar. Results of biochemical investigations were negative for oxidase and urease and positive for citrate. The isolate was subjected to analytical profile index (API) 20NE and 20E (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France), which yielded unacceptable results.\n\n【18】Molecular identification was performed by extracting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a pure culture of this bacterium using SpheroLyse DNA extraction kit (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified using the primer pair 8F and 1492R 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The polymerase chain reaction conditions and the subsequent steps of Sanger sequencing we used were based on those described by Liu _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. The resulting 16S rDNA sequence was checked using DECIPHER (version 2.2.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to verify that it was not a chimera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>.\n\n【19】The procedure for molecular phylogenetic inference was based on that described by Ku _et al_ . 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Briefly, the 16S rDNA sequence of the isolated strain was used as the query for sequence similarity search against the GenBank 16S rDNA sequence database. Highly similar sequences representing closely related species were selected for phylogenetic inference. All sequences were aligned using Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>, and the resulting multiple sequence alignment was used to infer a maximum likelihood phylogeny using PhyML (version 3.0) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. The bootstrap support values were inferred based on resampling 1000 iterations.\n\n【20】The isolated strain reported in this study was found to be most similar to _Pseudomonas oryzihabitans_ IAM 158 \\[GenBank accession NR\\_115005\\] with nucleotide sequence identity of 1455/1460 (99.7%). The molecular phylogeny also indicated that the new sequence is clustered with other _P. oryzihabitans_ strains, which strongly supports the findings displayed in Fig. 1 .

The isolate was found to be susceptible to co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin but resistant to ampicillin and cefuroxime. The rash on the patient’s scalp and skin, as well as her temperature spikes, resolved after continuous treatment with gentamicin, and her condition improved clinically. She was discharged on flucloxacillin and folic acid therapy 1 week after admission. A final diagnosis of septicemia secondary to bacterial skin infection with malaria coinfection was made.\n\n【25】Discussion\n----------\n\n【26】_P. oryzihabitans_ is a rare bacterial isolate that has been linked to meningitis, endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, and infection with other organisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 15 \\]</u>. The pathogenicity of _P. oryzihabitans_ is still a subject of debate in the scientific community, hence the need for adequate information to enable clinicians and public health practitioners to manage episodes associated with this pathogen.\n\n【27】Although it might be difficult to determine to what extent the severity of our patient’s illness was due to malaria or sepsis, the presence of the rare pathogen _P. oryzihabitans_ in the blood in our patient is of importance, being the first such case reported from West Africa and only the second in sub-Saharan Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. It is possible that the pustular rashes provided an entry route for the bacteria directly from the environment, and the patient eventually progressed to sepsis. It is also possible that the child might have been exposed through skin bites or minor abrasions, either in the house or upon visiting her family’s farm. Our patient’s case is similar to one reported in South Africa, which occurred in a 4.7-year-old child who had been diagnosed with kwashiorkor, sepsis, and anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Six cases of skin and soft tissue infections caused by _P. oryzihabitans_ have been reported in patients with a previous histories such as surgery, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, trauma, bites, and lactation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Although we did not perform an immunological immunodeficiency test for our patient, the result of a screening test for HIV antibody was negative, thus ruling out possible immunodeficiency disease associated with her illness.\n\n【28】An important feature we observed was the unique microbiological characteristics of this bacterium and the failure of the API to accurately identify the pathogen.

Historically, LCH has been classified as a unifocal disease, multifocal unisystem disease, or multifocal multisystem disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. LCS is a rare neoplasm exhibiting aggressive features that carries a poor prognosis. We report a case of a patient with a presentation with symptomatic multisystem multifocal LCH disease with early suggestion of leukemic transformation with particular sensitivity to growth factors. In addition to illustrating the refractoriness and poor outcomes of multisystem LCH in adults, specific events in this case highlight important characteristics of disease biology that warrant detailed discussion and exposition to a wider audience to raise awareness of this unusual entity and aid in the earlier identification of its potential complications.\n\n【10】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【11】A 42-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with acute onset of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and weight loss 3 months after LCH had been diagnosed on the basis of biopsy of an asymptomatic lesion on the left arm. His physical examination was pertinent for tender hepatosplenomegaly and multiple eczematous papular lesions on the trunk and extremities. His complete blood count (CBC) results and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were normal. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated herpes esophagitis and _Helicobacter pylori_ gastritis. Biopsies of the duodenum and esophagus showed involvement by LCH with features suggestive of LCS 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. The _BRAF V600E_ mutation was not detected. Imaging did not demonstrate any suspicious bone or central nervous system (CNS) involvement. His bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) showed no LCH or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was started on intravenous cytarabine 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> daily for 5 days every 4 weeks, which led to improvement but no resolution of his skin lesions or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. After four cycles, his therapy was adjusted to every 2 weeks in view of kinetic failure. This adjustment led to clinical improvement, but his LDH level continued to rise, leading to repeat BMBx performed after cycle 8, which showed no evidence of AML.\n\n【12】**Fig. 1**\n\n【13】Langerhans cell histiocytosis with progression to Langerhans cell sarcoma involving gastric and small intestine mucosa. Endoscopically derived biopsies of gastric and small intestine mucosa showed involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Pronounced pleomorphism, apoptosis, and mitotic figures were frequent, consistent with progression to Langerhans cell sarcoma ( **a** ; H&E stain, 1000× magnification). Neoplastic cells expressed langerin protein ( **b** ; 400× magnification), and a subset showed preserved expression of CD1a ( **c** ; 400× magnification). Langerhans cells were negative for S100. Ki67-based proliferative rate was estimated at 85% ( **d** ; 400× magnification). Although objective distinction between involvement by systemic Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Langerhans cell sarcoma is difficult, the pleomorphic features of the neoplastic cells, aberrant diminished expression of CD1a and S100, and high proliferative rate support designation as Langerhans cell sarcoma. The result of B-RAF testing was negative\n\n【14】Full size image\n\n【15】Three weeks later, he presented with acute left hemianopia resulting from an ischemic cerebrovascular accident. Workup demonstrated circulating blasts, spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). BMBx confirmed acute monoblastic leukemia with a complex karyotype. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed no additional mutations. The patient was started on induction 7 + 3 (daunorubicin/cytarabine), which led to transient resolution of skin lesions that quickly worsened by day 15. The lesions appeared as multiple erythematous papules and nodules throughout the back. Histological sections showed heavily epidermotropic and bandlike dermal infiltrates of leukemic cells in the dermis with pseudo-blisters formed by tumor necrosis 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. A subset of tumor cells showed features of Langerhans cells, including reniform nuclei and atypical large and hyperchromic nuclei 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>. Immunophenotyping revealed that the tumor cells were positive for langerin, S100, and CD1a with intratumoral heterogeneity and a Ki67 showing a nearly 80% cell proliferation rate 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 c, d)</u>. The tumor cells were also positive for CD56, CD117, and CD123 in a subset of cells. The immunophenotype supported both myelomonoblastic and Langerhans cell differentiation. Marrow cytogenetics detected t(13:14) in all tumor cells and additional structural abnormalities involving chromosomes 1, 8, 9, 10, and Y. In this particular context, the cutaneous lesions were best classified as cutaneous involvement of leukemia. Cytogenetic profiling with NGS showed nonsynonymous mutation p.E69K affecting the _PTPN11_ gene (SHP2), homozygous loss of _CDKN2A_ at 9p21, and a tumor mutational burden of 26%.\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】Punch biopsy of the skin showing superficial epidermal involvement by a hematopoietic neoplasm.

Intensive intrathecal therapy with methotrexate (MTX) was initiated twice per week for six cycles. The patient’s skin lesions and neurologic symptoms resolved with restaging consistent with complete remission. However, 1 week later, his skin lesions recurred, followed by recurrence of neurologic deficits that responded poorly to salvage therapy, including high-dose cytarabine, further intrathecal therapy, and CNS radiation.

Somatic mutations activating the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway are commonly observed in LCH, with _BRAF V600E_ mutation identified in over half cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. LCH is mostly described and studied in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Median age at the time of diagnosis is 1–3 years with an annual incidence of 3-5 cases per million persons per year in children and 1-2 cases per million persons per year in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u> LCH is further stratified into single-system disease with unifocal or multifocal involvement or multifocal multisystem disease with or without risk organ (marrow, liver, or spleen) involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 , 3 \\]</u>. The majority of adults present with multisystem involvement mostly characterized by osteolytic lesions, skin or mucocutaneous involvement, diabetes insipidus, and hepatosplenomegaly. CNS or GI compromise is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 , 10 \\]</u>. Prognosis correlates with extent of disease and degree of organ dysfunction, with more than half presentations with multisystem disease dying of LCH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 11 \\]</u>. LCS, reported mainly in adults, is extremely rare. Differentiation from LCH is challenging because immunophenotype is identical and diagnosis is based on overtly malignant pleomorphic appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 \\]</u>.\n\n【27】Therapy is extrapolated from pediatric studies and single-institution experiences because clinical trials in adults are lacking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. Although the commonly used pediatric approach with vinblastine and prednisone is acceptable, single-agent cytarabine or cladribine has been the preferred first-line option, mostly to minimize steroid-induced toxicity and neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. A review of the management of 58 adults with LCH demonstrated significantly higher response with cytarabine than with vinblastine/prednisone, which also presented worse toxicity with 75% grade 3–4 neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 \\]</u>. Recurrences in adults are common. Besides the use of other cytotoxic agents such as clofarabine, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated excellent, albeit transient, responses in patients with _BRAF V600E mutation_ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 \\]</u>. The role of consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant is unclear. A review of 87 patients with high-risk LCH who underwent allogeneic transplant demonstrated greater than 70% long-term survival with higher relapse rates with reduced-intensity conditioning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 20 \\]</u>. A literature review of LCS described dramatic variation in management from chemotherapy to surgery, radiation, or a combination of them. Chemotherapy regimens were CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)-based with mixed results. Survival was overall poor, 58% at 1 year, and outcomes were poorer in disseminated presentations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】Our case highlights the refractoriness of LCH in adults. Agents known to have activity in LCH demonstrated suboptimal responses. Attention to specific events during our patient’s presentation highlight important biologic characteristics of LCH. Molecular therapy was not possible, because no targetable mutation was identified. One central finding was the detection of LCS by EGD biopsy. Although our patient presented with symptomatic multisystem disease that required systemic therapy, the LCS component was minute. A more intensive first-line therapy was contemplated but was believed not to be indicated, considering that the presentation was mostly of LCH with a negligible LCS component with normal CBC, LDH, and BMBx. The best response was achieved after an AML induction/salvage regimen (cladribine, cytarabine, and filgrastim with idarubicin \\[CLAG-Ida\\]) that was intentionally chosen in view of the described activity of cladribine in LCH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 21 \\]</u>. One is left to wonder if our patient’s outcome would have been different had he received intensive induction chemotherapy for what was ultimately a presentation of myeloid sarcoma.\n\n【29】CNS involvement was another critical event. Although our patient had no suggestion of CNS involvement at initial staging, an ischemic cerebrovascular accident believed to be closely related to the DIC was the hallmark of presentation at disease progression/transformation to AML. Nonetheless, the most intriguing aspect of CNS involvement was the acute development of diplopia after the first dose of G-CSF administered as part of CLAG-Ida. The potential relationship between CNS involvement and G-CSF was highlighted during salvage, when the resolved diplopia recurred after a dose of pegfilgrastim. Numerous serum cytokines, including G-CSF, have been associated with the pathogenesis of LCH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 , 23 \\]</u>. The timing between growth factor injection and development of neurologic deficits implies a potential correlation.\n\n【30】The homozygous loss of _CDKN2A_ at 9p21 was also an interesting finding when analyzing the cytogenetic profile of our patient’s tumor. In contrast to its counterpart of LCH, a recent study demonstrated frequent homozygous loss of _CDKN2A/B_ locus (9p21) and both _MAP2K1_ and _NRAS_ genes mutations in LCS, which may provide a future basis for potential targeted therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 24 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】In summary, LCH remains an exceedingly rare entity in adults, frequently presenting as multisystem disease with risk organ involvement. Although therapeutic targets such as _BRAF V600E_ mutations have been identified, therapeutic options remain limited. An intensive AML induction regimen should be strongly considered for LCH presentations with suggestion of an LCS component with cautious use of growth factors and particular attention to CNS involvement. In view of the limited number of effective therapeutic interventions, patients with refractory cases or atypical presentations of LCH and LCH-related disorders should be encouraged to enroll in one of multiple active clinical trials 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【32】**Table 2 Active clinical trials recruiting patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and related disorders**\n\n【33】Full size table\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This report does not contain any data.

This case suggests that hepatic portal venous gas without any signs of bowel ischemia or emphysematous gastritis can resolve without treatment, which is a finding that could be helpful for clinicians who deal with those supported by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding is widely used as a route for enteral feeding, hydration, and medication administration for patients with impaired swallowing ability, particularly in older patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Although PEG feeding provides the safest and most effective way to maintain a patient’s nutritional state and preserve long-term health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, it holds the potential for complications. Two common types of complications are those that occur immediately after the PEG insertion procedure, and those that develop over a longer period. For instance, pneumoperitoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, ileus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, esophageal and gastric perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>, and hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u> are reported as some of the complications that may occur immediately following PEG insertion. On the other hand, deterioration of the gastrostomy site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>, buried bumper syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>, colocutaneous fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, and complications related to tube feeding are classified as chronic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】HPVG may arise from several predisposing conditions such as bowel ischemia, elevation of digestive tract pressure, abdominal infection, or endoscopic procedures, among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. The mortality rate for HPVG with necrotizing colitis is approximately 75 % 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 12 \\]</u>, whereas the mortality rate for HPVG without necrotizing colitis is not as high, highlighting the importance of distinguishing whether cases of HPVG may be fatal or nonfatal particularly by ruling out necrotizing colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In terms of HPVG as a PEG-related complication, only cases of HPVG occurring immediately following PEG insertion have been reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 6 \\]</u>. HPVG after an endoscopic procedure is generally thought of as a benign complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>, yet there is little information available concerning the characteristics of HPVG as a chronic complication of PEG feeding.\n\n【11】We present here a case of HPVG that happened to be detected in a patient with a past history of stroke and enteral feeding via PEG; the PEG had been inserted more than 6 months ago. Given the fact that large numbers of older patients are supported by PEG, it is likely that clinicians may experience HPVG in patients with PEG tubes. The present case report highlights that HPVG occurrence may be an important point of consideration for those maintaining the health of patients with chronic PEG feeding.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】An 81-year-old Japanese man with a past history of stroke, hypertension, and dyslipidemia presented to our hospital because of respiratory failure. He had presented to the department of neurosurgery in our hospital 9 months earlier with a diagnosis of right cerebral infarction. He then developed left motor hemiparesis, left sensory deficit, and aphasia. He was operated on for PEG tube replacement (Button-type gastrostomy tube; Olympus Medical System Co. Ideal PEG Kit) by a gastroenterologist without complications 6 months before admission. Soon after the procedure he developed recurrent cerebral infarction and it became difficult to communicate with him. He had presented with aspiration pneumonia 3 weeks before the present admission. After being treated with antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks, he was discharged home 3 days prior to the present admission.\n\n【14】On admission day of the present case, he had developed diarrhea and begun vomiting in the morning. After vomiting, he had been well until the evening; however, he then went into respiratory failure. His family called emergency medical services (EMS), and he was transported to our hospital. On examination in our emergency room, his temperature was 38.6 °C, blood pressure 155/70 mmHg, his pulse was 125 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation of 94 % on 10 liters of ambient air per minute given by mask. On physical examination, crackles and wheezing were heard on bilateral lower lung fields, and there was no tenderness and peritoneal signs in all quadrants of his abdomen. Results of a laboratory examination showed pH 7.445, partial pressure of oxygen 82.9 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 37.5 mmHg, base excess 1.9 mmol/L, white cell count 16,830/μl, C-reactive protein 4.30 mg/dl, aspartate transaminase 29 IU/l, alanine transaminase 27 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 271 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase 224 IU/l, urea nitrogen 22.1 mg/dl, and creatinine 0.62 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) showed HPVG (diagnosed by appearance of branching lucencies within 2 cm of liver capsule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>) and gas within the wall of his stomach 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. A CT obtained 3 weeks before admission with diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia showed no HPVG and no gas within the wall of his stomach in the visualized portions of his upper abdomen 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>. He received a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy (ampicillin-sulbactam) for aspiration pneumonia, and feeding products were changed to another type. Follow-up CT on hospital day 14 showed HPVG and air within his stomach wall diminishing 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>. His respiratory condition gradually improved. He was discharged on hospital day 17.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】Computed tomography obtained on admission day showed hepatic portal venous gas ( _thick arrow_ ) and air within the gastric wall ( _thin arrow_ )\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Fig. 2**\n\n【19】Computed tomography obtained 3 weeks before admission with diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia showed no hepatic portal venous gas and no gas within the wall of stomach in the visualized portions of the upper abdomen\n\n【20】Full size image\n\n【21】**Fig. 3**\n\n【22】Follow-up computed tomography on hospital day 14 showed resolution of hepatic portal venous gas and air within the stomach wall\n\n【23】Full size image\n\n【24】Discussion\n----------\n\n【25】In the present case, HPVG arose in a patient supported by a PEG which had been inserted more than 6 months ago; his HPVG resolved without treatment.\n\n【26】The presence of a PEG tube may have induced HPVG through an increase of abdominal pressure due to vomiting. HPVG has several predisposing conditions, which include bowel ischemia, elevation of digestive tract pressure, abdominal infection, endoscopic procedure, gastric emphysema, and emphysematous gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 , 14 \\]</u>. In the present case, accumulations of gas within our patient’s stomach wall were found through a CT scan, leading to a diagnosis of gastric emphysema. Although it is impossible to confirm whether the presence of gastric emphysema in the present case was associated with HPVG, gastric emphysema is generally triggered by secondary mechanical injury of the stomach surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In addition, increased abdominal pressure due to vomiting before admission in the present case could have led to gastric emphysema via the PEG hole, although possible associations between gastric emphysema and PEG tubes have not yet been explored in the existing literature. While we cannot rule out other potential causes of HPVG, the above hypothesis is consistent with the clinical course of this case, and thus we find a high possibility for HPVG to have been associated with the PEG tube.\n\n【27】It appears that HPVG without any signs of bowel ischemia or emphysematous gastritis can resolve without any treatment in patients who are supported by chronic PEG feeding. HPVG was recognized to be fatal in the 1980s, yet recent increases in cases have demonstrated that non-symptomatic HPVG is not necessarily fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In the present case, there were no acute abdominal symptoms on physical examination, and a blood test showed pH 7.445, base excess 1.9 mmol/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 224 IU/l. In addition, CT did not indicate pneumatosis intestinalis or obvious digestive wall thickening. It was therefore judged that there were no signs suggesting bowel ischemia or emphysematous gastritis. While aspiration pneumonia was treated with antibiotics as well as suspension of tube feedings, specific interventions such as gastric decompression or gastrectomy were not carried out. PEG feeding was re-started 7 days after admission, and HPVG was found to be diminishing without sequelae in a CT scan taken 14 days after admission.\n\n【28】In recognition of the growing numbers of older patients supported by PEG, the Japanese government has enforced a new law to reduce the medical fees for PEG placement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. There are many patients with long-term PEG use, particularly among older patients, and chronic complications such as HPVG seen in this case may be experienced by clinicians caring for these patients. Excluding patients with a need for acute surgery, it may be possible for non-fatal HPVG to be resolved without aggressive treatment, as seen in the present case.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【30】We experienced a case of HPVG that happened to be detected in a patient with a past history of stroke and enteral feeding by PEG; the PEG had been inserted 6 months earlier. HPVG may be associated with use of PEG tubes, but can be resolved without any treatment in patients without symptoms of bowel ischemia or emphysematous gastritis.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CT:</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Computed tomography</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>HPVG:</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hepatic portal venous gas</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PEG:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

She was in the eighth week of gestation and had a history of previous uncomplicated term pregnancy and an early first-trimester abortion. Her body mass index (BMI) was 21.4 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , and she was suffering from unilateral right-sided pulsatile and throbbing occipital headache radiating to her ipsilateral half of the face since a week before her referral. Her headache intensity had increased since its onset, and simple analgesics had not been effective. She had no history of prepregnancy headache, and her only complaint during pregnancy was mild-to-moderate nausea and infrequent vomiting.\n\n【12】The patient had visited her obstetrician 2 days before presenting to the emergency department. The obstetrician had requested a nasopharyngeal COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with suspicion of COVID-19 infection due to the COVID-19 pandemic condition, despite lack of its other common signs and symptoms. However the result was negative. Upon her arrival, she was afebrile, in stable hemodynamic condition, and completely conscious. Neurological examination did not reveal any abnormal finding. Because of suspected cerebrovascular events, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain. On the brain MRI, a large parenchymal hematoma was observed in the right temporal lobe with peripheral white matter edema and 2 mm of midline shift. On the MRV, right transverse and sigmoid dural sinuses were engorged on the T2-weighted images and showed diffuse filling defects compatible with cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT).\n\n【13】There was thrombosis involving the right inferior anastomotic vein (Labbé vein), too. Small patchy areas of filling defects in the superior sagittal and left transverse and sigmoid sinuses were also seen in favor of partial thrombosis. Fortunately, deep cerebral veins seemed to be intact. However, the straight sinus was partially obliterated 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>. Hence, full anticoagulation began with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg, and levetiracetam 500 mg twice a day was added for seizure prophylaxis. In addition, acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours was administered for pain control. The next day, her headache severity was obviously decreased; no new-onset focal neurological deficit was found, but she experienced a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. Since she had been in touch with a COVID-19-infected person recently, we repeated the nasopharyngeal PCR test despite her first negative test result 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Patient’s brain MRI–MRV. The brain MRI (right) shows a large parenchymal hematoma in the right temporal lobe with peripheral white matter edema with 2 mm of midline shift.

Hence, we began remdesivir 200 mg intravenously, then 100 mg daily plus dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously twice daily. To confirm COVID-associated CVT, all the inherited and acquired thrombophilia (prothrombin gene mutations, methyl-tetrahydrofolate reductase mutations, anti-thrombin III deficiency, factor V Leiden, protein S and C level, and antiphospholipid antibodies) were checked, and no abnormalities were found. Our patient showed a gradual decrease in her white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet (Plt) count on serial complete blood counts (CBCs) during her first 4 days of admission, while her peripheral blood smear did not show any abnormalities 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 2 )</u>. All the viral hepatitis tests (hepatitis A, B, and C) were negative, and no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was evident on ultrasound imaging. Her blood group was O-negative, and direct and indirect Coombs test as well as Coombs–Wright test were also negative. Thus, the most probable reason for bicytopenia was COVID-19 infection or drug-induced adverse effects. Subsequently, we discontinued levetiracetam. Since then, WBC and Plt count began to rise. Our patient never complained of dyspnea, and her peripheral blood pulse oximetry always showed O <sub>2 </sub> saturation above 98%. The patient was discharged to home 6 days after her hospital stay without any complications; both fetuses had normal fetal cardiac activity, and no retroplacental hematoma was evident on ultrasonography. The patient had biweekly prenatal and monthly neurological visits during the first and second trimesters, followed by weekly visits in the third trimester. She underwent an uncomplicated cesarean section due to a cephalic-breech presentation twin pregnancy at 38 weeks of gestation, and both healthy newborns and the mother were discharged 72 hours postpartum. Full anticoagulation was continued according to neurological consultation for 6 weeks, then all thrombophilia tests were rechecked; as no abnormality was found, anticoagulation was discontinued.\n\n【20】**Table 2 Serial complete blood cell count (CBC)**\n\n【21】Full size table\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】It has been confirmed that COVID-19 affects mainly the respiratory system, but many other organs, including those of the nervous system, can be involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Thrombotic events are other clinical features of COVID-19 infection, but their exact mechanism has not been well understood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 , 11 \\]</u>. On the other hand, pregnancy and postpartum period predispose the patient to thromboembolic events. CVT often occurs in the third trimester or, more commonly, postpartum. Surprisingly, CVT occurred in our patient in the early first trimester. Although she had a twin pregnancy, among all other risk factors, she had only experienced mild-to-moderate nausea and infrequent vomiting episodes that had not led to hospital stay.\n\n【24】There was no history of thromboembolic events, stillbirth, or recurrent abortions in her first- or second-degree relatives, and all inherited and acquired thrombophilia assessments were negative, too. It seems that COVID-19 infection manifested with neurological symptoms initially while her PCR test was negative. However, after upper respiratory tract involvement and flu-like syndrome occurrence later on her second day of admission (9 days after neurological manifestation onset), the PCR test result returned positive. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that, as the patient had no complaints of lower respiratory tract involvement and her COVID-19 infection had been confirmed via nasopharyngeal PCR, no spiral chest computed tomography scan was performed, although minor or subclinical COVID-19 pulmonary involvement could not be ruled out definitively. However, as Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography were all unremarkable, no further imaging was done to investigate pulmonary thromboembolic complications.\n\n【25】Gunduz _et al._ also reported the case of a 35-week pregnant woman diagnosed with CVT and a positive PCR test result. She had no fever or respiratory symptoms and high level of fibrinogen and D-dimer (compared with our patient). Her MRI–MRV images revealed partial venous thrombosis in left transverse sinus, and her Plt count decreased from 107,000/μL to 67,000/μL (same as in our patient). Postpartum chest computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【26】In a study on 184 COVID-19-positive patients in intensive care unit, 31% had thrombotic events, highlighting the importance of thromboprophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Cerebrovascular events are acute complications of COVID, and cerebral stroke has been reported in 2–6% of hospitalized COVID-infected patients. In a retrospective study on 219 COVID-19 infected patients, Li _et al._ reported that 4.6% of the patients had cerebral ischemia symptoms and 0.5% had cerebrovascular hemorrhagic symptoms. These neurologic symptoms had occurred 10 days after the infection on average. These patients’ mean age was higher (75.7 ± 10.8 years versus 52.1 ± 15.3 years), and they had more cardiovascular risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>. However, in this current case, COVID-19 infection first manifested with neurological symptoms, and subsequently, upper respiratory symptoms appeared.\n\n【27】In their case series of COVID-19-related CVTs, Ostovan _et al._ found that four out of six patients had no respiratory symptoms and five out of six patients had clinical manifestations of CVT and COVID-19 infection concomitantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u>. In this presented case, the first nasopharyngeal PCR was negative, which might have been due to false negativity. Thus, it seems that there might be a relation between respiratory signs and risk of CVT, as observed in our case.\n\n【28】Understanding the mechanism of COVID-related thromboembolic events requires more investigations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The patients’ mean age is higher in COVID-related CVTs compared with non-COVID-related CVTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>. However, our patient was only 21 years old.\n\n【29】Schulz _et al._ also reported 62 patients with cerebral events in close temporal proximity to their COVID-19 vaccination. Of 45 CVT cases, 35 were women (77.8%), 36 patients were younger than 60 years old, intracranial hemorrhage was observed in four cases (6.4%), and nine cases (14.3%) had primary cerebral ischemia. The median time interval from the last administered vaccine shot to the first neurological complications was 9 days. They estimated an incidence rate of 6.5–8.8 cerebrovascular events per 100,000 people annually within 1 month from administering the first dosage. They also reported four patients with primary intracerebral bleeding without imaging evidence of CVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>. Our case had intraparenchymal hematoma and CVT concomitantly.\n\n【30】CVT during pregnancy most often involves the superior sagittal sinus, but it may occur anywhere in cerebral venous circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 18 , 19 \\]</u>. We documented complete right transverse and sigmoid sinuses, Labbé vein thrombosis, partial superior sagittal, left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and intraparenchymal hematoma in our patient.\n\n【31】We show a case of twin pregnancy combined with systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19 that resulted in cerebral vein thrombosis, which was followed by upper respiratory tract involvement later on.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【33】Headache is clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection that is easily neglected. However, as infection can predispose patients to cerebrovascular events such as CVT, it seems reasonable that during the COVID-19 pandemic any neurological complaints, even a simple headache in a young, low-risk pregnant woman, should raise clinical suspicion of life-threatening conditions such as cerebrovascular events. Proper diagnostic approach should be considered to prevent related mortality and morbidities.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article (and its additional information files)</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CVT:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cerebral vein thrombosis</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>BMI:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Body mass index</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PCR:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Polymerase change reaction</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRV:</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance venography</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CBC:</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Complete blood cell count</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>WBC:</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>White blood cell</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hb:</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Hemoglobin</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Plt:</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Platelet</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Up-to-date, there is no effective drug for treating COVID-19 despite many trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This resulted in an unprecedented race by pharmaceutical companies attempting to develop effective vaccines. Shortly after initiation of COVID-19 vaccination, a number of serious vaccine-related diseases such as myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>, and acquired hemophilia A (AHA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 \\]</u> were reported. As opposed to congenital hemophilia, AHA is a rare autoimmune disease due to the production of IgG autoantibodies to coagulation FVIII that burdens high morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The exact pathophysiology behind AHA remains uncertain, with a probable genetic predisposition, an association to certain underlying diseases (autoimmune disorders, respiratory diseases, allergic reactions, malignancies or hematologic malignancies) or to a triggering factor such as infections or pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. The diagnosis is difficult in front of the lack of history of bleeding. It is presumed mainly on identifying an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), even without bleeding and is confirmed by determining a FVIII inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. In this article we report a case of AHA occurring after an inactivated sinovac-coronavac COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【10】Case report\n-----------\n\n【11】A 69-year-old Tunisian male patient consulted the emergency department at the month of June, for severe left leg pain limiting physical mobility due to a 5\\*6 cm large ecchymosis located at the left inner thigh, having spontaneously appeared 5 days prior consultation and without notion of trauma.\n\n【12】The patient had no known personal medical history, a family history of gastric cancer (father) and no psycho-social relevant history. He had received the second dose of CoronaVac-SinoVac vaccine 30 days prior to consultation. The patient reported a small ecchymosis appearing and disappearing spontaneously 3 weeks after the vaccination.\n\n【13】Further physical examination at the the emergency department (ED) revealed the presence of two other ecchymoses: one at the inner face of the right forearm, starting at the wrist reaching the elbow, measuring 15 \\* 5 cm and the other at the left flank of the abdomen reaching the left iliac crest, measuring 40 \\* 12 cm 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 )</u>.\n\n【14】**Fig. 1**\n\n【15】Ecchymotic spot on the left flank of the abdomen reaching the left iliac crest\n\n【16】Full size image\n\n【17】Both of these were secondarily reported by the patient as having spontaneously started 5 days ago, with no context of trauma. Soft tissue ultrasound performed in regard of the initial ecchymosis at the left inner thigh because of a 5 cm-asymmetry between the two thigh sizes revealed a hyper echoic infiltration of soft tissue located at the left inner tight.\n\n【18】The complete blood count showed marcrocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin at 8.4 g/dl; mean corpuscular volume at 103 fl; mean corpuscular hemoglobin at 32 pg/cell, hyper-reticulocytosis at 130 000/mm <sup>3 </sup> and a normal platelet count at 475 10 <sup>9 </sup> /l.\n\n【19】The determination of Prothrombin Time (PT), of aPTT and of coagulation factors were performed by coagulometric technique on ACL TOP. In our patient’s case, coagulation tests showed an isolated prolonged a PTT (100 s) which was not corrected on the mixing study.\n\n【20】In front of the presumptive diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (AHA), treatment by systemic corticotherapy of 80 mg/die of prednisolone for 3 days was immediately initiated and switched by oral corticotherapy at the dose of 1 mg/kg. The patient received also tranexamic acid 3 g/die and red blood transfusion to correct the anemia. Bypass therapy was not considered if front of the absence of life-threatening bleeding.\n\n【21】In front of the patient’s age, the absence of history of bleeding or heparin-based treatment and the spontaneous occurrence of hematomas and ecchymoses associated with the isolated prolonged a PTT, specific determination of coagulation factors was conducted (available 13 days later), revealing an isolated decrease of factor VIII (FVIII) activity (F VIIIc equal to 1%).\n\n【22】FVIII deficiency was confirmed on two separate samples. The presence of an FVIII inhibitor was confirmed and titrated by the modified-Bethesada assay (BA) = 121 Bethesada units/ml, affirming the diagnosis of AHA.\n\n【23】The diagnosis of AHA was confirmed. After 17 days of corticosteroid treatment, the patient continued to show minimal improvement although the progressive shortness of aTTP and a course of rituximab 375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> weekly for four consecutive weeks was initiated.\n\n【24】To exclude possible secondary organic causes of hemophilia A, CT-total body was performed with no signs of malignancy. Screening for autoimmune (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-extractable nuclear antigen, anti-double-stranded DNA), lupus anticoagulant studies, and chronic infectious diseases also resulted negative. There was also no history of illicit drug intake or recent medication.\n\n【25】The patient was later discharged after the first dose of rituximab and followed-up weekly at the out-patient clinic. After the second dose of rituximab, we noticed a prolongation of a TTP without worsening of the hemorrhagic syndrome not leading us to the interruption of treatment given its delayed effect. Follow-up showed a significant clinical (healing of the ecchymoses and no reoccurrence of further signs of bleeding) and normalization of a PTT 18 days of treatment with corticosteroids associated with rituximab. The detailed therapeutic schedule along with the biological improvement trends over 63 days are displayed in Fig. 2 . There were no treatment-related adverse effects.\n\n【26】**Fig. 2**\n\n【27】Timeline treatment/aPTT\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】Discussion\n----------\n\n【30】AHA is a rare autoimmune disorder resulting from the production of autoantibodies against FVIII affecting mainly the elderly with an incidence of around 1.4 cases per 1.000.000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u> and leading to high morbidity and mortality especially if untreated. AHA should be suspected in front of an isolated prolonged a PTT with or without bleeding and confirmed by detecting a FVIII inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Mostly with no identifiably trigger (43.6% to 51.9% of cases) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>, AHA has been described to be associated with genetic predispositions, certain underlying diseases (such as autoimmune disorders, respiratory diseases and malignancies) and infections or pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>.\n\n【31】Up-to-date, there is no effective drug for treating COVID-19 despite many trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. This resulted in an unprecedented race by pharmaceutical companies attempting to develop effective vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. This promptitude along with the emergency use authorization accorded to many vaccine led people to question vaccination safety and policy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. In the literature, there have been many cases of AHA occurring after COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 , 7 \\]</u>. Evidence about the causality of COVID-19 vaccines in the occurrence of a particular auto-immune phenomena thus causing autoimmune still remains unclear and debated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>.\n\n【32】The strength of this study is that, to the best of our knowledge, it reports the first occurrence of AHA after an inactivated COVID-19 vaccination (Sinovac-CoronaVac). In this case, it occurred 30 days after the second dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine. Although it is very difficult to certainly conclude the causal relationship between the vaccines and AHA, and that the development of FVIII inhibitors post vaccination could be only a coincidental event, we believe that the association is valid in the reported case following a bundle of anamnestic, clinical, biological data as well as the timing between symptom-onset and vaccination. This is supported by absence of the common causes of AHA in our patient who did not have history of previous bleeding with negative autoimmune screen and no malignancies.\n\n【33】This study has some limitations. First, it reports the case of only one patient. Second, although the probable causal relationship between the AHA and the vaccine, eliminating a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was not possible retrospectively.\n\n【34】Currently, no post-vaccination surveillance programs recommends screening for clinical or biological signs of AHA, nor any other of the rare autoimmune disorders potentially linked to COVID-19 vaccines. Attention needs to be paid in the post-vaccine period mainly based on auto-surveillance. Apart from presentations with spontaneous or uncontrolled bleeding, clinicians must consider the diagnosis of AHA when faced with isolated prolonged a PTT. Treatment is focused on symptomatically treating any bleeding along with etiological treatment. In urgent situations such as uncontrolled bleeding, the administration of recombinant FVII activated or the activated prothrombin complex can help control bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 14 \\]</u>. The main treatment of AHA focuses on inhibitor eradication relying on immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, rituximab and cyclophosphamide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. In the current case, the patient was treated by low dose rituximab (100 mg/week for 4 weeks) associated with corticosteroids. This regimen is preferred than the standard dose (375 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) to limit occurrence of side effects, mainly neutropenia, potentially dangerous to the elderly who have increased sensibility to infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】This article further highlights potential safety concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Although benefits acquired from vaccination highly overweighs the risks, post-vaccine surveillance is important to detect potential uncommon side-effects. Clinicians should consider AHA in front of prolonged a PTT with or without spontaneous bleedings, which, without prompt treatment, could be a life-threatening disease.\n\n【37】Availability of supporting data\n-------------------------------\n\n【38】The dataset of the current study is available from the corresponding author upon motivated request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Depending on the anticancer drug used, temporary withdrawal may be recommended before and after surgery to avoid complications. Once a surgical incision has healed and closed completely, wounds rarely open because of the initiation of molecular targeted therapy several months to years after surgery. Here, we aimed to describe a rare complication of pharyngocutaneous fistula in two patients that was thought to be caused by molecular targeted therapy.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】Case 1 involved a 64-year-old asian man who developed a delayed pharyngocutaneous fistula 3 months after total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer. Ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor used for recurrent gastric cancer, was speculated to be involved. Case 2 involved a 71-year-old japanese man who developed a delayed pharyngocutaneous fistula 2 years and 1 month after total pharyngeal laryngectomy for pharyngeal cancer. It was speculated that imatinib, a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha inhibitor used for chronic myeloid leukemia, was involved.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Although the incidence of late drug-induced anastomotic leakage is very low, when it occurs, it makes oral intake impossible for an extended period and interferes with the appropriate cancer treatment. In this report, we demonstrate the details of these two patients with such a rare complication, which may help accumulate essential data on this topic.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】In recent years, cancer research has progressed significantly at the molecular level. Specifically, the development and clinical introduction of molecular-targeted agents directed at certain molecular mechanisms have been rapidly advancing. The development of molecular targeted therapy has contributed to prolonged survival of patients with several malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. In contrast, various adverse events peculiar to molecular-targeted agents, which are different from conventional cytotoxic anticancer agents, have been identified. For example, rashes and hand–foot syndrome are frequent adverse events, with an incidence of ≥ 80% characteristic of cetuximab and sorafenib, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. In addition, although the incidence is less frequent, serious adverse events, with an incidence of approximately 1.5–2%, such as gefitinib-related interstitial lung disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u> and trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, require attention and awareness.\n\n【10】Delayed wound healing is also a rare but severe and life-threatening adverse event caused by molecular-targeted agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 \\]</u>. Normally, when tissue is damaged, various wound healing factors are released to promote cell growth and angiogenesis, thereby regenerating the damaged tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are key factors that play important roles in the wound healing process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 , 9 \\]</u>. Therefore, delayed wound healing may occur if these factors are inhibited. In fact, the administration of bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, induces adverse events, such as anastomotic leak and fistula formation, resulting in delayed wound healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 , 11 \\]</u>. The incidence of such adverse events is low, approximately 1–2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. However, because these adverse events may cause serious consequences, the causative drug should be withdrawn 6–8 weeks before and after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 , 7 , 11 \\]</u>.\n\n【11】A few articles have reported molecular-targeted agent-induced diastasis of a surgical wound that healed and completely closed months to years after the surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 , 13 , 14 \\]</u>. Here, we report two cases of delayed pharyngeal cutaneous fistula considered to be caused by molecular targeted therapy.\n\n【12】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【13】### Case 1\n\n【14】A 64-year-old asian man received cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (FU) combined with radiotherapy (60 Gy, 23 fractions) for esophageal cancer in 2014. In January 2018, he received 70 Gy (35 fractions) chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin for laryngeal cancer. In June 2018, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for gastric cancer. In October 2018, total laryngectomy was performed for laryngeal cancer recurrence. There was no postoperative wound issue, oral ingestion was started 1 week after the operation, and the wound progressed uneventfully. Subsequently, gastric cancer recurred in November 2018, and combination therapy with ramucirumab and paclitaxel was initiated. In January 2019 (3 months after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started to leak saliva without any warning signs, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 a)</u>. A delayed pharyngocutaneous fistula, which appeared 3 months after total laryngectomy, was diagnosed. Although ramucirumab was discontinued because the adverse event was thought to be caused by the drug, the fistula continued to increase in size 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 b)</u>. It was managed with various conservative treatments, for example, antibiotics, discontinuation of oral intake, enteral feeding, and negative pressure wound therapy. In February 2019 (1 month after the development of the fistula), the fistula was closed using pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery. However, shortly after the operation, a new fistula appeared at a site different from the previous fistula. The new fistula was again treated with the same conservative approach. This conservative treatment was performed for approximately 7 months repeatedly for new fistulas, and a second pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery was performed in August 2019 (7 months after the development of the first fistula). There was no subsequent fistula relapse, but it took 8 months from the appearance of the first fistula to complete closure 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1 c)</u>. For 8 months, he was unable to orally ingest much of anything, nor could he receive chemotherapy for stomach cancer. In this patient, ramucirumab was administered for 2 months before the first surgery for recurrence of gastric cancer, and a pharyngocutaneous fistula developed 3 months after the total laryngectomy. The fistula was intractable, and complete closure was achieved after 8 months. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, underweight, and hypothyroidism were detected in the laboratory data 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. However, considering the late onset of 3 months after surgery, this case was judged to be a complication of ramucirumab, a VRGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】The fistula of Patient 1. **a** Pharyngocutaneous fistula (3 months after the total laryngectomy). **b** The fistula continued to increase despite discontinuing ramucirumab. **c** A complete fistula closure with two reconstructive surgeries (after 8 months from the first appearance of the fistula)\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】**Table 1 Laboratory data at the time of fistula formation in the two cases**\n\n【19】Full size table\n\n【20】### Case 2\n\n【21】A 71-year-old japanese man underwent subtotal tongue resection, cervical dissection, and flap reconstruction for oral cancer in March 2014. In April 2019, partial pharyngeal resection, total laryngectomy, cervical dissection, and flap reconstruction were performed for laryngeal cancer. Oral ingestion was initiated 1 week after the operation, and the procedure was continued without any wound complications. He later developed chronic myelogenous leukemia, and imatinib was administered in January 2021. In May 2021 (2 years and 1 month after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started leaking saliva without any symptoms, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 a)</u>. This was judged to be a delayed pharyngocutaneous fistula that appeared more than 2 years after total laryngectomy. Even after discontinuation of imatinib, the fistula continued to increase in size for 1 week 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 b)</u>, but it began to shrink 10 days after the drug was discontinued. The fistula closed 2 months after negative pressure wound therapy 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 c)</u>. In this patient, imatinib was administered for 2 months before surgery for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The pharyngocutaneous fistula showed delayed onset 2 years after the total laryngectomy. Mild anemia was detected in his laboratory data 通用删除1(英):<u>(Table 1 )</u>. Consequently, the case was judged to be a complication of treatment with imatinib, a PDGF receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor.\n\n【22】**Fig. 2**\n\n【23】The fistula of Patient 2. **a** Pharyngocutaneous fistula (2 years and 1 month after the previous surgery). **b** The fistula continued to increase despite discontinuing imatinib. **c** Complete closure of the fistula with conservative treatment by negative pressure wound therapy (2 months from the first appearance of the fistula)\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】Discussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\n\n【26】Pharyngocutaneous fistula is one of the major complications after laryngectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 , 17 \\]</u>, and the reported frequency of fistula ranges from 7.4% to 58.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 16 \\]</u>. However, the fistula typically occurs a median of 9–20 (range: 2–28) days after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 , 18 \\]</u>; thus, a pharyngocutaneous fistula that develops more than several months after surgery is extremely rare. In the usual occurrence of pharyngocutaneous fistulas, which develop in approximately 9–20 days, a metaanalysis indicated that prior radiation therapy exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 17 \\]</u>, anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 17 \\]</u>, positive surgical margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 17 \\]</u>, supraglottic subsite or hypopharyngeal tumor site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 , 17 \\]</u>, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 17 \\]</u> have been reported as risk factors. Meanwhile, only one case of fistula that developed a long time after the operation, similar to in our cases, has been reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. As mentioned above, in an unusual case of delayed fistula formation, it is difficult to apply the same risk factors involved in a normal pharyngocutaneous fistula formation. Therefore, in the present cases, a strong role of VEGF and PDGF inhibitors was considered in inhibiting wound healing.\n\n【27】When using molecular-targeted drugs that block signaling pathways related to VEGF and PDGF, which are essential for wound healing, the risk of wound complications must be considered. Drug suspension is recommended for approximately 2 weeks to 2 months before and after surgery, depending on the half-life of each drug, to avoid the risk of wound-related complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Wound healing may be difficult to achieve after surgery in patients who have already been administered this type of molecular targeting agent. In such cases, the risk of delayed wound healing can be assumed in advance, and surgery can be planned after a safe withdrawal period, thereby reducing the incidence of wound reopening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Conversely, in patients who were administered the agent after surgery, healed wounds may reopen because of drug administration.\n\n【28】However, as shown in the present cases, it is rare and difficult to predict the development of delayed-onset wound reopening due to a molecular-targeted drug in patients who underwent surgery months to years ago with complete closure of the surgical wound, even if the drug is associated with a risk of wound healing complications. Rare cases of delayed wound dehiscence caused by molecular-targeted drugs have been reported. Anastomotic leakage resulting from bevacizumab administration 33 months after surgery for colorectal cancer has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. A pharyngocutaneous fistula was reported to have developed 23 years after administration of cabozantinib after total pharyngeal–laryngeal esophagectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. In addition, the formation of a large deep ulcer was reported after imatinib administration in a patient with skin wounds, 4 years after the wounds healed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u>.\n\n【29】Ramucirumab, the drug used in the first case, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGFR and is used to treat recurrent gastric and colon cancers. A rare incidence of adverse events (1–2%) has been reported after ramucirumab administration, including delayed wound healing and fistula formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 19 , 20 \\]</u>. Imatinib, which is an inhibitor of PDGFR and is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, was used in the second case. A high incidence of skin disorders (edema and rash) because of imatinib administration has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 21 \\]</u>, but no reports on delayed wound healing or fistula formation incidence have been published. Imatinib has been shown to be effective in keloid scar treatment because it reduces fibroblasts and collagen formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 22 \\]</u>. It was speculated that imatinib use might result in delayed wound reopening because of the reduced number of fibroblasts and collagen in the wound.\n\n【30】Cancer cure rates have improved with the development of anticancer drugs, and the number of cancer survivors continues to increase. As a result of prolonged survival, the probability of suffering from multiple cancers in a lifetime and receiving various cancer treatments has also increased. In addition, in recent years, cancer treatment strategies have become more complicated because of the dramatically increased use of anticancer drug therapy. Adverse events associated with these treatments have also been complicated, and a new range of unexpected complications has been reported.\n\n【31】Anticancer drug therapy is administered along with measures against various adverse events. However, it may be possible to start anticancer drugs, such as VEGFR or PDGFR, for the treatment of new cancers different from the previous cancer treated by surgical therapy several months to years ago. In such cases, there is a concern that the drugs may be administered without evaluating the risk to the wound from the previous surgery. Although rare, anastomotic leakage makes oral intake impossible for an extended period and interferes with appropriate cancer treatment. The two cases in this report were drug-induced delayed-onset pharyngocutaneous fistulas. Detailed information on this very rare complication must be elucidated to appropriately increase awareness among healthcare professionals involved in cancer treatment.\n\n【32】In conclusion, drug-induced late-onset pharyngocutaneous fistula is rare. However, when it occurs, it significantly lowers the patients’ quality of life and is difficult to treat. Thus, it is indispensable to accumulate more data on such rare cases, and we believe that this report offers more insights into drug-induced late-onset pharyngocutaneous fistula.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Data sharing is not applicable to this manuscript as no datasets were generated.</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VEGF:</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Vascular endothelial growth factor</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PDGF:</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Platelet-derived growth factor</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VEGFR:</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>VEGF receptor</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PDGFR:</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PDGF receptor</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We observed a cluster of thigh swelling episodes in infants in which the cause was Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-related cold thigh abscess. We report this unusual case series to raise awareness about this diagnosis.\n\n【3】### Case presentations\n\n【4】We performed a retrospective review of five infants (four boys and one girl) who presented with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-related left thigh abscess. The swelling was noticed by the parents at a mean period of three months prior to presentation. The ages at presentation were five, five, eight and nine months for the boys, and six months for the girl. All of the patients were healthy Saudi infants, and received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine at birth. Clinically, all of the patients were well and did not demonstrate signs of systemic infection. All patients underwent needle aspiration, with subsequent incision and drainage in four of the five cases. The cultures obtained from the abscess fluids were the key to establishing the diagnosis. Only three patients (60%) received antituberculosis drugs. Wound healing lasted for a mean period of approximately seven months. Two-year follow-up was unremarkable for all of our patients.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】Technical errors continue to be significant in the development of vaccine-related complications.

We report five cases in which the erroneous injection of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly into the thigh lead to the formation of a cold thigh abscess.\n\n【10】Case presentations\n------------------\n\n【11】### Case 1\n\n【12】A six-month-old healthy Saudi girl presented with left thigh swelling that was noticed by her parents three months prior to presentation. The swelling slowly increased in size. There was no history of trauma or other illness. Our patient looked well and had normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a soft, fluctuant, nontender left thigh lesion with no overlying skin changes. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 21.9 ×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her left thigh revealed signs of hematoma. Needle aspiration of the lesion revealed serous, light yellowish fluids. Cultures of the aspirated fluids grew _Mycobacterium bovis_ . Our patient was put on isoniazid and rifampicin for six months by the pediatric infectious disease team. At the site of the needle aspiration, our patient developed a sinus that healed within six months, leaving a small scar. The two-year follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【13】### Case 2\n\n【14】A five-month-old healthy Saudi boy presented with left thigh swelling that was noticed by his parents three months prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma or other illness. Two weeks prior to presentation, the swelling markedly increased in size, and the overlying skin became erythematous. Our patient looked well and had normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a fluctuant, nontender left thigh lesion with overlying skin redness and no hotness. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC count of 31.1 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 20 mm/h. MRI of his left thigh revealed an abscess. Needle aspiration of the lesion revealed purulent fluids. Incision and drainage (I&D) of the abscess were performed during the same procedure. Cultures of the aspirated fluids grew _M. bovis_ . Our patient was put on isoniazid and rifampicin for six months by the pediatric infectious disease team. At the site of the I&D, our patient developed a sinus that healed within three months, leaving a small scar. The two-year follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【15】### Case 3\n\n【16】A five-month-old healthy Saudi boy presented with left thigh swelling that was noticed by his parents three months prior to presentation. The swelling slowly increased in size. There was no history of trauma or other illness. Our patient looked well and had normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a soft, fluctuant, nontender left thigh lesion with no overlying skin changes. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC count of 16.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and an ESR of 13 mm/h. An ultrasound of his left thigh indicated an abscess. Needle aspiration of the abscess revealed purulent fluids. I&D of the abscess were performed during the same procedure. Cultures of the aspirated fluids grew _M. bovis_ . Our patient was put on isoniazid and rifampicin for six months by the pediatric infectious disease team. However, the medications were stopped after three months because our patient developed an impaired level of consciousness. At the site of the I&D, our patient developed a sinus that became infected with _Pseudomonas_ and required another I&D procedure. Wound healing lasted for ten months, leaving a small scar. The two-year follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【17】### Case 4\n\n【18】A nine-month-old healthy Saudi boy presented with left thigh swelling that was noticed by his parents three months prior to presentation. The swelling slowly increased in size. Ten days prior to presentation, the overlying skin became erythematous, and the lesion increased in size. There was no history of trauma or other illness. Our patient looked well and had normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a fluctuant, nontender left thigh lesion with overlying skin erythema. Laboratory tests revealed an ESR of 55 mm/h. Needle aspiration of the lesion revealed purulent fluids. I&D of the abscess were performed during the same procedure. Cultures of the aspirated fluids grew _M. bovis_ . Our patient did not receive antituberculosis drugs. At the site of the I&D, our patient developed a sinus that healed within eight months, leaving a small scar. The two-year follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【19】### Case 5\n\n【20】An eight-month-old healthy Saudi boy presented with left thigh swelling that was noticed by his parents four months prior to presentation. The swelling slowly increased in size. There was no history of trauma or other illness. Our patient looked well and had normal vital signs. A physical examination revealed a fluctuant, nontender left thigh lesion with no skin changes. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC count of 23.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Needle aspiration of the lesion revealed purulent fluids. I&D of the abscess were performed during the same procedure. Cultures of the aspirated fluids grew _M. bovis_ . Our patient did not receive antituberculosis drugs. At the site of the I&D, our patient developed a sinus that healed within eight months, leaving a small scar. The two-year follow-up was unremarkable.\n\n【21】Discussion\n----------\n\n【22】Thigh swelling is a symptom of various benign and malignant conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 – 9 \\]</u>. Hematoma as a result of trauma, iatrogenic injection or coagulopathy is one of the causative disorders. Infections like cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis are other causes of thigh swelling in infants. Benign and malignant tumors can also present as thigh swelling. Differential diagnosis is not always easy, particularly if the causative disorder has not previously been reported.\n\n【23】In the first case, there was no history of witnessed trauma. The rest of the medical and family history was also unremarkable, making the diagnosis of hematoma less likely. There were no general or local sign of infection. Tumor was the most likely diagnosis on physical examination. MRI of her left thigh did not provide a clear answer but revealed signs of hematoma and indicated that needle aspiration be used for a final diagnosis. When the cultures grew _M. bovis_ , it became obvious that the abscess was a complication of BCG vaccination. However, the pathogenesis was not clear. The absence of skin scarring in the left upper arm above the deltoid muscle in our patients raised the possibility of inadvertent injection of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly into the left thigh instead of the intradermal administration into the left upper arm. Our patient was clinically well. However, the possibility of subclinical disseminated disease in this case and in the two subsequent cases was the justification for prescribing antituberculosis medications given by the pediatric infectious disease team.\n\n【24】In the rest of the cases, the possibility of a BCG-related cold thigh abscess was considered. The cultures of the aspirated fluids were the key to establishing the final diagnosis.\n\n【25】In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as per World Health Organization recommendations, the BCG vaccine is given to all healthy neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 , 10 \\]</u>. The technique involves the intradermal injection of 0.05 mL of the vaccine into the left upper arm. In our hospital, BCG vaccine is given to all healthy newborns three to four hours after birth intradermally in the left upper arm. The vaccine used is manufactured by Statens Serume Institut, Denmark. At the same time, 0.5 mL of hepatitis B vaccine is injected intramuscularly in one thigh and vitamin K into the other thigh. All these injections used to be given by one certified nurse in the same room and at the same time.\n\n【26】A review of the medical records revealed that all of these infants were vaccinated by the same nurse, who is certified and has experience. Investigations did not reveal how the error occurred; however, the only reasonable explanation is that the BCG vaccine was confused with the hepatitis B vaccine or vitamin K, and inadvertently injected intramuscularly into the left thigh instead of an intradermal administration into the left upper arm. The recommendation of the infection control and patient safety committees was to assign one nurse to give the BCG vaccine in an assigned BCG vaccination room and another nurse to administer the hepatitis B vaccine and the vitamin K in a different room and at an another time. Since that policy was implemented approximately three years ago, we have not had any similar cases.\n\n【27】The BCG vaccine is administered to 100 million children each year and is considered to be one of the safest vaccines available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 2 \\]</u>. Adverse reactions arising from the use of BCG vaccine in healthy infants are relatively uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 6 \\]</u>. Local and regional adverse reactions to BCG vaccinations include local swelling, abscess formation, ulceration, keloid formation and regional lymphadenitis. Such reactions occur at a rate of four-30 per 1000 vaccinated infants and comprise the majority (84%) of adverse reactions reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Local and regional adverse reactions are generally self-limiting and require no treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 , 3 \\]</u>. Systemic adverse reactions to the BCG vaccine are rare and include osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 4 \\]</u>. Disseminated BCG infection has been estimated to occur at a rate of 0.19-1.56 per million vaccinees and is associated with a high case fatality ratio of 80-83%. Disseminated BCG infection has almost exclusively occurred in individuals with severely compromised cellular immunity. However, it also has also been reported in healthy immunocompetent infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. Vaccine-induced extensive ulcerating vasculitis is also an extremely rare systemic adverse reaction to the BCG vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>.\n\n【28】The considerable variation in the number of adverse reaction reports from different countries is thought to be due to a number of factors, including the level of case finding and the diagnostic criteria employed, the route of administration and technique, the age and immune status of the vaccinees and the quality, strain and dose of the BCG vaccine delivered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 – 5 \\]</u>. Many reports have stressed the importance of technical factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 , 5 \\]</u>. One of these technical errors is subcutaneous administration of the BCG vaccine, which can result in localized abscess formation. Other technical issues involve incorrect reconstitution of the vaccine, incorrect selection of syringes and the use of the same syringe to vaccinate several children, leading to errors in dose.\n\n【29】To the best of our knowledge, BCG-related cold thigh abscess has not previously been reported in the English literature. In our case series, the only reasonable explanation for the phenomenon observed is the confusion of the BCG vaccine for the hepatitis B vaccine and/or vitamin K, and the inadvertent injection of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly into the thigh by the vaccinating nurse. The number of newborns that received the BCG vaccine intramuscularly into the thigh is unknown. It is also unknown how many of them developed local reactions and how many were treated at other centers. It is also unclear whether other factors, such as age of the vaccinees or the quality of the vaccine strain, played a role in abscess formation in our patients. Nevertheless, we think that the technical error of confusing the vaccines and administering the BCG vaccine intramuscularly played the main role in our reported cases.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【31】Correct vaccination techniques remain the most important factor in the prevention of vaccine-related complications. Different vaccines should not be given simultaneously by the same nurse in the same room. BCG-related cold thigh abscess as a result of erroneous administration of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly into the thigh is an extremely rare occurrence.\n\n【32】Consent\n-------\n\n【33】Written informed consents were obtained from the parents of our patients for publication of this case series.

Reported bone involvement of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) is in the femur (27%), pelvis (15%), tibia/fibula (13%), polyostotic (13%), humerus (12%), spine (9%), other (5%), mandible (2%), radius/ulna (1%), scapula (1%), and skull (1%).

Because malignant cells exhibit increased proliferation and glucose metabolism, PET/CT scans noninvasively detect a primary lesion and cancer metastasis in images by increased \\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]-FDG uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. This case report describes the detection of appendicular bone involvement of DLBL on whole-body bone scans and PET/CT scans.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 73-year-old Asian man who had gingival swelling of the labial area of the left maxillary lateral incisor presented to our institution. Initially, it was suspected of being a radicular cyst in the left maxillary sinus incisor. No other symptoms, including fever, cough, or dyspnea, were present. The patient had no family history of cancer. Laboratory data, including tumor markers and peripheral blood appearance, were all within the normal limits. The patient underwent excision of the swelling. A pathological examination revealed a highly pleomorphic large-cell proliferation. Immunohistochemistry was diffusely positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 and B-cell lymphoma 6 proteins. The patient’s Ki-67 index was approximately 80%. His tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD10, and creatine kinase. We diagnosed the tumor as DLBL with an immunohistological staining pattern consistent with germinal center B-cell derivation. PET/CT was performed to determine the stage. Increased FDG uptake in multiple masses and nodular lesions was evident, with maximum standardized uptake values of 12.15 in the left testis, 1.92 in the skin of the right chest, and 2.88 in the left ulna and the third metatarsal bone 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a and b )</u>. A bone scan performed to diagnose the bone lesions revealed multiple uptakes in the left ulna, hand, both tibiae, and the left foot 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2a )</u>. On the basis of the PET/CT result, left orchiectomy was performed for accurate histological diagnosis. The lesion was confirmed as DLBL. Axial and sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhanced signaling of lesions with soft tissue edema in the olecranon of the left ulna 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3a )</u>, the third metacarpal bone of the left hand 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3b )</u>, and the third metatarsal bone of the left foot 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3c )</u>. MRI findings prompted a diagnosis of lymphoma. Eight cycles chemotherapy were given according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone protocol plus external radiotherapy targeted to the involved bone sites for 5 months. Follow-up PET/CT 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1c )</u> and bone scan 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2b )</u> revealed the disappearance of hypermetabolism and decreased uptake in lesions compared with the previous images. Laboratory data were also all within the normal limits after chemotherapy.\n\n【13】**Fig. 1**\n\n【14】Images of a 73-year-old Asian man who underwent <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography for metastasis evaluation for malignant lymphoma. **a** and **b** Maximum-intensity projection images obtained by <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography shows focal hypermetabolic lesions (maximum standardized uptake values 1.92 \\[chest wall\\], 2.56 \\[olecranon of left ulna\\], 2.88 \\[left third metacarpal bone\\], and 12.15 \\[left testis\\]; _red arrows_ ), which were proven to be malignant lymphoma by histological and radiological examinations. **c** Follow-up <sup>18 </sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography after chemotherapy shows disappeared hypermetabolic lesions in the above-described sites\n\n【15】Full size image\n\n【16】**Fig. 2**\n\n【17】**a** Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy shows increased uptake in the olecranon of the left ulna, as well as the left hand and foot ( _red arrows_ ). **b** Follow-up technetium-99m bone scintigraphy after chemoradiotherapy shows decreased uptake in the third metacarpal bone of the left hand ( _red arrow_ )\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】**Fig. 3**\n\n【20】**a** Axial and sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images show an increased signal mass in the olecranon of the left ulna ( _red arrow_ ). **b** Axial and sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images show an increased signal mass in the third metacarpal bone of the left hand ( _red arrow_ ). **c** Axial and coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images show an increased signal mass in the third metatarsal bone of the left foot ( _red arrow_ )\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】Discussion\n----------\n\n【23】DLBL comprises a group of large, lymphoid B-cell malignant proliferations that is clinically, morphologically, and genetically heterogeneous. It constitutes about 30% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and is the most common histologic subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. It is also characterized by relatively frequent extranodal presentation. The most common extranodal localizations are the stomach, central nerve system, bone, testis, and liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Presently, only extranodal areas affecting gingival areas of the left maxillary lateral incisor, the chest wall, the testis, and distal appendicular bone were affected with DLBL.\n\n【24】Bone scan is widely available and commonly used to detect bone metastases from cancers because it is inexpensive and sensitive and is able to capture a whole-body image 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>. Notably, PET/CT also provides whole-body images with an overall assessment of disease extent, and so can reveal lesions that are hidden on other conventional images. PET/CT has several advantages in the management of patients with lymphoma during staging and follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. In our patient, DLBL was first diagnosed in the gingival area of the left maxillary lateral incisor, but unrevealed lymphoma involvement on the chest wall, testis, and distal appendicular bone were subsequently detected by whole-body bone scanning and PET/CT. PET/CT also is important in the early prediction of response to chemotherapy and the evaluation of residual masses after chemotherapy or radiation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 , 10 \\]</u>. In our patient, decreased uptake visualized by bone scanning and PET/CT was apparent after chemo- and radiotherapy.\n\n【25】Malignant lymphoma of bone is classified into four subtypes: primary bone lymphoma (PBL), multifocal PBL, and disseminated lymphoma with secondary osseous involvement either within 6 months of lymphoma diagnosis via soft tissue/nodal disease or more than 6 months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. PBL is defined as lymphoma that is confined to the bone or bone marrow without evidence of concurrent systemic involvement, and it has the best prognosis of all primary bone malignant lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>. PBL is commonly found in the appendicular skeleton, typically affecting the metadiaphysis of the femur, tibia, and humerus, and it has a better prognosis than disseminated disease with secondary osseous involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u>. Secondary osseous lymphoma is usually due to DLBL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 , 13 \\]</u> and preferentially affects the axial skeleton, such as the spine, pelvis, skull, ribs, and facial bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Secondary osseous lymphoma of distal appendicular bone is extremely rare. In our patient, DLBL was detected in the gingival area, but multiple lymphomatous involvement on the chest wall, testis, and distal appendicular bone was detected by bone scanning and PET/CT. Despite the improvement of disease by chemo- and radiotherapy, a poor prognosis is expected.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【27】Secondary DLBL involvement of distal appendicular bone is extremely rare. Bone scanning and PET/CT are important in the diagnosis and response assessment of DLBL involvement of appendicular bone, as in our patient. Bone scanning and PET/CT may be instrumental in establishing a diagnosis of lymphomatous involvement of distal appendicular bone.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations\n-------------</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Bone scan:</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Technetium-99m methylenediphosphonate bone scintigraphy</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CD:</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Cluster of differentiation</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>DLBL:</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>\\[ <sup>18 </sup> F\\]-FDG:</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用删除4(英):<u><sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>MRI:</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PBL:</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Primary bone lymphoma</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PET/CT:</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Positron emission tomography/computed tomography</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Other secondary causes include malignancy, systemic inflammatory diseases, sepsis and primary thrombophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. However, idiopathic OVT is rare, and no consensus has been agreed upon regarding its diagnosis and management. Recommendations have been offered to manage episodes like other deep venous thromboses in the lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Yet this remains unsupported by randomised trials in the setting of low incidence. This case presents a patient who was diagnosed with idiopathic OVT and was treated with apixaban. A literature review was performed collating reported cases of idiopathic OVT to form a recommendation regarding optimal management and follow up based on current experience.\n\n【11】### Case presentation\n\n【12】A 42-year-old Chinese woman presented to her general practitioner with 1 day of worsening right lower quadrant pain, described as a persistent dull ache, radiating to the right flank and groin. She was afebrile and without nausea or vomiting. She had no vaginal bleeding or discharge, nor symptoms of urinary tract infection.\n\n【13】She is gravida 2, para 2 and otherwise a healthy non-smoker without any significant past medical history. She does not take any regular medication. Her alcohol consumption is minimal. She has no history of thrombosis or hereditary thrombophilia. She has no gynaecological history nor previous miscarriage. She is a homemaker, living with her husband and two children and is independent of her activities of daily living. She has no significant medical family history.\n\n【14】On examination she demonstrated slight discomfort on deep palpation over the right groin, below McBurney’s point. She did not have rebound tenderness. Her vital signs were within normal limits with a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/68 and temperature of 36.3 °C. Her neurological examination was unremarkable with normal power and sensation in both upper and lower limbs. Her urine dipstick was unremarkable with no nitrites or leucocytes found. Routine blood tests were unremarkable with a haemoglobin of 124 g/L, white cell count of 6.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, thyroid stimulating hormone of 2.54 mU/L, eGFR of > 90 and INR of 1.0.\n\n【15】Her initial renal tract ultrasound ruled out urinary tract obstruction and calculi. A CT abdomen was arranged given her pain had not resolved with simple analgesia, which revealed a 35 mm segment thrombus of the lower right ovarian vein as depicted in Fig. 1 .\n\n【16】**Fig. 1**\n\n【17】CT abdomen of ovarian vein thrombosis (green arrowing pointing to thrombus)\n\n【18】Full size image\n\n【19】She was commenced on apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily and referred to vascular surgery for ongoing management and monitoring. Coagulation testing for hereditary thrombophilia including prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden mutation, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C, protein S and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test was negative. Her groin pain subsequently improved after 3 months of anticoagulation with resolution of thrombus demonstrated on repeat Doppler ultrasound. Six months since presentation, she remains symptom free and is planned for a follow up CT angiogram to monitor progress.\n\n【20】Discussion\n----------\n\n【21】This case describes a 42-year-old woman who presents with idiopathic OVT who was successfully treated with apixaban with resolution of her symptoms. Ovarian vein thrombosis commonly presents in the post-partum period and has been well described in this setting. This case is unique in that idiopathic OVT is rare and its description in the literature is relatively scant. As such there is no consensus on the optimal management of idiopathic OVT. This case describes successful management using apixaban demonstrating a viable treatment regime for this novel presentation.\n\n【22】Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) was first described by Austin in 1952 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Complications can be life-threatening and include inferior vena cava (IVC) extension, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and renal obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. Classically a disease of the post-partum period, OVT more commonly presents in the right versus the left ovarian vein given compression by the uterus during pregnancy and its drainage to the IVC being at an acute angle which increases venous stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. This is consistent with Virchow’s triad of endothelial injury, hypercoagulability, and venous stasis which are all exacerbated in pregnancy. Secondary causes of OVT have been reported in settings of hypercoagulability including sepsis, pyelonephritis, malignancy, Behcet’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease and post-operatively. Even so, idiopathic episodes of OVT have been reported, though rare.\n\n【23】A literature review was performed using key words “ovarian vein thrombosis” on OVID Medline yielding 265 results. After screening of titles and abstracts 18 case reports were identified of idiopathic aetiology as presented in Table 1 . Given limited evidence in the literature, there is no consensus on the diagnostic approach and management. As ultrasound (US) is operator dependent with variable accuracy, CT and MRI have been recommended as the optimal diagnostic imaging modality. Treatment follows the principles of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>.\n\n【24】**Table 1 Literature review of reported cases of idiopathic ovarian vein thrombosis**\n\n【25】Full size table\n\n【26】Review of the literature identified 18 cases reporting idiopathic OVT. Patients did not have associated malignancy, surgery, sepsis, pelvic disease or primary coagulopathies. Lower abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint, often associated with nausea. As such, most were diagnosed on abdominal and pelvic CT with differentials of appendicitis or renal calculi. Two cases were diagnosed on exploratory surgery. Management, however, was more variable. Some patients were immediately commenced on warfarin while others were bridged with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin. Others were commenced on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban or rivaroxaban. Duration of anticoagulation ranged from 6 weeks to 8 months. Common to each case was a prompt symptomatic response upon commencing anticoagulation with follow up occurring in 6 weeks to 6 months with accompanying CT or US imaging to demonstrate recanalization or resolution of the thrombus.\n\n【27】Direct oral anticoagulants are the choice of therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) given their superior bleeding safety profile and non-inferiority for preventing recurrent VTE compared to warfarin–recent studies also demonstrate non-inferiority of DOACs in cancer associated VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. However, DOACs are contraindicated in triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients, where warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice. Because a diagnosis of APS requires positive antibodies on repeat blood tests 12 weeks apart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>, the safest anticoagulant agent to commence patients on is warfarin where there is suspicion of APS–with low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin bridging–until the diagnosis can be excluded.\n\n【28】This case reports a rare episode of idiopathic OVT with successful treatment on initiation of apixaban. Combining the experience of known cases of idiopathic OVT to date, recommendations have been offered based on the best evidence currently available.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【30】Idiopathic OVT is a rare condition. Given limited evidence in the literature, a range of treatments have been trialled, generally following the principles of DVT management with anticoagulation and follow up imaging which have been summarized in Table 2 . While this review has demonstrated that DOACs can effectively treat idiopathic OVT, warfarin may be a more prudent choice in patients with suspected antiphospholipid syndrome until it can be confidently excluded to reduce risk of thrombus extension and embolism.\n\n【31】**Table 2 Management alternatives for treating idiopathic ovarian vein thrombosis**\n\n【32】Full size table\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Availability of data and materials\n----------------------------------</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

A bezoar is defined as indigestible material inside the gastrointestinal tract that develops into a trapped mass; the most frequent bezoar is a trichobezoar. When a trichobezoar extends into the small intestine it is defined as Rapunzel’s syndrome. Literature describing complications related to this pathology remains scarce.\n\n【3】### Case presentation\n\n【4】A 16-year-old Mexican girl presented to our emergency room with acute abdomen and a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. Computed tomography was suggestive of intussusception. Surgery confirmed a jejunal-jejunal intussusception with a mass within the gastric cavity extending into her small intestine, corresponding to a trichobezoar. A manual intussusception reduction and a gastrotomy with extraction of the trichobezoar were performed.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We present a case of a jejunum intussusception as a complication of Rapunzel syndrome. Our patient had a favorable outcome after surgical intervention with a manual intussusception reduction, with retrograde displacement of the trichobezoar into the gastric lumen, and a complete extraction through a gastrostomy. Follow-up included psychiatric evaluation.\n\n【7】Peer Review reports\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】Adult intestinal intussusception is a rare condition caused by a mechanical disruption of motility due to an infection, tumor, Meckel’s diverticulum, and intestinal duplication among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>. A bezoar is defined as undigested material inside the gastrointestinal tract that eventually becomes a trapped mass. Trichobezoars are made up of hair and are associated with psychiatric conditions such as trichophagia and trichotillomania 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. Trichobezoars are usually progressive in nature and begin in the stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 3 \\]</u>. Trichobezoars are the most frequent type of bezoar in patients under 30 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 4 \\]</u>. Baudamant was the first to report a trichobezoar in 1779 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 5 \\]</u>. If the bezoar happens to extend into the small intestine, this is termed Rapunzel syndrome as described by Vaughan _et al._ in 1968 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 6 \\]</u>. Rapunzel syndrome presents with symptoms of intestinal obstruction in which there is a gastric trichobezoar with a “tail-like” post-pyloric extension into the small intestine. The diagnosis is confirmed by surgical findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 7 \\]</u>.\n\n【10】Most published case reports focus on intestinal obstruction or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 2 \\]</u>. However, a few discuss the relationship between intussusception and Rapunzel syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 1 \\]</u>, as we report in the following case.\n\n【11】Case presentation\n-----------------\n\n【12】A 16-year-old Mexican girl presented with a 4-day history of epigastric abdominal pain that radiated to the left hypochondrium and was accompanied by abdominal bloating. She reported vomiting approximately 30 times 24 hours after symptom onset. Oral intake of fluids and solid food was impaired, and both flatus and bowel movements were absent. She had no history of prior surgical interventions and did not have a history of fever, hematemesis, jaundice, chyluria, or acholic stools.\n\n【13】She was hemodynamically stable on room air with a mild tachycardia of up to 140 beats per minute (bpm). On physical examination she presented no neurological alterations or alopecia. An abdominal examination revealed distention, borborygmi, painful palpation, and involuntary resistance in upper quadrants with rebound tenderness.\n\n【14】She was hemoconcentrated with a hematocrit of 40 and had leukocytosis of 17,560/mm <sup>3 </sup> . A computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis with intravenously and orally administered contrast showed dilatation of the gastric chamber with a hyperdense beehive pattern 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 1a , b )</u>. Dilated small intestine loops with fluid levels and a target image in the jejunum were suggestive of intussusception. Furthermore, findings were compatible with a trichobezoar.\n\n【15】**Fig. 1**\n\n【16】**a** Computed tomography with coronal reconstruction, we observe a beehive pattern within the gastric chamber that extends into duodenum, observing a transition zone ( _arrow_ ) in the proximal jejunum. **b** Volumetric reconstruction, observing an image suggesting intussusception ( _arrow_ )\n\n【17】Full size image\n\n【18】She underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Findings included gastric distention 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 2 )</u>, a palpable mass that extended from the gastric lumen to the first duodenum section, and a jejuno-jejunal intussusception 通用删除1(英):<u>(Fig. 3 )</u>, which was liberated through manual revision. The jejunum showed macroscopic signs of inflammation 110 cm away from the ligament of Treitz. The mass was manually dragged into the duodenum.\n\n【19】**Fig. 2**\n\n【20】Anterior wall of the stomach observing dilated gastroepiploic arteries\n\n【21】Full size image\n\n【22】**Fig. 3**\n\n【23】Jejunum loop with macroscopic changes (edema, swollen, hyperemia) due to intussusception\n\n【24】Full size image\n\n【25】A 10 cm gastrotomy was performed on the anterior portion of the gastric body and a 20 cm-long continuous conglomerate of hair was extracted followed by four smaller fragments which extended to the site of the intussusception 通用删除1(英):<u>(Figs. 4 and 5 )</u>. After gastric lavage with saline solution, a first intention closure was performed in two layers: first with polyglactin 00 using the Connell technique and then with gastric silk 00 using the Lembert technique. A 19 Fr closed system drainage was placed in her peritoneal cavity.\n\n【26】**Fig. 4**\n\n【27】Trichobezoar extraction through gastrotomy from the anterior gastric wall with a longitudinal incision\n\n【28】Full size image\n\n【29】**Fig. 5**\n\n【30】Extraction of trichobezoar segment\n\n【31】Full size image\n\n【32】She had no immediate complications. Enteral nutrition was tolerated during the third postoperative day. Before hospital discharge she was evaluated by an in-house psychiatrist and was discharged during the fifth day of hospital admission.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】Bezoars are classified into four groups: phytobezoar (indigestible fiber from fruits and vegetables), trichobezoar (hair), lactobezoar (milk protein/curd), and pharmacobezoar (medications) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 8 \\]</u>. The term trichobezoar comes from the Greek word _trich_ , which means hair, and _bāzahr_ , which is Arabic for antidote 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 9 \\]</u>. Rapunzel’s syndrome is a rare form of trichobezoar, which receives its name due to its resemblance to a tail; it has a 1% incidence in patients with trichophagia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 10 \\]</u>. In addition, 90% of cases involve women with underlying psychiatric disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 11 \\]</u> and 10% involve young men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 12 \\]</u>.\n\n【35】Clinical presentation includes a palpable mass in the abdomen, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, weight loss, diarrhea, malnutrition, anorexia, and constipation depending on the degree of obstruction. The bezoar can cause a mass effect inside the gastrointestinal tract resulting in intestinal obstruction or gastric ulcer. The distal part of the trichobezoar (tail) may interfere with peristalsis and lead to an intussusception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 13 \\]</u>. Patients are clinically diagnosed with intestinal obstruction. Medical evidence suggests a 6-month history of trichophagia is necessary in order to become symptomatic.\n\n【36】Image findings include an abdomen X-ray that shows a dilated gastric chamber with a complete filling image displacing intestinal loops. An abdominal ultrasound shows a highly reflective mass inside the stomach and duodenum with posterior acoustic shadowing. The most sensitive diagnostic study is computed tomography with double contrast; it shows gastric dilatation with a beehive pattern within that suggests trichobezoar, which extends to the duodenum.\n\n【37】A laparotomy is the surgical intervention of choice for elimination of the trichobezoar. Endoscopic removal remains controversial. Konuma _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 14 \\]</u> describes a successful 15-minute endoscopic removal of a 34 cm, 100 g trichobezoar. However, a recent literature review by Gorter _et al._ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 15 \\]</u> describes that only 5% of trichobezoars were susceptible for endoscopic extraction. Furthermore, conservative treatment with fizzy soft drinks has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[ 16 \\]</u>.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【39】Surgical management continues to be the treatment of choice for the resolution of a trichobezoar. Enterotomy is the preferred procedure for the extraction of a bezoar with intestinal extension. After extraction a systematic distal examination has to be performed in order to rule out a synchronic bezoar or a distal perforation.\n\n【40】In this case our patient presented Rapunzel syndrome with acute abdomen secondary to an occlusive jejunum-jejunum intussusception. The Rapunzel syndrome was surgically resolved with manual liberation, an anterograde retraction of the trichobezoar into the gastric lumen, and a complete extraction via gastrotomy. Follow-up treatment included psychiatric evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "jmedical", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
