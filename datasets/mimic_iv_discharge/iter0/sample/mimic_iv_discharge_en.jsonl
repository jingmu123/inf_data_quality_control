She was recently admitted in ___ for a relapse consisting of worsening lower extremity \n【25】weakness and numbness to the level of her bra line.  She\n【26】underwent a course of IV solumedrol, with a fair amount of \n【27】improvement in her lower extremity weakness and sensory loss, \n【28】and on discharge was able to ambulate with a cane.  Since that \n【29】discharge, she has been started on Tysabri, and notes that she \n【30】has so far received 4 doses, with the last on ___.  She does \n【31】not feel as though she ever made it completely back to her \n【32】pre-hospitalization baseline, and also is not sure if the \n【33】Tysabri is working for her, though denies any significant side \n【34】effects.  \n【35】\n【36】Starting ~2 weeks ago she began to notice some worsening in her \n【37】gait, stemming primarily from worsening lower extremity \n【38】weakness. She notes that while she used to be able to ambulate \n【39】with a cane, over a week she progressed to being dependent on a \n【40】walker, and now is unable to stand unassisted.  While she \n【41】attributes the problem primarily to her legs, she also feels as \n【42】though she\n【43】doesn't have the arm strength that she used to in order to \n【44】support herself.  She lives in a house with a flight of stairs, \n【45】which she has had difficulty navigating, though does not note \n【46】any significant difference between going up or down stairs.  She \n【47】was seen by her outpatient Neurologist, Dr. ___, on ___ for \n【48】these symptoms.  At that time she was noted to have a left \n【49】hemiparesis and lingual dysarthria.  As she was still able to \n【50】ambulate with the walker at that time, the plan had been to \n【51】persue an MRI of the brain and C-spine as an outpatient, with a \n【52】plan for outpatient Solumedrol and Cytoxan.  However, since that \n【53】clinic visit her weakness has worsened.  She came in for her MRI\n【54】today, and as she was now unable to stand unassisted, was sent \n【55】to the ED for further evaluation and likely admission. \n【56】\n【57】The patient reports that she has some degree of incontinence at \n【58】baseline, occasionally having difficulty holding her urine until \n【59】she can make it to the bathroom, and sometimes having to strain \n【60】to get it out.  However she does not feel this is any different \n【61】than her baseline.  At baseline she has poor vision out of her \n【62】left eye, but does not feel this has changed, and does not note\n【63】any new sensory loss today, though does note that she has \n【64】baseline pins and needles in her feet bilaterally.  She denies \n【65】any recent illness or sick contacts. \n【66】 \n【67】On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, new loss of vision, \n【68】blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, \n【69】lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies \n【70】difficulties producing or comprehending speech.  \n【71】\n【72】On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or \n【73】chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies \n【74】cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, \n【75】palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation \n【76】or abdominal pain.  No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. \n【77】Denies rash. \n【78】 \n【79】Past Medical History:\n【80】1. RRMS - She was diagnosed with MS at ___ with an episode of\n【81】optic neuritis in ___ . She had two periods where she lost her\n【82】vision completely, but it returned. Her current baseline is now\n【83】roughly ___ vision loss in the Left eye.

He \n【28】indicates that he was aware of a lesion of the right upper back \n【29】for at least ___ years, which over the past few weeks became \n【30】more raised at the center and somewhat pruritic.  ___ is \n【31】quite convinced that he had picked at the lesion very shortly \n【32】before his biopsy procedure.  He did not have any spontaneous \n【33】bleeding otherwise. \n【34】\n【35】___ also showed me today a large very suspicious nodule of \n【36】the right medial calf which probably represents a \n【37】keratoacanthoma or squamous cell cancer present for an \n【38】indeterminate length of time.  He thinks that it has been\n【39】progressive within the past two weeks.\n【40】\n【41】He underwent shave biopsy of the right upper back lesion on \n【42】___.  The pathology, as reviewed again today with our \n【43】dedicated dermatopathology group, shows an invasive melanoma \n【44】with a minimal thickness of 0.65 mm with an involved deep and \n【45】peripheral margin.  The lesion extended to ___ level III. \n【46】There was 1 mitosis present per mm2 with mitoses scattered \n【47】throughout the specimen.  There was a small area with overlying \n【48】scale which could be interpreted as focal ulceration, but our \n【49】group felt overall it was most consistent with the patient's \n【50】history of trauma.  The lesion appears to arise within a \n【51】preexisting nevus.  It was positive for Melan-A and HMB-45.  On \n【52】the same date, a biopsy of the right helix was performed showing \n【53】epidermal acanthosis with an involved margin.\n【54】\n【55】To a review of systems, ___ does not smoke cigarettes.

However, stool culture, c. \n【205】diff and norovirus were all negative.  Initial lipase was \n【206】negative. While DKA may have be a possible cause, symptoms \n【207】persisted after resolution of DKA. Gastroparesis was another \n【208】alternative diagnosis, though less likely given acute onset, \n【209】lower abd pain and diarrhea. He improved slowly with supportive \n【210】care. He initially required IV antiemetics and pain medications, \n【211】but was able to successfully transition to orals. By the time of \n【212】discharge, Mr ___ was able to eat and drink without \n【213】difficulty and he had no further nausea and vomiting. \n【214】\n【215】# T1DM: Hyperglycemia in the setting of acute infection with AG \n【216】metabolic acidosis and ketonuria was consistent with mild DKA. \n【217】DKA resolved with SQ insulin and IVF resuscitation.  Insulin \n【218】regimen titrated in setting of poor PO and N/V with \n【219】gastroenteritis as above. \n【220】\n【221】# ___: Presented with Cr 1.9, up from baseline 1.0.  Quickly \n【222】resolved with IVF, thus was likely prerenal in nature due to GI \n【223】losses and hyperglycemia. Creatinine remained at baseline for \n【224】the remainder of hospitalization.\n【225】\n【226】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n【227】# Hypertension: Home BP meds initially held in setting of N/V/D \n【228】and ___. Restarted lisinopril, but HCTZ was held through time of \n【229】discharge. \n【230】# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on home atorvastatin.\n【231】\n【232】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n【233】- Patient's ___ resolved at time of discharge, but please check \n【234】at time of follow-up appointment.\n【235】- Patient with notable hyperglycemia while hospitalized, please \n【236】titrate insulin as needed for euglycemia. \n【237】- HCTZ was held at time of discharge and patient mildly \n【238】hypertensive. Please re-introduce once feeling well and taking \n【239】normal PO intake.\n【240】- Patient has a chronic dry cough, which he believes may be \n【241】related to lisinopril. If does not resolve, may consider a \n【242】change to ___\n【243】- Please monitor LFTs as an outpatient. Inpatient viral \n【244】serologies were negative, but ultrasonography was suggestive of \n【245】steatosis/NASH.\n【246】- Patient noted to have asymptomatic gallstones without \n【247】cholecystitis on ultrasound.\n【248】- If systoms persist for a significant amount of time \n【249】post-discharge, please consider workup for gastroparesis.\n【250】- Contact ___ (Aunt) ___\n【251】- Code: Full\n【252】 \n【253】Medications on Admission:\n【254】The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n【255】1.

Differential diagnosis includes recurrence of her \n【219】malignancy ___ PET scan showing spiculated R upper lobe nodule \n【220】vs abscess given fluid vs bronchiectatsis although not seen vs \n【221】necrotizing PNA vs TBvs fungal infection. She was started on \n【222】vancomycin/Zosyn ___ concern for infection in the setting of \n【223】mild leukocytosis. Interventional Radiology and Interventional \n【224】Pulmonology were consulted to determine potential options to \n【225】control the bleeding. After an in-depth discussion with the \n【226】patient regarding the risks and benefits associated with \n【227】intervention vs no intervention, the patient agreed to reversal \n【228】of her code status (she presented to the hospital DNR/DNI) in \n【229】the context of having a procedure. She remained hemodynamically \n【230】stable on her home 2L NC overnight for ___. She was electively \n【231】intubated the morning of ___ in the MICU. Per ___, embolization \n【232】of her R bronchial artery was performed followed by bronchoscopy \n【233】by IP which revealed persistent oozing in her RLL. A \n【234】double-lumen ETT was placed in anticipation of rebleed/concern \n【235】for airway protection. Overnight of ___, the patient spiked a \n【236】temperature to 101.1. Blood and urine cultures were sent. Per ID \n【237】recommendations, fungal studies were sent and voriconazole was \n【238】added to the patient's medication regimen. Because of continued \n【239】bloody output, she was taken for rigid bronchoscopy by IP who \n【240】applied bio-glue and placed a spigot in her right apical segment \n【241】in attempt to stop the bleeding. She was transitioned back to a \n【242】single lumen ETT. Thoracic surgery was consulted for further \n【243】recommendations in the setting of continued re-bleed. A repeat \n【244】bronchoscopy on ___ by IP revealed successful cessation of her \n【245】bleeding. However, the patient continued to be \n【246】ventilator-dependent ___ worsening respiratory status ___ likely \n【247】pneumonia and continuing deterioration of her renal function. On \n【248】___ repeat bronchoscopy showed displacement of spigot in right \n【249】lower airway and it was retrieved. No active bleeding was noted. \n【250】Patient subsequently was kept on ventilator with inability to \n【251】wean secondary to near apnea and poor lung volumes even on high \n【252】PEEP PSV. On ___, after repeated conversations with daughter, \n【253】due to patient's prior wishes of not wanting to be kept on \n【254】ventilator, patient was made CMO, was extubated and subsequently \n【255】passed.  \n【256】  \n【257】# COPD, baseline 2L O2: Per patient report, she had a long \n【258】history of COPD requiring home O2 on 2L NC. Although the patient \n【259】reported approximately 1 month of increasing sputum production \n【260】combined with increasing dyspnea on exertion, it was thought \n【261】that her current respiratory compromise was more likely ___ to \n【262】the active process in her R lung vs exacerbation of her COPD. \n【263】Her home COPD medications were continued until passing on ___ \n【264】  \n【265】# Elevated creatinine: Upon admission, patient received a CTA. \n【266】She had an increase in her creatinine to 1.3, which was \n【267】concerning in the setting of an unknown baseline in a patient \n【268】with known chronic kidney disease. Urine sediment showed muddy \n【269】brown casts and her creatinine continued to trend upward \n【270】peaking. Nephrology was consulted but given patient's poor \n【271】prognosis and GOC discussions, as well as questionable utility \n【272】of ultrafiltration in resolving patient's respiratory distress \n【273】HD was not pursued. \n【274】\n【275】# Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient was noted to have \n【276】loose stools on ___.

Large geographic areas of abnormally low T1 signal involving \n【241】the distal tibia and multiple tarsal bones, predominantly the \n【242】talus and calcaneus, atypical in appearance for osteomyelitis.  \n【243】This may represent developing osteonecrosis/avascular necrosis \n【244】given smaller areas with more characteristic imaging features of \n【245】osteonecrosis in the distal tibia and superolateral talus, as \n【246】described above.

Patient was \n【299】noted to be febrile T-max 101 with leukocytosis, ulcers of \n【300】bilateral lower extremities and elevated CRP.  MRI showed \n【301】evidence of osteomyelitis of the first and fourth metatarsals of \n【302】the right lower extremity.  Vascular surgery, podiatry and \n【303】plastic surgery was consulted and it was felt that ultimately \n【304】local debridement would not be viable given likelihood of poor \n【305】healing and difficulty of obtaining clean margins.  As such he \n【306】was initiated on empiric therapy with Vancomycin/Zosyn for prior \n【307】MDR osteomyelitis organisms, and follow-up with vascular surgery \n【308】was arranged to discuss the role of BKA for source control. \n【309】Patient will be followed by OPAT infectious disease team for \n【310】antibiotic monitoring and duration. Please obtain weekly CBC w/ \n【311】differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin level and CRP and fax results \n【312】as directed.\n【313】\n【314】# Multifocal myoclonus\n【315】Patient presented with chief complaint of multifocal myoclonus \n【316】sudden onset.  He had a history of myoclonus in the setting of \n【317】gabapentin overdose, with some residual twitching in his daily \n【318】life.  Etiology of this episode is unclear particularly given \n【319】multifocal nature.  He was taken off of his recently started \n【320】pregabalin. Symptoms resolved over the course of the next ___ \n【321】hours. However given the presentation concerning for basal \n【322】ganglia stroke we obtain an MRI head which showed chronic \n【323】frontal infarct.  Was ultimately felt to be most likely toxic \n【324】metabolic in the setting of UTI, osteomyelitis superimposed on \n【325】baseline susceptibility.\n【326】\n【327】# Subacute / chronic frontal infarcts\n【328】Incidentally noted on MRI head when investigating myoclonus. The \n【329】role of further workup for causes of stroke and its impact on \n【330】medical management and procedural/surgical management of risks \n【331】was thoroughly discussed with the patient. Carotid dopplers \n【332】preformed prior to discharge. Echo with bubble deferred (very \n【333】unlikely to change management). \n【334】\n【335】# Afib with RVR\n【336】Likely triggered by infection. Of note, he has had difficulty \n【337】with rate control and has been undergoing consideration for \n【338】initiation of amiodarone vs DCCV. After treatment of infection \n【339】he remained rate controlled.

However, he is able to \n【345】lie flat on exam and is breathing comfortably. His torsemide was \n【346】most recently increased from 40mg to 60mg daily (___). We \n【347】continued him on this increased dose with good effect.\n【348】\n【349】# ___:\n【350】# CKD, Stage IV\n【351】Baseline Cr 1.8. Peaked at 2.3, was given 500cc IVF in ED out of \n【352】concern for pre-renal / hypovolemia iso sepsis.

Patient was \n【93】transferred to the PACU in stable condition with JPx1. \n【94】Overnight, patient put out bilious output from her JP drain. On \n【95】POD2, patient had JP output of bilious fluids. Patient was taken \n【96】to ERCP where the CBD was unable to be cannulated, a PD stent \n【97】was placed. However, on POD3, repeat ERCP was performed with \n【98】successful cannulation of CBD with stent placement.\n【99】\n【100】Patient was advanced to a bariatric stage II diet but she had \n【101】continued right upper quadrant abdominal pain and focal \n【102】peritonitis.  An ultrasound was performed on ___ with evidence \n【103】of a 2 cm biloma in the right upper quadrant.  The patient's \n【104】total bilirubin began to rise and she had a growing leukocytosis \n【105】with intermittent fevers.  Her INR rose to 4.2 and a CT scan was \n【106】performed with evidence of a 7 x 4.7 x 9.3 cm bilious collection \n【107】in the right upper quadrant.  She was given vitamin K for \n【108】correction of her INR.  The following day she was sent to \n【109】interventional radiology with drainage of 120 cc of purulent \n【110】bilious fluid, a drain was placed in the collection.  Her \n【111】antibiotics were broadened to cefepime and Flagyl.  She was \n【112】again sent for an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement \n【113】to help decompress the bile duct.\n【114】\n【115】Her home medications were resumed when the patient was started \n【116】back in a bariatric stage II diet which was well-tolerated.  A \n【117】CT scan was again performed on ___ with evidence of a 1.6 x \n【118】5.1 collection anterior to her stomach.  Interventional \n【119】radiology was again consulted for possible aspiration and \n【120】drainage of this collection, however this was not possible due \n【121】to the location.  Infectious disease was consulted for \n【122】assistance with management of the patient's antibiotic regimen \n【123】and they recommended broadening the patient from cefepime and \n【124】Flagyl to Zosyn IV.  Upon starting broad-spectrum antibiotics \n【125】the patient's leukocytosis began to resolve, her abdominal pain \n【126】improved, and over the subsequent days her bilious drainage from \n【127】her ___ placed drain began to decline daily.  PICC line was \n【128】placed in anticipation of the patient being discharged on \n【129】long-term IV antibiotics after discharge.\n【130】\n【131】Prior to discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet \n【132】without any nausea or vomiting, her pain is well controlled on \n【133】oral pain medications.  She was afebrile and did not have a \n【134】leukocytosis.  Her PICC line was in good position and she was \n【135】receiving IV antibiotics.  She is ambulating at her baseline, \n【136】her right upper quadrant drains were still producing small \n【137】amounts of bilious output.  She was discharged home with \n【138】infusion services as well as visiting nurse care for IV \n【139】antibiotics as well as drain care.  She will follow-up with a \n【140】CAT scan as well as labs on ___ in anticipation of the clinic \n【141】follow-up with Dr. ___ on ___.

Her course \n【278】was complicated by acute neck swelling due to mucositis that \n【279】required broad spectrum abx with resolution. She also developed \n【280】diarrhea that was concerning for graft versus host disease, \n【281】which was treated with steroids and improved dramatically. \n【282】\n【283】ACTIVE ISSUES:\n【284】==============\n【285】\n【286】#AML\n【287】#S/p allo transplant (___)\n【288】Patient recently completed consolidation therapy with \n【289】HiDAC/midostaurin and presented for scheduled admission for \n【290】allotransplant from matched unrelated donor after completion of \n【291】ablative therapy with Flu/Bu/ATG. Patient's ablative therapy \n【292】course complicated by Palmar/Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (as \n【293】below) and severe nausea/vomiting requiring zofran. Fluconazole \n【294】D/C'd after dose ___ iso transaminitis (as below) and was \n【295】switched to micafungin for fungal ppx, and ultimately to \n【296】cresemba. She developed severe mucositis while neutropenic (as \n【297】below). Over time, her counts recovered, and then she developed \n【298】leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. A thorough infectious workup \n【299】was completed (cultures, CT torso/neck, C Diff pcr) which was \n【300】all negative and the patient continued to feel well. Peripheral \n【301】cytogenics confirmed donor leukocytes. At the time of discharge \n【302】the patient felt well and there was no clear source for the \n【303】persistent leukocytosis, which should be monitored over time. \n【304】She will be continued on tacrolimus with goal of ___ (.5 mg BID \n【305】at time of discharge). She will also be continued on Acyclovir, \n【306】cresemba ppx.\n【307】\n【308】# Diarrhea\n【309】# Acute GVHD\n【310】Patient with new diarrhea the morning of ___, watery with ___\n【311】episodes. CDiff Neagtive. Concern for GVHD -- improved with 30 \n【312】IV\n【313】methylpred BID, now on oral steroids (tapering) without\n【314】further diarrhea. She was originally started on trial that \n【315】included Itacitinib for GVHD, but the drug was discontinued \n【316】given the patients ongoing leykocytosis of unclear etiology. She \n【317】will be discharged on 15 mg prednisone, which will be tapered as \n【318】tolerated. She was discharged without any significant amount of \n【319】diarrhea. Given how quickly her symptoms improved, it was \n【320】unclear if the patient truly had GVHD vs some other cause of \n【321】diarrhea. She did not receive endoscopy or tissue sample for \n【322】diagnosis. \n【323】\n【324】#Mucositis\n【325】OP noted to be erythematous w/ multiple small lesions Transplant \n【326】Day 6.

Also started TPN while unable to tolerate \n【330】regular diet. She gradually had improvement in symptoms and was \n【331】able to resume PO over time, and TPN was discontinued. \n【332】\n【333】#Neck Swelling\n【334】Patient developed diffuse neck swelling overnight ___. Swelling \n【335】was not causing patient pain, not compromising respiration, no \n【336】overlying skin changes. Most likely this represented a local \n【337】response to patient's severe mucositis and subsequent \n【338】inflammation aggravating surrounding tissues. CT neck w/ \n【339】contrast revealed soft tissue edema from skull base to C4 and \n【340】retropharyngeal fluid collection. She was ___ transferred to \n【341】the ICU on ___ due to concern for airway; she remained stable \n【342】overnight without concern for airway and ENT deemed no further \n【343】intervention including drainage was necessary. She was started \n【344】on\n【345】Vancomycin 1000 mg q12hr, Meropenem 1000 mg IV Q8H, Micafungin\n【346】100 mg IV Q24H and completed a 10 day course with improvement in \n【347】neck swelling.\n【348】\n【349】#Constipation\n【350】Likely related to chemotherapy and now increasing dose of opioid \n【351】pain medication for mucositis. Pt was unable to tolerate po \n【352】bowel regimen with mucositis and was given methylnaltrexone in \n【353】setting of high doses of opioids being used. \n【354】\n【355】#Transammonitis\n【356】Most likely iso fluconazole ppx.

He was \n【120】very tearful and labile, still irritated.  He was dramatic, \n【121】saying \"you are my saviour.\"  He was grandiose, for example, \n【122】saying \"I have so much going on, I have skills upon skills.\"  He \n【123】also seemed to display some splitting, telling his resident \"my \n【124】wife's a nurse, she's a better nurse than anyone I've \n【125】encountered here.\"  Every provider discussed is described as  \n【126】either  wonderful or horrible.  His thought process was \n【127】tangential with some subtle loosened associations.  He denied \n【128】suicidal ideation throughout his admission. It was ultimately \n【129】felt with additional collateral from his wife and through \n【130】ongoing assessment that Mr. ___ was presenting with a manic \n【131】episode in the context of recent cocaine abuse. \n【132】\n【133】Though the patient was help seeking and admitted voluntarily \n【134】without a ___, and the rules associated with signing a CV \n【135】were explained in detail, as soon as the patient signed the CV \n【136】he started to demand that he leave immediately and be \n【137】transferred to another unit, although it was explained that Deac \n【138】4 is the only psychiatric unit in the hospital.  He continued to \n【139】grow increasingly uncooperative, agitated and threatening \n【140】towards staff,  and required a chemical and physical restraint \n【141】his first evening on the unit.  He was then placed on security \n【142】continuous observation for safety overnight. His behavior did \n【143】improve and he was returned to Q15min checks for safety. Mr. \n【144】___ effexor and ___ were discontinued on admission \n【145】due to concern for mania.  His lamictal was also stopped. He was \n【146】initally treated with seroquel to target his manic symptoms, but \n【147】this was discontinued as it was too sedating. He was also given \n【148】haldol (with cogentin) due to his degree of agitation upon \n【149】admission. As he improved wth treatment, the haldol was switched \n【150】to risperidone 2mg BID with PRN ativan for agitation, anxiety \n【151】and insomnia. He found the risperidone very helpful, tolerating \n【152】it well without sdeation. It was unclear during his \n【153】hospitalization if Mr. ___ manic episode was triggered by \n【154】substance (antidepressants and cocaine) or if he indeed suffers \n【155】from bipolar disorder. This was discussed in detail with he and \n【156】his wife and they understand the importance of close follow up \n【157】with his psyhciatrist to determine this through time and to \n【158】evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of risperdal over hte \n【159】next few days to weeks. An antipsychotic was felt to be \n【160】necessary at this time due to his degree of agitation in the \n【161】hospital, but this will likley need to be adjusted through time \n【162】and the utilty of lamictal should be reconsidered. He and his \n【163】wife will also both monitor for signs of effexor withdrawal. So \n【164】far he has been tolateing the discontinuation of his \n【165】antidepressants well. Psychoeducation was provided about the \n【166】symnptoms of mania vs ADD/ADHD as the aptient was initally \n【167】requesting a stimulant medication. \n【168】\n【169】Mr. ___ improved dramatically by discharge and was able to \n【170】engage in meaningful discussion surrounding his mental health, \n【171】substance abuse, and treatment plan for the future. He was \n【172】pleasant, cooperative, and understood the importance of avoiding \n【173】cocaine and mental helath follow up. His organization, insight, \n【174】and judhement all improved. He slept at night and was no longer \n【175】irritable. He and his wife both strongly requested discharge as \n【176】soon as possible, as it was felt that the ___ hospital was \n【177】not a productive enviornment ultimatly for Mr. ___. His wife \n【178】will continue to closely monitor his medications (as she has \n【179】been through time) and both were agreeable to transition to a \n【180】partial hosptial program, understanding risk of relapse and \n【181】emergency signs/symptoms to seek help. At no point during his \n【182】hospitalization was suicidality a concern, and there was no \n【183】evidence of failure to care for himself. \n【184】\n【185】RISK ASSESSMENT: While Mr. ___ continues to be at risk of \n【186】harm to self and inability to care forself given his \n【187】impulsivity, mood lability and chronic substance abuse, his risk \n【188】has been substantially mitigated during his hospital stay. His \n【189】mood has improved and he has gained more insight into this.  He \n【190】has remained drug free during his hospital stay, is determined \n【191】to continue sobriety as an outpatient, and will be following up \n【192】with an intensive outpatient dual diagnosis program on discharge \n【193】for further observation and management.  He will additionally \n【194】beable to acquire more tools and utilize coping skills learned \n【195】during this IOP.  He has a supportive wife who, in addition to \n【196】the patient, has been educated on the warning signs and symptoms \n【197】of mania and all agree to a plan to call the patient's providers \n【198】or return to the hospital if these symptoms return or worsen.  \n【199】Mr. ___ provider has been updated on the \n【200】patient's progress and outpatient plan and will be following up \n【201】closely with him.  Mr. ___ was adament in denying suicidal \n【202】and homicidal ideation throughout his hospitalization and was \n【203】motivated for care through out. \n【204】\n【205】MEDICAL:\n【206】##) Diabetes: ___ was consulted for guidance in diabetic \n【207】management.  They slightly altered his insulin regimen, \n【208】decreasing the units dosed TID and adding a sliding scale.  They \n【209】additionally request a HgbA1c, anti-gad and anti-Ia2 be checked. \n【210】Mr. ___ and his wife were counselled about the importance of \n【211】good diabetic control. Mr. ___ has been compliant with his \n【212】insulin, but struggles iwth his diet as a long term issue. \n【213】\n【214】##) HTN: continued home carvedilol, lisinopril, spironolactone.\n【215】\n【216】##) History of DVT: continued outpatient coumadin regimen, \n【217】confirmed with PCP. His INR was therapeutic \n【218】\n【219】##) HLD: continued home simvastatin.\n【220】\n【221】##) Renal Injury: continued home daily cyclosporine and vitamin \n【222】D weekly.\n【223】\n【224】LEGAL: ___\n【225】COLLATERAL:  The patient's PCP was immediately consulted for \n【226】further information and medication confirmation.  The team was \n【227】also in contact with the patient's wife.  The ___ \n【228】___, ___, was called to reach patient's \n【229】therapist, ___, but she was on maternity leave.

Nonspecific white matter changes in a configuration \n【168】suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. \n【169】\n【170】 \n【171】Brief Hospital Course:\n【172】Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of Alzheimer's dementia, \n【173】recent diagnosis of superficial RLE thrombosis on Eliquis, MI \n【174】s/p quadruple bypass, afib on digoxin due to h/o massive GI \n【175】bleed, and CVA who presented with progressive cognitive decline \n【176】and failure to tolerate POs. \n【177】Initially, reversible causes for dementia were ruled out. An \n【178】infectious workup was conducted, and urine culture was positive \n【179】for E. coli and therefore treated with IV Ceftriaxone for 5 \n【180】days. The overall presentation was thought to be most concerning \n【181】for progressive end stage dementia. A goals of care conversation \n【182】with his son and healthcare proxy guided decision-making to not \n【183】pursue placement of a G-tube. He was discharged to ___ \n【184】rehabilitation, per recommendations from physical therapy. Dr. \n【185】___ primary care doctor, has agreed to continue the \n【186】goals of care discussion, specifically around his code status, \n【187】after discharge.\n【188】\n【189】#Inability to tolerate POs: This was thought to be either due to \n【190】transient delirium, progression of dementia and resulting \n【191】disinterest in eating, or more mechanical causes such as \n【192】dysphagia or odynophagia. Given appropriate management of \n【193】secretions, obstruction was felt to be unlikely. Speech and \n【194】swallow evaluated Mr. ___, and felt that there was no \n【195】concern for a mechanical process. Transient delirium in the \n【196】setting of a UTI was possible, although unlikely given no \n【197】resolution of symptoms after antibiotic treatment. This was felt \n【198】to therefore be most likely disinterest in eating due to \n【199】progression of end stage dementia. His willingness to take small \n【200】amounts of POs with his son feeding him suggested that \n【201】reorientation and familiar people/environments were helping.\n【202】\n【203】#Progressive cognitive decline, Goals of care: Acute causes of \n【204】cognitive decline, including MI or PE, were rule out (no EKG \n【205】changes, no tachycardia, evidence of RH strain, or respiratory \n【206】distress). LENIs showed interval improvement in superficial RLE \n【207】thrombosis. A stroke or vascular dementia were ruled out given \n【208】negative NCHCT, and then negative head MRI. Reversible dementia \n【209】was ruled out with normal B12, RPR, and TSH levels. Transient \n【210】delirium in the setting of infection was postulated, but CXR was \n【211】negative. UA was negative, but a urine culture showed >100,000 \n【212】colonies of E. coli. Although he is incontinent to urine and \n【213】stool, this was treated as a complicated UTI due to his \n【214】worsening mental status with IV Ceftriaxone x5 days with some \n【215】improvement in his mental status. Electrolytes were consistently \n【216】within normal limits. Digoxin level was 0.4. This was held on \n【217】admission, and stopped at discharge in consultation with his \n【218】PCP, as he was in sinus rhythm and the risks were felt to \n【219】outweigh the benefits. Geriatrics was consulted, and agreed with \n【220】the workup and recommendations. A goals of care discussion with \n【221】his son and healthcare proxy resulted in no G-tube consideration \n【222】and understanding about the prognosis. He expressed considerable \n【223】insight and understanding into his father's condition, and felt \n【224】that he may soon end up at hospice. He also felt that \n【225】intubation, chest compressions, and shock would be very \n【226】traumatic, and likely not in line with his father's current \n【227】goals of care. However, he strongly felt that his father would \n【228】have wanted to be \"given a chance,\" and felt that he needed more \n【229】time to think about changing his father from Full code to \n【230】DNR/DNI. So, he was discharged to ___ rehab, Full code, \n【231】with plans for Dr. ___ to continue the discussion about his \n【232】code status (per conversation with Dr. ___. He was continued \n【233】on his home dose of Namenda at discharge.\n【234】\n【235】#RLE superficial thrombosis: he was on home Eliquis (last dose \n【236】___. However, he was not tolerating POs while admitted, and \n【237】was unable to take this medication although it was continued. \n【238】This was discontinued at discharge, in consultation with his \n【239】PCP, as the risks of bleeding given high fall risk were felt to \n【240】outweigh the benefits of anticoagulation for low-risk \n【241】superficial thrombus.\n【242】\n【243】#Hypertension: Blood pressures were within SBP 130-160, with \n【244】occasional episodes to 180. Toprol was switched to Metoprolol to \n【245】allow for crushing pills in puree, but he rarely was able to \n【246】take these. This was continued at discharge.\n【247】 \n【248】#CHF, afib: Digoxin was held on admission given the uncertain \n【249】indication (outpatient records not available). Ultimately, it \n【250】was learned that he has a history of afib, and major bleeding on \n【251】anticoagulation, thus on digoxin. He was in sinus rhythm, so \n【252】this was held and discontinued on discharge.\n【253】\n【254】He was discharged to an ___ rehab facility.\n【255】\n【256】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n【257】1) Hospice: Please consider consulting palliative care/hospice \n【258】during ___ rehab, given his son's suggestion that this may \n【259】be the appropriate next step.\n【260】2) After discussion with the patient's primary care doctor, his \n【261】digoxin and apixaban were discontinued as the risks of these \n【262】medications were thought to outweight the benefits. As goals of \n【263】care conversations continue, may consider discontinuation of \n【264】metoprolol and/or memantine as well.\n【265】\n【266】-CODE: full\n【267】-CONTACT: son, (HCP) ___ ___, ___ \n【268】___ ___ \n【269】 \n【270】___ on Admission:\n【271】The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n【272】1.

You \n【309】came to the hospital from the ___ facility because you were \n【310】having a difficult time eating food and became less responsive \n【311】to people around you. You were evaluated from causes that might \n【312】explain this. You were found to have a mild urinary tract \n【313】infection which was treated with antibiotics. Imaging of your \n【314】head was not concerning for a stroke. However, it was thought \n【315】that your Alzheimer's dementia may be progressively worsening, \n【316】making your appetite less than normal. Geriatrics became \n【317】involved in your care during your hospitalization. Along with \n【318】your son, we discussed whether you needed a feeding tube placed. \n【319】However, the decision was made that this would be a high risk \n【320】procedure, and the benefits would not outweigh the risks. \n【321】Physical therapy recommended that you go to an ___ \n【322】rehabilitation facility to become stronger and to receive the \n【323】care that you would need to hopefully be able to return to a \n【324】nursing home or other assisted living facility in the future.\n【325】\n【326】Please follow up with Dr. ___ primary care physician, \n【327】after completing ___ rehabilitation.

CT scan at ___ showed diverticulosis, no aortoenteric \n【205】fistula (known AAA). INR was 1.5 on admission; warfarin was \n【206】held. Hgb was trended and decreased from 7.5 to 6.7 on HD1 and \n【207】he was transfused 1U PRBCs. He was seen by GI and underwent \n【208】colonosocpy on ___ which showed multiple diverticula but no \n【209】masses. Patient was found to be actively bleeding during \n【210】colonoscopy, but unfortunately no definitive source was \n【211】identified and thus no intervention performed. Patient initially \n【212】on clear liquid diet, but was transitioned to full diet post \n【213】procedure and did well. Patient continued to have intermittent \n【214】episodes of bloody stools and bright red blood per rectum in \n【215】subsequent days, but hemoglobin remained stable throughout \n【216】hospitalization. \n【217】\n【218】Patient counseled that he may continue to bleed at home, and \n【219】will likely require frequent lab work and possibly occasional \n【220】transfusions as outpatient. He was discharged with close PCP and \n【221】GI follow up. \n【222】\n【223】His Coumadin was discontinued after discussion with his PCP due \n【224】to risk of overt GI bleed.

He is currently on treatment \n【30】___.  He had been getting weekly debridements there though he \n【31】states that they are no longer providing him with this care and \n【32】he plans to resume care at ___ for debridements.  After his \n【33】first HBO treatment, he noted a popping of his ears and \n【34】immediate pain and decreased hearing acuity.  He had been \n【35】referred to ENT at ___ and had bilateral tympanostomy tubes \n【36】placed.  Prior to this he had no history of chronic ear \n【37】infections and does not recall ear infections as a child.  \n【38】Despite the tubes his pain persisted with each subsequent \n【39】bariatric treatment and he now declines to finish his course \n【40】there.  Over the last week he noted subjective fevers nightly \n【41】with drenching night sweats and increasing pain of the right ear \n【42】in particular.  \n【43】\n【44】Upon arrival to the ED, his initial vitals were 73 118/74 15 \n【45】99%.  Podiatry saw him and felt the wounds looked chronic and \n【46】stable, recommending WBAT to heals (apparently quite \n【47】noncompliant with pressure avoidance), and a 10d course of abx \n【48】with outpt followup.  ENT evaluated due to concern for otitis \n【49】externa. Their exam revealed probable otitis media that was \n【50】chronic and they confirmed patency of the tubes.  A CT of the \n【51】orbits showed evidence of likely chronic mastoiditis, though due \n【52】to his poorly-controlled diabetic status, he was admitted for \n【53】antipseudomonal IV abx.  He received cefepime and got an oral \n【54】dose of cipro that I suspect was intended to be a ciprodex drop \n【55】order.  He has an allergy to levaquin but has tolerated the \n【56】cipro thus far. \n【57】\n【58】On arrival to the floor, the patient has mild pain in the right \n【59】ear.  He had been given a script for percocet to be used prior \n【60】to debridements, however he used all of the pills due to \n【61】increasing pain of the feet.  He speaks of receiving an \n【62】anti-anxiety pill at the HBO sessions which caused great \n【63】distress to him and helped convince him to avoid this service.  \n【64】\n【65】On ROS, he denies current fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, \n【66】headache, weakness, dysuria, hematuria. \n【67】 \n【68】Past Medical History:\n【69】- Diabetes mellitus type II - recently poor A1C to 15 ___ \n【70】___, at ___ now on insulin with A1c recently ~8\n【71】- chronic diabetic foot ulcers, s/p 17 hyperbaric oxygen \n【72】treatments at ___, requiring frequent debridement, \n【73】noncompliant with pressure avoidance\n【74】- s/p right total and left partial great toe amputations ___ years \n【75】ago\n【76】- multiple foot ulcer infections  \n【77】- Hypercholesterolemia  \n【78】- Hand surgery from occupational injury  \n【79】- Eye surgery for foreign material inclusion as child  \n【80】- Hernia surgery as child  \n【81】- previous marijuana and cocaine use\n【82】- chronic neuropathic pain\n【83】 \n【84】Social History:\n【85】___\n【86】Family History:\n【87】All brothers have diabetes, some with amputations of legs.  \n【88】One brother had a stroke.  \n【89】Another brother had rheumatic fever.  \n【90】Sister with asthma.  \n【91】HTN in family.  \n【92】Grandmother with DM and leg amputation.  \n【93】Daughter dx with diabetes at age ___.  \n【94】 \n【95】Physical Exam:\n【96】Admission Exam:\n【97】VS - 97.9  ___  100RA\n【98】GENERAL - Well appearing \n【99】HEENT - there is mild tenderness with traction of the pinna, \n【100】there is pain on tragal pressure.

There is no pleural effusion or \n【172】\n【173】pneumothorax. \n【174】IMPRESSION: Normal chest. \n【175】.\n【176】___ CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The lung bases reveal minimal \n【177】subsegmental \n【178】atelectasis bilaterally. The cardiac apex is normal. The \n【179】stomach, duodenum, adrenal glands, gallbladder, liver, kidneys, \n【180】and pancreas are normal. Small nodules of accessory splenic \n【181】tissue are visualized adjacent to the splenic hilum. The spleen \n【182】is slightly enlarged, measuring 16 cm in length. There is no \n【183】free gas or fluid in the abdomen.   \n【184】CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The distended urinary bladder, seminal \n【185】vesicles, \n【186】prostate, rectum are normal. The colon is also normal. There is \n【187】no free gas or fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic side wall \n【188】or inguinal \n【189】lymphadenopathy.   \n【190】OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic \n【191】osseous lesion.  \n【192】IMPRESSION:  \n【193】1. No apparent etiology to abdominal pain lasting two weeks. \n【194】2. Splenomegaly \n【195】\n【196】 \n【197】Brief Hospital Course:\n【198】This is a ___ year old male with a history of HIV on HAART (CD4 \n【199】of 728 in ___, poorly controlled type 1 diabetes on Insulin, \n【200】recently diagnosed Hepatitis C, and multiple previous skin \n【201】infections who presented with hyperglycemia and lower abdominal \n【202】pain with negative abdominal CT scan. \n【203】.\n【204】ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:\n【205】#Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1: Patient presented to primary doctor \n【206】with hyperglycemia to 697.  On admission, he did no have \n【207】evidence of full diabetic ketoacidosis--he had a normal anion \n【208】gap and hypokalemia.  He did show evidence of osmotic diuresis \n【209】and subsequent dehydration.  He was treated with IV fluids, \n【210】insulin per his home sliding scale with additional 6 units of \n【211】humalog and 33 units of glargine.\n【212】     High blood sugars were likely precipitated by poor \n【213】adherence, as conceded by the patient. Patient agreed to \n【214】consider Insulin pump to improve adherence. Likelihood of \n【215】ischemic event is low with normal Troponin and EKG without \n【216】changes from prior.  Infectious precipitant also unlikely \n【217】without fever, clear CXR, and no leukocytosis.  His urine tox \n【218】screen was negative for cocaine as a possible inciting event. \n【219】The patient should follow up with ___ re: Insulin pump \n【220】(Omnipod brand) since he is repeatedly non-compliant with his \n【221】home sliding scale requiring multiple admissions and manifesting \n【222】in ongoing kidney failure and barrier to hepatitis C treatment.\n【223】.\n【224】#Abdominal pain: Patient describeed low-grade sensation similar \n【225】to hunger ache. Abdominal pain often occurs in the context of \n【226】hyperglycemia because high blood sugars and low insulin lead to \n【227】poor gastric emptying and ileus.  Additionally, patient had a \n【228】lot of stool on abd CT and has been constipated per history.  \n【229】Possibility of pancreatitis was discounted with abd CT despite \n【230】mildly elevated lipase.  He was discharged on ranitidine and \n【231】multivitamins.\n【232】.\n【233】#Alkalosis: On admission, he was hypochloremic and with a \n【234】bicarbonate of 34.  However, he was saline responsive, dropping \n【235】from 34 to 30 with 4L of NS. Thus, alkalosis was likely a \n【236】\"contraction alkalosis\" secondary to profound dehydration. \n【237】.\n【238】# Acute kidney injury (___): Likely secondary to dehydration \n【239】from high blood sugars (see above). Patient has underlying \n【240】chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a baseline Cr of 1.5 presumed \n【241】to be from diabetic nephropathy.  Patient should be on an ACE \n【242】inhibitor given CKD and proteinuria.  He Cr improved to baseline \n【243】by the time of discharge.     \n【244】.\n【245】CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:\n【246】#Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): Upon admission, his \n【247】AST/ALT were elevated from ___.  It was felt that this was \n【248】due to his untreated hepatitis C.   Treatment is being postponed \n【249】in light of poorly controlled Diabetes, per note in OMR.  No \n【250】evidence of hepatomegaly on physical exam or on Abd. CT.  No \n【251】evidence of ascites on exam which would concern for SBP as cause \n【252】of his abd pain.\n【253】.\n【254】#HIV: Undetectable viral load on ___. CD4 count 728 on \n【255】admission. Patient reports good compliance with medications. No \n【256】history of opportunistic infections.   Frequent skin infections \n【257】are more likely due to poorly controlled DM than HIV. \n【258】He was continued on Sustiva and Truvada. \n【259】.\n【260】#Hyperlipidemia: Previous ___ measured on ___. \n【261】Patient has normal total Cholesterol but high triglycerides, \n【262】possibly secondary to HIV medications. Consider starting \n【263】Fibrates on outpatient basis.\n【264】.\n【265】# Anemia: Patient was discharged with hemoglobin of 13.5, he \n【266】presented with hemoglobin of 16 which trended down after 4+ \n【267】liters of fluids.  This is likely a dilutional effect and the \n【268】patient does not report any bleeding or dark stools.\n【269】.\n【270】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n【271】- Please consider alternative glucose regimens for this patient \n【272】because he has been consistently non-compliant with his current \n【273】regimen resulting in multiple hospital admissions for \n【274】hyperglycemia and manifesting as CKD\n【275】- Please consider initiation of an ACE inhibitor for renal \n【276】protection given his CKD and proteinuria.\n【277】- Please consider starting a fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia\n【278】 \n【279】Medications on Admission:\n【280】Truvada (Emtricitabine-Tenofovir) 200-300 mg q48h\n【281】Sustiva 600 mg QD\n【282】Aspirin 81 QD\n【283】Pravastatin 40 mg QHS\n【284】Lantus 50 SQ QHS\n【285】Humalog per sliding scale TID ___, 111-150=13U, \n【286】151-190=16U, 191-230=19U, 231-270=20U, 271-310=22U, 311-350=25U, \n【287】>351=27U\n【288】Glucerna LIQD TID\n【289】Cetirizine 10 mg PO QD\n【290】Melatonin 5mg QHS\n【291】Ranitidine 150 mg QD\n【292】\n【293】 \n【294】Discharge Medications:\n【295】1. emtricitabine-tenofovir 200-300 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet \n【296】PO Q48H (every 48 hours).  \n【297】2. efavirenz 600 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). \n【298】 \n【299】3. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \n【300】PO DAILY (Daily).  \n【301】4. pravastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY \n【302】(Daily).  \n【303】5.

Given \n【240】patient's worsening renal failure, we held a family meeting on \n【241】___ and ___ to discuss our goals of care, with the \n【242】decision to transition on comfort measures only and hospice \n【243】care.\n【244】\n【245】___:\n【246】The patient was discharged from ___ on ___ after she was \n【247】admitted with the flu with a BUN/CR 42/0.6. Per RN at ___ \n【248】___, BUN and Cr had crept up from 59/1.3 on ___ to \n【249】94/2.5 on ___. She also reported that the patient had received \n【250】3L during that time but her labs never improved. She had not \n【251】been hypotensive at the nursing home and had normal vitals and \n【252】sugars. She only stopped voiding much on day of transfer to \n【253】___. Renal was consulted in the ED, who recommended fluid \n【254】resuscitation for likely prerenal insult. Renal U/S was negative \n【255】for hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Of note, she was \n【256】receiving IV Ceftazidine (PICC) from previous CAUTI until ___. \n【257】FeNa was 1.9% on admission, concerning for intrinsic renal \n【258】injury, likely AIN. ___ w diff showed 10.1% eosinophilia (abs \n【259】EOS 1420). ___ thought to be AIN secondary to ceftazidine for \n【260】recent CAUTI. No muddy brown casts and no eos were seen on \n【261】spinning the urine. Cr continued to trend up to 3.6. Renal was \n【262】consulted and determined that she was not a candidate for \n【263】hemodialysis, and that the benefit of prednisone to treat AIN \n【264】would be outweighed by the side effects of decreased wound \n【265】healing and increased risk of infection. All nephrotoxic \n【266】medications/agents were avoided. All other medications were \n【267】dosed renally. Antibiotics were held as it was the likely \n【268】precipitant of the AIN. \n【269】\n【270】#Leukocytosis \n【271】#?CAUTI\n【272】Patient recently finished a 14 day course of antibiotics on ___ \n【273】for CAUTI with ceftazidime. Most recent UCx on ___ revealed \n【274】proteus and e coli sensitive to ceftaz, ceftriaxone, zosyn, \n【275】meropenem. Also history of pansensitive p. aeruginosa as well in \n【276】the past year. Has chronic indwelling foley at baseline which \n【277】was exchanged in the ED. UA with WBC >182, many bacteria, +leuks \n【278】with an uptrending leukocytosis and AMS (per son). Given concern \n【279】for UTI she did receive 1 dose of CTX in the ED. However, UA \n【280】pyuria could be better explained by AIN iso ceftaz use, and \n【281】bacteria colonization could be a chronic issue, and UCx showed \n【282】yeast. Repeat UA after Foley exchange w few bacteria. After the \n【283】1 dose of CTX, all antibiotics were held given suspicion for \n【284】AIN.\n【285】\n【286】#Hyponatremia: \n【287】Her hyponatremia was most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia ___ \n【288】inability to excrete free H2O in renal failure. Serum osmo 305, \n【289】likely elevated given BUN also elevated in setting ___ and is \n【290】likely actually hypoosmolar. We also obtained Urine Osm 272, UNa \n【291】27, possibly hypovolemic hyponatremia in setting of decreased \n【292】effective arterial blood volume, but hard to interpret given \n【293】worsening renal function. Na at 127 and trended up to 133 at \n【294】time of discharge before transition to CMO.\n【295】\n【296】#Anion gap acidosis: \n【297】In setting ___ (baseline Cr 0.6), on admission to ED, Cr 2.4. \n【298】Lactate wnl, no ketones and glucose in 150s with a near \n【299】compensated pH on VBG, low concern for DKA. Delta/delta \n【300】indicates coexisting high anion gap and normal anion gap \n【301】acidosis. Thus, we avoided NS to not worsen the acidosis, with \n【302】preference for LR. Likely due to renal failure. Per renal recs, \n【303】we gave bicarbonate replacement 2tabs TID to help compensation. \n【304】Electrolytes were trended daily until goals of care directed no \n【305】further laboratory testing. \n【306】\n【307】#Troponinemia: \n【308】EKG in the ED with no concerning ST changes, new q waves, or \n【309】twi. Troponin 0.24 in ED which is around her baseline on her \n【310】last admission. CKMB elevated 12, remained stable x2 in the ED. \n【311】Likely demand ischemia in setting of new urinary tract \n【312】infection. Serial troponins trending upwards to 0.31. Repeated \n【313】ACS workup as cannot assess for symptoms otherwise. Repeat ECGs \n【314】showed no ischemic change. Likely d/t decreasing renal fx, \n【315】unable to clear troponin from her blood and hence we did not \n【316】continue to trend to plateau. No heparin gtt and no aspirin load \n【317】was started. \n【318】\n【319】#Craniocervical jx soft tissue density: \n【320】CT head neck ordered in ED; incompletely characterized soft \n【321】tissue density at the craniocervical junction w extension \n【322】inferiorly and laterally with erosion of the R lateral mass of \n【323】C1 and dens. Could be degenerative per radiology but given rapid \n【324】progression compared to prior imaging, MRI recommended. Known hx \n【325】of CNS lymphoma. Primary onc looped into discussion, verified \n【326】pt's poor prognosis, that potential for sufficient recovery for \n【327】another cycle of chemo is vanishingly low. Non urgent MRI \n【328】recommended by radiology, but decided against this admission \n【329】given transition in goals of care to CMO. \n【330】\n【331】#Wound care: per discharge summary on last admission, patient \n【332】will need continued wound care for ongoing sacral decubitous \n【333】wound (Stage 4 pressure injury) open and developing deep tissue \n【334】injury on bilateral heels. \n【335】\n【336】CHRONIC ISSUES: \n【337】=============== \n【338】#T2DM: Continued scheduled and sliding scale insulin; but held \n【339】insulin on discharge given transition in goals of care.\n【340】\n【341】#Hypothyroidism: Held levothyroxine on discharge given \n【342】transition in goals of care.\n【343】\n【344】#Malnutrition: Continued tube feeds on discharge given family \n【345】preference; continue discussions after discharge about \n【346】discontinuation of tube feeds. \n【347】\n【348】#Anemia: Hgb at 8.8 on admission, at her baseline.

Patient experience leg \n【149】weakness and loss in sensation of the upper leg.  Most notably, \n【150】he had impairment of hip and knee extension.  Neurology and Pain \n【151】Management saw the patient and had concern for nerve compression \n【152】causing these finding.  He was evaluated by Dr. ___ \n【153】surgical drainage of the hematoma was considered to be very \n【154】risky and not recommended.  Interventional Radiology was \n【155】consulted and evaluated and hematoma is minimally liquid, and \n【156】they felt drainage would not be beneficial and was not \n【157】recommended.  It was discussed with family, and they were \n【158】inclined to pursue less aggressive measures at drainage, knowing \n【159】that recovery of leg function may not be complete and will \n【160】almost certainly be prolonged.  Hematocrit remained stable for \n【161】several days before his discharge, suggesting stabilization of \n【162】his bleed.  His mobility has been slowly improving.  Warfarin \n【163】was restarted without a bridge to minimize risk of rebleeding \n【164】while acknowledging the risk of emboli while off \n【165】anticoagulation.  He will go to rehab to continue recovery.  \n【166】Pain has been better controlled on narcotics, gabapentin and \n【167】acetaminophen, which should all be weaned as he continues to \n【168】recover.  He will require intensive ___ as an outpatient.

He had been started on tamsulosin recently with \n【175】improvement after stopping this medication.  It is also \n【176】suspected that a medication effect from opiates is present.  \n【177】Overall, his normal urinary function has been returning slowly, \n【178】and should continue to be monitored after discharge.\n【179】\n【180】# Hyperkalemia: unclear cause, mild, but present for several \n【181】days leading up to discharge.  This may be related to the \n【182】hematoma in his leg resolving and breaking down.  Chem10 should \n【183】be checked twice a week at rehab following discharge. \n【184】\n【185】# Acute on chronic kidney injury: patient was noted to have \n【186】acute kidney injury five days prior to discharge, thought to be \n【187】prerenal from decreased PO intake.  This improved with IVF \n【188】administration, back to his creatinine baseline of 1.7. On the \n【189】day of discharge, his creatinine bumped to 1.9.  He was \n【190】administered 1 liter LR.

INR should be trended daily until \n【202】level is consistently at ___.\n【203】\n【204】# Hypertension: patient's home valsartan is being held due to \n【205】creatinine elevation.   It should be evaluated whether this can \n【206】be restarted in the future.  His blood pressure was normal \n【207】during most of his hospital course.\n【208】\n【209】# GERD without esophagitis\n【210】# Hiccups: continued on his home pantoprazole, Pepcid.  Patient \n【211】had intractable hiccups throughout much of his hospital course.  \n【212】Chlorpromazine was attempted, with no effect, followed by \n【213】baclofen, which improved his symptoms somewhat.

The sensation and mobility of \n【324】your left leg was compromised due to this, and has been slowly \n【325】regaining function.  It was felt to be too risky to drain this \n【326】collection of blood surgically, so no procedure was undertaken \n【327】to drain this area.\n【328】\n【329】You also had intractable hiccups while admitted, which is felt \n【330】to be likely related to your gastric reflux, and were started on \n【331】a medication to help with this, with some small effect.\n【332】\n【333】You are now going to rehab.

No cells were found with the previously \n【444】observed ___ and ___\n【445】abnormal karyotype with trisomy 8. In addition, there was no \n【446】evidence by ___ of interphase cells\n【447】with trisomy 8 (see below).\n【448】\n【449】FISH: NEGATIVE for TRISOMY 8. No evidence of interphase bone \n【450】marrow cells with the\n【451】previously observed ___ and ___ trisomy 8. \n【452】There was also no evidence of\n【453】deletion 20q12.\n【454】\n【455】INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION REACTION (___)\n【456】DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. ___ \n【457】experienced\n【458】rigors, bone pain, a rash about 1.5 hours after infusion of an\n【459】apheresis-derived allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy \n【460】product.\n【461】There was also agitation, however, by report, the patient was \n【462】confused\n【463】prior to the stem cell infusions. Hemolysis is unlikely given an \n【464】ABO\n【465】compatible apheresis stem cell product. Bacterial cultures of \n【466】the stem\n【467】cell product showed no growth.\n【468】 \n【469】The patient's rigors may represent a response to cytokines, \n【470】similar to a\n【471】febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), due to \n【472】infusion of\n【473】white blood cells.\n【474】 \n【475】The rash, however, is not consistent with an FNHTR and was \n【476】reported as\n【477】morbilloform and not urticarial, as would be expected if there \n【478】was an\n【479】allergic reaction. In addition, it was almost two hours from \n【480】infusion\n【481】until symptoms occurred and the patient has had fevers in the \n【482】previous\n【483】days and a positive blood culture. As such, other non-infusion \n【484】related\n【485】causes of fever should be considered.\n【486】 \n【487】In summary, an FNHTR may have been contributed to the patient's\n【488】symptoms. The patient is restricted to leukoreduced red cell and\n【489】platelet products and this modification signficantly reduces the \n【490】risk of\n【491】FNHTRs (a stem cell product, however, cannot be leukoreduced due \n【492】to loss\n【493】of stem cells).\n【494】\n【495】 \n【496】Brief Hospital Course:\n【497】___ is a ___ year old female with high risk AML \n【498】s/p re-induction with MEC induction and decitabine consolidation \n【499】with evidence of CR on ___ BMbx. She presented for MUD \n【500】allogenic BM transplant on ___ (Day 0). During the course \n【501】of her hospital stay, the following issues were addressed:\n【502】\n【503】# AML. Relapsed AML s/p re-induction with MEC chemotherapy. By \n【504】BMBx in CR2, FISH negative for trisomy 8. BMBx pre-transplant on \n【505】___ showed CR. Her conditioning was unfortunately truncated \n【506】in the setting of sepsis as below and decreased functional \n【507】status. She received a total of 120 of fludarabine, ___ doses of \n【508】busulfan, and 1 ATG infusion before conditioning stopped. She \n【509】reached nadir on ___, Day 9 and showed evidence of count \n【510】recovery starting around Day ___, with platelet increase from \n【511】33-43. She was placed on acyclovir prophylaxis for the entirety \n【512】of her hospital stay, micafungin from ___, before switch \n【513】to fluconazole 400 mg daily on ___. Cyclosporine levels with \n【514】some fluctuations to supratherapeutic levels but largely \n【515】therapeutic. On ___ switched to oral cyclosporine. Discharged \n【516】with plan for pentamidine inhalation as an outpatient for PCP \n【517】___.\n【518】\n【519】# Sepsis and febrile neutropenia:  Became Febrile ___ at end of \n【520】ATG infusion. Defervesced then spiked again to 103 on the \n【521】morning of ___, with corresponding sepsis physiology, \n【522】tachypnea, AMS and elevated lactate to 5.5. MAPs stayed stable. \n【523】She was transferred to the FICU, received aggressive fluid \n【524】resuscitation with 4 L IVF and started on vancomycin, aztreonam \n【525】and IV cipro. This was deemed most likely due to subclavian line \n【526】infection. Ms. ___ had exquisite pain at site, with a \n【527】hematoma that likely served as nidus for infection. Her line was \n【528】pulled and her condition seemed to improved. Lactate peaked at \n【529】5.8 and decreased with IVF. She was in the ICU for 24 hrs with \n【530】subsequent resolution of tachypnea and encephalopathy and \n【531】transfer back to ___ service on ___. A single blood cltx grew \n【532】back VRE. She was switched from vanco to daptomycin on ___, \n【533】which was continued until count recovery on ___.\n【534】\n【535】# Acute Transaminitis: Ms. ___ had spike in LFTs with  ALT \n【536】of 525, AST of1275, LDH of 867, and ALP of 124 (Tbili normal at \n【537】6), albumin 3.1, INR 1.4. Was thought by hepatology to be most \n【538】likely medication-induced second to Busulfan but patient had \n【539】also received ATG. LFTs peaked at and continued to downtred \n【540】while patient remained on Ciprofloxacin and in setting of \n【541】worsening sepsis so these two entities were likely not \n【542】interrelated.  RUQ ultrasound revealed hepatic steatosis and \n【543】patent vasculature. LFT's improved after chemotherapy and were \n【544】normal by ___. INR peaked at 1.7, improved without vitamin K.\n【545】\n【546】#Afib: CHADS2-VASC of 3 (female, DM, HTN). Patient presented on \n【547】rate control regimen of carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID, Diltiazem XR \n【548】120 mg Daily and on apixaban 5 mg PO BID. After episode of \n【549】sepsis she was transitioned to metoprolol tartrate and diltiazem \n【550】___ for ease of titration. Rates initially in 100s-120s were \n【551】subsequently brought under good control. She was discharged on \n【552】Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg Daily and Cardizem 30 mg Q6H as \n【553】well as a reduced dose of apixaban while on fluconazole, \n【554】apixaban 2.5 mg BID.\n【555】\n【556】# Transfusion Reaction: On ___ Ms. ___ experienced a \n【557】severe reaction after infusion of apheresis-derived allogeneic \n【558】hematopoietic stem cells. 2 hours after second infusion bag was \n【559】finished, she experienced rigors, hip and jaw pain, flushing, \n【560】and a morbiliform rash over her back. Subsequent product \n【561】cultures showed no growth. After blood back investigation, \n【562】deemed that patient's rigors may represent a response to \n【563】cytokines, similar to a\n【564】febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), due to \n【565】infusion of white blood cells. \n【566】No changes to future transfusions/infusions were recommended.\n【567】\n【568】CHRONIC ISSUES\n【569】#DM: Managed well with metformin and insulin sliding scale at \n【570】home. Placed on sliding scale and fixed dose insulin in-house \n【571】with good effect.\n【572】\n【573】#Chronic ___ venous stasis: Stable, on 20 mg Lasix Q three days \n【574】and Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.025% Cream 1 BID PRN:itch. Held \n【575】lasix in setting of sepsis and then continued to discharge.\n【576】\n【577】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n【578】===================\n【579】- Consider change in rate control. Significant drug-drug \n【580】interactions between diltiazem and fluconazole\n【581】- On short acting diltiazem for the time being (switched from \n【582】diltiazem ___ 120 mg daily after episode of sepsis for ease of \n【583】discontinuation if nedded).\n【584】- Patient was switched to metoprolol from carvedilol for rate \n【585】control after episode of sepsis for ease of titration. Also \n【586】discharged with a reduced dose of apixaban while on fluconazole, \n【587】apixaban 2.5 mg BID.\n【588】- Patient will need PCP prophylaxis in near future, either with \n【589】inhaled Pentamidine in clinic or atovaquone (which she may not \n【590】be able to afford).\n【591】- Delirium: Patient became delirious on ___ in setting of \n【592】sepsis and with Ativan and Benadryl. Providers should be careful \n【593】with sedating meds in the future\n【594】\n【595】MEDICATION CHANGES:\n【596】- Started:\n【597】-- CycloSPORINE (Neoral) MODIFIED 75 mg PO Q12H \n【598】-- Diltiazem 30 mg PO/NG Q6H \n【599】-- Fluconazole 400 mg PO/NG Q24H \n【600】-- FoLIC Acid 1 mg PO/NG DAILY \n【601】-- LORazepam 0.5-1 mg PO Q6H:PRN anxietyStart: Postop \n【602】-- Metoprolol Succinate XL 75 mg PO DAILY \n【603】-- Multivitamins 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY \n【604】-- Ursodiol 300 mg PO BID \n【605】\n【606】- Changed:\n【607】-- Apixaban 5 mg BID -> Apixaban 2.5 mg BID\n【608】\n【609】- Discontinued:\n【610】-- Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG BID \n【611】-- Diltiazem Extended-Release 120 mg PO DAILY \n【612】\n【613】 \n【614】Medications on Admission:\n【615】The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n【616】1.

Reassuringly, though duodenum is narrowed, it is \n【178】patent. Concern also for narcotics withdrawal exacerbating \n【179】symptoms given recent heroin use. Pt was initially placed on \n【180】IVF's and treated symptomatically. Reviewed OSH imaging with \n【181】radiology here and unlikely that this was SMA syndrome based on \n【182】findings. Pt was evaluated by surgery here, who thought SMA \n【183】syndrome was very unlikely. LFT's were normal and lipase mildly \n【184】elevated, but normalized on repeat testing. His symptoms \n【185】improved with po clonidine initially and he was able to tolerate \n【186】a diet with prn ondansetron. Stool cultures were sent given a \n【187】loose bowel movement, but pending at the time of discharge.

By EMS report he was hypoxic \n【27】requiring a NRB, his HR was bradycardic between the high 50's to \n【28】low 60's and he was paced.  Prior to his presentation his \n【29】daughter notes that he has had weight loss, but is unsure if he \n【30】had any recent weight gain, he does have some lower extremity \n【31】edema.  She also reports that he has been intermittently hypoxic \n【32】at home for his ___ this week, he has had a recent change in his \n【33】oxygen prescription.  Previously he was on continuous oxygen, \n【34】however with recent recognition of his COPD and that his oxygen \n【35】saturations had been in the high 90's, so the decision was made \n【36】not to keep him on oxygen during the day, but only at night with \n【37】a goal O2 sat of 92%, his daughter had been uncomfortable with \n【38】this change.  \n【39】.  \n【40】In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8, 66, 102/68, 40, 94% on a NRB.  \n【41】His labs were notable for a white count of 23.7 with 78%N, no \n【42】bands, which is his baseline leukocytosis.  His BNP was 2511, \n【43】which is also around his previous values, Cr of 1.7, which may \n【44】be slightly up from his baseline and a troponin of 0.06, his \n【45】baseline is usually 0.04-0.05.  A CXR showed possible worsening \n【46】of a RLL infiltrate and slightly worsened pulmonary edema, his \n【47】EKG was paced with a rate in the 60's.  He was placed on bipap \n【48】for a very short period of time, with improvement in his \n【49】oxygenation to the high 90's, he did not tolerate the bipap well \n【50】so he was transitioned to ___ with oxygen saturations in the \n【51】high 90's.  He was given lasix 40mg IV x 1 for presumed CHF \n【52】exacerbation, and vanc/levofloxacin and ordered for meropenem \n【53】for HCAP.  His EKG was AV paced at 66 bpm.

Her typical migraine is always L\n【30】sided (never R sided) and associated with a visual aura of\n【31】\"squiggly lines\" and \"difficulty with depth perception\" which\n【32】improves when she covers one eye (?diplopia). HAs are throbbing,\n【33】with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. She was started on\n【34】verapamil as a prophylactic medication which was effective: her\n【35】migraine frequency decreased to once every ___ months. When she\n【36】got a headache she took hydrocodone which was effective in\n【37】aborting the headache. She previously tried triptans which gave\n【38】her nausea. She still intermittently required ED visits to\n【39】\"break\" a bad migraine. She states she had an MRI of her brain a\n【40】long time ago which was reportedly normal.\n【41】\n【42】On ___ the patient was at her ___ house in ___ and was woken up from sleep at 6 AM by what she describes\n【43】as her typical migraine headache. No preceding illnesses or head\n【44】injuries. She started vomiting later that morning and went to a\n【45】local ED, which give her Compazine and another medication IV.\n【46】This temporarily resolved her HA, and she went home, but later\n【47】that day had recurrence of her headache and went back to a\n【48】different ED where she got tramadol and a nausea medication.\n【49】Again the next 2 days she continues to have migraine headches.\n【50】Her PCP then prescribed her a 20 day prednisone taper, which\n【51】improved her headache so that she could function better, but she\n【52】continued to have now a daily headache. She is now off the\n【53】prednisone and continues to have daily headache. She feels her\n【54】daily functioning is impaired. She reports difficulty with\n【55】concentration and recently ordered 11 garlic breads by mistake\n【56】from Peapod, and paid her bills to the wrong amount (last months\n【57】amount instead of this months). She was also started on Depakote\n【58】for her headaches, and since then feels that her balance is a\n【59】little off and she is stumbling more, and also notes a postural\n【60】tremor which impairs her handwriting. She is also taking Fiorcet\n【61】TID, indomethacin TID, tramadol TID, but has not noted a big\n【62】improvement with any of them. Out of everything, the very first\n【63】dose of steroids seemed to help the most, but she continued to\n【64】have headaches daily during the long 20 day taper.\n【65】\n【66】She describes her current headache as L sided, throbbing,\n【67】associated with L ear tinnitus and photophobia.

Her Verapamil was uptitrated to 240 mg daily. \n【232】She was given a standing regimen of IVF, toradol and Zofran q6 \n【233】hours. Nortryptyline was considered, but it would interact with \n【234】her paxil. Topamax was started and titrated up to 50mg BID. She \n【235】had significant neck muscle spasm and so was also given \n【236】tizanidine which did seem to improve headache somewhat. Pain was \n【237】consulted and performed several nerve blocks after which her \n【238】headache was much improved. She was then discharged home with \n【239】follow up with pain medicine and with neurology.\n【240】\n【241】Transitional Issues: \n【242】- Can consider nortryptyline as needed, but would need to taper \n【243】off paxil.\n【244】- Pain clinic follow up, they will likely do botox as outpatient \n【245】since nerve blocks worked well, she needs follow up in one week \n【246】in case headache returns and she requires repeat nerve block \n【247】(short-term solution).\n【248】- Neurology clinic follow up\n【249】 \n【250】Medications on Admission:\n【251】The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n【252】1.

She was given a total of 3L of NS. She underwent a CT \n【143】of the abdomen/pelvis which showed sigmoid colitis. She received \n【144】500 mg of IV levofloxacin and 500 mg IV flagyl in the ED. Rectal \n【145】examination at that time revealed flecks of bright red blood. On \n【146】the floor, patient was monitored on telemetry, was typed and \n【147】crossed, had 2 units cross-matched, two large bore PIV's and \n【148】serial HCT's q6-8 hours. She was given IVF for hydration and \n【149】kept on bowel rest. We also continued her flagyl and cipro for \n【150】emperic coverage, ? infectious colitis.  On the morning of first \n【151】day of admission, she had two additional episodes of bright red \n【152】blood per rectum on the floor. We held her aspirin and BP \n【153】medications in order to avoid further bleeding or hypovolemia \n【154】respectively. GI was consulted and Dr. ___ patient in \n【155】the hospital. Given the unclear etiology of this episode of \n【156】diarrhea and BRBPR, flexible sigmoidoscopy was done, which \n【157】showed congestion and erythema with contact bleeding in the \n【158】sigmoid colon, consistent with ischemic colitis. Biopsies were \n【159】performed for histology at the sigmoid colon, but are pending at \n【160】time of discharge. Blood was noted in the rectum; otherwise \n【161】normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon. Per GI recs, patient was \n【162】recommended a low residue and soft diet for ___ days, hydration \n【163】and continuation of flagyl 500mg TID for the next 5 days. During \n【164】this hospitalization, patient's symptoms greatly improved. The \n【165】abd pain resolved and she did not have any more bleeding \n【166】episodes than the two on the morning of first day of admission. \n【167】Hct remained completely stable. She will have followup with Dr. \n【168】___ in a week and may have an outpatient colonoscopy. \n【169】\n【170】2) Diabetes Mellitus: Given bowel rest, little to no PO intake \n【171】and recent CT, we held her oral agents and put her on insulin \n【172】sliding scale as needed.  \n【173】  \n【174】3) Hypertension: Initially held her BP medications in setting of \n【175】bleeding, volume loss, potential for hypovolemia and \n【176】hypotension. BP meds were re-started upon discharge.\n【177】\n【178】4) Depression: Continued cymblata.  \n【179】  \n【180】\n【181】 \n【182】Medications on Admission:\n【183】- Centrum Silver Multivitamin Daily  \n【184】- Crestor 20 mg daily  \n【185】- Cymbalta 30 mg daily  \n【186】- Janumet 50 mg/1000 mg BID  \n【187】- ASA 81 mg  \n【188】- Tylenol ___ mg  \n【189】- Lorazepam 0.5 mg TID PRN  \n【190】- Cardizem CD 360 mg daily  \n【191】- Atlace 10 mg daily  \n【192】- Glipizie 20 mg daily  \n【193】- Calcium Citrate/Vitamin D2 315mg/200 units twice BID \n【194】 \n【195】Discharge Medications:\n【196】1.

There \n【179】were chronic bilateral cerebellar infarcts and a chronic right \n【180】occipital infarct noted. \n【181】\n【182】 \n【183】Brief Hospital Course:\n【184】Mrs ___ was admitted on ___ with report of stumbling to \n【185】the left. It is unclear whether she was ataxic or had left leg \n【186】weakness. Her brain MRI showed no acute stroke. There were \n【187】chronic bilateral cerebellar infarcts and a right occipital \n【188】infarct. GRE showed two small areas in the right hemisphere \n【189】concerning for chronic hemorrhage. MRA neck and brain showed no \n【190】significant stensoses or dissection.  Her symptoms resolved \n【191】rapidly. Therefore her diagnosis was a transient ischemic \n【192】attack. This TIA may have occurred in the left cerebellum or the \n【193】right ACA territory. Etiology could be small vessel disease. \n【194】Although she had one episode of atrial flutter in the past, \n【195】there was no cardiac arrhythmia noted during this \n【196】hospitalization. Persantine stress test in ___ showed an EF \n【197】of 49%. A cardioembolic event seems unlikely. The fact that she \n【198】was not taking aspirin for several days prior to the event may \n【199】have contributed to the TIA. We restarted her on aspirin 81 mg \n【200】daily, and the renal team approved of this, as currently no \n【201】intervention is required for her AV fistula. She will have a TTE \n【202】as an outpatient. \n【203】\n【204】She received hemodialysis while she was an inpatient.

Patient risk \n【225】factors including recent prednisone for her chronic cough/UIP \n【226】and known underlying lung disease. Felt to be atypical given no \n【227】focal consolidation on CXR: most likely mycoplasma, chlamydia \n【228】psittaci (given parakeet), or legionella. Also considering more \n【229】unusual pathogens that might have an acute on chronic \n【230】presentation, in setting of recent prednisone, including \n【231】aspergillosis, ___, coccidiomycosis. Feel PCP is very \n【232】unlikely given no hypoxia, patient steroid course brief, \n【233】otherwise not immunocompromised. Patient's leukocytosis and \n【234】fever resolve on azithromycin. Other infectious work-up with \n【235】blood and urine cultures was negative.  \n【236】-- Patient to be discharged with azithromycin to complete 10 day \n【237】course.  \n【238】-- Patient with sputum cultures pending for fungus and acid fast \n【239】bacteria including ___.  \n【240】-- Patient b-glucan and galactomannan also pending \n【241】-- Patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ will be able to \n【242】review these results at her pulmonary appointment ___ and \n【243】treat as indicated.\n【244】-- The patient was instructed to follow-up with her primary care \n【245】physician in two weeks regarding her recent hospitalization.\n【246】. \n【247】2) Usual Interstitial Pneumonitis: Patient presents with an \n【248】acute on chronic cough. Likely acute infection, see Pneumonia, \n【249】on chronic cough which may be due to inflammatory or infectious \n【250】process. Duration of chronic cough argues against an infectious \n【251】cause as the etiology. This may represent a side effect of her \n【252】ACEi which has been stopped. Other diagnosis have been \n【253】considered; however, ___ negative, ANCA negative, rheumatoid \n【254】factor within normal limits and immunoglobulin profile within \n【255】normal limits. The high resolution CT suggest the patient may \n【256】have had progression of fibrosis suggestive of usual \n【257】interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). It is likely that the patient's \n【258】elevated ESR and CRP are related to her current infection or \n【259】evidence of active UIP. The patient has also had a normal ECHO \n【260】with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Appreciated \n【261】pulmonary recommendations for the patient to follow-up with Dr. \n【262】___ in ___ for repeat PFTs, after she recovers from \n【263】pneumonia, and follow-up appointment. Patient will be discharged \n【264】home on albuterol, Atrovent, Guaifenesin/co diene and Tessalon \n【265】Perls for her symptoms.  \n【266】-- Patient with sputum cultures pending for fungus and acid fast \n【267】bacteria including ___.  \n【268】-- Patient b-glucan and galactomannan also pending\n【269】-- Patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ will be able to \n【270】review these results at her pulmonary appointment ___ and \n【271】treat as indicated.  \n【272】.  \n【273】3) Lactate elevation. Etiology unclear. No signs of sepsis. \n【274】Improved with treatment of pneumonia. \n【275】.  \n【276】4) Hypertension. Patient's blood pressure has been stable SBPs \n【277】100-120 off ACEi. No indication to restart any blood pressure \n【278】medications at this time.  \n【279】.  \n【280】5) Hypercholesterolemia. Patient was continued on low-dose \n【281】Statin therapy.  \n【282】.  \n【283】6) Depression. Patient was continued on citalopram.  \n【284】.  \n【285】7) Gastritis. Patient was continued on pantoprazole.  \n【286】.  \n【287】8) Arthritis. Patient's celecoxib was held while the patient was \n【288】in the hospital.

The gallbladder is normal without wall \n【104】thickening or gallstone.  The common duct measures 4 mm and \n【105】there is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.  The \n【106】visualized portion of the pancreas is unremarkable.  The \n【107】pancreatic tail is obscured by overlying bowel gas.  Mild \n【108】splenomegaly is present with the spleen measuring 13.8 cm.  \n【109】Bilateral kidneys are normal without hydronephrosis or stone.  \n【110】The right kidney measures 12.6 cm and the left kidney measures \n【111】12.1 cm.

He \n【132】presented with elevated Tbili to 4.5, INR that would peak at \n【133】3.3, ALT ~7,000, AST ~15,000, LDH 3,800. He was started on NAC \n【134】per protocol. Fortunately, he did well, and all his labs trended \n【135】down. NAC was stopped after 4 days. A transplant work-up was \n【136】done, but will likely be unnecessary. By discharge, his INR was \n【137】1.4, alt/ast were < 1000, t bili normalizing. He has no PCP, so \n【138】was encouraged   Finished NAC on ___. LFTs/coags have been \n【139】downtrending. As he has no PCP ___ (he is working on \n【140】getting one closer to his home), we arranged f/u in liver clinic \n【141】for now.  \n【142】.  \n【143】# Acute renal failure: Likely secondary to ATN from renal \n【144】hypoperfusion (from vomiting), and direct tylenol toxicity. His \n【145】creatinine was 5.9 on admission, peaked at 7.3, and he was \n【146】discharged w/ a creatinine of 2.0. No renal replacement therapy \n【147】was required. Urine output remained good during this time. He \n【148】was advised to stay hydrated, and to avoid NSAIDs, tylenol, and \n【149】other nephrotoxins.   \n【150】.  \n【151】# Hypertension: Patient denies a prior history of hypertension, \n【152】therefore is likely due to acute illness and renal failure. As \n【153】his blood pressure was as high as 180's/110's, and we wanted to \n【154】avoid further kidney injury, he was started on labetolol 200mg \n【155】PO BID. He tolerated this well, and will continue on it for now. \n【156】He will establish care w/ a PCP to monitor HTN, and if it \n【157】resolves he can stop. If he continues to have HTN, once ___ \n【158】resolves, likely he should be switched to a different agent \n【159】given he is a young, active male, and a beta-blocker would not \n【160】be first line therapy.   \n【161】.    \n【162】# CODE STATUS: full (confirmed)  \n【163】# EMERGENCY CONTACT: Mom ___ ___  \n【164】================================================\n【165】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n【166】# no new medications, herbals, supplements without consent of a \n【167】doctor\n【168】# no alcohol for time being\n【169】# no tylenol, NSAIDs, or OTC meds without consent of a doctor \n【170】# monitor blood pressure in outpatient setting.

His syncopal \n【111】episode this morning was probably due to orthostasis with \n【112】compounding factors of excessive alcohol ingestion during the \n【113】previous night and structural heart disease (MR, dilated aortic \n【114】root). His EKG and cardiac enzymes x 2 were normal. Of note his \n【115】CK rose from 354-->667, likely due to trauma. He was told to \n【116】hydrate as much as possible. His last echo on ___. On the \n【117】floors, he was not found to be orthostatic: lying: BP: 130/88, \n【118】HR: 70, sitting: BP: 128/82, HR: 70 and standing: BP: 116/80, \n【119】HR: 82.

He has followup appointments with both his \n【121】cardiologist and PCP. \n【122】.\n【123】Fracture of the ramus of the mandible: While syncopizing the \n【124】patient fell and hit his chin on the counter. He was given one \n【125】dose of Unasyn in the ER. Oral surgery evaluated him and \n【126】suggested continuing Augmentin 875-125 mg BID for 4 days. He \n【127】will followup with oral surgery in two days. He was advised to \n【128】limit his chewing and ingest many liquids. He was given 3 days \n【129】worth of Percocet ___ mg until his surgery appointment.\n【130】.\n【131】Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension. He used \n【132】to be on Lisinopril 10 mg, but decrease to 5mg. He describes \n【133】presyncopal episodes on exertion. He was advised to limit \n【134】activity until being assessed by PCP. His Lisinopril was \n【135】decreased to 2.5 mg qAM.\n【136】.\n【137】CV disease: The patient was advised in the past to take ASA 81 \n【138】mg for prophylaxis. We gave him a prescription.

No evidence for pulmonary embolism.  2. Large \n【173】simple pericardial effusion with flattening and elongation of \n【174】the right ventricle suggestive of tamponade. Would recommend \n【175】evaluation with clinical exam and/or cardiac echocardiogram.  3. \n【176】Small left simple pleural effusion. Bilateral basilar \n【177】atelectasis, left greater than right. 4. Mild pulmonary vascular \n【178】congestion suggestive of mild volume overload. 5. Left thyroid \n【179】nodule, stable.

Interval enlargement of cardiac silhouette, \n【190】pericardial effusion versus cardiomegaly.  2. Small left pleural \n【191】effusion with left basilar atelectasis or early pneumonia. \n【192】.\n【193】CARDIAC ECHO ___: The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. The \n【194】left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal \n【195】technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \n【196】fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \n【197】normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \n【198】motion are normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There \n【199】is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. The effusion \n【200】appears circumferential. There is right ventricular diastolic \n【201】collapse/compression, consistent with impaired \n【202】fillling/tamponade physiology. \n【203】Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \n【204】the pericardial effusion is now much large. \n【205】\n【206】POST TAP ECHO ___: There is a very small pericardial effusion. \n【207】There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade (RV not well \n【208】imaged). No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen. Compared \n【209】with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \n【210】effusion is much smaller.\n【211】 \n【212】Brief Hospital Course:\n【213】___ F with HTN, HL presenting with pleuritic shoulder pain, \n【214】presyncope, nausea, found to have a pericardial effusion with \n【215】tamponade.\n【216】\n【217】PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  On presenation pt had fluid seen on CTA, \n【218】found to have an increased pulsus paradoxus, and tamponade \n【219】confirmed with echo. Pt was taken to cath for tap of pericardial \n【220】fluid and drain placement. Pt reported immediate eleviation of \n【221】symptoms with fluid drainage except persistent chest/shoulder \n【222】pain with deep inspiration. After repeat ECHO showed minimal \n【223】residual fluid and no sign of recollection or tamponade, and \n【224】drain produced minimal output, pt's drain was removed. Pt then \n【225】felt additional relief of pain. \n【226】\n【227】Regarding the etiology of the effusion infectious or malignant \n【228】causes were most likely, as these are the most common sources of \n【229】pericardial effustion and she has no history of radiation, renal \n【230】failure or collagen vascular disease.  Her family history of \n【231】breast and ovarian cancer increase the concern for malignant \n【232】cause, however the acute onset and history of a few weeks of \n【233】fevers and elevated WBC would favor infectious etiology.  Workup \n【234】included viral, bacterial and fungal cultures, which were all no \n【235】growth to date at time of discharge. Also checked TSH, ___, HIV \n【236】and cytology which were all normal. Pt has unchanged pulmonary \n【237】nodules regarding which she will follow up with pulmonary, \n【238】thyroid nodules which will be biopsies on ___, and guaiac \n【239】positive school for which she will schedule outpt \n【240】followup/workup. \n【241】\n【242】ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: \n【243】Pt presented in atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated due to \n【244】pt's wishes. She was continued on Aspirin and was not \n【245】recommended anticoagulation given the bloody pericardial fluid. \n【246】Pt was tachycardic early in the admission with an episode of RVR \n【247】requiring increased dose of beta blockers. Pt was switched from \n【248】her home atenolol 25mg to Metoprolol 25mg PO BID to have a more \n【249】consistent rate control. \n【250】On the day prior to discharge, pt spontaneously reverted to \n【251】normal sinus rhythm and remained there at a rate of ___ \n【252】until discharge. \n【253】\n【254】Pt is to follow up with Dr ___ anticoagulation \n【255】in the future after having a repeat echocardiogram to document \n【256】resolution. \n【257】\n【258】It is possible that a slowly growing pericardial effusion or \n【259】pericardial irritation may have been the cause of the atrial \n【260】fibrillation. Also possible but much less likely, is that the \n【261】atrial fibrillation is related to a silent MI, and the \n【262】pericardial fluid represents a Dressler's syndrome. \n【263】\n【264】HYPOXIA: \n【265】After pt's pericardial fluid was drained she still required \n【266】significant oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, especially \n【267】with movement. A CXR showed a small left-sided pleural effusion, \n【268】and some atelectasis, consistent with the bronchial sounds heard \n【269】at the left base on exam. Situation was attributed to \n【270】atelectasis in the setting of stenting from pleuritic pain. Pt's \n【271】O2 improved with use of incentive spirometry over time and at \n【272】discharge she was satting mid to high ___ on room air. \n【273】\n【274】ELEVATED LFTS: \n【275】LFTs on presentation were AST 145, ALT 151, Alk Phos 197 and \n【276】were attributed to congestion in teh setting of RV failure from \n【277】tamponade. LFTs trended down throughout the hospital stay. \n【278】\n【279】HYPERTENSION: Pt was started on Metoprolol for afib rate control \n【280】and blood pressures were also well controlled on this regimen \n【281】thus lisinopril and HCTZ (which were initially held given \n【282】tamponade physiology) were not restarted. BP was well controlled \n【283】and at time of discharge pt's SBP was ranging 100s-120s. \n【284】\n【285】DEPRESSION: Pt was continued on her outpt regimen of Paxil\n【286】\n【287】PROPHYLAXIS: Given the possibility of malignancy causing \n【288】hypercoagulability and general immobility, pt was on Heparin \n【289】5000U TID subcataneously for DVT prophylaxis. \n【290】\n【291】 \n【292】Medications on Admission:\n【293】ATENOLOL - 25 mg Tablet - 2 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day, was \n【294】only taking 25 mg/day following low blood pressures last week\n【295】FLONASE - 50MCG Spray, Suspension - ONE SPRAY TWICE A DAY\n【296】HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE - 25 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a \n【297】day\n【298】LISINOPRIL - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\n【299】PAROXETINE HCL [PAXIL] - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth \n【300】once a day\n【301】PRAVASTATIN [PRAVACHOL] - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth 1 \n【302】po qd\n【303】ASPIRIN -  (OTC) - 325 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a \n【304】day\n【305】OMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [PRILOSEC OTC] -  (OTC) - 20 mg Tablet, \n【306】Delayed Release (E.C.) - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\n【307】 \n【308】Discharge Medications:\n【309】1.

Patient has new head CT with signs of acute RMCA stroke, \n【342】now bilateral disease.  In the initial evaluation, the patient \n【343】was very confused and disoriented, and concerning for possible \n【344】non-convulsive status epilepticus.  He received Ativan 1 mg IV \n【345】and had a further deterioration of his mental status.  The \n【346】patient was then intubated for airway protection and admitted to \n【347】the neuro ICU.\n【348】.\n【349】Hospital course by problem;\n【350】.\n【351】Neuro; The patient was admitted to the neurological ICU after \n【352】intubation in the Emergency Department.  His home aspirin was \n【353】discontinued and he was started on plavix.  Given his \n【354】disorientation and somnolence, he was initially started on \n【355】keppra, however this was discontinued the following morning as \n【356】his bilateral hemispheric disease from strokes were thought to \n【357】account for his change in mental status.   His blood pressure \n【358】was allowed to autoregulate for the first 48 hours after the \n【359】event.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no cardiac source \n【360】for his stroke.  The patient's LDL was 74 and HbA1c was 5.6.  He \n【361】was continued on a statin and fingersticks were covered with \n【362】regular insulin sliding scale.  He underwent an MRI brain and \n【363】MRA of his head and neck.  The MRI brain confirmed the right \n【364】parietal subacute infarct, however also appeared suspicious for \n【365】possible acute infarct in the left parietal lobe in the region \n【366】of his prior stroke in ___, as this region was also bright on \n【367】DWI and dark on ADC.  This remains somewhat uncertain as the \n【368】area of infarct appears unchanged when comparing to his imaging \n【369】in ___, although MRI sequences do reveal the concern for \n【370】possible bilateral acute strokes.  An MRA of the head and neck \n【371】was notable for moderate to high-grade narrowing at the origin \n【372】of the right ICA, although degree of stenosis was difficult to \n【373】quantify.  Therefore, the patient underwent CTA head and neck \n【374】which showed ___ stenosis at the origin of right internal \n【375】carotid artery, which was considered mild , and it did not show \n【376】evidence of any other abnormality. A transesophageal \n【377】echocardiogram was attempted which could not be completed owing \n【378】to parapharyngeal mass. His examination is notable for \n【379】inattention, fluent empty non meaningful speech, moving all \n【380】extermities antigravity.\n【381】.\n【382】Respiratory; The patient was extubated on HD#2 after receiving \n【383】his MRI/A. he was maintaining good saturation on oxygen mask \n【384】after transfer from ICU to floor.  \n【385】.\n【386】ID; The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection on \n【387】___ and was started on ciprofloxacin.  A urine culture was \n【388】sterile. He was given cipro for 7 days.\n【389】.\n【390】CV; The patient was continued on his beta blocker at ___ his \n【391】home dose to allow for permissive hypertension in the acute \n【392】setting of stroke and as he was bradycardic on telemetry with a \n【393】heart rate in the ___.  This can be titrated up to his home \n【394】dose of atenolol 100 mg daily as tolerated. He was in atrial \n【395】fibrillation, with controlled rate. Heparin or coumadin was not \n【396】started immdiately because of concerns for hemorrhagic \n【397】transformation. he was started on his home meds in stepwise \n【398】fashion keeping a watch over his blood pressure.\n【399】.\n【400】GU; The patient had hematuria upon arrival to the ICU.  This was \n【401】thought to be secondary to traumatic foley placement.  This \n【402】responded to irrigation and his hematocrit remained relatively \n【403】stable.\n【404】.\n【405】Endo; The patient was continued on his glipizide and \n【406】fingersticks were treated with regular insulin sliding scale.  \n【407】\n【408】ENT; patient was noted to have parapharyngeal mass for which ENT \n【409】consult was sought. They felt that this does not require urgent \n【410】work up and does not pose contraindication for anticoagulation, \n【411】should felt necessary for other reasons. \n【412】\n【413】Nutrition\n【414】He was evaluated by nutrition team. he was encouraged to \n【415】increase PO intake and to undergo calorie count. It was felt \n【416】that he would require PEG tube.

The patient \n【86】exercised for 4 minutes on ___ protocol and was stopped for \n【87】increasing ventricular irritability associated with atypical \n【88】chest pain \n【89】and pre-syncopal symptoms. The estimated peak MET capacity was 5 \n【90】which \n【91】represents a poor exercise tolerance for her age. The patient \n【92】presented \n【93】to the lab with ___ left sided chest \"pressure/tightness\". This \n【94】\n【95】discomfort was TTP and worse with deep inspiration. It \n【96】progressed to a \n【97】___ with exercise and was also associated with pre-syncopal \n【98】symptoms \n【99】and \"tunnel vision\". The pre-syncopal symptoms resolved by 4 \n【100】minutes in \n【101】recovery and the CP returned to baseline by 5 minutes \n【102】post-exercise. \n【103】There were no significant ST segment changes seen during \n【104】exercise or \n【105】recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated VPBs, \n【106】several \n【107】ventricular couplets, and brief run of VT at peak exercise (6 \n【108】beats at \n【109】~160 bpm). The BP response to exercise was appropriate and A BP \n【110】obtained \n【111】during VEA was 194/60 mmHg.

Systemic hypertension.\n【135】\n【136】ECHO ___:\n【137】The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \n【138】thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \n【139】normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging \n【140】suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left \n【141】ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular \n【142】chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of \n【143】aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The \n【144】aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \n【145】stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The \n【146】mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no \n【147】mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen \n【148】(within normal limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \n【149】could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \n【150】IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular regional and global systolic \n【151】function.

Surgeon was Dr. ___.\n【79】At the time of surgery, it was noted, once perfused, the kidney \n【80】was uniformly pink.  As hemostasis was assured, the kidney \n【81】became somewhat purple and mottled. There was a good pulse in \n【82】the renal arteries, and there was a good Doppler signal in the \n【83】renal parenchyma, and it appeared there was spasm in the renal \n【84】artery which was\n【85】treated with topical application of papaverine.  The kidney then \n【86】pinked up nicely over the next several minutes and had good \n【87】tone. \n【88】There were no bleeding complications noted, and the patient was \n【89】extubated and taken to PACU in stable condition.\n【90】\n【91】The patient received routine induction immunosuppression to \n【92】include Myfortic 720 mg BID (started due to history of \n【93】gastroparesis from long standing DM). He received 500 mg \n【94】intra-op solumedrol and completed the solumedrol to prednisone \n【95】taper on POD5. He received 125 mg thymoglobulin intra-op, with a \n【96】total of three doses thymo 125 mg given. Tacro was started on \n【97】the evening of POD 1, with daily levels checked and dosage \n【98】adjusted per level.\n【99】\n【100】In the PACU, the urine output was noted to be decreasing, and he \n【101】was transfused two units of RBCs and a renal ultrasound was \n【102】obtained. This showed patent transplant renal vasculature with \n【103】slightly elevated resistive indices with no hydronephrosis or \n【104】perinephric fluid collection. \n【105】\n【106】The patient was started on Neo and was transferred to the ICU. \n【107】Urine output was 1800 cc the first day, JP drain output was less \n【108】than 100 and not bloody in appearance.\n【109】\n【110】Creatinine, which was 8.1 on pre op labs was down to 5.0 on post \n【111】op labs and by POD 2 was down to 1.5, and for the rest of the \n【112】hospital stay was 1.1 or 1.2, and was 1.2 on day of discharge. \n【113】Urine output was between 1500 and ___ cc daily.\n【114】\n【115】The patient stayed in the ICU on Neo for several days. Of note, \n【116】there was a large discrepancy between the A line that was placed \n【117】on the right arm below the fistula, and the left arm pressures \n【118】that he had typically been using at HD. The difference was 40 - \n【119】60 mmHg different. However, the left arm seemed to be \n【120】artificially high, as when the neo was titrated to keep the \n【121】right arm A line above 110, the urine output would increase.\n【122】Decision was ultimately made to use cuff pressures on the right \n【123】arm.\n【124】\n【125】The patient was having orthostasis, which he does have a \n【126】longstanding history with his DM. He would become lightheaded \n【127】and feel weak. \n【128】On POD 4 from the kidney transplant, the patient had been off \n【129】Neo for 24 hours, and Midodrine had been started. As such he was \n【130】transferred to the regular surgical floor.\n【131】\n【132】Patient continued to have issues with his blood pressure, widely \n【133】variable from low ___ to mid ___. However with standing he was \n【134】continuing to have symptoms of orthostasis and was also \n【135】symptomatic.\n【136】\n【137】The midodrine was increased to 15 mg TID and florinef was added. \n【138】This too was titrated to final dose of 0.3 mg daily. Sodium \n【139】bicarb was added to increase salt load, and patient has been \n【140】encouraged to drink three liters daily.\n【141】\n【142】Blood glucose control was initially a challenge with the \n【143】steroids. Patient is followed as an outpatient by ___, and \n【144】the also followed him while in house. He was ultimately started \n【145】on Humalog ___ to be given BID at home, and has short term \n【146】follow up with ___ as well.\n【147】\n【148】Patient continues to have some symptoms of lightheadedness. He \n【149】has a wheelchair at home.

CT head with no acute changes and evidence of \n【209】prior infarct in R medial parietal lobe. Another ischemic event \n【210】may be contributing, but Pt has several clips in his body from \n【211】prior surgeries and it is unclear whether these are compatible \n【212】w/ MRI, which would be the next imaging modality to select. \n【213】Electrolytes normal. Seems levels for barbituate and phenytoin \n【214】are near prior levels and are not supratherapeutic. Phenytoin \n【215】level is a bit low when corrected for albumin but unclear what \n【216】prior free phenytoin level is. No current evidence of seizures \n【217】and no description of symptoms based on history provided by \n【218】family, however, non-convulsive seizure could certainly \n【219】contribute to worsening confusion though Pt's daughter reports \n【220】his prior seizures were tonic-clonic. EEG did not show any \n【221】evidence of seizure. B12, RPR, TSH all normal. Pt was discussed \n【222】with PCP, who feels this is likely due to continued progression \n【223】of primary neurological state or possible additional chronic \n【224】ischemic disease. Per Pt's last neurology note, Pt seems to be \n【225】at baseline. There was a discussion that phenobarbital may be \n【226】affecting his memory and thought of tapering off this \n【227】medication, but this has not been done, reportedly per the \n【228】daughter based on some EEG results, though EEG her showed no \n【229】seizure. Pt completed a three day course of ceftriaxone. Pt was \n【230】discharged to assisted living and will have follow-up with his \n【231】neurologist who will pursue further analysis and adjustment of \n【232】his anti-epileptic medication.\n【233】\n【234】# UTI: many bacteria and moderate pyuria on UA, but was also \n【235】treated with tmp/smx previously. Pt denies any symptoms but he \n【236】has a chronic urostomy. Urine culture only grew mixed flora, \n【237】which was worked-up further and showed Strep viridans and Staph \n【238】aureus ___, consistent with skin contamination. Pt never had \n【239】fevers, leukocytosis, or pain near his urostomy. Doubtful that \n【240】this is a clinically significant urinary tract infection, but Pt \n【241】was treated for three days with ceftriaxone 1g iv q24.\n【242】\n【243】# ___: unclear baseline. Cr 1.3 but in ___, and Pt was treated \n【244】w/ tmp/smx, so increase may simply be drug effect and not true \n【245】decrease in renal function. Tmp/smx course ended day of \n【246】admission. Pt's Cr did not respond to 1L of NS. FENa 1.3% \n【247】suggestive of intrinsic renal disease. Cr improved back to \n【248】baseline 1.4 on ___ without intervention.\n【249】\n【250】# bradycardia: unclear etiology or duration. Seems sinus \n【251】bradycardia based on regular rhythm. Possibly effect from beta \n【252】blocker, and Pt's atenolol was discontinued. Pt denies any \n【253】symptoms except occasional orthostasis. ECG shows sinus \n【254】bradycardia. Pt's HR stable in 45-50 range for most of his \n【255】admission. This was discussed with Pt's PCP, who will pursue \n【256】further workup as an outpatient.\n【257】\n【258】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n【259】\n【260】# CAD s/p CABG: continue home clopidogrel, atorvastatin\n【261】\n【262】# epilepsy: continue home phenytoin 100mg po bid, phenobarbital \n【263】32.4mg po bid.

There is no thick enhancing rim to suggest empyema. \n【301】There is \n【302】associated atelectasis and moderate volume loss in the right \n【303】lower lobe.  \n【304】3. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Paramediastinal \n【305】fibrosis is longstanding and consistent with radiation exposure. \n【306】\n【307】4. Extensive collateralization within the chest and mediastinum \n【308】with \n【309】nonvisualization of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins \n【310】bilaterally, including surrounding the left-sided \n【311】Port-A-Catheter. These \n【312】findings suggest central venous occlusion. The SVC is patent. \n【313】 \n【314】Brief Hospital Course:\n【315】___ year old female with a prior history of diffuse large B-cell \n【316】lymphoma in the mediastinum s/p R-CHOP and R-EPOCH chemotherapy \n【317】and radiation [completed ___ who has been in complete \n【318】remission since then, who presented with recurrent fevers which \n【319】continued even on appropriate therapy for a Pseudomonas PNA and \n【320】C.diff. \n【321】\n【322】# Fever of unknown origin:  The patient presented with ongoing \n【323】fevers.  During her hospital course infection was a major \n【324】concern in the differential.  Her fevers were initially thought \n【325】to be due to a recurrent pseudomonal pneumonia, however she was \n【326】treated appropriately with ceftazadime throughout her hospital \n【327】course and continued to experience fevers.  She was found to be \n【328】C.diff positive and was initially treated with po flaygl, \n【329】however this was changed to po vancomycin due to fever despite \n【330】tid Flagyl treatment of her C.diff colitis.  A PPD was placed \n【331】and was negative and a quantaferon-gold test was sent, the \n【332】results were pending at time of discharge.  Cultures from the \n【333】T11 biopsy, bone marrow, and pleural fluid were all no growth.  \n【334】She did continued to grow pseudomonas from her sputum, making it \n【335】likely that this was a contaminant.  \n【336】\n【337】She underwent a throacentesis on admission which showed so many \n【338】white blood cells due to her pneumonia so that cytology could \n【339】not be accurately performed to evaluate for abnormal cells.  An \n【340】MRI of her T11 vertebrae showed abnormal bone marrow edema \n【341】concerning for malignancy so a CT-guided biopsy of T11 was \n【342】preformed.  Pathology showed only connective tissue and cultures \n【343】have been no growth to date.  Due to her history of a bronchial \n【344】stent in her left lobe she underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate \n【345】for evidence of infection of the stent which was within normal \n【346】limits.  A BAL was done which grew pseudomonas.  Given \n【347】persistent pleural effusion and cough she underwent a second \n【348】thoracentesis which showed improvement of the white count of the \n【349】pleural fluid and 11% other cells which were described as \n【350】immature immunoblasts.  Cytology showed atypical cells.  Due to \n【351】concern for malignancy as a source of her fevers a bone marrow \n【352】biopsy was preformed which did not reveal any evidence of \n【353】malignancy.\n【354】\n【355】Besides infectious disease and heme/onc consults, rheumatology \n【356】was also consulted as rheumatologic disease remained in the \n【357】differential for FUO, however they did not feel that further \n【358】rheum workup was indicated given lack of history to point \n【359】towards a specific disease.\n【360】\n【361】# Respiratory distress: Throughout her hospitalization she had \n【362】multiple episodes of respiratory worsening, then improvement.  \n【363】Her respiratory distress was initially thought to be due to her \n【364】pseudomonal PNA.  She began improving, but after the \n【365】bronchoscopy she worsened and her CXR showed a new infiltrate in \n【366】her RUL. She was treated for a possible MRSA HCAP for a 7 day \n【367】course with vancomycin.  She was placed on standing nebs and \n【368】guafenesin.  She was encouraged to use incentive spirometry and \n【369】get OOB with her family and ___.  Due to continued shortness of \n【370】breath with exertion a TTE was preformed which showed no acute \n【371】change but mildly decreased systolic function.\n【372】\n【373】# Psudomonas pneumonia:  She was thought to have recurrent \n【374】pseudomonas pneumonia from incomplete treatment after her \n【375】previous admission for pnueumonia.  There was some concern for \n【376】empyema given persistence of a right pleural effusion and a \n【377】thoracentesis was done which had elevated counts of red and \n【378】white blood cells but no organisms, and the culture was \n【379】negative.  There was also concern for lymphoma recurrence, but \n【380】cytology of the pleural cells was negative for atypical cells \n【381】and a CT of the chest and abdomen did not reveal any new areas \n【382】of adenopathy.  She was followed by both the heme-onc and \n【383】infectious disease consult services and was ultimately completed \n【384】a three week course of ceftazadime.  She will need five more \n【385】days of PO vancomycin. \n【386】\n【387】# Right pleuritic chest pain:  This was thought to be secondary \n【388】to pleurisy from her right pleural effusion, and it improved \n【389】gradually over the course of her hospital stay.  A chest CTA was \n【390】performed to rule out pulmonary embolism and was negative.  She \n【391】was managed with tylenol and oxycodone prn.\n【392】\n【393】# Left subclavian vein stenosis:  She was found to have \n【394】significant collateral venous circulation in chest incidentally \n【395】on a chest CT to rule out PE, and this was consistent with \n【396】chronic obstruction of the left subclavian vein.  It was unclear \n【397】whether the obstruction was due to subclavian stenosis from the \n【398】left chest port catheter or a chronic thrombosis, and left upper \n【399】extremity ultrasound was performed which was negative for clot.  \n【400】An MRV of the extremity was considered for further evaluation of \n【401】the nature of the stenosis, as a chronic clot could not be ruled \n【402】out with the ultrasound study, but after discussion with \n【403】radiology, it was determined that no noninvasive test would be \n【404】able to differentiate between chronic sclerosis and clot.  \n【405】Because the collateral circulation suggested a chronic process \n【406】and because there was no concern for PE, it was concluded that \n【407】the stenosis was likely secondary to the existence of a port \n【408】catheter in the vein.\n【409】\n【410】# NHL: She has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the \n【411】mediastinum s/p R-CHOP and R-EPOCH chemotherapy and radiation \n【412】[completed ___ and also has a right bronchial stentin place.  \n【413】She has been in complete remission.  The heme-onc service was \n【414】consulted to evaluate whether her fevers could be related to a \n【415】cancer recurrence, but there was no evidence of this, as \n【416】described above.\n【417】\n【418】# ___ sclerosis:  Sclerosis of T11 spine found incidentally \n【419】on abdominal CT and likely represents radiation changes.  An MRI \n【420】was performed to further evaluate it and showed some abnormal \n【421】bone marrow edema at T11.  A biopsy was completed.  Cultures \n【422】have been no growth to date, cytology was negative, and \n【423】pathology preliminarily has shown only connective tissue.\n【424】\n【425】# Tachycardia:  She was in a sinus tachycardia throughout the \n【426】hospital stay with a heart rate between 90-110, and it was \n【427】generally not fluid responsive.  It was thought to be secondary \n【428】to her underlying infectious process and physical \n【429】deconditioning.\n【430】\n【431】# Anemia:  She has chronic anemia and had declined outpatient \n【432】colonoscopy.  She was given 1 unit of PRBC during her \n【433】hospitalization when her Hct dropped to the low 20's for \n【434】symptomatic benefit.  Her Hct remained in the mid to high 20's \n【435】through most of her hospitalization.  She was guaiac negative. \n【436】Bone marrow biopsy did not show recurrent lymphoma. Colonoscopy \n【437】will be arranged as outpatient.\n【438】\n【439】# Asthma: She was continued on advair and albuterol prn.\n【440】  \n【441】# Hypothyroidism: She was continued levothyroxine.   Her TSH was \n【442】mildly elevated but FT4 was within normal limits.  She should \n【443】have a repeat TSH performed in the beginning of ___.\n【444】\n【445】# HTN: She was initially continued on dilitiazem, however her \n【446】blood pressure was on the low side so this was stopped and she \n【447】remained normotensive.\n【448】\n【449】# Patient will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.  \n【450】\n【451】# Code: Full code\n【452】 \n【453】Medications on Admission:\n【454】DAILY:  \n【455】DILTIAZEM HCL - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 120 mg Capsule, \n【456】 \n【457】Sustained Release - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)  \n【458】LEVOTHYROXINE - 100 mcg Tablet - 1 Tablet by mouth once a day on \n【459】 \n【460】___ through ___, do not take on ___  \n【461】INTERMITTANT USE:  \n【462】ALBUTEROL - 90 mcg Aerosol - 2 puffs(s) q4-6h as needed for \n【463】cough  \n【464】or throat irritation  \n【465】CALCITONIN (SALMON) - 200 unit/dose Aerosol, Spray - 1 spray to  \n【466】\n【467】nostril daily.

She arrived to the lab with her chronic \n【171】upper back \n【172】discomfort. She exercised 10.5 minutes of a Gervino protocol \n【173】___ METs, \n【174】average functional capacity for age/gender) and the test was \n【175】terminated \n【176】due to fatigue. No progressive arm, neck, back or chest \n【177】discomfort was \n【178】reported by the patient throughout the study. There were no STTW \n【179】changes \n【180】with exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent \n【181】\n【182】isolated vpbs at rest and in recovery. The ventricular ectopy \n【183】resolved \n【184】at HR > 85 bpm during exercise. Appropriate heart rate and blood \n【185】\n【186】pressure response to exercise and recovery. \n【187】  \n【188】IMPRESSION: Average functional exercise capacity. No anginal \n【189】type \n【190】symptoms or ischemic EKG changes to achieved workload. Normal \n【191】hemodynamic response to exercise. Echo report sent separately. \n【192】\n【193】___ ECHO:\n【194】The patient exercised for 10 minutes and 30 seconds according to \n【195】a Gervino treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart \n【196】rate of 122 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 170/68 mmHg. The \n【197】test was stopped because of fatigue. This level of exercise \n【198】represents an average exercise tolerance for age and gender. In \n【199】response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave changes (see \n【200】exercise report for details). There is normal resting blood \n【201】pressure with normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to \n【202】stress. \n【203】\n【204】 Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 64 bpm and a \n【205】blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg. These demonstrated normal \n【206】regional and global left ventricular systolic function. Biplane \n【207】LVEF = 69 %. Right ventricular free wall motion is normal. There \n【208】is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrated no aortic \n【209】stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant mitral \n【210】regurgitation or resting LVOT gradient. .\n【211】\n【212】 Echo images were acquired within 76 seconds after peak stress \n【213】at heart rates of 105 - 87 bpm. These demonstrated appropriate \n【214】augmentation of all left ventricular segments. There was \n【215】augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. \n【216】\n【217】 IMPRESSION: Average functional exercise capacity for age and \n【218】gender. No ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible \n【219】ischemia to achieved workload. Normal hemodynamic response to \n【220】exercise. \n【221】\n【222】 \n【223】Brief Hospital Course:\n【224】Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ w/ ___ Afib on amiodarone, \n【225】HTN, and HLD, who presents with generalized weakness, \n【226】palpitations, and chest pressure with exertion, concerning for \n【227】angina. \n【228】\n【229】#CORONARIES: Unknown \n【230】#PUMP: EF 65%\n【231】#RHYTHM: NSR with bigeminy \n【232】\n【233】ACTIVE ISSUES: \n【234】==============\n【235】# Chest pressure\n【236】# Palpitations\n【237】# Frequent PVCs\n【238】Patient presented with chest pressure that occurred at rest. Her \n【239】ECG was unremarkable and troponins were negative. On interview, \n【240】she describes her chest pain as localized to her rib cage and \n【241】non-exertional, which is less concerning for anginal pain. \n【242】Differential includes anxiety vs. arrhythmia. Review of her \n【243】telemetry revealed numerous PVCs with no evidence of higher \n【244】degree block, which likely explains her palpitations. She has an\n【245】unclear history of HFpEF and is on several heart failure \n【246】medications - it is unclear whether or not she needs these \n【247】mediations. Her last TTE in ___ showed an EF 65% with \n【248】preserved systolic function. She had a stress echo which was \n【249】negative for ischemic changes. \n【250】\n【251】# Weakness\n【252】# Episodic hypotension\n【253】# Dizziness\n【254】Patient presented with weakness, dizziness, and reported \n【255】hypotension that began the night before presentation. \n【256】Orthostatics on admission were slightly positive and patient \n【257】received 500cc IVF. Notably, she is on several anti-hypertensive \n【258】medications, including clonidine, carvedilol, amlodipine, and \n【259】lisinopril. Her dizziness/weakness is likely in the setting of\n【260】hypotension secondary to overmedication. Her symptoms improved \n【261】since holding her home carvedilol, clonidine, and torsemide. She \n【262】also recevied a small amount of IVF. \n【263】\n【264】# ?HFpEF ___ AV Fistula\n【265】Patient had a TTE in ___ that showed EF 65%. She takes \n【266】torsemide 5mg PO daily at home, reportedly for a fistula. On \n【267】exam, patient appeared euvolemic, and CXR on admission did not \n【268】show evidence of pulmonary edema. A Pro-BNP was checked and was \n【269】not elevated. She had a stress echo, as above, and was treated \n【270】with her home amlodipine and lisinopril during her admission. \n【271】Her home torsemide and carevedilol were held, as there were no \n【272】clear indications for these medications and patient's blood \n【273】pressure was low-normal. \n【274】\n【275】CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: \n【276】======================\n【277】# Atrial fibrillation\n【278】ECG shows NSR with frequent PVCs. CHADS2-VASc 1. Continued home \n【279】amiodorone 200mg PO daily\n【280】and dabigatran 150mg PO BID\n【281】\n【282】# HTN\n【283】Continued home amlodipine 5mg PO daily and lisinopril 15mg PO \n【284】daily. Held home carvedilol and clonidine as blood pressure was \n【285】low-normal during admission and patient was having dizziness, \n【286】likely explained by overmedication (see above). \n【287】\n【288】# HLD\n【289】Last cholesterol 157 on ___. Continued home atorvastatin \n【290】20mg PO daily\n【291】\n【292】# Positive quantiferon gold\n【293】Patient recently had positive quant gold on ___. Per her OP \n【294】provider, she was not having active symptoms and is asymptomatic \n【295】upon presentation. Likely represents latent TB rather than \n【296】active infection.\n【297】\n【298】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n【299】====================\n【300】[ ] Discontinued medications: Clonidine 0.1mg PO daily, \n【301】Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID, Torsemide 5mg PO daily\n【302】[ ] Unclear why patient was needs so many heart failure \n【303】medications - there seems to be no indication for these \n【304】medicines.

When your left arm swelled \n【296】up after the first hemodialysis session, we did several tests to \n【297】rule out a clot in the arm and to check how well your fistula \n【298】was working. You received a procedure called a fistulogram, \n【299】which showed that there was a narrowing of the veins, which was \n【300】then fixed. \n【301】\n【302】You will need to continue hemodialysis sessions regularly after \n【303】leaving the hospital. As part of your work-up to receive \n【304】hemodialysis in the out-patient setting, we screened you for TB \n【305】and for hepatitis viruses and your results were negative.

During his stay in the MICU he was \n【276】continued on Protonix drip and octreotide which continued for \n【277】24hours afterwhich he was resumed on BID PPI. Ceftriaxone was \n【278】started at OSH for SBP prophylaxis in setting of fever, however \n【279】it was continued for antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of an \n【280】UGIB.  Pt received total of 7uPRBC (OSH and in ___ MICU) since \n【281】bleeding began. While in the MICU, pt remained hemodynamically \n【282】stable without further bleeding. His initial HCT was 26.4 and \n【283】this increased to 34.9 on transfer to the floor, 32 at time of \n【284】discharge. It was noted that he had not been taking his variceal \n【285】PPX (propranolol) for about a month prior to admission, which \n【286】may have contributed to his varices, and he was therefore \n【287】started on nadolol for further prophylaxis.\n【288】\n【289】#Airway Protection/Mechanical ventilation: Pt was intubated at \n【290】OSH prior to arrival for airway protection in the setting of \n【291】UGIB.

Your heart arteries \n【335】were examined (cardiac catheterization) which showed a blockage \n【336】of one of the arteries that was previously by-passed. This was \n【337】opened by placing a tube called a stent in the artery. You \n【338】improved considerably and were ready to leave the hospital.\n【339】\n【340】WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  \n【341】-It is very important to take your heart medications, most \n【342】importantly aspirin and prasugrel (also known as Effient) every \n【343】day.  \n【344】-These two medications keep the stents in the vessels of the \n【345】heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart \n【346】attack.  \n【347】-If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing \n【348】a blood clot forming in your heart stents, and you may die from \n【349】a massive heart attack.  \n【350】- Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below)  \n【351】- Follow up with your doctors as listed below  \n【352】- Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms \n【353】or you develop chest pain, swelling in your legs, abdominal \n【354】distention, or shortness of breath at night. \n【355】 \n【356】It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the \n【357】best!  \n【358】-Your ___ Care Team  \n【359】 \n【360】Followup Instructions:\n【361】___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": "多余换行#0#361#全文存在多处多余换行", "type3": "无关文本#356#358#内容与上文无关", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-01 22:42:46", "update_time": "2024-04-02 21:44:39"}
