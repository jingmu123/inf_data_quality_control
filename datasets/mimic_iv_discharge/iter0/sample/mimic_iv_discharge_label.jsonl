Likely source considered pneumonia, as had diffuse bilat patchy infiltrates on CXR, new O2 requirement, and increase work of breathing which was consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Initially differential included bacterial pneumonia vs. viral infection with ARDs type pathology. Blood cultures were negative. Urine culture no growth. Initial bronc had 90%polys and grew had gram negative coccobacilli. Repeat bronch demonstrated 28% eosinophils. Patient was treated with broad spectrum antibx including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levoquin. \nElective inbution was performed for respiratory distress on day of admission. RIJ was placed and a-line was also placed. \nPatient was agressively fluid resuscitated with goal to maintain CVP ___ with UOP > 30 cc/hr. Patient initially was also on levophed (norepinephrine) for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. On night of admission, cardiology called to come assess patient as small pericardial effusion on chest CT in the context of hypotension and tachycardia and sepsis; fellow did not see any evidence of large pericardial effusion or evidence of tamponade physiology. Patient had to be proned one day in order to maintain oxygenation status. APACHE II score was calculated and patient was not felt to be a candidate for activated protein c administration. Urine legionella was sent and was negative. As cultures were all essentially negative, patient was started on stress dose steroids for presumed acute eosinophilic pneumonia. Urine legionella was negative. CMV was negative. Patient was HIV negative with rapid screen as well as with viral load studies. \nWith initial concern for patient's status, patient was also started on ambisome for fungal coverage. Once culture negative for evidence of gram +, vancomycin was discontinued. Ambisome was continued until patient significantly improved, as urine histo was still pending. Additional cultures were drawn. O+P was negative. C. diff negative. mycoplasma negative. Pt. was felt to possibly have adrenal insufficiency based on testing in the icu, felt possibly induced by etomidate. Imaging did not show adrenal infarct or pathology. He was written for a lengthy steoid taper on discharge and arranged to see endocrine in follow up for continued evaluation.\n\n【20】Pt rapidly improved with steroids and antibiotics, and all infectious work up was negtive including multiple serologies for infectious and other causes of his resp. failure.

The recordings at these times showed normal waking patterns, without change at the time of the pushbutton activation. On routine sampling there was minimal left temporal slowing but an otherwise normal background. No electrographic seizures were captured. There were no epileptiform discharges \n\n【17】___\n\n【18】This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine sampling showed a normal background in wakefulness and in sleep. \nThere was a single left temporal sharp wave. No electrographic seizures were recorded. \n\n【19】___\nThis telemetry captured six pushbutton activations. Only one had changes on EEG, and a report of symptoms was absent. The \n\n【20】patient was speaking with a visitor at the time but activated the system herself. There was some rhythmic 4 Hz slowing without clear epileptiform features, seen broadly over the right anterior quadrant with a bit of extension to the left. Several seconds later there \n\n【21】emerged ___ Hz sharp waves over the right anterior quadrant,centering at T4. At this point, the patient appeared to be staring a bit to the left and not interacting in her usual way. No clearly epileptiform abnormalities were seen at other times. \n\n【22】___\nThis telemetry captured nine pushbutton activations. \nSeveral were associated with relatively brief (four to ten second)semi-rhythmic 3 Hz higher voltage activity in the right temporal region with some sharp features but without prominent rhythmicity or epileptiform features. This was found during one prominent incident of unresponsiveness to a conversation, but slowing on the right and left(again, generally quite brief and not rhythmic and sharp as in many seizures but definitely appearing newly with the symptom) were found with reports ___, i.e. the same symptom was associated with paroxysmal changes on the two sides. Interictally, there was an occasional right anterior temporal sharp wave. \n\n【23】___\nThis telemetry captured five pushbutton activations. There were no clear signs of electrographic seizure with any of them although there was some right temporal slowing seen before one activation \n\n【24】although admixed with muscle artifact and not clearly epileptic. \n\n【25】Infrequent discharges seen on earlier recordings were no longer evident on this one. \n\n【26】___\nThis telemetry captured 13 pushbutton activations. There were three very well-recorded seizures. The most prolonged was clearly left temporal and included immobility of responsiveness although with some semi-purposeful movement of the hands. Others included the right temporal 3 Hz somewhat sharp but irregular activity seen on earlier recordings. \n\n【27】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted and EEG monitoring was begun. Her keppra was continued at the home dosing regimen with zonisamide discontinued on the first day. She had multiple events including visual changes, auditory changes, and word-finding difficulties. Initially, These events did not appear to correlate with any epileptiform discharges, however preliminary results from monitoring session demonstrated intermittent left temporal slowing and sharp waves with normal background activity. Per patient request, keppra was slowly decreased starting on ___ as she was concerned that the medication might be contributing to cognitive difficulties she was having. \nShe was monitered closely on EEG telemetry for evidence of seizures . Her EEG did reveal evidence of seizure acivity as per EEG report dated ___. She was started on Keppra and gradually increased to 1500 BID and Oxcarbazepine 450 BID.

SYNCOPE: etiology of syncope is likely secondary to medication effect as patient was reported to be non-adherent on anti-hypertensive regimen and took all of her medications at once prior to seeing her PCP. This could also be secondary to orthostatic hypotension from volume depletion due to decreased PO intake. The patient is elderly, lives alone and appears quite unkempt and disheveled and could possibly have poor nutritional status at baseline. Other important etiologies to consider are cardiac arrythmias or structural heart disease, although patient had EKG only concerning for sinus bradycardia and prolonged QT interval. Her prolonged QT interval could contribute to syncope. \nThe etiology of this EKG abnormality is unknown as she is not currently on any medication that could exacerbate this. There are no old studies for comparison. She was monitored on telemetry and had no alarms or further episodes of syncope. Her enalapril and calcium channel blocker were held due to prevent further episodes of hypotension. She had no complaints during her stay and was afebrile, with no leukocytosis. The plan was for discharge on ___ to her ___ apartment so she could have careful monitoring. However, she failed her physical therapy evaluation as she was unsteady on her feet and appeared confused. ___ determined she needed 24 hour supervision.\n\n【25】2.

HYPERTENSION: Patient should take HCTZ in the morning/enalapril and dynacirc in the evening to minimize large drops in blood pressure that can precipitate syncopal event. Initially,Ms. ___ HCTZ and ___ were held (CCB and BB continued) due to concerns about her elevated creatinine. It was unclear whether this was acute or chronic renal insufficiency.

She was worked up with ECHO, cath (displaying no significant CAD) and cardiac MRI consistent with diagnosing focal myocarditis. She would benefit from symptomatic therapy and close outpatient cardiology f/u with ECHO in 1 month (no exercise or strenuous physical activity for ___ months).\n\n【23】ACTIVE ISSUES:.\n\n【24】#NSTEMI Her elevated troponin with no/mild EKG changes were consistent with NSTEMI. Troponin T peaked at 1.67, but remained plateaued on ___. Hemodynamically stable. TTE showed mild anterior wall hypokinesis in mid LAD territory c/w CAD. However, cardiac catheterization showed <30% stenosis, suggesting either rapid clot lysis or vasospasm. Her symptoms of chest pain are atypical as they generally occur at rest, and this most recent episode lasted several hours. TIMI score 2 (age>___ and cardiac markers)puts her at 8% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. PE ruled out with negative D dimer at OSH. \nWell's criteria puts her in low risk category for PE (1 point for potential hemoptysis, although brushing teeth may cause gingival bleeds). She was monitored on tele throughout stay. She underwent cardiac catheterization on ___ which demonstrated no flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease (___% RCA,___ LAD), and normal LVEF. There was a mildly elevated left-side filling pressures. Furthermore, TTE on ___exhibited mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction(mid LAD territory), an LVEF 55%. Given lack of CAD explaining her presenting NSTEMI, further diagnoses were considered. \nCardiac MRI performed to evaluate for possible myocarditis,and/or information regarding the distribution of hypo-kinesis or injury. This was read as consistent with focal myocarditis with LGE enhancement that spared the endocardium. Her chest pain resolved. She was started on metoprolol succinate and lisinopril. It was explained that she would benefit from limiting her physical activity during the healing phase of myocarditis. \n\n【25】CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:.\n\n【26】#HTN\n#LVH: Discontinued home nifedipine, started ACE inhibitor therapy for d/c\n#GERD: Concerned for re-occurrence of H. pylori given chest pain symptoms associated with eating. H pylori stool antigen was not detected. Important to keep in mind that may be false negative due to recent PPI use.\n\n【27】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[]Please obtain a repeat ECHO (TTE) in 1 month for evaluation of wall motion\n[]Please avoid exercise/strenuous activity for 1 month before getting re-checked and cleared by your cardiologist\n[]Cardiac MRI was suggestive of focal myocarditis, we considered a potential viral URI but the history was not supportive of this.

History was obtained from pt's wife, as he is unable to provide any history. For the past few days, he has had worsening difficulty with ambulation and forgetfulness. He has been complaining of left hip pain, which his wife attributes to his being less active recently. He has also had a cough for the past 4 days, which has been getting progressively worse. The morning of admission, he could not remember his wife's name and was unable to walk. At baseline, he knows his wife's and daughter's names, his own name and his birthday, but is otherwise not oriented.

There are bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, worrisome for aspiration and/or infection. There is slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, which may be due to mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. \nIMPRESSION: Right greater than left bibasilar opacities concerning for underlying pneumonia and/or aspiration. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.\n\n【19】___ CT Head w/o con: Left frontoparietal hypodensities are again noted, consistent with prior infarcts, as seen on prior CT and MRI. Severe white matter hypodensity is likely secondary to sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Prominent sulci and mildly prominent ventricles suggest age-related involutional changes. There is no CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus. \nThe basal cisterns appear patent. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well-aerated. No acute bony abnormality is detected. \n\n【20】Brief Hospital Course:___ year old man with PMHx left MCA infarct with residual right sided deficits, HTN, HLD, DVT, A Fib (on Pradaxa) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome presenting with confusion, fever,leukocytosis, and SOB.\n\n【21】ACTIVE PROBLEMS:\n# PNA/Sepsis: Fever, bandemia and Right sided infiltrate consistent with PNA. He was tachypnic in the ED, though satting well on minimal supplemental O2. He lives at home with his wife;no hospitalizations in the last 90 days, therefore this is consistent with community acquired pneumonia. Meets ___ SIRS criteria, though no e/o end organ hypoperfusion or lactic acidosis. He was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime though levofloxacin was added on hospital day #2 for atypical coverage. A sputum sample was sent for culture which revealed normal respiratory flora. The patient was transferred to the regular medical floor on day #2 and was satting well on 2L and breathing comfortably. Given that the patient is not at high risk for hospital acquired PNA or aspiration (denies episodes of choking), cefepime and vanco were discontinued. While his right lung fields still are rhoncourous at the time of discharge, he was breathing comfortably and satting well on RA. He will be discharged on levofloxacin po for a total of 7 days (last day___. Of note, we were entertaining the idea of foreign body obstruction or post-obstructive so if his lungs do not clear or he decompensates after antibiotics this should be revisited. To that end, he should have a CXR in 6 weeks to confirm resolution of PNA.\n\n【22】#UTI: He was found to be growing proteus, pan sensitive. He was already on antibiotics (for above PNA).\n\n【23】# Leukocytosis/bandemia: Was found to have bandemia on admission, likely secondary to his acute infections that are now being treated. Blood cultures have been NGTD (with 1 bottle growing coag-neg staph likely contaminant.) Elevated WBC resolved by discharge.\n\n【24】# Encephalopathy: Likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of acute infection. CT head negative for acute process and no focal neurologic deficits. No metabolic abnormalities. Encephalopathy resolved while treated with antibiotics.\n\n【25】# Hematuria: This is a new finding for Mr ___, likely partially related to systemic anticoagulation. His wife states he has been incontinent recently; denies h/o BPH. He was treated for proteus UTI with levaquin. Recommend outpatient f/u if hematuria continues.\n\n【26】CHRONIC PROBLEMS:\n# Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in NSR. Continued Pradaxa.\n\n【27】# Anemia: Likely multifactorial. ACD and Fe deficiency given low MCV and elevated RDW. Stable.\n\n【28】# HTN: Initially held lisinopril, restarted on discharge.\n\n【29】# Depression: continued citalopram.\n\n【30】# HLD: Continued lovastatin.\n\n【31】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- He should have a CXR in 6 weeks to confirm PNA resolved (as per above)\n- He should be reassessed for hematuria as an outpatient and referred for further evaluation\n- If pt has recurrent pneumonia symptoms after discontinuation of antibiotics, he may need CT scan vs bronch to assess for obstructive pathology.\n\n【32】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She re-presented to ___ on___ with abdominal pain. Her labwork was significant for elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and lipase. Her total bilirubin was normal at 0.6. She had a leukocytosis of \n16.1. She was kept NPO and given IV fluids while her condition was evaluated. A CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed peripancreatic fluid but no discrete collection, abscess, or pseudocyst at that time. On the following day, the patient underwent an MRCP to evaluate the biliary tree for stones. The exam showed no calculi present and a swollen, edematous pancreas consistent with acute pancreatitis. There was no evidence of pancreatic necrosis. During this time, Mrs. ___ was kept NPO and given IV fluids. IV narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics were provided as necessary. During her stay, the patient was intermittently nauseous, requiring intermittent anti-emetic administration. \n\n【24】Because her liver enzymes and lipase levels were still elevated,Mrs. ___ underwent an ERCP on ___. During the procedure,a sphincterotomy was performed and sludge was removed. After the procedure, her labwork revealed a subsequent decrease in her lipase level from 1269 to 102. Her transaminases and alkphos decreased accordingly as well. Her total bilirubin was within normal limits. On exam, however, the patient was still having abdominal pain on palpation. Although she was having bowel function, her diet was advanced cautiously. She was started on sips with oral medications, which she tolerated fairly well. \nShe complained on intermittent nausea, which was initially treated with Zofran, which was ineffective. Phenergan was then administered with better results. She tolerated the medication well without any adverse side effects. Because of her continued nausea, slightly elevated WBC and frequent loose stools, a stool specimen was sent for c. difficile testing, which was subsequently negative. \n\n【25】Over the following days, Mrs. ___ was slowly advanced to a regular diet as her LFTs and lipase levels stabilized. Once she began taking adequate oral intake, her IV fluids were discontinued. As she began to feel better and was normalized on a diet, Mrs. ___ was ready for discharge home with follow-up in the ___ clinic. She was ambulating independently,tolerating a regular diet, and voiding without issue.\n\n【26】At the time of discharge, Mrs. ___ was afebrile,hemodynamically stable and in no acute distress. She required no prescription for pain and was instructed to take over-the-counter analgesics if needed. She was also instructed that if her nausea persists or becomes worse, to contact the ___office or contact her PCP.\n\n【27】Medications on Admission:\n1. Albuterol 2 puffs prn\n2.

You were evaluated in the Emergency Department. Your initial labwork showed elevated liver enzymes wich could indicate a retained stone in your cystic duct. You underwent a MRCP on ___ which indicated that there was no stone present. Because a MRCP does not show stones 100% of the time, you then underwent an ERCP on ___. During that procedure, you had an ERCP in which they removed sludge from your common bile duct and a sphicterotomy was performed to help drain the duct in the future. \n\n【33】Since that time, you have recovered well and are being discharged home.

Alcoholic Cirrhosis & Portal Hypertension:\nBecause of his DOE and increased abdominal girth, there was a concern for ascites initially. An abdominal CT showed no evidence of ascites, however, but did demonstrate a cirrhotic liver, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension. There was also a concern for malignancy given his nonspecific constitutional complaints on presentation and an AFP was found to be markedly elevated at 560. Because no discrete lesion was seen on CT, an abdominal MRI was performed because of its higher sensitivity,but its findings were similar to that of the CT with the exception of a mild amount of ascites present on this study. \nStill, no lesion consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma was appreciated. The hepatology service was consulted and recommended sending an alpha 1 antitrypsin and an AFP-L3. The former was normal and the latter was elevated. He was set up with outpatient hepatology follow-up and will likely need serial CTs every three to four months. The discordance between the high AFP and absence of a visualized liver lesion was unexplained.\n\n【30】#. MSSA bacteremia: \nOn the day of anticipated discharge, he developed right forearm peripheral IV infiltration with purulent drainage, surrounding cellulitis, and fever. Blood cultures were positive for high grade MSSA bacteremia with ___ bottles positive. He was started empirically on vancomycin but transitioned to nafcillin once sensitivities became availabe, and he will complete a one week course. He was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic throughout his entire hospitalization, other than fatigue. A TTE was repeated and was negative for vegetations. As the clinical suspicion for endocarditis was low, TEE was not pursued. Because of a scheduling problem with ___, he was given a prescription for one dose of dicloxacillin to bridge him at home until the nurses could set up his nafcillin pump.\n\n【31】#. Pancytopenia:\nHe had stable pancytopenia that was thought to be ___ cirrhosis or perhaps pan-suppression in the setting of potential malignancy. An HIV test was negative. Aspirin was held because of concern for bleeding (though his Hct remained stable throughout and he had no bleeding events) and the risks and benefits of aspirin for primary prevention will need to discussed with his PCP.\n\n【32】#. Dyspnea:\nHe complained of dyspnea on exertion (normal ambulatory O2 sat)that was thought to be secondary to his 30 pound weight gain and deconditioning. TSH was normal. A chest CTA was negative for PE but did show pleural plaques and lung nodules consistent with his history of asbestos exposure. He will need follow-up CTs per ___ guidelines to evaluate for interval change. He was empirically treated with furosemide to reduce mild lower extremity edema but this was stopped because his creatinine rose. \n\n【33】#. Microscopic hematuria:\nHe had no complaints of dysuria and urine cultures were negative but his urinalysis was positive for protein and microscopic hematuria. Urine cytology was unremarkable. The etiology of his hematuria is unclear and will need further evaluation by urology as an outpatient. \n\n【34】#. Borderline Pulm Htn:\nHe had a TR gradient of ___ mmHg consistent with mild pulm HTN, and this was presumed to be ___ undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea given his obesity. An outpatient sleep study was recommended.\n\n【35】#. BPH:\nStarted on tamsulosin with improvement in nocturia. Also used this agent because he has borderline hypertension.\n\n【36】Medications on Admission:\nASA 81\n\n【37】Discharge Medications:\n1. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg Capsule, Sust.

Because of the nature of your symptoms, we examined many possibilities of these symptoms. We evaluated you for a heart attack, congestive heart failure, fluid in your abdomen (ascites), thyroid problems, lung problems including a clot in the lungs or a punctured lung, and others. Given your history of alcoholic liver disease, we performed imaging of your liver, which showed liver cirrhosis with elevated pressures in your blood vessels going to the liver(also known as portal hypertension) as well as some ascites(fluid in your belly). But imaging did not show any focal lesions indicative of cancer. You were also found to have low counts of several blood cells (red cells, white cells,platelets). This is commonly found in cirrhosis. Because you were found to have an elevated alpha-fetal protein (AFP) level,there was concern of a malignant process & this continues to be a possibility. It will be important to follow this closely with your hepatologist (liver doctor).\n\n【44】During this hospital stay, we found bacteria in your bloodstream. This is a serious infection, and we are treating you with an intravenous antibiotic called nafcillin. You will be receiving this from a pump.\n\n【45】In addition, on this admission, you were found to have an abnormal urine analysis. This was notable for blood and blood-related substances, which is likely the reason why your urine has been dark. This is quite possibly unrelated to your other health issues. We would recommend you followup with your PCP for further evaluation.\n\n【46】During this admission, we also found that you have elevated blood pressures, and you may have essential hypertension. \nFurthermore, we found that you have slightly elevated blood pressures inside your lungs. This can be seen in obstructive sleep apnea. Please followup with your PCP to manage these as an outpatient.\n\n【47】You were also found to have low blood counts including low white blood cell, platelet, and red blood cell counts. Please follow up with a hematologist as an outpatient. Your PCP ___ arrange this.\n\n【48】Finally, the CT scan of your chest revealed findings consistent with your exposure to asbestos. Please follow up with your PCP to monitor this going forward.\n\n【49】MEDICATION CHANGES:\nWe are discharging you home with a new medication which should help you with frequent urination. This is called tamsulonin. \nPlease take 0.4 mg of this every evening. Your urologist and/or PCP ___ help you manage this further.\n\n【50】STOP taking aspirin for now. Your platelet count is low and your PCP ___ have to weigh the benefits of aspirin against the risks of bleeding.\n\n【51】Please return to the hospital emergency room if you experience worsening swelling of your legs or abdomen, severe shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, yellowing of the skin (jaundice)or the white of your eyes (icterus), bleeding with bowel movements, vomiting blood, black stools, dizziness,light-headedness, loss of consciousness, chest pain, high fevers, abdominal pain, or any other medical emergency.\n\n【52】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

No blood or BM yesterday, Hct is stable. Differential includes hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease,diverticulosis, colitis whether infectious or ischemic,gastroenteritis or angiodysplasia. Patient does not report using frequent NSAIDs or aspirin. In a patient of his age, it is unlikely to be diverticulosis or ischemic colitis. \nAngiodysplasia is also to be unlikely given the patient's young age. Given his report of \"white flecks\" that were moving,greater concern for infectious etiology or possibly worm. Was in___ in ___. No e/o eos on diff, though. Also, IBD is high on the differential in a patient of his age, especially given repeated hospitalizations for n/v/d. No anemia, perianal disease or other obvious extraintestinal manifestations. ESR pending at the time of discharge. Patient did not have a bowel movement during admission so no stool studies were sent. Per GI,patient should have a non-urgent outpatient endo-colonoscopy to further evaluate symptoms. In addition, he should be tested for HIV, having a fasting blood sugar and CRP checked, though ESR and TFTs were wnl. A CT could be considered as an outpatient as well for further work up of his abdmoinal symptoms.\n\n【21】# Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology. Patient initially reported that this had been going on for a long time, then stated that it developed over the last two days. Only occurs once or twice daily and relieved with BM, but patient is tender to palpation over his mid-abdomen. This was mildly improved with a GI cocktail and ppi. LFTs and lipase within normal limits. CBC without leukocytosis and normal diff. Differential dx is similar to that above including infectious or inflammatory bowel disease. IBS unlikely given blood in his stool. He was managed symptomatically and did well during the admission. Further GI work up as above.\n\n【22】# Weight loss: Per OMR, weight on ___ was 176 lbs during his most recent visit with his PCP. He was 150 pounds in ___, which are his only recorded weights. Patient states that he had been trying to gain weight and was 200 pounds in ___. He does report decreased exercise recently due to time constraints but no change in his diet. Also reports increased hunger/hyperphagia. Differential includes infectious gastroenteritis/colitis, IBD, malabsorption, for example celiac disease. Also could consider endocrine disorder such as thyroid disease, though this would not be associated with blood in his stool. Does not appear to be associated with food and weight loss is not chronic issue. Patient has a history of conversion disorder as well as other psychiatric issues as per OMR. \nUnclear if he did in fact lose 15 pounds over one month. This should be evaluated further as an outpatient. TSH was within normal limits as was ESR.\n\n【23】# Pleuritic chest pain: D-dimer well within normal limits. Low pretest probability given the reproducibility of the patient's symptoms. Satting 100% on RA. CXR without any abnormalities. \nPatient is very active. This is likely either musculoskeletal or referred pain from the abdomen. ECG in the ED showing NSR without STT wave changes. Relieved with ibuprofen and tylenol as well as GI cocktail.\n\n【24】# CODE: FULL \n\n【25】Medications on Admission:\nNone\n\n【26】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Tox screen positive for cocaine, unclear whether he took anything else, endorsed using benzos once awake and responsive. \n\n【34】# Altered Mental Status: Intubated and sedated at admission,initially non-responsive off sedation. Lactulose started and mental status improved, also placed on rifaximin. Lactulose continued prn once stool output increased, and patient oriented x3.\n\n【35】# Shock: Likely a combination of severe dehydration (was found down in the hot sun) and direct cocaine toxicity. Patient was fluid rescusitated and was inititally on pressors which were later weaned and then had to be restarted, weaned off again___. \n\n【36】# Respiratory failure: Patient was initially intubated for agitation and altered mental status. He was extubated on hospital day #2, however was reintubated the same day for hypoxemic respiratory distress. He was found to have E. coli on BAL and completed an 8 day course for VAP. He was subsequently extubated successfully and maintained normal SpO2 on room air.\n\n【37】# Pneumothorax: Patient developed a right-sided pneumothorax as a complication of a subclavian line placement in the ___. A chest tube was placed with re-expansion of the lung and eventually removed.\n\n【38】# Liver failure: Patient developed liver failure, complicated by coagulopathy and hypoglycemia. He was supported with blood products (plateletes, FFP). The etiology is felt to be secondary to direct cocaine toxicity and shock. Hepatitis serologies were consistent with prior Hep B vaccine and prior Hep A exposure. \nHep C, EBV, CMV were all negative. A liver biopsy was obtained which showed necrosis with fungal elements. His bilirubin remained markedly elevated throughout. \n\n【39】# Fungemia: Patient with yeast on urine and sputum cultures and later found to have yeast on peritoneal fluid and liver biopsy. \nHe was started on micafungin with plan for course defined by whether or not there was a drainable fluid collection in the liver.\n\n【40】# Renal failure: Patient developed anuric renal failure. A temporary HD line was placed and CVVH was started. A tunneled HD line was later placed and CVVH/HD were continued and eventually transitioned to HD once hemodynamics improved, though still required additional volume with HD initially.\n\n【41】# DIC: Patient developed DIC in the setting of shock and multiorgan failure. This was confirmed by schistocytes on his blood smear. He was supported with platelets, FFP, and cryo as needed and recovered counts.\n\n【42】# Abdominal compartment syndrome: Patient developed worsening abdominal distention and bladder pressures in the low ___. \nSurgery was consulted and the patient was taken for an abdominal fasciotomy and left open for >72h. He was eventually taken back to the OR for closure and later developed wound dehiscence requiring wound vac. He developed worsening abdominal pain and markedly reduced stool output later in course, c/f SBO. KUB showed no dilated loops or air fluid levels, he was kept NPO and improved within 24h.\n\n【43】# Diarrhea: Pt. developed profuse diarrhea after starting tube feeds. GI was consulted and this was felt to be a malabsorptive process. Bile salt excess also possible, consider cholestyramine.\n\n【44】# Diffuse Intraabdominal bleeding in setting of DIC from GNR bacteremia. After a short period of relative stabilization from above events, on ___, pt developed altered mental status,rising lactate, and was found to have new GNR bacteremia and ultimately severe intraabdominal bleeding with recurrent abdominal wound dehiscence. He went to the OR for an attempt at closure, at which time the severity of the abdominal bleeding was noted and he went into shock. He was in hypovolemic and septic shock. He was volume resuscitated > 40 units of blood products with > 15 units of PRBC, > 10 units of FFP, 10 units of cryo, DDAVP and 4 units of Plt. He continued to have ongoing coagulopathy with intrabdominal bleeding which was likely from his portal hypertension varices which are not amenable to surgically management. A family meeting was held to explain the grave prognosis and explain that since we could not stop his intrabdominal bleeding with surgical or medical means. He was maintained on three pressors until family decided to transition to comfort measures. Family was at bedside at his terminal event on ___. \n\n【45】Medications on Admission:\nNone\n\n【46】Discharge Medications:\nN/A\n\n【47】Discharge Disposition:\nExpired\n\n【48】Discharge Diagnosis:\nDeath\n\n【49】Discharge Condition:\nN/A\n\n【50】Discharge Instructions:\nN/A\n\n【51】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The main and right hepatic arteries demonstrate patency and appropriate waveformsIMPRESSION: No portal vein thrombosis or ascites evident. Normal abdominal sonogram.\n\n【27】___ Abdominal CT scan:\nFINDINGS: The lungs are clear. Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evidentCT ABDOMEN: Evaluation of the solid viscera is limited given lack of intravenous contrast. No large lesion identified within the liver. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Patient is status post a cholecystectomy. Pancreas is normal. The spleen is enlarged. \nBilateral adrenal glands have normal limb thickness and are without convex margin to suggest mass. Bilateral kidneys are normal in size without evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureterThe stomach is unremarkable. Bowel wall thickening is noted extending from the very distal aspect of ileum and throughout the ascending colonterminating at the hepatic flexure. Minimal surrounding inflammatory changes noted. Trace fluid present within the right paracolic gutter. No diverticula identified. Incidental note of colon interposed between the liver and diaphragm, can be mistaken for a pneumoperitoneum on abdominal radiographs. There is no free air identified within the abdomenNo mesenteric, retroperitoneal, or portacaval lymphadenopathy identifiedAtherosclerotic calcifications are identified within the aorta without aneurysmal change. Ostia of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries appear patentCT PELVIS: The appendix is visualized and unremarkable. The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, uterus, and adnexa are unremarkable. No free fluid in the pelvis. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy identifiedOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evidentIMPRESSION: Bowel wall thickening and edema noted extending from the distal aspect of the ileum throughout the ascending colon. Findings are consistent with infectious colitis or inflammatory process, differential diagnosis includes ischemia. Minimal surrounding inflammatory change. No diverticula identified.\n\n【28】___ Chest x-ray:\nCardiac size is normal. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusionIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.\n\n【29】___ Abdominal KUB:\nFINDINGS: Two AP supine views of the abdomen show air mixed with stool throughout the large bowel with air and stool also seen in the rectum. There is no evidence of colonic dilation. The patient is status post cholecystectomyIMPRESSION: Stool/air mixture throughout the large bowel with no evidence of colonic dilation.\n\n【30】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old lady, with a history of past alcohol abuse and HCV cirrhosis (without complications) recently started on telapavir, ribavirin, and interferon admitted with colitis. \nHer course was complicated by pancytopenia and lower extremity edema.\n\n【31】Active issues:\n#Colitis/RLQ abdominal pain: CT scan showed inflammation of the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon c/w colitis. The patient was started on antibiotics and bowel rest with improvement in her symptoms. Stool studies were sent and were negative as was testing for CMV and HIV. The etiology of the colitis is still somewhat unclear, but is felt to most likely be infectious in etiology. She was able to tolerate a regular diet without abdominal discomfort prior to discharge. Pt was managed with oral pain medications for most of her hospitalization.\n\n【32】# Pancytopenia: \nPt was pancytopenic on admission which worsened during hospitalization. Her platelets remained stable in the ___ felt to be due to combination of portal hypertension, splenegaly,cirrhosis, and HCV. She did not have bleeding complications. Her hematocrit trended down over the admission requiring multiple transfusion of red cells. The anemia was felt likely to be related to a combination of bone marrow suppression for her HCV,cirrhosis, previous alcohol consumption, and recent initiation of interferon +/- mild degree of ribavirin mediated hemolysis. \nHer stool was guaiac'd frequently and was occasionally positive but she did not have any BRBPR. She also had a recent EGD which showed portal gastropathy but no varices. She did not have symptoms from her anemia and was discharged to f/u in ___clinic for PRBC transfusions as needed. She was also started on epogen. Lastly, she became neutropic during her admission. The Liver service felt this would be an uncommon side effect of interferon. Hematology was consulted who felt that the most likely cause of neutropenia was a combination of marrow suppression from cirrhosis, HCV, previous alcohol use and interferon. Of note, she had a BM bx for neutropenia previously which was unremarkable per report. Hematology did not feel a repeat bone marrow biopsy was indicated. However, given that the patient had colitis which did not resolve quickly and did not show recovery spontaneous recovery of her neutrophil count, the decision was made to start G-CSF therapy which led to a prompt recovery of neutrophils and improvement in abdominal symptoms. \nThe patient was not discharged on neupogen, but will follow up in ___ clinic for monitoring of her cell counts.\n\n【33】# UTI: Patient found to have a Klebsiella infection, which was pan-sensitive. This was treated with her PO ciprofloxacin.\n\n【34】# Lower extremity edema: Two days prior to discharge, the patient developed increased bilateral lower extremity edema and pain secondary to swelling. This was attributed to redistribution of IV fluids given during this admission, as well as hypoalbuminemia, relative immobility, and the patient's choice not to wear pneumoboots while in bed. BNP was not consistent with CHF. There was low suspicion for DVT. The patient's edema improved with two doses of furosemide 10 mg IV,compression stockings and leg elevation. She will follow up with her PCP for resolution and further management if necessary of her edema.\n\n【35】.\nChronic issues:\n# HCV: Documented history of this problem. Hepatology followed. \n Ribavirin and interferon were held, as they likely contributed to pancytopenia and colitis. HCV viral load was low during this admission.\n\n【36】# Impaired longterm memory and decreased concentration: Likely secondary to alcohol abuse. Normal ammonia. Patient's mental status was stable during this admission without evidence of encephalopathy.\n\n【37】# Hypertension: Patient had a history of hypertension but was not hypertensive during this admission. Her beta blocker was discontinued.\n\n【38】.\nTransitional issues:\n1.) Code: Full, confirmed with patient\n2.) Emergency contact: ___, is HCP___. Other contact is oldest daughter ___.\n3.) Discuss continuation of neupogen and epogen with patient,outpatient hepatologist and primary care physician.\n\n【39】Medications on Admission:\nMEDICATIONS (confirmed with patient): \nAtenolol 50 mg Tablet by mouth daily Rifaximin 550 mg Tablet by mouth twice a day Ribavarin 600 mg BID Interferon 180 mcg SQ injection once weekly[Patient denies taking the following medications from her most recent med rec: bupropion 200 mg PO daily, cholestyramine with uncertain dosage, fluoxetine 60 mg PO daily, lactulose 15 cc PO TID titrated to ___ stools daily, ursodoil 300 mg PO TID).\n\n【40】Medications per pharmacy:\nrifaximin 550 mg BID (filled on ___\ntrimethobenzamide 300 mg PO TID (antiemetic) (filled on ___\nbupropion SR 200 mg PO BID (filled on ___\nlactulose 15 mL TID (filled on ___\nlorazepam 1 mg PO qHS (filled on ___\nursodiol 300mg PO TID (filled on ___\nfluoxetine 20 mg three per day (filled on ___\n\n【41】Discharge Medications:\n1. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime). \n\n【42】2. trimethobenzamide 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO three times a day. \n3. bupropion HCl 200 mg Tablet Extended Release Sig: One (1)Tablet Extended Release PO twice a day. \n4. fluoxetine 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO once a day. \n\n【43】5. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO q6 hours PRN as needed for pain: Please DO NOT drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medicationDisp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n\n【44】Discharge Disposition:\nHome\n\n【45】Discharge Diagnosis:\nPrimary diagnosis:\nColitis.\n\n【46】Secondary diagnoses:\nPancytopenia\n\n【47】Discharge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherentLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactiveActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n【48】Discharge Instructions:\nDear Ms. ___, \n\n【49】 You were admitted with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and were found to have evidence of \"colitis,\" or inflammation of the large intestine on imaging of your abdomen. You initially improved with resting your bowels, intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. We gradually transitioned you back to a regular diet, which you tolerated without any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain at the time fo discharge.\n\n【50】Additionally, while you were here, we found that your cell counts, including your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, were very low. This was most likely from suppression of the bone marrow that produces these cells.

No mass lesion identified. IMPRESSION: Unremarkable MRI of the internal auditory canals. \n\n【27】Brief Hospital Course:\nOur patient was admitted with recurrent episodes of dizziness and imbalance. She notably had a mild left hemiparesis which were the symptoms of her old stroke (no available imaging or history of investigation; limited per the patient). This prompted admission for evaluation for ischemic stroke initially. \nFortunately, her CT angiogram and MRI Head did not reveal any thrombosis, vascular anomalies, or infarction. She does notably have a small right thalamo-capsular GRE signal which likely represents a small microhemorrhage from her distant stroke,perhaps from a small cavernoma. Her clinical examination revealed a rightwards corrective saccade on lateral head impulse testing, a negative ___ test, normal orthostatic vital signs, and fatiguable rightwards torsional nystagmus (with a minimal horizontal vector) looking to the right (none at rest). \nShe did have a mild left hemiparesis thought to be attributable to her old stroke. Her case was discussed with Drs. ______ who recommended an MRI internal auditory canal and lumbar puncture, respectively. The patient underwent the MRI IAC which was normal; she declined the lumbar puncture. Her clinical symptoms continued to improve, though with a waxing-waning course. On the last day, she had no evidence of nystagmus and was stable walking with a walker (which was ___recommendation).

You also have some weakness on the left side of your body. Your dizziness is resulting from a peripheral (outside the brain) problem with your vestibular(inner ear) system. It is most likely caused by a virus causing an infection in the inner ear, also known as a vestibular neuritis. You have had two MRIs which did not show any signs of a new stroke, meningitis, inner ear problem, or any other structural problem. Your left sided weakness is most likely related to your old stroke symptoms returning in the setting of an acute illness. A reexpression of symptoms from an old stroke can occur in this setting. We discussed your case with our Chairman and senior neurologists who provided input and suggestions.\n\n【35】\n\n【36】Please follow up with your primary care provider and Dr. \n___ (Neurology) as below.\n\n【37】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Additionally,several pulmonary subpleural nodular opacities have developed in the interval most consistent with pulmonary and/or pleural metastases ranging in size from a few millimeter up to 6.4 mm with bilateral pulmonary nodules (for example,images 11, 14, 16, 22, 24, 26, 27, 36 and 37). The soft tissue nodules involving the pericardiophrenic region have increased consistent with increasing pericardiophrenic metastatic lymph nodes. For example, a left pericardiophrenic lymph node now measures 14 mm as opposed to 7.6 mm and a right pericardiophrenic lymph node now measures 13 mm as opposed to \n6.4 mm. Mediastinal lymph nodes have also increased in size compared to prior exam consistent with progressive metastatic adenopathy. For example, a right paratracheal lymph node now measures 13.7 mm as opposed to 7.4 mm. There is also retrosternal soft tissue which is more pronounced compared to prior exam which could represent additional nodal disease or extension from osseous disease. The regional skeletal structures are diffusely sclerotic consistent with diffuse osseous metastases. There is a pacemaker. There is cardiomegaly. \n\n【20】ABDOMEN: There is moderate ascites. The hepatic attenuation is diffusely abnormal and heterogeneous with numerous hepatic metastases which appear more confluent compared to prior exam. \nIn the interval, omental infiltration has developed and there are several omental implants consistent with metastatic disease. \nThe spleen is not enlarged. The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is symmetric renal enhancement with renal cysts. The gallbladder is grossly unremarkable. Right iliac adenopathy has increased compared to prior exam. \n\n【21】PELVIS: The urinary bladder is suboptimally distended. There are postoperative changes with surgical clips. There is ascites. \nOmental implants are noted andperitoneal implants are noted. The regional skeletal structures are diffusely sclerotic consistent with diffuse osseous metastases. Right iliopsoas bursal fluid is again noted. \n\n【22】IMPRESSION: Progressive metastatic disease with increasing hepatic metastases and increasing nodal disease with interval development of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions as well as interval development of omental and peritoneal metastases as well as lung and/or pleural metastases. \n\n【23】INPATIENT IMAGING:\n\n【24】ABDOMINAL U/S ___:\nThe liver has multiple echogenic masses scattered throughout both lobes, consistent with metastatic disease. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct is normal measuring 2 mm. The gallbladder is not visualized,question prior cholecystectomy. The main portal vein has normal hepatopetal flow. The spleen is normal measuring \n11.7 cm. There is a small amount of ascites. \n\n【25】IMPRESSION: \n1. Multiple liver masses, consistent with metastatic disease. \n2. Patent main portal vein. \n3. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites. \n\n【26】CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___:\nThere is an extra-axial dense mass, apparently dural-based,along the inner table of the right middle and anterior cranial fossae. \nThe lesion measures 2.7 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension (2:12, \n2:15). This was either not present, or too small to be detected,on the prior CT, indicating rapid growth in the interval. The adjacent calvarium demonstrates no evidence of bone destruction,and this does not appear to have arisen from the bone. There is dramatic sclerosis of the calvarium indicating diffuse osseous metastatic disease. Although this lesion may represent a meningioma, the rapid growth in a patient with metastatic prostate carcinoma raises the concern of an unusual dural based metastasis. \n\n【27】There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or shift of the normally midline structures.

In addition, there is subcutaneous air. Enlarged cardiac silhouette likely reflects portable technique. There are multifocal areas of atelectasis, most pronounced in the right lung. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax\n\n【15】CXR ___: Comparison to ___. Status post removal of the right chest tube. A mild to moderate right basal pneumothorax persists. No evidence of tension. Slightly increasing basal and right upper lobe postoperative parenchymal opacities. Mild increase in severity of a retrocardiac atelectasis.\n\n【16】CXR ___:\nIn comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. \nBilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. In the appropriate clinical setting, would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits without definite vascular congestion. The subcutaneous gas along the right chest wall has essentially cleared. No definite right apical pneumothorax is seen, though this area is somewhat obscured by the head of the patient.\n\n【17】___ bronchoscopy:\nPROCEDURE FINDINGS: Oropharyngeal exam with mildly edematous vocal cords with adherent thick white secretions that were suctioned. Airway inspection to the segmental bronchi notable for narrowed left main bronchus with no endobronchial lesions,patent right side to the segmental bronchi. No mesh or sutures visualized in the trachea. The airways were diffusely edematous and friable throughout with thin white secretions that were suctioned. \n\n【18】CXR ___: Small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right are probably unchanged. There is persistent postoperative parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Left lower lobe opacity is could be atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. \nThere is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. No other interval change from prior study.\n\n【19】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ female with history of severe TBM who was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on ___ after undergoing scheduled right thoracotomy with tracheobronchoplasty. The patient tolerated the procedure well and it was uncomplicated (please see Operative Report for further detail). Post-operatively, the patient was monitored in the ICU per pathway. She had an epidural placed pre-operatively that provided inadequate relief and was replaced on POD1 with much improved pain control. She initially became hypotensive after the replacement of the epidural and required intermittent low-doses of phenylephrine while she remained on the epidural.By POD2, she was able to wean off pressors and remained hemodynamically stable. \nHowever, she initially had difficulty clearing her secretions secondary to severe pain and required face mask oxygenation and non-invasive bipap. Her respiratory status gradually improved with aggressive pulmonary toilet and she was weaned to nasal cannula by POD4. She remained ronchorous on exam with a worsening right lower lobe collapse on CXR so she underwent bronchoscopy with interventional pulmonology on POD4 with suctioning of secretions. This improved her respiratory status and right lower lobe collapse, which then remained stable for the remainder of her hospital course. Sputum cultures were sent from the bronchoscopy and grew out only respiratory commensal flora. \nHer course was additionally complicated by a single episode of atrial fibrillation with rvr on POD2. Given her allergies to both beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, she was started on an amiodarone drip and converted to normal sinus rhythm the following day. Her amiodarone was weaned to oral and then discontinued prior to discharge. She remained in NSR for the remainder of her hospital course. \nIn terms of diet, on POD2, she was started on a clear diet which she tolerated without issue. She was advanced to a regular diet on POD4 without issue. \nHer epidural was removed on POD5 and her pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. Her foley was removed on POD5 and she voided without difficulty. \nShe initially had a leukocytosis post-operatively that improved but then worsened again starting on POD6 (WBC 10->15->16). She was afebrile and overall looked well but a urinalysis was sent that was positive for a UTI. She was started on bactrim and her WBC decreased to 13 the following dayShe was discharged home with ___ services on POD8 to folllow up in clinic in two weeks with repeat CXR. \n\n【20】Medications on Admission:\nVit D, Colace, gaviscon before meals \n\n【21】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Thrombosis is noted of the celiac axis, proximal common hepatic artery as well as the majority of the splenic artery (in parts partially occlusive, in other parts occlusive) with resultant splenic infarction. There is approximately 75% infarction of the splenic parenchyma. The splenic vein is thrombosed. No perisplenic hematoma. Please note that the etiology of this arterial thrombosis is not clear. A hypercoagulable state could possibly explain this (with history of PEs). Note is made of marked narrowing of the celiac axis as it passes under the arcuate ligament which may have been worsened post spine surgery and this could be an alternative explanation for celiac axis thrombosis.\n2.

She was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe and was started on a heparin drip. She then became hypotensive with a down trending hematocrit. She was transfused with PRBCs. On___ she developed lower abdominal pain and underwent CTAP that showed possible intrasplenic hemorrhage. On ___ the patient was transferred to ___ for further care. She underwent bilateral lower extremity ultrasound that showed no DVT. Second opinion CT scan showed a splenic thrombosis of the celiac axis,proximal common hepatic artery as well as the majority of the splenic artery and not hematoma. Patient was made NPO and had a PICC line placed to start TPN, which was discontinued once she tolerated a regular diet. While on the floor, she had an episode of asymptomatic hypotension with SBPs in the ___ which improved with IVF. \n\n【19】Neurosurgery was consulted given recent spine surgery and the patient was cleared for a heparin drip if needed with goal PTT no greater than 80 and no bolus. Heparin drip was started and titrated to goal. Vascular medicine was consulted and recommended continuing heparin drip, transition to warfarin if no surgical intervention, TTE with bubble test to rule out PFO/paradoxical emboli, and B2-glycoprotein to complete work up for APLS. Vascular surgery was also consulted and recommended ASA/atorvastatin and CTA to evaluate for mesenteric ischema. TTE revealed no evidence of PFO. Repeat CTA was done on ___ and___ that showed no evidence of mesenteric ischemia. Her coagulation workup revealed low antithrombin with other lab workup pending at time of discharge.

Leftward axis. Non-specific intraventricular conduction abnormality. Suspect left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared To the previous tracing of ___ ventricular premature complexes are new, atrial premature complexes are no longer present. Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are now present. \nIMAGING:\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: 1.No evidence of mesenteric ischemia. No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic process to explain patient's elevated lactate. 2. Extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 3. Small hiatal hernia. 4. \nTiny focus of air within the bladder, which should be correlated with history of instrumentation.\n\n【16】AP and lateral views of the chest: are compared to previous exam \n\n【17】from ___. As on prior, there are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen throughout. There is, however, no confluent consolidation or large effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Findings again compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema or consolidation.\n\n【18】CT-HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Examination is somewhat limited for small hemorrhage due to the presence of preexisting intravenous contrast; however, there is no finding to suspect acute hemorrhage, edema, recent infarction or mass. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is consistent with age-related global atrophy. Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likely reflects sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Focal hypodensity in the right basal ganglia is consistent with prior lacune, unchanged. No concerning osseous lesion is seen. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are grossly clear. The right frontal sinus is not pneumatized. There are calcifications of the carotid siphons. IMPRESSION: The presence of preexisting intravenous contrast somewhat limits evaluation for small hemorrhage;however, no finding to suggest acute intracranial process is seen.\n\n【19】CTA CHEST: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.\n\n【20】INTERVAL:___ 07:28PM BLOOD Lactate-6.3___ 09:53PM BLOOD Lactate-2.9___ 08:25AM BLOOD Lactate-3.2*.\n\n【21】DISCHARGE:___ 11:24AM BLOOD Lactate-3.0___ 07:40AM BLOOD WBC-4.1 RBC-3.79* Hgb-8.9* Hct-29.3*MCV-77* MCH-23.4* MCHC-30.3* RDW-25.9* Plt ___\n___ 07:40AM BLOOD ___ PTT-43.2* ___\n___ 07:40AM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-7 Creat-0.7 Na-138 K-3.2* Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-13\n___ 07:40AM BLOOD ALT-14 AST-17 LD(LDH)-192 AlkPhos-96 TotBili-0.4\n___ 07:40AM BLOOD Albumin-3.7 Calcium-7.9* Phos-2.4*Mg-1.5*\n\n【22】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is an ___ year old woman with a PMHx of chronic left sided pain and weakness, myofacial pain syndrome, and mild dementia who presents with worsening of her chronic head, neck,chest, and abdominal pains.\n\n【23】ACUTE ISSUES:\n# Acute on Chronic pain: Upon clarification of the HPI, the patient's son brought her in for her chronic pains because in the past, she often complained about them more than usual when she had urinary tract infections. Given her recent admission for UTI, as well as her PCP extending the time course of antibiotic treatment last week, the son and patient were concerned of a re-flare of her UTI or other infection. They came in to make sure she did not have a UTI. She was treated acetaminophen (1g tid dosing), and reported great relief of her pain.\n\n【24】# Elevated lactate - The patient presented with an elevated lactate of 6.3. She has had elevations in the past between \n1.3-4. She was worked up extensively for causes of this, with a differential that included hypoperfusion (no evidence of such,but possible given her use of diuretics), bowel ischemia (not evident on CT of abdomen and pelvis), cirrhosis/liver failure(AST slightly elevated, normal ALT, lactate trending down, so less likely), seizures (no witnessed seizures). Her urinalysis and chest x-ray and CTA did not have evidence of infection, and her head pain did not fit the clinical picture of intracranial infections. Blood cultures were pending at time of discharge,but no growth to date. On receiving IV fluids, the lactate improved markedly to 3.0 by time of discharge, and the patient's physical complaints had largely resolved, so the etiology of the elevated lactate was never confirmed. \n\n【25】# Hyponatremia - The patient presented with a sodium of 130 that was initially thought to be related to her use of diuretics and volume depletion. She was given normal saline IV fluids and her sodium responded appropriately. She was stable by time of discharge. \n\n【26】# Supratherapeutic INR - The patient's INR was 4.5 on admission and 3.6 on discharge. She and her Healthcare proxy son were instructed to hold her dose day of discharge and to follow up with the HCA anticoagulation the next day for further instructions and dosing. The clinic nurses were also emailed to ensure follow up with the patient.\n\n【27】# Hypokalemia - Possibly secondary to diuretic use, but etiology not deteremined. The patient's low potassium on admission responded appropriately to repletion. She received additional repletion on day of discharge.\n\n【28】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n# Chronic diastolic heart failure - The patient's furosemide was held initially due to concern of hypoperfusion with elevated lactate, but was restarted on day of discharge. The patient remained stable during her stay.\n\n【29】# Hypertension: The patient was stable on her home lisinopril. \n\n【30】# History of venous thromboembolic disease on warfarin: The patient's warfarin was held for supratherapeutic INR (as above). \n She remained clinically stable with a negative CTA and no signs of blood clots during her stay. \n\n【31】# Chronic Anemia: The patient's Hct remained stable during this admission.\n\n【32】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n1) The patient should call/follow up with the ___clinic to manage her warfarin.\n\n【33】Medications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete. \nInformation was obtained from Family/CaregiverwebOMR.\n1.

Thus it seems her dyspnea on exertion is much less likely caused by epicardial coronary disease, though cannot rule out small vessel ischemia. \nHer atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk profile includes a reasonable lipid profile HDL 62, LDL 81, HbA1c 5.4 despite being overweight, and she does not smoke. She was initiated on aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg daily for possible small vessel ischemia. She was also sent home with lifting precautions for her right arm due to right radial access used during angiography.\n\n【25】# Subscapular shoulder pain: Patient with 6 months of subscapular pain. Initially there was concern that this might have been anginal, however it was not associated with activity and dyspnea, only with carrying heavy bags/using the shoulder. \nShe also noted that belching and passing gas improved her symptoms, suggesting possible component of diaphragmatic irritation due to gas, which can result in referred pain to the scapula. For this she was given simethicone. The pain also improved somewhat with lidocaine patches and acetaminophen. She would would likely benefit from outpatient physical therapy.\n\n【26】CHRONIC ISSUES\n# BMI>40: Patient reports already initiating some dietary changes at home, seemed knowledgeable and highly motivated.

Some relief with lying on his right side; real relief last ___ when he passed a few pellets followed by a rush of non-bloody watery diarrhea. Abdominal discomfort worsens with meals; reports recent poor PO intake due to mild nausea (without vomiting) and poor appetite. Occasionally has difficulty with hard BMs and constipation, which he can usually self-medication with milk-of-magnesia and prune juice. However, he was hesitant to take these this week because his abd discomfort was worse than usual. At this time he denies fever/chills, nausea/vomiting,hematochezia, and melena. Some urinary frequency and baseline urinary urgency/incontinence is unchanged.

Labs notable for BS 500, Na 125, K 5.5, CO3 21,lipase 101, lactate 2.1, and INR 3.6. Chemistry panel including BS all improved significantly w/1L NS. Vascular surgery saw him because of concern for abdominal angina/mesenteric ischemia. On their exam he had no abdominal pain; they reviewed a CTA abdomen which showed stenotic but patent mesenteric vessels and felt constipation was the best explanation for his symptoms. After 1 dose maalox and 1 dose donnatal he tolerated lunch in the ED. \nAdmitted for ongoing hyperglycemia and possible demand mesenteric ischemia (due to lactate and stenotic mesenteric vessels on CTA.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Old left rib fractures are seen in the area of metallic fragments. Numerous radiopaque structures again project over the thorax, bilaterally, stable,question shrapnel. There is no evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\n\n【25】___ CTA ABD/PELVIS FINDINGS LOWER CHEST:\nThe imaged lung bases feature minimal basilar atelectasis, but are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion. There is focal thinning of the myocardium at the cardiac apex with a calcification, suggestive of old infarction (4B:205). There are coronary arterial atherosclerotic calcifications present. There is no pericardial effusion. There is minimal dilation of the right atriumABDOMEN:\nThe liver enhances normally and contains no concerning focal lesions. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The inferior vena cava,portal vein, splenic vein, superior and inferior mesenteric veins are patentThere is subtle stranding of fat surrounding the pancreatic head. The body and tail appear normal. There is no fluid collection. Borderline 1 cm peripancreatic lymph node it seen (4:239). There is a 1.7 x 1.3 cm left adrenal nodule (2:23). This mass is of fat density on non-contrast imagesand homogeneous in appearance, consistent with benign adrenal adenoma. The right adrenal gland appears normal. There is a wedge-shaped hypodensity within the spleen in the delayed phase, which may indicate an area of prior infarction. The kidneys enhance normally and excrete contrast symmetricallyThere is a 2.3 x 2.0 cm simple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidneyAnother, 1.2 x 0.9 cm simple cyst is found in the lower pole of the right kidney. A subcentimeter hypodensity in the mid pole of the left kidney is too small to characterize by CT, however, also has the appearance of a simple cyst. Cortical thinning seen at the posterior aspect of the right kidney, likely scarringThere is no intraperitoneal free air or fluid. The intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear normal, without dilation, wall thickening, or abnormal enhancement. The abdominal aorta features extensive atherosclerotic calcification, which extend into many of the main branches. There is no aneurysmal dilation or dissection. \nThere is focal narrowing of the celiac trunk due to atherosclerotic disease (4B:246). There is mild stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery caused by non-calcified plaque (4B:251). Similarly, there is mild stenosis of the proximal superior mesenteric artery (4B:260). The inferior mesenteric artery contains extensive calcifications, but appears to be patent. There is no mesenteric arterial occlusion seenPELVIS:\nThe pelvic loops of small and large bowel, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. The appendix is not seen. The bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles appear normal. There is no pelvic free fluid. There is no intraperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathyOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no destructive lesions or acute fractures. Old left ___ and 10th rib fractures seen. Chronic appearing deformity of the right superior pubic ramus is also seen, may be sequela of prior traumaIMPRESSION:\n1. Extensive peripheral vascular disease without evidence of mesenteric arterial occlusion. There is no evidence of ischemic enteritis or colitis.\n2. Focal fat stranding around the pancreatic head, in the setting of elevated serum lipase, is consistent with mild acute pancreatitis.\n3. Incidental findings as described above.\n\n【26】Brief Hospital Course:___ M w/hx CAD/PVD/DM2 p/w 2 weeks abdominal pain, constipation and hyperglycemia, all of which resolved by the following morning with a laxative-induced bowel movement and his home insulin regimen.\n\n【27】# CONSTIPATION Admitted via PCP's office for abdominal pain and concern for demand mesenteric ischemia despite lack of mesenteric vascular occlusion on CTA abd/pelvis and vascular surgery consult in the ED. On the floor, constipation (given excellent story for this)and/or mild pancreatitis (given mildly elevated lipase and mild___ fat stranding seen on CT. There was no evidence of SBO on CT, so he was given an agressive bowel regimen(colace, senna, miralax, lactulose and glycerin suppositories)and had three large bowel movements overnight. Felt better in the morning. Discharged with prescriptions for colace and senna;may also need miralax and/or lactulose if constipation recurs.\n\n【28】# HYPERGLYCEMIA Longstanding type II diabetes. Takes insulin 27U qbreakfast and dinner. Today he had a ___ 475 in PCP's office, then 500 in ED on arrival. Asymptomatic. Review of atrius records show that he called in 6 days ago w/report of running out of glucometer test strips but \"was eating the right things\" so we suspect he was taking insufficient insulin in the interim. Intial electrolyte derangements resolved w/IVF, so unlikely to be ___hyperglycemia. Received his usual of 27U 70/30 insulin on the evening of admission; ___ was 147 the following morning.\n\n【29】#Hiccups Going on for 2 weeks, contemporaneous with abdominal pain/distension. Likely due to diaphragmatic irritation. Managed with reglan overnight. Resolved by morning, after constipation resolved.\n\n【30】# CKD Creatinine within baseline of 1.2-1.4. Continued lisinopril.\n\n【31】# Hx PVD Pt has suffered AKA previously for an infected diabetic ulcer;Atrius notes show that he has a blister on his L heel now which___ podiatry is following. The ulcer was a dry 0.5 cm eschar,not infected appearing. Vascular surgery agreed that it looked well and not in need of any special wound care at this time.\n\n【32】# Hx CAD No chest pain or SOB. TRoponins checked in the ED were negative. \nNot repeated on the floor because his history of 2 weeks abdominal pain without diaphoresis, SOB or elevated trop in ED was not concerning for an anginal equivalent. Continued home meds: Isosorbide Mononitrate 60 mg ER QD, Furosemide 40 mg Oral Tablet take 1 tablet QD, Lisinopril 5 mg Oral Tablet take 2 tablet QD, ASPIRIN 81 MG TAB QD, Metoprolol ER 200 QD.\n\n【33】# Hx Atrial fibrillation On long-term anticoagulation with coumadin. Per ___ records,his most recent coumadin dosing (adjusted ___ is Warfarin \n7.5mg x FRI/TUES; 6.25 mg x5d. Supratherapeutic in the ED w/INR \n3.6. Coumadin was held during this admission because he was supratherapeutic, likely ___ poor PO intake recently. Restarted at discharge at unchanged doses. Patient instructed to follow-up with ___ clinic in ___ days.\n\n【34】# Hyponatremia125 on admission corrects to 135 in setting of hyperglycemia. Na improved to 130 with 1L NS in the ED.\n\n【35】# Hypertension BP wnl in the ED today. Atrius records show baseline 130s with one isolated reading of 180 ~2 weeks ago at his PCP's office. \nContinued lisinopril 5 QD, metoprolol.\n\n【36】# Hx Anemia Last Hct in PCP's office was 41.9. Higher here.\n\n【37】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Needs close ___ clinic follow-up given supratherapeutic INR here\n2. Follow-up and trend blood sugars, adjust insulin scale PRN\n3.

We think you are having trouble breathing due to both lung disease and heart disease. Your underlying lung disease (COPD and squamous cell lung cancer) make your breathing difficult at baseline, and your congestive heart failure causes fluid to build up in your lungs,making your breathing even more difficult than baseline. You were tested for lower extremity blood clots by ultrasound and found not to have any clots. You were tested for blood clots in your lungs by CTA and found not to have any lung blood clots either. You were given an echocardiogram to look at your heart by ultrasound, which found that your heart pumps out a low volume of blood. The CT of your lungs show that your lung cancer has grown since the previous scan. You were seen by an oncologist who advised you receive follow-up as an outpatient for these conditions.\n\n【36】Please note the following changes to your medications:\n- Please STOP taking Losartan and Lisinopril, as your blood pressure has been fine without these two drugs, and they are bad for your kidney function- Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.\n\n【37】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She increased her nasal cannula, and then ultimately called EMS. EMS increased her nasal cannula to 6 L which brought her saturations up to around 90. They gave her 1 dose of albuterol with some relief in the ambulance. In the emergency department on initial evaluation she was complaining of severe shortness of breath. \nShe has noticed recent increased swelling in her bilateral ankles and feet. She has a consistent unchanged cough,nonproductive. Denies fevers, abdominal pain, headache. Patient not on anticoagulation.\n\n【10】She had a recent admission for hypoxia (___): radiation related changes, mucous plugging, with no culture growth on that admission. \n\n【11】Per her recent outpatient hematology/oncology notes she was being treated for a persistent cough with steroids 35mg daily and her pazopanib was held at her recent appointment on ___. \nHer oncologist at that appointment did not feel that pazopanib was the underlying etiology for her cough alone and felt that ongoing inflammation from her underlying lung inflammation. \n\n【12】Exam: CTAB, no wheezing, rhonchi; 1+ pitting edema bilateral feet and ankles; tachycardia, normal peripheral perfusion\n\n【13】In the ED she triggered for hypoxia and was transferred to the acute treatment area. She was subsequently intubated with 80 etomidate, 15 succ, 7.0tube and received midaz and fentanyl. Her CTA read showed a massive saddle embolus and she was given a dose of TPA. In the setting of intubation she became hypotensive and required pressors with norepi and additionally vasopressin. \n\n【14】In ED initial VS: \nTemp 98.5 HR 122 BP 125/62 RR 24 02 93% NC \n\n【15】Labs significant for:\n\n【16】WBC: 15.4 hgb: 11.7 plt: 170BMP: 142 K 4.1 CL: 102 HC03 23 BUN 20 cr. 0.8\nTrop 0.2 VBG pH 7.29/___--> 7.31/45/44INR 1.1--> 1.5 post TPA \n\n【17】Patient was given: Fentanyl, etomidate, succinylcholine and midazolam for intubation.

Emphysema with right upper lobe fibrosis with resultant architectural distortion appear similar to prior. \n4. Thin-walled cavity in the left posterior midlung containing a fluid level, potentially concerning for an abscess. Consider drainage. \n5. Thickened esophagus, correlate for esophagitis. \n\n【30】LENIs Bilat (___)\n1. Left occlusive deep vein thrombosis extending from the mid femoral vein through the popliteal vein, with occlusive thrombus also in the peroneal veins. \n2. Right occlusive deep vein thrombosis extending from the mid femoral vein through the popliteal vein, with occlusive thrombus in 1 of the peroneal veins. \n\n【31】CXR (___)\nInterval slight increase in hazy opacities at the left hemithorax, again possibly representing asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection. \n\n【32】CXR (___)\nCompared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___through ___. \n\n【33】Right upper lobe is now completely collapsed. Heterogeneous opacification in the lungs has gotten progressively worse since___. Some of this could be pneumonia,, for example lateral to the upper pole the left hilus, but the bulk is due to pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions have increased. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. \n\n【34】ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placement. Right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends in the right atrium as before. \n\n【35】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ y/o F hx of metastatic sarcoma with lung metastases s/p multiple prior treatments including surgery, RF ablations, cyberknife, chemotherapy now off pazopanib (___) who presented to the ED with acute onset dyspnea found to have large saddle embolus requiring TPA with subsequent intubation and hypotension now on pressors and heparin gtt most consistent with obstructive shock. \n\n【36】#Hypotension: #Difficulty weaning off vent\n#Obstructive Shock #Saddle PE #Pulm HTN Patient with worsening dyspnea and 02 requirement at home iso ongoing malignancy. Found to have large saddle embolus in ED on CTA, which was most likely cause of dyspnea and cardiovascular collapse. Received TPA in the ED with MASCOT who assessed and recommended heparin gtt and close h/h and fibrinogen monitoring post TPA. Report of beside TTE in the ED showed mild RV dysfunction with a troponin leak of .02. In the ICU she continued to have blood pressure instability with difficulty weaning off pressors (levophed, vasopressin). NICOM not responsive. ___ LENIs showed bilateral occlusive DVTs from mid femoral vein through popliteal vein, also in peroneal veins. \n___ TTE showed normal right ventricular cavity size with low normal free wall motion, but severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP 85), basically did not show RV failure that could explain hypotension s/p PE. She received IV heparin gtt. Had difficulty weaning off vent. Given mildly increased pulm edema on CXR(difficult to interpret given underlying burden of lung disease), was diuresed with 40 IV Lasix once. On ___, saw ST elevation on tele, got EKG with wandering baseline sent trops were negative. In the AM of ___, was given propofol, Ativan for agitation, found to have mucus plug in filter. On the morning of___, patient was requiring additional ventilation support and was started on standing nebulizer treatments. At this time, the HCP was contacted and informed of the patient's current status. \nShe stated that she felt the patient would not want to live with a low chance of functional recovery. On ___, after speaking with HCP, patient was transitioned to CMO. In the AM of ___, the MICU nurse noted that the patient was no longer breathing. MICU physician was called to bedside and patient was pronounced at 12:10.\n\n【37】# Leukocytosis # Cough # Lower Lobe opacity Patient with prior cough though to be post radiation fibrosis with inflammatory changes per outpatient hematology/oncology. \nShe was treated with steroids and taken off her pazopanib although less likely for this to be the primary cause for her SOB and respiratory failure. She has had a new leukocytosis but given the acute inflammatory nature of her large PE and underlying malignancy these are both possible etiologies. She also had a thin-walled cavity in the left posterior midlung containing a fluid level, similar in size to prior. This is concerning for possible abscess but given her metastatic known sarcoma to her lung and prior seen findings active abscess or infection is less likely. We will perform work up for pulm infection but hold off on antibiotic coverage since she has been afebrile and has another direct cause for her shock as detailed above. \n\n【38】#Hyperactive delirium Patient has been agitated, reportedly pulling out IVs even when on prop. On night of ___ patient agitated again. Given prop lowers her BP and precedex causes bradycardia, tried Seroquel 50mg TID. Continued agitation, gave Ativan .5mg IV x1 as patient is on home Ativan.

Findings concerning for acute intramural hematoma at the level of the mid descending arch. Nearby left mainstem bronchus appears thickened. The possibility of unusual pattern of recent bleeding from the aortic hematoma into the wall of the left mainstem bronchus may be considered. To evaluate further,non-contrast CT of the chest is suggested on an urgent base to reassess in addition to vascular surgery consultation. This is to confirm and characterize further. \n2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. \n3. Findings consistent with extensive airway inflammatory disease including bronchiectasis and mucus plugging, most extensive in basilar lower lobes. \n4. 9 mm subpleural nodule in the left lower lobe may represent focal atelectasis and has demonstrated five-month stability. A followup CT in ___ months is recommended to ensure ongoing stability. \n5. Similar upper thoracic compression fractures. \n6. Moderate lower thoracic degenerative changes with some increase in sclerosis and Schmorl's nodes, although likely degenerative. \n\n【22】___ CT chest w/o contrast:\n1. New intramural hematoma involving the ascending through mid descending aorta. The proximal part is suspected to be acute to subacute but very thin and probably not extending entirely to the aorta root. The site of most intramural hemorrhage is along the mid descending aorta (55___ units) measuring 11 mm in width, acute to subacute. \nA separate focus of probably recent intramural hemorrhage appears separate along the more distal descending aorta,apparently present before, suggesting an unusual multifocal process of mural hemorrhage that may relate to underlying aortic disease or coagulopathy. \n2. Moderate wall thickening and narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus and mild to moderate mid to lower tracheal thickening. \nAttenuation is difficult to judge, but intramural hemorrhage should be considered based on coagulopathy; the possibility of the aortic hemorrhage as an unusual source for this should also be considered. \n3. Small right adrenal nodule, indeterminant, although these are commonly due to benign adenomas. This can be reassessed when CT is pursued to follow-up a left lower lobe nodule of 9 mm in ___months. \n4. New slight soft tissue thickening along the anterior margin of the mid thoracic spine which may relate to known interval injury - which had known involvement of T1 and T3 vertebral bodies. Increase in degenerative changes is relatively rapid but may relate to shifting stresses associated with interval injury. Indolent infectious process seems less likely but hard to entirely exclude, however. \n\n【23】___ RUS US:\n1. Cholelithiasis without specific evidence for acute cholecystitis. \n2. Gallbladder adenomyomatosis. \n3. Small amount of nonspecific pericholecystic fluid. \n\n【24】___ CXR:\nCardiomegaly is unchanged as well as dilated mediastinum. \nVascular upper zone re- distribution is noted, minimally different from the previous study. Bronchiectasis are bilateral in the lower lobes, unchanged. Overall no substantial change since previous examination demonstrated and no interval development of pulmonary edema seen. \n\n【25】___ Echo:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. \nTrace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___. \nImages are suboptimal on the current study. The right ventricle is probably mildly dilated and hypokinetic. Trace aortic regurgitation.\n\n【26】___ CXR:\nIf edema was present previously it has improved. There is still substantial heterogeneous consolidation in the left lung and perhaps some of the right base due to either the asymmetric residual of edema or multi focal pneumonia. The heart is normal size. Pleural effusion is small on the right if any. No pneumothorax. \n\n【27】___ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:\n-No imaging evidence of pancreatitis. \n-Cholelithiasis. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid is again demonstrated as on prior ultrasound, nonspecific finding. \n-Mild possible urothelial thickening and adjacent stranding of bilateral renal pelvis/ proximal ureters, for which correlation with urinalysis suggested. \n-Left femoral hernia containing a short loop of nonobstructed small bowel. \n-Other findings as detailed above. \nNo appreciable interval change since ___ in the appearance of the non-acute intramural hematoma, descending thoracic aorta. No mediastinal hematoma or other signs of progression or rupture.\n\n【28】No appreciable interval change in extensive right middle and lower lobe bronchial inflammation or infection with extensive mucoid impaction, which is likely due to chronic aspiration. Associated right lower lobe cystic and cylindrical bronchiectasis is also unchanged. \n\n【29】9 mm left lower lobe nodule is stable since ___. New 8 mm right lower lobe nodule may be part of the inflammatory process or due to atelectasis. A three-month followup chest CT is advised following appropriate treatment. \n\n【30】Stable bilateral hilar and paraaortic lymphadenopathy is likely reactive. \nNew small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion. \n\n【31】Stable dilatation of the main pulmonary artery suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n\n【32】Brief Hospital Course:___ year old female with PMHx notable for HIV, hyperthyroidism,stroke on coumadin, CHF, and polymyositis who presented with chest pain and abdominal pain.\n\n【33】ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES: \n# Aortic intramural hematoma: On arrival to the floor, pt c/o back pain radiating to chest. Received call from radiology of concerning finding on CTA and recommended stat CT non con. CT non-con showed intramural aortic hematoma in ascending and descending aorta. Vascular surgery and cardiac surgery were notified and reviewed imaging. Given that hematoma was also present on imaging from CTA on ___, vascular surgery attending felt that current CT finding was unlikely to represent a new hematoma and urgent surgical or medical intervention was not warrented. She does have a significant cardiac history, but she was ruled out for ACS with three sets of troponin stable at \n0.02. On ___ she had a repeat chest CT which showed stable hematoma. We attempted to keep systolic BP < 120 although her blood pressure was difficult to control. Lisinopril had to be held after she developed ___. Hydralazine was increased from 25mg TID to 50mg QID. Diltiazem was increased from 120mg to 240mg daily. Warfarin was held given hematoma, but subsequently restarted after consultation with Cardiac Surgery. \n\n【34】#Epiagastric pain: had tenderness to palpation in the RUQ/LUG/epigastrium. She had elevated LFTs at presentation,which had been attributed to starting methimazole. Methimazole was stopped on ___ prior to admission after LFTs continued to rise. RUQ US showed cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis, and she had normal Tbili so cholangitis was also thought to be unlikely. \nLipase of 61 and 62 ruled out acute pancreatitis. She had a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which did not reveal the cause of her pain. \nShe was seen by GI, who recommended increasing her omeprazole from 20mg daily to 40mg BID, which did not help with pain, so on discharge, placed back on home dose, given that over the course an alternative diagnosis arose: MSK pain/pluritis from chronic cough from bronchitis/asthma exacerbation. \n\n【35】# ___: had increase in creatinine following CT chest/abdomen/pelvis. This was felt to be contrast induced given creatinine started to rise ___ hours post contrast. Creatinine peaked at 2.3 before trending down. Received extra dose of Torsemide which caused bump from 1.5 to 1.6. Torsemide ___ dose held and Cr was 1.7 on discharge. She was discharged on her home dose of torsemide.\n\n【36】# Dyspnea/tachypnea: Patient continued to have persistent tachypnea in the ___ but denied any dyspnea. During episodes of acute tachypnea she was noted to wheeze but was not hypoxic. \n___ CTA was reassuring against PE. She had no evidence of acute pneumonia; however, CT shows chronic focal consolidation in right lower lobe. She had recently received a 5 day course of azithromycin for bronchitis diagnosed 1 week prior to admission. \nShe denied any fevers concerning for infectious etiology. She received 1L NS in ED and her home diuretics were initially held. \nShe was restarted on home torsemide and also received several doses of furosemide prn. CXRs did not show any significant pulmonary edema. She was continued on standing albuterol-ipratropium and albuterol prn. Blood gases revealed metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis. \nUltimately, respiaratory status improved with diuresis and inhaled GC for asthma exacerbation. \n\n【37】# Anemia: H/H was stable at around ___ but was below her baseline of ___. Hemolysis labs were not suggestive of acute hemolysis, and there was no evidence of nutritional deficiencies. She was guaiac negative. Normochromic, normocytic pattern of anemia may be associated with some vasculitides or possible anemia of chronic disease given pattern of iron studies(although Fe normal). H/H remained stable and she did not require any transfusions.\n\n【38】# Transaminitis: had elevated LFTs at presentation, which had been attributed to starting methimazole, Methimazole stopped on___ prior to admission after LFTs continued to rise. RUQ US showed cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis, and she had normal Tbili so cholangitis was also thought to be unlikely. LFTs trended down without intervention and after consulting with Endocrine, it was felt that Methimazole was unlikey the cause of her elevated LFTS (likely congestive from fluid bolus in ED). \n\n【39】CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES: \n# dCHF: ___ ECHO was notable for mild LVH (LVEF > 55%) and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Continued home metoprolol and torsemide 40 mg PO DAILY. \n\n【40】# HTN: Has been difficult to treat in the past. isosorbide mononitrate 30 daily. Held lisinopril in the setting of ___. \nIncreased diltiazem from 30 to 240mg XL and increased hydralazine from 25mg TID to 50 QID for goal SBP < 120. Switched metoprolol to Coreg 25 BID. \n\n【41】# HIV: CD4 count 815 in ___ with undetectable viral load. \nRepeat CD4 count 600, viral load with < 20 copies/mL. Continued home Dolutegravir 50 mg PO DAILY, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO DAILY,Abacavir Sulfate 600 mg PO DAILY.\n\n【42】# Asthma: held home metered-dose inhalers while on nebulizers as above, added Flovent, which imporved respiratory status. \n\n【43】# Depression: continued home sertaline\n\n【44】# GERD: increased home omeprazole from 20mg daily to 40mg BID per GI recommendations \n\n【45】# CVA hx: INR was subtherapeutic- Follow-up with cardiac surgery team regarding restarting warfarin\n\n【46】# Hyperthyroidism: methimazole stopped ___ due to increased LFTs; however, restarted on ___ after consult with Endocrine(methimazole was not felt to be causing elevated LFTs). TSH was low but increased from prior (0.05 from 0.02) with T4, T3, and free T4 within normal limits, so thyrotoxicosis was thought to be unlikely\n\n【47】Transitional Issues:\n-dry weight ___ 65.5 kg\n\n【48】___ Methimazole, Tramadol, Steraline all have interactions with Warfarin, as indicated by her INR of >5 on this admission. Close monitoring needed with possible decrease in daily Warfarin dose. \nShould be checked q2 days until stable INR reached. \n2. 9 mm subpleural nodule in the left lower lobe may represent focal atelectasis and has demonstrated five-month stability. \nFollow-up CT in ___ months recommended to ensure ongoing stability as well as to evaluate stability of a small right adrenal nodule.\n3. Lisinopril stopped d/t ___, likely from contrast. For better BP control, we increased Imdur XR from 30 mg to 60 mg daily. \nOnce her ___ resolves, Imdur can be decreased (and perhaps D/Ced) in favor of Lisinopril. \n4. Her asthma was being treated with Ipratropium-Albuterol Neb 1 NEB NEB Q4H:PRN SOB prior to admission, which is not in the step-wise treatment of asthma, but is okay for occasional use. \nWe started her on medium dose inhaled GC to be taken BID for one month for this exacerbation. She can take Albuterol inhaler as needed for SOB. If she is waking nightly with SOB, using rescue inhaler daily, etc she may need ongoing inhaled GC treatment. \n5. She was discharged at a weight of 65.4 kg, which was noted to be her dry weight by the heart failure service last admission. \nDiuretic dose was increased but led to ___, therefore she was discharged on her home dose. Please check Renal Chem 10 within___ days of discharge to monitor Cr. ___ require titration of lasix as an outpatient.\n6. Her chest wall pain is likely from chronic cough/MSK pain from bronchitis with possible component of pleurisy, which may take weeks to months to fully resolve. She was given Tramadol 50 mg TID for pain relief. \n\n【49】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO BID:PRN pain \n2.

In order to prevent this hematoma from getting bigger, it is important to keep your blood pressure under control and we've added medications on to do so. \nYou were also having abdominal pain and chest wall pain. You had a CT scan and ultrasound of your abdomen which did not reveal the cause of your pain; however, we believe your pain was possibly from pleuritis and chronic cough from bronchitis. We've given you 3 weeks of pain medicine to help get you through while this runs its course; this should get better in time. \nFor your asthma, we started you on a new inhaler to better control your symptoms and you should follow up with your PCP for___ management. \n\n【56】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Hemorrhagic products versus calculi versus debris within the CBD. \nPreliminary ReportUnsuccessful attempts at placing biliary drainage catheter. \n\n【24】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr ___ is a ___ with h/o cirrhosis who p/w hepatic encephalopathy, worsening liver failure, likely related to EtOH hepatitis, found to likely have cholangitis, who was transitioned to DNR/DNI/CMO status during this admission. He is discharged to SNF close to his family, who will continue evaluation for hospice. Pt is DO NOT HOSPITALIZE, confirmed w/pt and family.\n\n【25】# Goals of care: patient is quite sick, w/ multiple acute issues. His life expectancy is several weeks. After family meeting ___, decided patient would be DNR/DNI/CMO/DO NOT HOSPITALIZE. Palliative care was involved, and the patient was discharge to ___, who will continue evaluation for hospice services.\n\n【26】# Cholangitis: CT scan showed CBD dilated from previous RUQ U/S. \nBecause he was coagulopathic w/ INR 5.1, he was reversed w/ FFP and went to ERCP. ERCP saw pus, and possibly obstructing stone,but was unable to cannulate ampulla. He thus went for a PTC. \nHowever, on PTC, there was no obstruction, w/ contrast flowing freely into the intestines, so no drain left in place. Perhaps the stone cleared after ERCP, or perhaps there never was one,just ulcers by the ampulla. After ERCP adn PTC, his tbili continued to worsen. Thus, he may never have had obstruction,just worsening liver disease. However, we decided to treat him for cholangitis anyways, so he will complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl ___, which he will complete on ___.\n\n【27】#AMS/hepatic encephalopathy: likely related to worsening liver disease, acute liver injury from alcoholic hepatitis, and contribution from cholangitis. His lactulose was increased, and we started rifaxamin. His mental status improved, though he did remain confused as his liver disease worsened.\n\n【28】#Acute on chronic liver disease. Has cirrhosis related to HepC and EtOH. He developed progressive hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy during this admission. MELD increased to 37. We thoughtthis may be related to cholangitis, but CBD was patent on PTC attempt ___, so this became less likely. Hep C viral load is 170, almost non-detectable. Pt admits to drinking etoh prior to admission, so alcoholic hepatitis is the likely cause of actue injury. ___ Discriminate Function rose to 205 during this admission, indicating a very poor prognosis. We started treatment for alcoholic hepatitis with pentoxyfiline, but he developed intractable N/V so this was stopped. Not using prednisone ___ HCV and cholangitis. ___ serologies showed no acute infection. He became a bit volume overloaded from many FFP infusions for the procedures above, so we diuresed with IV lasix for several days prior to discharge, and put him back on palliative lasix and spironolactone prior to discharge.\n\n【29】# Duodenal ulcers: Seen on ERCP. Unclear cause, though likely EtOH related. We checked H pylori serologies, which were also positive, so that may play a role as well. He will be on PPI,flagyl, and levofloxacin, which should have reasonable H pylori coverage. Again, the point is palliation in this patient, so likely the PPI is the most pertinent medication. In order to avoid further painful ulcers, should avoid NSAIDs, alcohol,steroids, cigarettes.\n\n【30】# Pain control: palliative care was involved with the patient's pain control. Initially he was on methadone 94mg daily for heroin maintenance. Because of altered mental status, we weaned this down to 60mg daily. Given the patient's new very poor status, we decided to stop methatdone for heroin abstinence maintenance. However, at the recommendation of our palliative care doctors, it was decided to use methadone for pain control,as they felt that switching to a different opioid would be quite dangerous, either for under or overdosing, given complex pharmacokinetics of methadone. Thus, he was sent out on methadone 20mg ___ TID, as well as methadone 10mg ___ TID PRN breakthrough pain, per recommedations of our palliative care service.\n\n【31】#HTN: as patient now CMO, lisinopril was stopped.\n\n【32】#ETOH ABUSE: as patient now CMO, we stopped B12, folate,thiamine. Multivitamin was continued at request of patient.\n\n【33】#CODE: DNR/DNI/CMO/DO NOT HOSPITALIZE\n#CONTACT: ___ ___. home: ___.\n\n【34】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# evaluate for hospice services at ___\n# Will continue to be followed by his PCP: ___. \nPhone: ___Fax: ___# DO NOT HOSPITALIZE confirmed with patient and family \n\n【35】Medications on Admission:\nAlbuterol HFA 90mcg 2 puffs every 4 hours PRN* Magnesium oxide 400mg twice daily* Multivitamin daily* Folic acid 1mg daily* Lasix 40mg daily* Spironolactone 50mg daily* Omeprazole 20mg daily* Lisinopril 40mg daily* Thiamine 100mg daily* Methadone 94mg daily (confirmed, dosed daily at ______) \n\n【36】Discharge Medications:\n1.
