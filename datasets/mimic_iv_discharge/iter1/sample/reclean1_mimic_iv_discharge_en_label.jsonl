CXR prelim read showed LLL pneumonia, and the patient received levofloxacin 750mg and vancomycin 1gm IV because of a report of prior MRSA per patient. \nAnkle plain films were negative for osteomyelitis. Noted to have an elevated CK but normal UA. She was given morphine 8mg IV for pain. Blood cultures were sent. Per RN report, the patient has removed clean bandages, repeatedly left the building to smoke,had lost one peripheral IV. She was then transferred to the floor for further management. \n\n【10】Past Medical History:\nHepatitis C Cyroglobulinema Beta thalassemia Chronic ulcers h/o narcotic/ETOH abuse \n\n【11】Social History:___\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory\n\n【12】Physical Exam:\nper Dr. ___: T 99.2 BP 120/62 HR 118 RR 24 85% RA 95% on 4L GEN: NAD, WDWN SKIN: ___ ulcers on lateral lower extremity bilaterally;no erythema; no purulent drainage HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, neck supple, no LAD, no JVD CARD: Tachycardic, no m/r/g LUNG: \nABD: +BS, NTND, soft, no guarding or rebound EXT: no edema, pulses dopplerable bilaterally NEURO: A&Ox3, ___ strength, Sensation intact bilaterally \n\n【13】Pertinent Results:\nLABS ON ADMISSION:\nCBC: WBC 13.9, Hct 33.1, Plt 378Chem7: Na 138, K 4.6, Cl 98, CO2 27, BUN 25, Cr 1.0, Glu 190Cardiac: CK 3462, TropT <0.01Lactate 2.7\nUrine/Serum tox: Negative CRP 187.6\nU/A: Negative.\n\n【14】LAB TRENDS:\nWBC: 13.9 -> 8.2\nHct: Stable 32-35 (chronic microcytic anemia)\nCK: 3462 -> 2873 -> 1845 -> 652 -> 294LDH: 814 -> 549 -> 514Lactate: 2.7 -> 2.3 -> 1.6\n___ 03:00PM BLOOD cTropnT-<0.01\n___ 03:00PM BLOOD CK-MB-88* MB Indx-2.5\n___ 03:30AM BLOOD CK-MB-44* MB Indx-1.5 cTropnT-0.02___ 11:45AM BLOOD CK-MB-27* MB Indx-1.5 cTropnT-<0.01.\n\n【15】CXR ___: Early left lower lobe PNA.\n\n【16】CTA ___: Suboptimal opacification of distal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary artery. However, no large central or lobar pulmonary embolus was noted. Extensive background lung disease with multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation. These could represent multifocal pneumonia. In the setting of immunocompromised status, PCP pneumonia remains ___differential consideration. Other forms of interstitial lung diseases such as UIP, drug-induced pneumonitis cannot be excluded.\n\n【17】# CXR ___: Progressive density in the right lower lobe area and a more atelectatic appearing density in the left lower lobe area. Continued followup and clinical correlation needed to differentiate atelectasis from pneumonia.\n\n【18】Ankle xray ___: IMPRESSION: Large soft tissue ulcerations along the lateral aspect of the lower legs with findings concerning for osteomyelitis of the right distal fibula. \n***Note: this was discussed and felt to likely be in the setting of patient's chronic ulcer which has exposed bone. This was felt not likely to be due to a new or active osteomyelitis.***.\n\n【19】___: CT chest: IMPRESSION: Near complete resolution of previously described ground-glass opacities. \n\n【20】Brief Hospital Course:\nPatient had resolution of her pneumonia (see below) but was not cleared by physical therapy for discharge. She also was not able to perform her own dressing changes. We attempted to place patient in rehab/snf but she was a difficult placement. The patient was then found to be smoking in her room then again down outside of the hospital. We explained that this was not appropriate. The following day she insisted on leaving with the wheelchair. We urged her to stay since we were not sure she was stable to ambulate on her own or do own dressing changes. She demanded to leave and signed out AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.\n\n【21】Hosp course by problem:\n\n【22】 # Hypoxia/LLL Pneumonia: CXR with evidence of LLL pneumonia. Hx of MRSA therefore started on vanco/levaquin for abx coverage. \nBlood cultures from the ED were negative and other blood cx were NGTD at time of discharge. Levaquin and vancomycin were continued for possible nosocomial vs CA pneumonia (patient had recently been hospitalized and after that had resided in a nursing home and it was felt she was at risk for hospital-acquired infection) for 4 days. After this, IV vancomycin was D/Ced and patient was continued on a total of a 10-day course of levaquin (5 days at 750mgQD and 5 days at 500mg QD). In terms of other etiologies of hypoxia/SOB: ___ was performed with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes and no new EKG changes. CTA was performed and showed no large central or lobar pulmonary embolus. However CTA did reveal extensive background lung disease with multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation, which were initially felt to likely be ___underlying lung disease ___ cryoglobulinemia (there have been reports of interstitial pneumonitis in association with HepC and cryoglobulinemia) or drug-induced lung disease (patient has received multiple cytotoxic medications for attempted treatment of HepC and cryoglobulinemia). There was some concern for rituxan-induced UIP but a repeat chest CT showed almost complete resolution of the ground glass opacities on initial CT so these changes were thought to most likely be ___ an infectious process. Patient should follow up with PCP to discuss any need for further pulmonary imaging.\n\n【23】# Severe pain: ___ ulcers, neuropathic pain, ?psychological componenet. Patient was initially given 4mg IV morphine x 3 over 3 hours in ED. She continued to complain of ___ pain on arrival to floor. After several hours on floor, patient given valium for CIWA and appeared very sleepy, yet still complaining of pain. After talking with PCP, PCP recommended switching off IV pain meds given h/o IV narcotic abuse. Patient was switched to PO MScontin and oxycodone. Gabapentin, amitryptiline,effexor, and lyrica were also given for neuropathic pain. \nGabapentin was initially started at 300mg TID and this was titrated up to 1200mg TID over the course of the hospital stay. \nPatient was weaned off the narcotic medications MScontin and oxycodone. She complained of persistent difficulty ambulating___ pain; she was actively encouraged to ambulate on a daily basis by both staff and ___.\n\n【24】# ___ IV Ulcers: Unclear etiology but likely secondary to severe refractory cryoglobulinemia. Xray did show evidence of osteomyelitis but this was believed to be a chronic finding given the fact that the patient's ulcers reveal exposed bone. \nVascular surgery did see her in consult and believed that there was no clinical evidence of cellulitis, active osteomyelitis,necrotizing fasciitsi, or compartment syndrome. On exam, ulcers were deep but did not appear infected; granulation tissue present with no active bleeding or exudate. Ulcers were managed with daily wound dressing changes as per vascular surgery recommendations, as well as pain management by PO pain medications.\n\n【25】# Elevated CK: Patient had elevated CK to ~3500 at time of presentation. This may have been ___ stasis, not moving with pain of leg ulcers, medication side effect. She had been on home lyrica which has been reported to cause elevated CK and/or rhabdo in about 2% of cases. Lyrica was initially held as inpatient. Patient given IV fluid replacement. Repeat CK trended down 3500 -> 2800 -> 1800 -> 650 and at this point lyrica was restarted given the decreasing CK as well as patient's significant pain. Over the course of the hospital admission, CK continued to trend down to around 300.\n\n【26】# Anemia: Patient has longstanding anemia likely related to both her reported history of beta thalassemia as well as chronic blood loss from her ulcers and anemia of chronic inflammation. \nIron studies ___ iron but also low TIBC and high Ferritin,which is most c/w anemia of chronic inflammation rather than iron deficiency anemia. Microcytosis likely ___ thalassemia. \nNo treatment was given for anemia during hospital stay as supplemental iron did not seem to be indicated.\n\n【27】# Lactic acidosis: Lactic acid elevated to 2.7 at presentation with unclear etiology, ? local tissue ischemia from ulcers. \nThere was no evidence of hypoperfusion or severe hypoxemia. \nLactate was trended and decreased from 2.7 to 1.6 over the course of the hospital stay.\n\n【28】# Hx of substance abuse: Per patient report, she has not used illicits or ETOH in ___ yrs. Utox and serum tox negative at presentation. Monitored on CIWA scale with administration of valium for signs of severe agitation as necessary.\n\n【29】# Cryoglobulinemia: Patient has history of Type II cryoglobulinemia most likely ___ HCV infection. Patient recently received Rituxan therapy at OSH. Rituxan is anexperimental treatment in patient who have not responded to interferon therapy. She may have extensive vasculitis leading to the ulceration, but there was no evidence of renal failure on labs. \nPer report from her rheumatologist, patient has been tried on multiple medications to treat both the hepC and the cryoglobulinemia, none of which have been tolerated or been successful. She was initially treated with interferon but had a negative reaction (severe depression) to this and it was stopped. She was also tried on plasmaphoresis (which did not help), steroids (which made her \"crazy\") as well as the most recent trial of rituximab. Some evidence in the literature for use of azathioprine/cyclophosphamide for treatment of refractory cryoglobulinemia, and this could possibly attempted as outpatient.\n\n【30】# Hepatitis C: Monitored LFTs; as per above patient has h/o interferon allergy and this seems to preclude further treatment.\n\n【31】# Depression: Continued citalopram 40mg PO QD (though on report from ___ patient has not filled this Rx since ___. Added effexor. Continued pain meds. Social worker consulted.\n\n【32】# Tobacco Use: Nicotine patch.\n\n【33】# FEN: Regular diet, electrolyte repletion prn, IVF PRN.\n\n【34】# PPX: Heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel regimen, PPI, Contact precautions for hx of MRSA.\n\n【35】# Code: Full.\n\n【36】# Communication: Mother, ___, ___ ___ or 6800.\n\n【37】Medications on Admission:\nViroptic eye drops Prednisolone eye drops Trazodone 150mg PO QHS PRN insomnia Prilosec 40 mg daily Celexa 40 mg PO daily Lyrica 300 bid Effexor 75 PO daily Amitriptyline 50mg BID \n\n【38】Discharge Medications:\nNote that no prescriptions were given since patient left AMA.\n\n【39】1.

Chronic low grade temperatures and tachycardia, has been persistent through hospital course and during previous hospitalizations at ___,does not appear to be new, likely ___ chronic ulceration/inflammation.\n\n【44】Discharge Instructions:\nYou were admitted because of worsening pain in your legs as well as some shortness of breath. You had a chest Xray which showed possible pneumonia and your oxygen was low, so we started treatment with 2 antibiotics (levoquin and vancomycin) to treat this pneumonia. We continued the vancomycin for 4 days and levoquin for 10 days. Chest CAT scan showed that you initially had a lung process which could have been either infection or drug-induced process; a repeat chest CAT scan after a few days showed that this process had resolved so it was likely an infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis. We also worked as carefully as we could with your PCP to control your leg pain with oral pain medications (MS contin and oxycodone as recommended by your PCP) as well as gabapentin which we increased from 900 three times a day to 1200 three times a day,and your home dose of amitryptiline. We added effexor to better control your pain. We weaned off your narcotics prior to discharge.\n\n【45】Please take all medications as directed. You left against our advice so we were unable to prepare prescriptions for you.\n\n【46】If you have any problems with severely worsening leg pain or any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fevers at home please call your PCP, and if your PCP is not available please come to the nearest emergency room.\n\n【47】You left AGAINST OUR ADVICE and signed a release form documenting this. Please see your physician tomorrow for refills on your medications.\n\n【48】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Per the patient and OSH records she was admitted to ___from ___ with chief complaints of dyspnea and hemoptysis. She had sudden onset of dyspnea and hemoptysis(unable to quantify amount but saying it \"covered\" the room she was in when it began). She was admitted to ___where she had a \"half dose contrast\" CTA, which showed no PE, a V/Q scan that was read as low probability, and a bronchoscopy showing a diffuse submucosal infiltrative process but no endobronchial lesion. She was kept in the ICU and managed on BiPAP but improved with antibiotics and steroids and never required intubation. She also received a course of IV antibiotics while in the hospital, but these were not continued at home. She was discharged home on supplemental oxygen and a steroid taper. Since her discharge she had been doing well until the day prior to presentation when she developed dyspnea while walking outside without her oxygen. She also had multiple episodes of quarter sized hemoptysis with coughing. When these symptoms began she called EMS and was brought to ______ once again. At the outside hospital she had a chest radiograph and repeat VQ scan, which was read as low probability once again. She received vancomycin and pipercillin-tazobactam for hospital associated pneumonia as there was question of a left lower lobe infiltrate. At that point the pulmonologists at___ requested transfer as they felt they had reached the limits of their capabilities to work this process up. \n\n【9】In the ED, initial vitals: T 98 (98.7),BP 133/63,HR 100,RR 18,O2 Sats 96% on 2L.

Physiological pericardial effusion.\n3. Widespread ground-glass opacity and septal thickening, mostly in the left upper lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe but also in every lobe, could be edema or hemorrhage, very less likely pneumonia. More focal consolidation in the right perihilar region could be post-radiation changes or infection.\n4. Right upper and right lower lobe lung lesions, warrants comparison with older studies. Left lower lobe mass, could be rounded atelectasis or malignancy, should also be compared.\n5. Abdominal lymphadenopathy. Left adrenal adenoma. Right adrenal lesionnot typical for an adenoma, should be compared to older studiesBilateral Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasounds:\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.\n\n【24】Renal U/S ___:\nIMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.\n\n【25】Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___:\nIMPRESSION: Very small circumferential pericardial effusion with a prominent anterior fat pad. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Increased PCWP. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. \n\n【26】Brief Hospital Course:___ y.o. female with history of non-small cell lung cancer status post chemoradiation presenting with recurrent dyspnea and hemoptysis. \n\n【27】1) COPD exacerbation/Pneumonia: Upon presentation the patient had considerable wheezing bilaterally but was breathing comfortably and was not desaturating on 2L O2 by nasal cannula,which was what she had been prescribed at home. Therefore, as she had been intermittently using 2L O2 by nasal cannula at home it was unclear how much worse her symptoms were than her baseline. Given concern for hemoptysis and possible need for bronchoscopy, however, pulmonology consult was obtained and involved throughout her hospitalization. As she was quite wheezy on presentation and her long smoking history an element of COPD was considered quite likely to be contributing to this presentation so she was started on an aggressive COPD regimen with standing beta agonist and anti-cholinergic inhalers as well as daily long acting beta-agonist/corticosteroid inhaler. \nFurther systemic corticosteroid therapy was deferred at this time given she had just completed a taper on the day prior to presentation. She also was continued on a course of antibiotics for hospital acquired pneumonia given she did have an infiltrate, though her clinical presentation did not sound completely consistent with acute bacterial pneumonia. CT scan revealed probable infiltrate as well as masses and post-radiation fibrosis consistent with her previous malignancy and treatment. Her previous imaging from ___was also reviewed by the pulmonary consult service who thought her fibrosis was essentially stable. With inhalers and antibiotics her symptoms considerably improved with resolution of her wheezing. She was transitioned to oral antibiotics and remained afebrile. At the time of discharge she was able to ambulate with an O2 saturation of 93-97% on room air. She was discharged to complete a total of ten days of antibiotic therapy. As the patient has COPD she also received pneumovax in the hospital, as she had not received this previously. \n\n【28】2) Hemoptysis: The patient had small volume hemoptysis (coughing up rusty sputum and quarter sized clots) prior to presentation. \nAt presentation her cough had resolved and she had no hemoptysis. Hematocrit remained stable and she never complained of lightheadedness, chest pain, or general fatigue consistent with symptomatic anemia. An active type and screen was obtained but she never required transfusion. The pulmonology consult service was involved in her care and considered bronchoscopy,but after discussing the previous bronchoscopy with her pulmonologist at ___ they believed she had a quite complete study and the yield of repeating it so soon was very low. She did re-develop a small amount of rusty sputum in the context of increased cough later in the hospitalization but as this was associated with overall improvement in her respiratory symptoms this was considered most likely due to improved mucociliary clearance and her hematocrit remained stable. Her cough was improving again at the time of discharge. \n\n【29】3) Anemia: Given concern for hemoptysis this was initially monitored closely and the patient had an active type and screen throughout her hospitalization. Nevertheless, she never had large volume hemoptysis and her hematocrit remained with stable anemia and a hematocrit from 28 to 26 throughout her hospitalization. Iron studies were checked and were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation presumed due to her recent hospitalizations as well as possible underlying malignancy and/or her chronic kidney disease. \n\n【30】4) Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease: The patient reported a long history of being followed by a nephrologist but was unable to tell us the name of that nephrologist. Baseline Cr was unclear as there was a report that on her previous hospital discharge from ___ Cr was 1.1 but there were other indicators (i.e. treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism) that the patient had more severe renal disease than this. Unfortunately, attempts to obtain previous labs for renal function were unsuccessful. Evaluation for obstructive uropathy showed no obstruction, urine sediment was benign, and there were no eosinophils on evaluation or urine. \nCr improved from 1.7 to 1.3 over the course of his hospitalization and after ruling out major sources of active damage no further acute management was conducted. She was encouraged to follow up with her outpatient nephrologist. \n\n【31】5) H/o pericardial effusion: The patient had an echocardiogram at the outside hospital that by report showed a possibly loculated effusion. Given concern for a possible malignant effusion this was repeated at ___ and showed no loculation, a small effusion, and a normal ejection fraction. There was elevated PCWP noted, which was considered most consistent with some secondary pulmonary hypertension due to her pulmonary disease. \n\n【32】6) Atherosclerosis: The patient has atherosclerotic disease with no history of CAD but a history of a carotid endarterectomy and a reported history of PVD. Her aspirin was held in the hospital given concern for bleeding from her hemoptysis, but her statin was continued. There was never any indication of active ischemic disease in the hospital. \n\n【33】7) History of malignancy: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer status post chemoradiation therapy. Her presentation and previous benign bronchoscopy suggested that her current presentation was not due to an acute manifestation of progressive malignancy though the results of her previous radiation therapy undoubtedly contribute to her decreased pulmonary reserve. The patient is closely followed for her malignancy at ___ and was encouraged strongly to continue to follow there. We also suggested she obtain her imaging taken here and make sure these are conveyed to her treaters at ___ to assess for any progression,though this was not obvious on non-radiologist comparison of her old and new films. \n\n【34】8) Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is on cinacalcet at home for presumed secondary hyperparathyroidism, which was further implied by her elevated PTH. She was continued on her home cinacalcet dosing. \n\n【35】9) Insomnia: The patient is on temazepam at home for insomnia and though considered a less ideal option in an elderly patient this was continued in the hospital. \n\n【36】10) Hypertension: The patient was continued on her home metoprolol with stable blood pressures.\n\n【37】The patient was continued on her home PPI for GERD. Pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis as there was concern of worsening her hemomptysis with anticoagulation. She was fed a full diet. \nShe was DNR/DNI per her request. \n\n【38】Medications on Admission:\nAlbuterol INH Metoprolol 25 mg bid Furosemide 20 mg daily Atorvastatin 40 mg daily Ferrous Sulfate 325 daily Temazepam 15 mg qhs Cincalcet 30 mg daily Potassium Chloride 20 meq daily Omeprazole 20 mg daily Prednisone 10 mg po (last dose on ___APAP PRN\n\n【39】Discharge Medications:\n1.

While you were here you were comfortable on the same amount of supplemental oxygen you had at home and you only coughed up limited amounts of dried blood. Your blood counts were stable. The lung doctors, the pulmonologists, did not feel it would be helpful for you to have another bronchoscopy as you had just had one within the last few weeks. \nWe believe you most likely had a lung infection (either bacterial or viral) that worsened your breathing in the context of being off your oxygen. We also think you probably need chronic treatment for your shortness of breath with inhalers. \nWe are treating you for a bacterial pneumonia and you will be discharged with five more days of the antibiotics CEFPODOXIME and AZITHROMYCIN after you're discharged. \n\n【46】Your medications have been changed. You will complete courses of the antibiotics CEFPODOXIME and AZITHROMYCIN. We have also started inhalers (ALBUTEROL and IPRATROPRIUM) to help your breathing. You will need to take the Albuterol every six hours(except during sleep)for at least two weeks. You can use this medication as needed afterwards. You should stay on the IPRATROPRIUM every six hours until told to stop by your doctor. \nOtherwise your medications have not been changed. \n\n【47】Please come back to the hospital if you have worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, increased blood in your sputum, or any other changes in your health. \n\n【48】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

She had CT at ___ which revealed known AAA with evidence of aortitis with edema around the thoracic and upper abdominal aorta. Also with pleural effusions,that were by report transudative. She was started on CTX and Penicillin and managed medically; vascular surgery was then consulted and she was transferred to ___ for further evaluation. On arrival to ___ on ___ she was HD stable. \nVascular surgery was consulted and recommended interval CTA which showed progression of edema and inflammation around the thoracoabdominal aorta extending to involving the aortic arch and left subclavian artery with new pouch-like protrusions arising from the thoracic and abdominal aorta, highly suspicious for mycotic aneurysms. She was transferred to the ___ for closer monitoring. Cardiac surgery was consulted based on new ascending aortic involvement. Both vascular and cardiac surgery jointly determined that Ms. ___ would not be a surgical candidate based on extensive aortic involvement. During this time Infectious Disease was also consulted and recommended monotherapy with CTX 2g q12H for 6 weeks duration (last day___. She was transferred to the medical ICU for strict blood pressure control with SBP goal <120 which was achieved as below with multiple agents. She was then transferred to the floor. She continues to be at high risk of aortic rupture, though timing of rupture is difficult to predict. Palliative care was consulted given complexities with end of life planning (see below).\n\n【43】# Goals of care: Patient's condition is almost certainly fatal. \nShe is not a surgical candidate and has progressed on antibiotics (details below). She is at risk for aortic rupture,but per vascular surgery evaluation unable to predict exact timeline (\"1 day to ___ year\"). Family meetings on ___ and ___with the primary team and palliative care revealed that patient and her family understand the severity of her medical disease and need for end of life planning, would like to find a facility close to home where she can pursue hospice and focus on comfort. \nShe will be discharged to a nursing facility with affiliated hospice. Per ID, completion of 6 week course of IV ceftriaxone would likely prolong her life, improve quality of life. Per team discussion this would be a palliative measure. Patient is DNR/DNI as resuscitation is not indicated for aortic rupture. \n\n【44】# Hypertension/strict BP control: Per Vascular surgery recommendations her SBP goal was <120 to reduce risk of aortic rupture. She was initially transferred to MICU for BP control. \nShe was placed on Labetalol, Lisinopril, and HCTZ. IV hydralazine 10mg was used q4H PRN for BP control when patient was intermittently unable to take PO. She was discharged on: \nLabetalol 600mg TID, Lisinopril 40mg daily, amlodipine 5mg daily, and chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily.\n\n【45】# S. pneumo bacteremia: Likely seeded from LLL pneumonia seen on Chest CT at ___. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended continuing 2g IV Ceftriaxone q24 hours for 6 weeks for endovascular infection. A PICC line was placed. It was ultimately felt that continuation of antibiotics on discharge for life-prolonging measures was within the patient's goals of care. \n\n【46】#Oral thrush/throat pain: the patient had oral thrush and significant mouth and swallowing discomfort with suspicion of esophageal candidiasis that initially prevented her from taking PO pills and eating. She was unable to tolerate PO meds so ___started on IV fluconazole with significant improvement. She was switched to PO fluconazole on discharge for total of 14 day course with last day on ___. \n\n【47】# Anemia: Per records from ___, she had an initial Hct drop there from 28.5 to 24.5. She received 1u pRBCs on ___, with appropriate Hb rise. GI at ___ did feel there was an active GI bleed and recommended outpatient EGD/colonoscopy. \nHer Hgb was stable throughout her admission at ___ without sx of bleeding. \n\n【48】# Nutrition: Albumin in ED was found to be low at 2.1 likely protein malnutrition secondary to poor intake. \n\n【49】# Hyponatremia: Sodium was 131 on admission with unclear etiology, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia; improved on discharge to 134. \n\n【50】# Elevated lipase: Lipase was elevated to 600 at ______ without symptoms and no radiographic evidence of pancreatitis. Repeat lipase at ___ was normal at 27.\n\n【51】# Thrombocytosis: Platelet count was elevated to 687 on admission, likely reactive in the setting of infection. \nDowntrended to 589 on discharge. \n\n【52】# Elevated alkaline phosphatase: On admission, AP was 111 likely in the setting of rib fracture. \n\n【53】# L rib fracture: She continued to have significant left-sided pain from rib fracture s/p mechanical fall 1 month PTA. She was continued on Acetominophen 1000mg prn and oxycodone.\n\n【54】# NIDDM: Her most recent HbA1c was 7.9%. \n\n【55】# Hx of prior TIA: Continued on dipyridamole, aspirin.\n\n【56】Transitional Issues:.\n\n【57】- Antibiotic course is Ceftriaxone 2g q24 hours for 6 weeks(___). She has an appointment for repeat imaging on___ per Infectious Disease Team to assess for interval change in aortitis. Final course of antibiotics will be determined based on the imaging. \n- Access for ABX is a PICC line, which should be removed at completion of antibiotics. \n- Please maintain patient's systolic blood pressure <120 to reduce risk of aortic rupture. She was discharged on labetalol 600mg TID, lisinopril 40mg and Chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily, and amlodipine 5mg daily with good blood pressure control. Please uptitrate as needed to achieve BP goal. \n- Patient on fluconazole for highly symptomatic oral thrush and likely esophageal candidiasis. Course: ___. \n- During this hospital stay, there were extensive goals of care discussion with patient and her family regarding her end of life planning. Per vascular surgery, we are unable to predict the immanency of aortic rupture. During her remaining time family would like to optimize quality of life. Please continually reassess goals of care, especially with respect to antibiotics. \n- Patient should be evaluated by hospice team once she establishes care at her nursing facility. She may have escalating needs and may choose to peel back treatments as her condition advances. \n- No specific activity restrictions per vascular surgery- Patient's blood sugar was well controlled so diabetes medications were held on discharge. Please follow up with blood sugar and assess need for restarting oral hypoglycemics if within patient's goals of care. \n\n【58】ID OPAT RECOMMENDATIONS: \n\n【59】ID OPAT Program Intake Note - Order Recommendations \n\n【60】OPAT Diagnosis: strep pneumonia bacteremia and aortitis with mycotic aneurysms of ascending/thoracic aorta (likely seeded into existing aneurysm)\n\n【61】OPAT Antimicrobial Regimen and Projected Duration: \nAgent & Dose: CTX IV 2g q24hrs Start Date: ___\nProjected End Date: final duration pending clinical course and repeat imaging, but at least 6wks likely\n\n【62】LAB MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS: NOTE: For lab work to be drawn after discharge, a specific standing order for Outpatient Lab Work is required to be placed in the Discharge Worksheet Post-Discharge Orders.

Assess abdominal mass for active bleeding versus other etiology. \n\n【31】TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis,initially without cotrast, and subsequently in the arterial and portal venous phases after administration of IV Omnipaque contrast. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal, sagittal, and MIP reformats. \nCOMPARISON: Outside CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast from___bdomen and pelvis from ___ \n\n【32】FINDINGS: \n\n【33】CTA abd/pel: \nThe celiac axis, SMA, bilateral renal arteries, and ___ are grossly patent. Moderate atherosclerotic mural calcifications are seen throughout the aorta and its major branches. The hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. \n\n【34】LOWER CHEST: There is atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally. Aortic valve replacement is noted. There is a trace, likely physiologic, pericardial effusion. The heart is mildly enlarged. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis. \n\n【35】ABDOMEN: \n\n【36】No suspicious focal liver lesion is seen. The portal venous system is patent. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are normal. A 2.3 x 2.3 cm right adrenal adenoma is unchanged since prior study. The left adrenal gland is unremarkable. Cortically based hypodensities are again noted bilaterally measuring up to 1.4 cm in the upper pole of the right kidney. Most of these are too small to fully characterize but statistically represent simple cysts. A 4 mm stone is seen in the interpolar region of the left kidney. Tiny punctate stone is seen in the interpolar region of the right kidney. \nThere has been slight interval improvement in mild to moderate bilateral hydroureteronephrosis. There is persistent hazy opacity surrounding the proximal right ureter, unchanged since prior study. There is also nonspecific perinephric stranding, likely related to chronic obstruction. \n\n【37】Within the mid abdomen, to the right of midline, there is a 5.1 x 4.7 x 5.1cm heterogeneous hyperdense rounded mass with a focus of arterial enhancement which blushes on the portal venous phase compatible with active extravasation. This is within the mesentery, in close proximity to an SMA peripheral branch,although direct communication with the adjacent SMA branch is not identified. The hematoma, however, has not increased in size compared to study performed one day prior, when it measured 5.5 x 5.3 cm. There is associated stranding within the mesentery. \nSome retroperitoneal fat stranding is also present. \n\n【38】There is a small hiatal hernia. The small and large bowel are normal in caliber and without evidence of wall thickening. The appendix is visualized and normal. Colonic diverticulosis is present without evidence of diverticulitis. Mildly enlarged 12 mm short axis diameter mesenteric lymph node noted series 10, image 77,slightly enlarged from previous CT from ___. \n\n【39】PELVIS: \nThe prostate gland is grossly enlarged and measures 7.3 x 6.1 cm in axial___. A Foley catheter is present within a mostly collapsed bladder. There is bladder wall thickening likely related to chronic outlet obstruction. There are scattered prominent pelvic sidewall lymph nodes but not enlarged by cT size criteria. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is a small fat containing left inguinal hernia. Surgical clips are noted on the right inguinal region. \n\n【40】OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes are seen within the visualized thoracolumbar spine. No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy. \n\n【41】IMPRESSION: \n\n【42】1. 5.1 x 4.7 x 5.1 cm rounded mass in the mid abdomen to the right of midline contains a focus of arterial enhancement which blushes on portal venous phase compatible with a mesenteric hematoma with active bleeding. The size of this hematoma,however, is unchanged since study performed one day prior. \nClosest visible enhancing vessels are branches of the superior mesenteric artery. \n\n【43】2. Slight interval improvement in bilateral mild to moderate hydroureteronephrosis following Foley placement, likely secondary to massively enlarged prostate gland. \n\n【44】3. Persistent fat stranding surrounding the proximal right ureter, unchanged since ___ when it was evaluated on MR urogram. Stability over time favors an inflammatory/reactive etiology, although neoplastic processes are not entirely excluded. \n\n【45】4. 4mm left and punctate right renal stones. \n\n【46】5. Chronic findings include colonic diverticulosis, right adrenal adenoma, and small fat containing umbilical hernia. \n\n【47】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ year old male with h/o dementia, s/p AVR on AC, HTN, HLD, severe BPH who presents with abdominal pain.\n\n【48】Abdominal Pain secondary to mesenteric hematoma:\nPresented with acute abdominal pain and presented to ___. \nCT non contrast demonsrated a mesenteric \"mass\" and our CTA here showed it to be a bleeding mesenteric hematoma, but not enlarging. His anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K. \nHis hemoglobin remained stable for over a day after reversal of his coumadin, so he was restarted on a heparin gtt with coumadin. His hemoglobin continued to remain stable and his abdominal resolved. \n\n【49】BPH with obstruction Enterococcal UTI Hematuria Acute on chronic. On CT found to have bilateral hydronephrosis,secondary to severe BPH. He also had urinary retention. Foley placed and CBI initiated for his hematuria. His Urine grew out enterococcus and he was started on abx. His hematuria completely resolved, and ___ have been secondary to UTI. He will finish a two week course of antibiotics for his UTI and will follow up with urology for voiding trial. REHAB should call Dr ___ for appointment if they have not been notified of an appointment within a few days. He will continue on finasteride and BID tamsulosin for his severe BPH. \n\n【50】Mechanical aortic valve:\nINR 3.2 within his range. Given concern for bleeding above,warfarin held and reversed. After confirming that hemaglobin was stable, signaling mesenteric hematoma was not expanding,heparin gtt and coumadin resumed, and hemoglobin remained stable. \n\n【51】Vascular Dementia:Has been deteriorating per wife. She notes a lot of personality changes as he has been losing independence.\n\n【52】HTN:\n- Held antihypertensives as was normotensive for most of the admission.\n\n【53】Leg pain/knee pain: Per his wife, he has complained about knee pain intermittently for some time. However, he complained of bilateral leg and knee pain, left much worse than the right. He refused to move his legs secondary to stiffness and pain for the first few days of the hospitalization, but then was flexing the right knee without too much difficulty. Exam notable for left sided knee effusion. Knee xrays showed OA, chondrocalcinosis and Left quadricep tendon injury. He was seen by both the orthopedics and rheumatology services and both agreed on this assessment. It is likely that he has some inflammation, ?bursitis on top of significant OA in the left leg that is causing his symptoms. He was offered a arthrocentesis by the rheumatology service but refused adamantly. He was given two low doses of NSAID and had some relief, but we did not want to continue this given his bleeding, age, anticoagulation. He was started on low dose prednisone after discussion with rheumatology with the hope that his pain and swelling would subside. He was started on prednisone 10 mg on ___ and will taper to 5 mg on ___, and to 2.5 mg on ___ for three days and then stop. He would also benefit from ___ since he also demonstrates a lot of stiffness secondary to immobility. \n\n【54】Goals of care:\nIn discussion with wife/HCP ___, he wishes to be DNR/DNI, no artificial nutrition.

He was in his usual state of health until approximately 2 weeks prior to admission, when he developed gradual-onset progressive exertional dyspnea, unable to walk more than a few steps without becoming short of breath, down from perhaps \"20 feet\" at baseline; he also describes significant windedness in the context of climbing stairs to his apartment, requiring him to stop frequently to catch his breath. Over the same period, he has experienced exertional lightheadedness, PND, occasionally awakening at night short of breath despite CPAP compliance and 2-pillow orthopnea; he initially denied peripheral edema, but then acknowledged perhaps stable peripheral edema. He denies recent fevers, chills, sweats, cough, URI symptoms, chest pain,palpitations, pleuritic chest pain, nausea, vomiting,diaphoresis, abdominal pain or distention. He denies weight gain, calf pain, recent travel or immobilization. Of note, he indicates that he was on furosemide years ago for peripheral edema without heart failure work-up, but self-discontinued due to frequent urination. He initially presented to ___ \n4 days prior to admission for similar symptoms, with EKG,cardiac enzymes, and TTE reportedly reassuring.\n\n【9】In the ED, initial vital signs were: HR 88, BP 149/69, RR 20,SaO2 100% on RA. Admission labs were notable for WBC of 11.3,normal chemistries, NT-pro-BNP of 91, TnT <0.01, and lactate of \n1.6. Blood culture was drawn. EKG in ED showed type 1 second-degree AV block. Portable CXR was essentially unremarkable. Bedside echocardiogram reportedly demonstrated a small pericardial effusion. He received no medications in the ED. He was evaluated by the on-call cardiology fellow who suggested admission for surveillance and formal TTE in the setting of newly diagnosed second-degree AV block. Vital signs on transfer were as follows: HR 67, BP 109/53, RR 18, SaO2 96%on RA.\n\n【10】After arrival to the cardiology ward, he denied dyspnea at rest. \nHe declined furosemide due to the late hour, fearing that it will keep him up all night.

Compared to the previous tracing there is no diagnostic change.\n\n【23】Portable CXR ___\nHeart size is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified although the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.

Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect scarring or atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. \nDegenerative changes in the spine.\n\n【25】Echocardiogram ___\nSuboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. \nThe left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \nIMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality.Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.\n\n【26】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ with history of diabetes mellitus, obesity,sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and GERD who presents with shortness of breath.\n\n【27】# Shortness of breath: He reported progressive exertional dyspnea and PND/orthopnea with signs of volume overload consistent with decompensated heart failure, though CXR without pulmonary edema and NT-pro-BNP entirely normal (91 and rechecked at 74), arguing against diastolic heart failure. Echocardiogram showed very suboptimal image quality, but only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function. He has multiple risk factors for CAD. \nTroponin-T negative twice. Patient's body habitus makes imaging difficult and his weight of 195 kg may exceed the weight limit of nuclear stress or cardiac catheterization imaging tables. \nNormal D-Dimer argued against venous thromboembolic disease. No radiographic or symptomatic evidence of pneumonia or bronchitis. \nHe was treated as follows:\n- Trended daily weight, I/Os\n- He received furosemide 40 mg IV BID on ___ with 2 L output and symptomatic improvement, suggesting some element of fluid overload and diastolic heart failure despite normal NT-pro-BNP- Patient was adamant about discharge home on ___ (despite no change in renal function to indicate approaching dry weight and intravascular volume depletion). We discharged him on furosemide 80 mg PO a follow up appointment with his PCP to monitor chem 10 and fluid balance.\n\n【28】# Hypertension: Continued home lisinopril.

Our workup, which included the ECHO (or picture of your heart), did not reveal any structural abnormalities. The pumping action of your heart appears to be normal; however, the heart is not filling as well as it should, as a result, fluid can back up and cause the edema you now have. The treatment is mostly with diuretics to help you pee off the excess fluid, and we are discharging you home on 80 mg of oral Lasix. Please take this daily to ensure you stay in fluid balance. You should follow up with your PCP ___ 1 week for lab work as this medication can cause electrolyte changes that may require your doctor to decrease the dose. \nPlease weigh yourself daily; if you gain more than 3 lbs in one day, please call your doctor as your diuretic dose may need to be adjusted. Please kep your sodium less than 1,500 mg daily and do not drink more than 2L of fluid daily. \nWe wish you all the bestYour ___ Team. \n\n【39】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

As of now,hemodynamically stable and actively bleeding, so not a candidate for rate control or anticoagulation.\n\n【138】- no rate control\n\n【139】- monitor clinically\n\n【140】- will cautiously rate control if HR persistently >130's\n\n【141】- will obtain TTE to evaluate cardiac function i/s/o AF and shock state\n\n【142】#RLE swelling: patient with likely swelling due to fluid overload and low oncotic pressure, but with slight asymmetry R>L. Given his hypercoagulable state I/s/o active bleeding and cirrhosis, he is at risk for DVT. Could also be cellulitis.\n\n【143】- will order ___ \n\n【144】- abx as above\n\n【145】#Positive urine tox: positive for cocaine and opiates, unclear if opiates are due to what was given at OSH. Cocaine is likely not.\n\n【146】- will obtain further collateral when patient stabilizes\n\n【147】- SW consult likely from above\n\n【148】#Coagulopathy: likely due to liver disease - cirrhosis vs. alc hep - and potentially vitamin deficiency i/s/o malnutrition and ETOH abuse.

On hospital day 2 he was continued on the drip and underwent lower extremity arterial duplex which demonstrated patent right femoropopliteal and tibial vessels with monophasic flow throughout. All imaging was reviewed and it was decided to take the patient to the OR for an aorto-bifem bypass graft the following day. He was cleared for surgery by cardiology prior to the procedure. \n\n【16】He went to the OR on ___ for the bypass. For full details please see the dictated operative report. There was significant blood loss in the OR and the patient received 3 liters of crystalloid fluid, additional albumin, 3 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of FFP, 1 unit of platelets, and 1.4 L by cellsaver. The patient was transferred to the CVICU intubated. \nThe night of the procedure, the patient became increasingly hypotensive with increasing pressor requirement, increasing lactate, and increasing acidosis. In the morning of POD1, he underwent exploratory laparatomy. He was found to have bleeding from the proximal anastamosis which was controlled. He was heavily resuscitated with blood products. Following the procedure, his hematocrit was at 30 from a pre-op hematocrit of \n10. He was transferred back to the CVICU in stable condition. On POD0 and POD1 from the exploration, the patient was kept intubated and sedated. He remained hemodynamically stable, his hematocrit remained stable, and his acidosis normalized and his lactate trended down. \n\n【17】On POD2, the patient was extubated. Upon extubation, the patient experienced pulmonary edema and was maintained on O2 via facemask as he was diuresed. IV lasix was given for diuresis and the patient's respiratory status steadily improved. At the time of discharge, the patient's respiratory status was at baseline and he was saturating well on room air. From a vascular perspective, the patient improved dramatically following the procedure. On POD3, the patient had palpable DP pulses bilaterally. His feet were warm and well-perfused and the duskiness present on admission in his right toes improved throughout the remainder of his admission. The day prior to admission, the patient experienced an episode of narrow complex tachycardia in the 140s. He was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. He received one dose of 5 mg IV metoprolol and converted back into normal sinus rhythm. EKG following this episode was normal and the same as pre-op. He remained in normal sinus rhythm for the remainder of the admission. Upon discharge, his metoprolol was increased from 50 bid to 50 tid. \n\n【18】The biggest issue experienced following the re-operation was the patient's mental status. Upon extubation, the patient became extremely confused and agitated. Discussion with the patient's wife revealed an significant history of daily alcohol use,significantly more than disclosed by the patient preoperatively. \nHe was started on a CIWA scale with ativan for withdrawal. He was also started on haldol to control his confusion and agitation. On POD3, the patient's mental status slowly began to improve. However, he remained oriented to self at best with frequent agitation, especially at night. Therefore, psychiatry was consulted on POD5. Psychiatry recommended minimizing use of benzodiazapenes, increasing the haldol dose, and stressing reorientation techniques. On POD6, the patient's mental status began to improve more rapidly. He became alert and oriented x3. \nHe was seen by speech and swallow who cleared him for pureed diet with thickened liquids. He was transferred out of the ICU. \nOn POD7, the patient returned to his baseline mental status. He tolerated diet and was advanced to thin liquids and soft diet. \nHe ambulated well with ___. On POD8, he was discharged home with___ for home ___ and wound/pulse monitoring. He will follow-up in the clinic with Dr. ___ in 2 weeks for his post-op visit and staple removal. \n\n【19】Medications on Admission:\nMeds at time of discharge ___: \n- Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q4H:PRN pain- Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY- Atorvastatin 80 mg PO DAILY- Clopidogrel 75 mg PO DAILY- Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY- Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg PO BID- Enoxaparin Sodium 60 mg SC BID- OxycoDONE (Immediate Release) ___ mg PO Q4H:PRN pain- Warfarin 5 mg PO DAILY16- Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID Constipation \n\n【20】Discharge Medications:\n1.

He is to be treated for 10 days, last day ___. Etiology of cholangitis unlikely to be common bile duct obstruction, but more likely due to intrahepatic biliary obstruction in the setting of occluded portal vein and tumor involvement within the liver.\n\n【34】# Portal vein thrombus: new compared to last CT in ___. \nPrior to admission, patient was anticoagulated with warfarin for presumed portal vein thrombosis and history of DVT. As noted above, warfarin was discontinued on admission to allow INR to drift down to allow any intervention, if indicated, during ERCP,but then was held due to thrombocytopenia (this plan was confirmed with the patient's oncologist). Hepatology was consulted for consideration of TIPS, patient deemed not to be a candidate. \n\n【35】# Ascites: significant amount on presentation, and re-accumulated after paracentesis. No evidence of SBP, and chemistries suggested fluid was do to portal hypertension. \nSuspicion that occluded portal vein was primary contributor to ascites.

After 2 paracenteses (with quick accumulation of fluid after first drainage), patient was started on furosemide and spironolactone, which was uptitrated. His abdominal exam was stable for days at the time of discharge. If he has recurrent ascites, a peritoneal drain may be considered. He will follow up closely with his oncologist.\n\n【36】# Thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia: no evidence of hemolysis. Able to recover platelet count after last chemotherapy (___),thus low counts attributed to sepsis and disease progression. \nNeeded platelet transfusion around time of ERCP, and stabilized~50,000 thereafter. At the time of discharge, his platelet count was in the ___, hematocrit 26.\n\n【37】# Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: last received palliative chemotherapy in ___. Unable to receive additional therapy given recurrent cholangitis. Updated patient, family, PCP, and oncologist with concern that patient may not be able to receive additional palliative chemotherapy given ongoing cholangitis. \nHe is at this time full code. He will follow up closely with his oncologist after discharge.\n\n【38】INACTIVE ISSUES\n--------------# Diabetes: patient was placed on sliding scale insluin during his admission.

Pyridium for symptomatic relief. Antiemetics as needed. By hospital day 2 she endorsed mild symptomatic improvement and she was discharged on an oral cefpodox fr prelim UCx growing >100K CONS. \n Later that day, culture results/ sensitivities returned for the coag negative staph revealed resistence to PCN/ cephalosporins/flouroquinolones (she had failed outpt cipro X2 courses). Blood cultures remain negative. Patient was contacted, and a prescription for nitrofurantoin was called into her pharmacy. \nHowever, once again, given that the organism is CONS (unusual pathogen, however, not sure if her repeated cystoscopies place her at risk), we are concerned that she may have another process(?retained object vs endocardiits or another source). Once again, blood cx here were negative. She should have a repeat UA done 1 week after her Abx course is completed to see if she has persistant pyruia.

The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy. Confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities likely represent the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. \nThere is no evidence of fracture. A few ethmoid air cells are opacified and the left maxillary sinus is completely opacified,unchanged compared to the prior CT head examination. There is sclerosis of the walls of the left maxillary sinus which suggests chronicity. The cavernous portion of the internal carotid arteries and disTal right vertebral artery demonstrate atherosclerotic calcifications. The mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable. \n\n【27】IMPRESSION: \n\n【28】No acute intracranial process. Chronic findings as described above. \n\n【29】CXR ___\nIMPRESSION: \n\n【30】Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new since ___. \nModerate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe volume loss are stable since ___. \n\n【31】ECHO ___\nConclusions The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. \nThere is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = \n40-45%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\n【32】IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. RVH with borderline right ventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP and severe pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【33】Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,pulmonary pressures have further increased. There is more mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. \n\n【34】CTA HEAD & CTA NECK ___\n\n【35】IMPRESSION: \n\n【36】1. No evidence of dissection. \n2. Approximately 70% stenosis of the left proximal internal carotid artery and 60% stenosis of the right proximal internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria. \n3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the cavernous and supra clinoid segments of the internal carotid arteries,resulting in severe, multifocal stenoses. Patent anterior,middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. \n4. Two mm outpouching at the origin of the right superior cerebellar artery, likely representing an infundibulum. A small aneurysm cannot be excluded. Possible aneurysm identified at the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery as described above, measuring approximately 2.6 mm in transverse dimension. \n\n【37】MRI BRAIN ___\nIMPRESSION: \n1. No acute infarct or mass effect. \n2. Extensive cerebral white matter T2 FLAIR hyperintense foci,likely related to small vessel ischemic changes, with some progression compared to the prior study. Mild to moderate diffuse parenchymal volume loss without significant change. \n3. Tiny outpouching from the right middle cerebral artery division;intracranial arteries are better assessed on the same day CT angiogram study. \n4. Left maxillary sinus fluid/mucosal thickening/retention cyst. \n\n【38】5. Slightly hypointense marrow signal and degenerative changes in the cervical spine. \n\n【39】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ M w PMHx of DM2, CAD, HTN, and HLD who presented with two days of feeling \"off-balance.\" His exam was notable for some instability and symptomatic dizziness, joint proprioception, + Romberg sign. His orthostatic were negative. \nGiven that Mr. ___ is an older gentleman with clear vascular risk factors, evidence of prior infarcts on ___, an uncertain history, and no obvious alternative diagnosis, he was transferred to the neurology stroke service to r/o a TIA or CVA. \nOther alternatives, however, were \"cervical vertigo\" given his known history of cervical disc disease; autonomic neuropathy ___uring his hospitalization, Mr. ___ had persistent symptoms of lightheadedness, especially upon standing. He was hyponatremic (Na = 130) but this appears to be longstanding when checking his sodium level on previous admissions. He had difficulty walking without his cane. Had persistent Romberg sign and decreased joint proprioception. His imaging work-up included a CT head which was negative for acute bleed, chest x-ray which was negative for infiltrates w/ no concern of infectious etiology, ECHO was notable for mild LV systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral reguitation/tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension. CTA head/neck showed approximately 70% stenosis of the left proximal internal carotid and 60% stenosis of the right proximal internal cartery. A 2 mm outpouching at the origin of the right superior cerbellar artery was also noted, unable to exclude a small aneurysm. Finally, a MRI showed no abnormalities in the posterior circulation or findings concerning for stroke. Given persistent hyponatremia,he was given 1L NS fluids. Orthostatic signs were negative. His presumptive diagnosis of hypovolemic hyponatremia. At time of discharge, urine lytes were not concerning for dehydration or pathologic process. Prior to discharge worked with ___ noting appropriate ambulation. Pt was asymptomatic noting that lightheadedness subsided.

The patient says that he was in a normal state of health, and when he was trying to get from his bed into his wheelchair, he fell on the floor. He did not lose conciousness, and did not hit his head. While in the hospital, he did not have any episodes of falling, and ___ saw him and recommended that he go to rehab in order to improve his strength as he was unable to safely transition from bed to wheelchair on his own.\n\n【20】#Hypoxemia: The patient remained between around 95% on 2L Nasal cannula throughout the duration of his hospitalization, which is his baseline at Landmark. Upon his discharge he was satting 96%on 3 L. He endorsed no episodes of SOB or difficulty breathing.\n\n【21】___: On admission the patient's Creatinine was 2.3, which was slighly up from his former baseline around 1.6. During his hospitalization, he was diuresed with furosemide, and while he had good urine output in response to the furosemide, his creatinine continued to remain at approximately 2 - 2.2. This may be his new baseline creatinine, and he will follow-up in___ clinic for further management.\n\n【22】# Episode unresonsiveness: Patient with episode in ED were nursing concerned by patient somnolence. The episode was transient, and his neurologic exam was normal. He had a similar episode on his on the evening of his admissoin to the floor. He did not have any further episodes during his hospitalization. \nNeurology was consulted, and recommended checking the depakote levels, and toxicology screen, which were normal. They also reocmmended that he be considering for 24-hour EEG to assess him for seizure activity during sleep. The primary team felt that his episodes of somnolence are likely due to the patient's retention of CO2; he is a chronic COPD patient, who consistently on laboratory values has elevated bicarbonate, consistent with a metabolic alkalosis attemping to compensate for a long-term respiratory acidosis. He was instructed to make an outpatient appointment with neurology following rehabilitation if he continues to have episodes of decreased responsiveness.\n\n【23】#Lower extremity chronic venous stasis - patient has had these changes on previous admissions, and these were felt unlikely to be due ot DVTs, given the patient's home regimine of coumadin. \nConsult Wound care was consulted, and recommended that Lac-Hydrin lotion to the left lower shin daily. In additoin, the patient was started on Cipro 750 BID for 10 day course to treat left lower extremity cellulitis.\n\n【24】#Hyperkalemia - Patient has a history of hyperkalemia on admissions, but does not have any evidence of concerning changes on his admission EKG. His EKGs remained unchanged during his admission. His admit K was 5.7, and on discharge it was 4.8. We lowered his potassium using furosemide as well as kayakelte during his admission.\n\n【25】#PE - Patient has a history of PE. We kept his coumadin therapeutic (last INR was 2.5) by adjusting his dose of warfarin to 5 mg during his admission. He should have an INR checked on___. If stable, he can remain on the current dosage of coumadin and INR checked weekly or every other week. If coumadin needs further adjustment, INR should be checked twice weekly until stable at goal ___.\n\n【26】#RA - Continued on home medication (Hydroxychloroquine).\n\n【27】#HTN - Continued on home medication, including amlodipine,metoprolol.\n\n【28】#COPD - Continued oxygen and outpatient medical regimen,including Tiotropium Bromide, Albuterol, and fluticasone.\n\n【29】#Schizoaffective disorder - Continued outpatient medical regimen, including Divalproex Sodium, Oxcarbazepine, and Risperidone\n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\n1.

Ethics team recommended continuing treatment as long as not inhumane or causing suffering per the ___ \"Policy on Interventions that are Ineffective or Harmful.\" The recommendation was \"If at any time the responsible___ attending determines that a potential intervention -- such as attempting CPR in the event of cardiac arrest -- would \"cause likely suffering or other risk of harm that grossly outweighs any realistic medical benefit to the patient\", then the attending should enter a DNAR order in the medical record AND inform that daughter/HCP of that, and the reasons for it. If the daughter objects, then she has a right to a second opinion [from a physician not actively engaged in the patient's care.]\"Furthermore, \"If specific decisions need to be made for which it is not entirely clear from previous discussions with a health care proxy what the patient himself would want, then for the health care proxy to be involved s/he must be both able and willing to participate in discussions at least to the extent that would be expected of the patient if he were able to make his own decisions. If the health care proxy is unable or unwilling to do that, then she should be informed that in the absence of an appropriately-engaged proxy the clinical team will be required to consult the Ethics Support Service and possibly seek a court-appointed guardian.\"\n\n【55】Decision was made to make patient DNAR based on clinical decision making based on medical futility.

UE RAMs symmetric.\n\n【24】Discharge Exam:\nNeurologically intact\n\n【25】Pertinent Results:___ EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of mild intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region and a less well sustained alpha rhythm in the left temporo-occipital region. These findings are indicative of mild focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in origin,in the left temporal region and posterior quadrant. These findings are consistent with the known left temporal hemorrhage. \nNo epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.\n\n【26】___ EEG Read pending\n\n【27】___ EEG Read pending\n\n【28】___ MRI/A Brain\n1. Redemonstration of subdural and subarachnoid anterior medial temporal lobe hematoma, left convexity hemispheric subdural hematoma overlying is noted. Gradient echo susceptibility within the left medial temporal cortex indicates a component of parenchymal hemorrhage. Hemorrhage products layering along the falx and left tentorial leaflet is also identified. \n2. Asymmetric FLAIR hyperintense signal of left mesial temporal cortex, which also appears thickened, may be reactive/edema secondary to the hemorrhage. However its appearance does raise concern for underlying herpes encephalitis. Clinical correlation is recommended. \n3. There is a 2 mm focal outpouching of the right basilar tip,which may represent a aneurysm. \n4. An additional 2 mm outpouching of the proximal left M1 segment is noted, which likely represents a infundibulum however given the degree of motion degradation, a small aneurysm is not excluded. \n\n【29】MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ \n1. Left mesial temporal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage as well as left sided subdural hematoma is essentially unchanged in configuration from prior exam allowing for expected evolution. No new hemorrhages.The pattern of mesial temporal lobe hemorrhage is not typical for traumatic contusion. \n2. Unchanged 4 mm T2 hypointense focus adjacent to the left supra-clinoid ICA. Given its stability, this raises concern that this may represent an aneurysm with a neck that is beyond the resolution of MRI/MRA technique. If no aneurysm to explain hemorrhage, the possibility of an underlying vascular anomaly such as dural AVF would be additional diagnostic consideration. \n3. Recommend conventional cerebral angiogram when clinically feasible for further evaluation of the above findings. \n4. FLAIR hyperintense signal of the medial temporal lobe is again noted,without definitive underlying mass lesion. If there remains clinical concern, followup examination after resolution of the hemorrhage is recommended. \n\n【30】RECOMMENDATION(S): 1. Recommend conventional cerebral angiogram when clinically feasible for further evaluation of the above findings. \n2. If lack of vascular related cause for hemorrhage, followup MRI is recommended. \n\n【31】CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ \n1. Status post left frontal craniotomy with expected postoperative changes. \n2. New 4 mm rightward shift as well as effacement of the left lateral ventricle. \n3. No ventriculomegaly. No acute hemorrhage. \n4. Stable small edema within left temporal lobe. \n\n【32】CT Head ___:\nStatus post left frontal craniotomy with expected postoperative changes and pneumocephalus. No evidence of new hemorrhage or territorial infarction. Stable edema within the left temporal lobe. \n\n【33】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is ___ man with history of HTN and CKD, with a left medial temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with left SDH and SAH. No clinically significant aneurysm found, no reported history of trauma. Etiology of hemorrhage is unclear at this time.\n\n【34】# NEURO: The patient was initially admitted to the NeuroICU. \nHome ASA was held. MRI brain showed L posteromedial temporal lobe hemorrhage, with left convexal and parasylvian SDH and small amount of parasylvian SAH. MRA brain (time of flight, due to CKD) showed ?infundibulum at tip of basilar and question infundibulum in left M1, but no concern for clear aneurysm on formal neurorads review. Given the location of hemorrhage, there was question of traumatic IPH with subdural and subarachnoid component, but he denied any fall and had no evidence of head trauma on imaging (e.g. tissue/subgaleal hematoma). Angiogram was discussed but since would be atypical to have large IPH and SDH with aneurysm, and since has stage 4 CKD, it was deferred in ICU. \n\n【35】Given the location of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there was initial concern for HSV and the patient was started on empiric acyclovir. However, CSF HSV returned negative and Acyclovir was stopped. In the ICU he was initially quite confused so had EEG to rule out seizures, which was negative. He was then transferred to the floor, where he intermittently complained of\"burning smell\" concerning for temporal lobe seizures. Repeat cvEEG was mostly obscured by artifact (including events of burning smell, which were captured) but suspicion was high based on clinical presentation and temporal lobe lesion so he was started on LAC 200mg IV bolus, then 100mg BID. Can be uptitrated to 150mg TID if seizures continue (max dose for renal failure). \n\n【36】On HD #7, a repeat MRI was performed to assess for underlying lesions with some resolution of the bleed. Review of the imaging showed a flow void on T2 in the distal left ICA concerning for an aneurysm. Patient was urgently transferred to the Neuro ICU for monitoring, with plan to perform open craniectomy and aneurysm clipping on HD #8 (no angiogram due to renal status). \n\n【37】# RENAL: The patient has a history of CKD with Cr 3.5 on admission, which trended up after acyclovir administration. \nNephrotoxins were subsequently held and the Cr was trended daily.\n\n【38】# ___: The patient was monitored by telemetry, with a goal SBP < \n160. He was slowly restarted on his home antihypertensives(labetalol, amlodipine, hydralazine, isosorbide), but did initially require a nicardipine gtt on admission.\n\n【39】TRANSITIONS OF CARE:\nPatient was transferred to neurosurgery on ___ and taken to the OR for a L craniotomy for clipping of L PCOM aneurysm. He was hypertensive post op and was started on a nicardipine gtt. He had a severe headache, but head CT showed no acute hemorrhage and expected post op changes. He was started on ceftriaxone 1g QD for a positive UTI. \n\n【40】On ___, patient remained on nicardipine gtt, but was neurologically intact. On ___, he was started on PO medications and renal was consulted for further management of hypertension. \nHis decadron was tappered and ___ was consulted. \n\n【41】On ___, patient was intact. His aline and blood pressure cuff had different readings. The aline was removed and nicardipine was discontinued. He was transferred to the floor in stable condition. ___ was consulted. \n\n【42】On ___ Patient was re-evaluated by OT who cleared patient for home with direct supervision. ___ consult was pending. \n\n【43】On ___ Mr. ___ remains neurologically intact and continues on the dexamethasone taper. Renal has been following due to his history of CKD (baseline Cr 3.5), with a current stable Cr of 3.1. Mr. ___ continues to increase up to \n5.7 and was treated with kayexalate 30gm PO per renal recommendation and will continue to trend electrolytes. Repeat K was 5.0\n\n【44】On ___ He was neurologically stable and was mobilizing.

Elevated lipase on exam concerning for possible acute pancreatitis and pt with ETOH 2 weeks ago. She also has family h.o of pancreatic related concerns. However, clinically a picture of acute pancreatitis did not fit. She was treated for acute pancreatitis with IVF/NPO initially. By the following day, her lipase had decreased. \nHowever, Given recent IUD placement, polypectomy and prior complicated abdominal surgical history elected to perform further studies other than RUQ u/s. She had an MRCP that showed some pancreatic IPMNs and some non-specific edema in the r.lower chest. This prompted a CT of the torso to further evaluate her reports of abdominal pain. In addition, the evening after MRI,pt reported CP/SOB which was transient. In this setting, she was noted to have discordant BP's in her ARMS raising concern for an acute chest process. However, see below, CTA chest, CXR, EKG and troponins were unrevealing. CT revealed a small non-displaced R.sided 10th rib fracture which likely explains pt's RUQ/flank pain. After PO contrast, pt reported continued inability desire to advance her diet. She was reassumed that her labs and imaging did not reveal any acute abdominal pathology that would be a contraindication to advancing her diet. Pt felt that eating may increase her R.sided pain. However, she was seen ambulating and appearing comfortable during admission. She was discharged with a plan to take Tylenol as needed for pain. Narcotics were given during admission but avoided on discharge given pt's history of ETOH intake. Narcotics were not given during the day on day of DC.\n\n【25】#chest pain-see above, transient.

Underlying infection and volume depletion likely caused recrudescence of deficits from prior CVA that improved with treatment of diarrhea and volume depletion. Patient's TSH and cortisol within normal limits. With IV fluid rehydration and improvement in diarrhea patient's weakness improved. She was evaluated by physical therapy who recommended that patient use walker and continue to work with physical therapy at home upon discharge. \n\n【48】#Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia. New onset without neutropenia. \nPatient's WBC and platelets downtrended during admission. \nHematology/oncology was consulted and evaluated patient's blood smear which was without abnormal cells. Patient's hydroxyurea for CMML was discontinued with improvement in white blood cell count and platelet count to suggest medication effect as underlying cause. Additionally consider viral etiology, or secondary to recent initiation of plavix however given improvement with discontinuing hydroxyurea this was most likely etiology. \n\n【49】 #Transaminitis: Patient with diarrhea, elevated AST, ALT, Alk phos with normal T bili consistent with hepatocellular injury with preserved synthetic function. Suspect secondary to infection or possibly related to volume depletion and hypotension. LFTs downtending at discharge, recommend repeat LFTs and further work up if persistently abnormal. \n\n【50】CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:\n\n【51】# Recent CVA: Previously presented with fluctuating alertness,inattention, dysarthria, R gaze deviation, L weakness, L sensory deficit, L hemineglect. Patient initially had left lower extremity weakness on presentation that improved with IV fluids and resolution of diarrhea. Monitored patient closely with serial neurologic exams and continued home gabapentin 100mg PO qhs for paresthesias.\n\n【52】# CAD s/p NSTEMI with recent BMS ___. Patient did not have chest pain on presentation or during admission, EKG with persistent twi in V2-V4 with troponin 0.03x2 therefore no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Continued home aspirin and plavix.\n\n【53】# Type 2 diabetes. HbA1c in ___, on metformin and glimepiride at home. Patient monitored with QID fingersticks and humalog sliding scale insulin while in patient. Resumed metformin and glimepiride on discharge and advised patient not to take glimepiride if she is not feeling well or not eating to avoid hypoglycemia.\n\n【54】# ADHD: On recent admission, ritalin discontinued ___ ischemic heart disease. Not currently on any medication as outpatient. \n\n【55】# Hypothyroidism: Not on therapy. TSH within normal limits this admission.\n\n【56】# Asthma/COPD: Continued home albuterol prn, Advair BID.\n\n【57】# GERD: Changed home esomeprazole to pantoprazole based on interaction with plavix.\n\n【58】# CMML: Discontinued hydroxyurea as may likely cause of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Patient will follow up with outpatient provider ___ who is aware of admission and medication changes. \n\n【59】# Psych: Continued home lorazepam and mirtazapine.\n\n【60】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:.\n\n【61】 Diarrhea: If persistent, consider further GI evaluation,colonoscopy. Patient needs repeat electrolytes ___, please monitor potassium and magnesium with diarrhea.\n\n【62】 Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia: Hydroxyurea discontinued per hematology/oncology consultant recommendations. Repeat CBC___ to be sent to Dr. ___ on dc 4.4k with ANC 1452, plts 112k)\n\n【63】 Transaminitis: Patient with evidence of acute hepatocellular injury with elevated AST, ALT, Alk phos.

Neutropenic fever, most likely ___ health care associated pneumonia. On admission, his calculated neutrophil was found to be 188. Patient had significant SOB and tachypnea on presentation. There was initial concern of infected hematoma at the Port-a-cath site given recent admission, but area were without signs of infection. He was not bacteremic by culture result. There was no urinary or GI symptoms or signs. Patient was initially started on vancomycin and aztreonam on ___ then with addition of levofloxacin on ___ for atypical coverage. CT chest revealed multifocal pneumonia. Pulmonary was consulted for possible need for bronchoscopy, but was deferred based on location and patient's informed preference. He received total of 2 days of micafungin given his initial respiratory status,low ANC, and concern for possible fungal infection. He was r/o'ed for common viral infections. He remained afebrile after Hospital Day 1. Antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only on ___. He was discharged on oral levofloxacin for a total of 10 days course to be completed on ___.\n\n【23】#. COPD exacerbation, likely ___ HCAP. He was started on antibiotics (see above) and his prior prednisone taper at 10 mg was increased to 20 mg. He was placed on standing albuterol. \nHis Advair was increased to 500/50 per pulmonary recommendation. \n Spiriva was not tried while in the hospital given acute illness. However, with underlying COPD, it should be re-considered but will require close monitoring given his allergy profile (hives with ipratropium). His taper to 10 mg prednisone daily starts on ___. He was instructed to take 10 mg for 2 days each and 5 mg for 2 days eaech and then stop. He was instructed to take Advair 500/50 for another week before going down to home Advair dose of 250/50. This should be followed closely. He will likely need to have routine PFT done and may need to have O2 supplement if ambulatory O2Sat < 88%. \nHe may also benefit from pulmonary rehab. \n\n【24】#. AMS/AML. He was Day + 35 of azacitidine on admission. His counts were monitored closely. His initial differential showed 18% blasts and 4% others, concerning for persistent disease. \nHowever, he did recently receive Neupogen in his last admission. \n Risk and benefits were weighed. He received 2 doses of Neupogen while in the hospital given his neutropenic fever and HCAP. He also received transfusions to support his counts. He will need close follow-up with his primary oncologist regarding the plan for his AML. \n\n【25】#. Insomnia. Chronic. Patient was on Ativan for sleep at home.

On presentation to___, her urinalysis revealed proteinuria, pyuria, 1+bacteria, and +leukocyte esterase, prompting treatment with ceftriaxone. She was noted to be agitation on arrival, and was physically and chemically (with haloperidol and olanzapine)restrained.\n\n【9】During her admission, her mental status did not improve with treatment of her suspected UTI (with follow-up cultures negative), and was punctuated by episodes of unresponsiveness to verbal commands (typically during sleep) with eyes open. She was evaluated with a brain MRI on ___ that demonstrated restricted diffusion in the right temporal and inferior frontal lobes concerning for HSV encephalitis; Ms. ___ was accordingly placed on acyclovir for management. In consultation with Neurology, an extensive laboratory evaluation was also performed (detailed below). Despite these interventions, Ms. \n___ continued to experience episodes of unresponsiveness as well as episodes in which she was noted to ambulate and feed herself independently. As a result, a repeat MRI was performed on ___ that demonstrated progression of diffusion restriction now also involving the left frontal, left parietal, and left temporal lobes. Having noted the absence of headache, clear seizures, epileptiform activity on EEG,leukocytosis, or CSF pleocytosis, the ___ Neurology team expressed doubt regarding the presumed diagnosis of HSV encephalitis, instead noting correlation of her behavioral withdrawal with administration of antipsychotics for agitation. \nAccordingly, transfer to ___ was recommended for further evaluation.\n\n【10】Prior to her admission at ___, Ms. ___ was reportedly diagnosed with dementia in ___ after symptoms of memory loss, repetitive questions, and difficulty managing her finances. She had little improvement with donepezil, which was also not well-tolerated at higher doses and subsequently discontinued. Over the preceding six months, she had needed assistance from coworkers to punch in for work or identify fruits.\n\n【11】On arrival to ___, Ms. ___ was awake but not responsive, not following commands or providing a history to the examiner. \n\n【12】Past Medical History:\nAlzheimer's dementia Hypertension\n\n【13】Social History:___\nFamily History:\nUnknown\n\n【14】Physical Exam:\nON ADMISSION.\n\n【15】Vitals: T: 99.6 P: 73 R: 25 BP: 154/84 SpO2: 98% RA General: Awake, unresponsive, in NAD HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted Neck: Supple, no nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: No tachypnea or increased WOB Cardiac: Warm, well-perfused Abdomen: Soft, ND Extremities: No ___ edema Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.\n\n【16】Neurologic:\n\n【17】-Mental Status: Awake with eyes open but not responding to voiceoccasionally makes purposeful movements, such as wiping mouthbut no semi-purposeful movements noted.

Otherwise, the remainder of the examination is mildly motion degraded. Within this confines: \nWhen compared to prior examination of ___, there is interval improvement in degree of cortical thickening and FLAIR/diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal involving the left frontal lobe, with persistent abnormality involving the right greater than left temporal lobes, bilateral temporal parietal lobes, which appears slightly more prominent when compared to prior exam. There are superimposed mild periventricular and subcortical punctate T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensities, which are nonspecific,but compatible with chronic microangiopathy in a patient of this age. There is a partial empty sella. No definite postcontrast enhancement on motion degraded examination. No acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. The major intracranial flow voids are preserved. There is mild mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses. The orbits are unremarkable. No significant fluid signal is seen the mastoid air cells. \n\n【29】IMPRESSION: \n1. Diffuse cortical thickening and FLAIR/diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal, predominantly involving the bilateral temporal parietal lobes, some which appears slightly more prominent when compared to prior exam. However, there is interval improvement in degree of cortical thickening and FLAIR/diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal in the left frontal lobe compared to examination of ___. \n2. Given extensive involvement of the bilateral temporal lobes,and apparent responsiveness to steroids, this could represent autoimmune encephalitis. Differential consideration such as CJD is considered much less likely given overall improvement of the left frontal lobe. \n3. No acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. \n4. Additional findings as described above. \n\n【30】CT CHEST:\n1. Isolated enlargement of a right lower paratracheal node measuring 1.8 x 1.6 cm, for which continued follow-up is recommended with at least a repeat chest CT in 3 months. \n2. No suspicious pulmonary nodular opacities are identified. \n\n【31】CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:\n1. Slight prominence in the region of the endometrial cavity measuring up to 0.8 cm, which can be seen in the setting of cervical stenosis. However, nonurgent pelvic ultrasound recommended to exclude underlying endometrial lesion. \n2. Otherwise no evidence of abdominopelvic malignancy or lymphadenopathy. \n\n【32】PELVIC ULTRASOUND:\n1. No evidence of pelvic abnormality on transabdominal pelvic ultrasound. \nHomogeneous endometrium measuring 6 mm. \n2. Ovaries not visualized, however no gross adnexal abnormality identified. \n\n【33】EEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal continuous video EEG study. There are continuous independent periodic discharges from the left frontal region and left occipital region. There are also independent and intermittent runs of periodic discharges from the right occipital region. The most consistent periodic discharges occur in the left occipital region, while the periodic discharges in the right occipital and left frontal region are more intermittent and appear improved compared to previous day. These findings Suggest multiple areas of highly epileptogenic cortex with a high propensity to develop electrographic seizures. There is marked attenuation of activity over the entire left hemisphere, indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction. Diffuse Background slowing is consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy, which is nonspecific with regards etiology but can be seen in the setting of toxic/metabolic derangements,infection, anoxia, and medication effect. There are no pushbutton activations on this study. There are no electrographic seizures during this recording. Compared to the previous days' recording, there is no significant change. \n\n【34】LABS:___ 05:10AM BLOOD WBC-7.7 RBC-4.05 Hgb-11.3 Hct-36.0 MCV-89 MCH-27.9 MCHC-31.4* RDW-16.1* RDWSD-50.9* Plt ___\n___ 05:10AM BLOOD Glucose-151* UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-140 K-4.2 Cl-100 HCO3-28 AnGap-12\n___ 05:10AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.2\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD Ammonia-64___ 06:22AM BLOOD PTH-35\n___ 06:00AM BLOOD 25VitD-15___ 07:10PM BLOOD ___\n\n【35】Serum\n*Ammonia: on ___: 26 and on ___: 64\n*PTH-35\n*T4\n*TSH w/ reflex to FT4: 2.41VitB12: ___\nFolate: 5.7 (ref: 4.8-37.3)\n*25VitD: 15\n*Vitamin ___ Dihydroxy:41 (ref: ___\n*METHYLMALONIC ACID: 141\n\n【36】*CRP: <0.3\n*ESR: 25\n___: negative\n*DNA double strand Ab: <1\n*PTHrP: 11 (ref: ___\n*Autoimmune Encephalopathy Panel: Negative\n*Angiotensin-1-Converting Enzyme: 71 on ___ and 51 on___. \n*Ceruloplasmin: 33 (ref: ___*IgA: 258\n*IgM: 51\n*Protein Electrophoresis: No M spike detected\n*Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Ab: <1.0 for both myeloprox Ab and Proteinase-3 Ab\n\n【37】*Lactic Acid: 0.8\n*Lyme: 0.03\n*RPR: negative\n*Influenza A/B/RSV: Negative\n*HepB Surg antigen: Non-reactive\n*HepC Ab: Non-reactive\n*HIV: negative\n\n【38】*Negative Serum Toxic Screen : ACETA, EtOH, SAL\n\n【39】CSF\n*Color: Tube#1: Pink & Tube#2: Colorless\n*WBC: Tube#1: 6 and Tube#4: 6 (ref ___. \n*RBC: Tube#1: 1298 and Tube#4: 102 (ref: ___. \n*Gram Stain: No organisms seen and no growth in 3days\n*Albumin: 18.5mg/dL\n*Glucose: 84\n*Protein: 35\n*IgG: 3.7mg/dL\n*IgG Index: 0.75 (ref: 0.66); (*evidence of increased synthesis of IgG provides support for the diagnosis of MS). \n*Synthesis Rate IgG: 3.9mg/24h (ref: -9.9 to 3.3). \n*PCR for HSV 1 and 2: negative\n___ protein: negative\n*Oligoclonal Bands: negative (The patient's CSF contains 4 well defined gamma restriction bands that are also present in the patient's corresponding serum sample, but some bands in the CSF are more prominent.

She was initially treated at ___, where she received many doses of antipsychotics for agitation. MRI obtained at ___ showed diffuse areas of cortical diffusion restriction, prompting a transfer to ___.\n\n【41】Given these MRI changes, there was concern initially for___ disease, seizure, autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis. She was monitored on continuous EEG. This showed frequent, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges but no overt seizures. Still, given these findings and her history of waxing and waning levels of alertness, the decision was made to treat with anti-epileptics. She was started on Levetiracetam,which was titrated to a dose of 1500mg twice daily. \n\n【42】Although there was concern for CJD initially, repeat MRI ___ in fact shows significant resolution of the diffusion changes on previous MRI. This seemed less likely to be secondary to CJD. \nShe has improved clinically after Keppra, again supporting seizures as the primary driver of her encephalopathy and MRI changes. \n\n【43】Given the concern for autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis,she was treated empirically with 5 days of IV methylprednisolone. An autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalopathy panel was sent from the ___ and was pending at the time of discharge. She also had a CT torso to look for any primary malignancy, but did not show any. \n\n【44】After treatment with Keppra and Methylprednisolone, her mental status slowly improved. Whereas she was initially somnolent and not interactive in any meaningful way, she was later able to make eye contact, track the examiner, and say ___. She did not follow any commands or produce any other language. \n\n【45】As above, repeat MRI on ___ showed significant improvement of her prior MRI changes, after treatment with Keppra and steroids. \nThus it is felt that seizures are most likely to explain her waxing and waning alertness, as well as the MRI changes. The large quantities of antipsychotics she received at ___ are also likely responsible to some degree. An autoimmune or paraneoplastic process is still possible, though in the absence of a specific identifiable antibody, this diagnosis is more difficult to make. \n\n【46】Transitional issues: \n-f/u with neuro-continue on Keppra \n\n【47】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were initially at another hospital, where an MRI showed some changes on the surface of your brain.\n\n【56】In the hospital, we did several tests. You already had a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) done at ___. This did now show any evidence of infection. We also monitored you on EEG (brain wave test). This did not show seizure, but did suggest that your brain may be at risk for seizures, so we started a medicine called Keppra to prevent seizures. Finally, we treated you with steroids in case there was an autoimmune condition causing your changes. After this, we repeated an MRI, which looked much better than before.\n\n【57】When you leave the hospital, you will go to rehab to improve. It was a pleasure taking care of you. \n\n【58】Sincerely,Your ___ team\n\n【59】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Patient with elevated bicarbonate in the setting of emesis and NG Tube output and loosing H+. Emesis also caused patient to loose K+ and Na+causing the kidneys to attempt to keep fluids leading to bicarb reasorption. Finally diuresis and contraction alkalosis also added to worsening bicarb. Patient was given fluids briefly (1L NS, with hesitancy given history of dCHF and being fluid overloaded already) but also diuresed with acetazolamide.\n\n【41】# Chron's disease:\nOn prednisone taper and Vedolizumab infusions q8 weeks, missed last infusion on ___, so received infusion during last two admission on ___\n\n【42】# Pain management: While patietn was NPO with NGT, pain controlled with IV dilaudid 0.5mg-1mg every 4 hours.

There is a very mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. \nThere is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n【20】US ___\nThere are moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta but no evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. The abdominal aorta measures about 1.4 cm at its mid section. The aortic bifurcation is normal. \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\n【21】CT ABD/PELVIS (no contrast) ___\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Anasarca. \n2. Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions. \n3. Left kidney cyst, no evidence of hydronephrosis. \n4. Extensive diverticulosis without diverticulitis. \n5.

There is deformity of the humeral head with large medial spurs and narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. There are cystic changes within the humeral head suggesting old trauma with superimposed degenerative change. No acute fracture is demonstrated. There are no findings suggestive of dislocation; however, if this is suspected clinically, additional views would be indicated.\n\n【23】RUE US ___: Superficial thrombus in the right cephalic vein. \nNo right upper extremity DVT.\n\n【24】Brief Hospital Course:___ female with PMH of HTN, HL, prior upper GI bleed, and diverticulosis presents now s/p unwitnessed fall at home brought in by ambulance after a call by a family member concern about her safety and found to have hypothermia, bandemia, ___,elevated CK, and hypoglycemia.\n\n【25】#. Hypotension: The patient presented in the ED with profound hypovolemia after being found down for an unclear period of time, but was normotensive. The patient was hypothermic and exhibited a left shift (2% band and 92% polys) in the ED. Blood cultures were obtained, but were negative. A UA revealed 32 hyaline casts, but also many epithelial cells. A urine culture obtained in the ED grew skin flora. A repeat cath UA (obtained in the MICU) revealed WBC-11, a few bacteria, but urine cultures were unable to be obtained because the lab did not receive sufficient quantity of urine. Her subsequent urine cultures have been negative.\n\n【26】The patient was volume resuscitated with 6L of NS in the ED. On arrive to the ICU, the patient became hypotensive to the 60/30___. An additional 1L bolus was given, a R triple lumen CVL was placed, norepinephrine gtt was started to maintain MAP>60. \nEmpiric antibiotics were started - vancomycin and zosyn with renal dosing. The patient had multiple sources of infection including a UTI vs. translocation of skin flora from 2 large unstagable ulcers located on her sacrum and on her L scapula,however, we had no positive cultures.

The patient presented with a Cr 2.3 which down-trended to her baseline of around 0.8 after 7L of NS. \n Etiology likely ___ prerenal ischemia especially given significant improvement with IVF. Despite initial CK elevation to the 1200's, no evidence of rhabdomyolysis based on sedmient which would have contributed to renal dysfunction. Based on her initial BUN of 95, the patient has likely being hypovolemia and in renal failure for multiple days prior to her presentation. \nAll medication were renally dosed. Her Cr remained stable on the floor.\n\n【29】# GIB- There was initial concern for GIB given a pos guiaic in the ED and in the mICU and HCT drop from 38 to 31 over 8 hours. \nThis HCT drop was in the setting of 6L of fluid resuscitation. \nThe HCT remained stable, but below her prior baseline of around 38-40. There was also a concern for AAA given a abdominal palpable mass, HCT drop and hypotension. A CTA and ultrasound of the Abdominal Aorta was negative for a AAA. The patient had no episodes of bleeding while on the floor. Her Hct remained low, but stable. Iron studies were consistent with an inflammatory anemia, negative for hemolysis, and an appropriate reticulocyte count.\n\n【30】#. Fall- The patient has had 2 prior falls- in ___ and ___. \nThe cause of those falls were deemed to be mechanical. The etiology of this 'fall' was unclear given the patient was found down without a clear memory of the 'fall'. She had fecal material on her clothing. A CT head and C-spine in the ED was negative. She developed pain in her right arm, but did not recall if she fell on to it. X-rays were negative for fractures. Social work and case management was involved to evaluate better options for her home situation. The patient will be discharged to rehab.\n\n【31】# Superficial RUE clot: The patient had unilateral right upper extremity swelling. Xrays of the arm were negative. An UE US showed a superficial cephalic clot. This was treated with elevation and compresses.\n\n【32】# Unstageable ulcers: The patient has skin breakdown on her back and sacrum, likely from immobilization. Wound care was consulted and performed dressing changes. The patient will continue dressing changes at rehab.\n\n【33】# Fungal groin infection: The patient has probable dermatophytic infection of intertriginous groin area. The patient will continue Micaconazole powder to area three times a day.\n\n【34】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: The patient's platelet count was 100K on admission and this trended down slightly. We attributed this to a possible medication effect and think that this should improve after discharge. We have ordered a CBC to be ordered on ___at rehab and then another CBC should be drawn at her first PCP___. These results will be followed up by her PCP.\n\n【35】Medications on Admission:\nMVI Vitamin D\n\n【36】Discharge Medications:\n1. Vitamin D Oral\n2.

We also placed stents in the branch arteries to the kidneys and intestine as the aneurysm had weakened as well. To perform this procedure,small punctures were made in the arteries on both sides of your groin. You tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the hospital. Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery.\n\n【22】Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Discharge Instructions\n\n【23】PLEASE NOTE: After endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), it is very important to have regular appointments (every ___ months) for the rest of your life. These appointments will include a CT(CAT) scan and/or ultrasound of your graft. If you miss an appointment, please call to reschedule. \n\n【24】WHAT TO EXPECT:\nBruising, tenderness, and a sensation of fullness at the groin puncture sites (or incisions) is normal and will go away in one-two weeks\n\n【25】CARE OF THE GROIN PUNCTURE SITES:\nIt is normal to have mild swelling, a small bruise, or small amounts of drainage at the groin puncture sites. In two weeks,you may feel a small, painless, pea sized knot at the puncture sites. This too is normal. Male patients may notice swelling in the scrotum. The swelling will get better over one-two weeksLook at the area daily to see if there are any changes. Be sure to report signs of infection. These include: increasing redness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage that is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more. (If you have taken aspirin, Tylenol, or other fever reducing medicine, wait at least ___ hours after taking it before you check your temperature in order to get an accurate reading.)\nFOR SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or incision)\nIf you have sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either of the groin puncture sites: \n-Lie down, keep leg straight and apply (or have someone apply)firm pressure to area for ___ minutes with a gauze pad or clean cloth. \n-Once bleeding has stopped, call your surgeon to report what happened. \n-If bleeding does not stop, call ___ for transfer to closest Emergency Room. \nYou may shower 48 hours after surgery. Let the soapy water run over the puncture sites, then rinse and pat dry. Do not rub these sites and do not apply cream, lotion, ointment or powder. \nWear loose-fitting pants and clothing as this will be less irritating to the groin puncture sites. \n\n【26】MEDICATIONS Take aspirin daily. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that could form in your repaired artery. Take Plavix for the next month only for the kidney and intestine stents. \nIt is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or other blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless the surgeon who repaired your aneurysm tells you it is okay to stop. Do not stop taking them, even if another doctor or nurse tells you to, without getting an okay from the surgeon who first prescribed them. \nYou will be given prescriptions for any new medication started during your hospital stayBefore you go home, your nurse ___ give you information about new medication and will review all the medications you should take at home. Be sure to ask any questions you may have. If something you normally take or may take is not on the list you receive from the nurse, please ask if it is okay to take it. \n\n【27】PAIN MANAGEMENT Most patients do not have much pain following this procedure. \n Your puncture sites may be a little sore. This will improve daily. If it is getting worse, please let us knowYou will be given instructions about taking pain medicine if you need it.\n\n【28】ACTIVITY You must limit activity to protect the puncture sites in your groin. For ONE WEEK:\n-Do not drive\n-Do not swim, take a tub bath or go in a Jacuzzi or hot tub\n-Do not lift, push, pull or carry anything heavier than five pounds\n-Do not do any exercise or activity that causes you to hold your breath or bear down with your abdominal muscles-Do not resume sexual activity Discuss with your surgeon when you may return to other regular activities, including work. If needed, we will give you a letter for your workplace. \nIt is normal to feel weak and tired. This can last six-eight weeks, but should get better day by day. You may want to have help around the house during this time___ push yourself too hard during your recovery. Rest when you feel tired. Gradually return to normal activities over the next monthWe encourage you to walk regularly. Walking, especially outdoors in good weather is the best exercise for circulation. \nWalk short distances at first, even in the house, then do a little more each dayIt is okay to climb stairs. You may need to climb them slowly and pause after every few steps. \n\n【29】DIET It is normal to have a decreased appetite. Your appetite will return over timeFollow a well balance, heart-healthy diet, with moderate restriction of salt and fat. \nEat small, frequent meals with nutritious food options (high fiber, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables) to maintain your strength and to help with wound healing.\n\n【30】BOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION You should be able to pass urine without difficulty. Call you doctor if you have any problems urinating, such as burning,pain, bleeding, going too often, or having trouble urinating or starting the flow of urine. Call if you have a decrease in the amount of urine. \nYou may experience some constipation after surgery because of pain medicine and changes in activity. Increasing fluids and fiber in your diet and staying active can help. To relief constipation, you may talk a mild laxative. Please take to your pharmacist for advice about what to take. \nSMOKING If you smoke, it is very important that you STOP. Research shows smoking makes vascular disease worse. This could increase the chance of a blockage in your new graft. Talk to your primary care physician about ways to quit smoking. \n\n【31】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He is not currently in pain and has not vomited in ED. He reports he has not been eating anything due to theories about his GI problems which he feels no one can solve. He has some bizarre ideas about what is causing his illness, including toxins of some sort to religious theories\n(he says if he tells me what the reasons are, '\"You'll just write that I'm hyperreligious\".) He denies that anyone is poisoning him or intentionally trying to harm him, although he does describe belief that medical people in general are not understanding or believing him. He is very fixated on the color of his urine being cause of illness (it is strikingly dark,likely as result of his dehydration). Mother confirms very minimal po x several days. Recent medical w/u has been negative, as is w/u here in the ED. Patient acknowledges feeling hopeless that anything will ever get better. He describes a shorter fuse than usual. He denies feeling so discouraged he wants to die. However, pt's Mother notes he has not returned to baseline since discharge from psychiatric unit in the ___; he has been off meds for that time for unclear reasons; appears that at least part of reasoning is that he believes they worsen his abdominal sx and that he feel sedated at current doses. Pt and mother both describe him as increasing irritable and labile at home. Pt's mother reports that he has been hitting the counter and walls with his fists, and that in the last 24 -48 hrs he stated he needed to go to the mental hospital, needed help, and that he couldn't take anymore. She also notes she felt very frightened that he would hurt her or possibly her baby granddaughter when he got very angry at family members and became threatening. Mother reports that he looks\"like a different person when he is taking the medications\". He is not suicidal or homicidal at present and has no AH or VH. \nPatient and mother are not able to answer most of my questions about specific sx of mania such as pressured speech, racing thoughts, hypersexuallity, increased risk taking behaviors. \nPatient describes getting pulled off plane coming back from hilippines as due to his nausea/ vomiting/ being sick ( as per BEST, in fact was altered mental status likely mania).

GI specialist Dr. ___ and PCP ______ were also contacted for further information. GI workup was requested from outside hospitals ___, ___, ___but little received. His father at one point reported that___ had been diagnosed at ___ with ODD,conduct disorder and ADHD but no records to that effect were received. His father also reported that the pt was incoherent and disorganized on returning from ___ in ___ he had to be taken directly from ___ to ___ by police/EMS.\n\n【15】He presented with depressed mood, somatic delusions of tremendous intensity almost to the point of meeting criteria for schizophrenia, and apparent disintegration of thought. Over time and with further observation, his delusions became more clear and a primary psychotic disorder was thought to be more likely than an affective one. This was corroborated after a trial of zoloft was ineffective. Gross cognitive function was preserved. Zyprexa was started and uptitrated to 10mg QHS, then continued in light of the longstanding delusion and apparent benefit to the patient's insomnia. Stelazine was started then discontinued when little benefit was shown. PO fluphenazine was started, taken inconsistently, and paired with IM decanoate fluphenazine which the patient was willing to take with encouragement from staff. He remained guarded and resistant to psych testing per ___, PhD. He did occasionally complain about ongoing GI upset/pain, vomiting, malodorous urine, and poor PO intake but repeated blood and urine tests were unremarkable. He was placed on a lactose-free diet, per his report of lactose deficiency, but was observed to not be following this. In after receiving a total of 3 doses of IM fluphenazine but began to refuse. Next dose is due ___, but he is not willing to take it.\n\n【16】Pt was unwilling to accept the report that there was little to no acute pathology found after multiple GI workups at various teaching ___, and consequently ridiculed staff for suggesting that his diagnosis was psychosomatic rather than organic. He was reminded of his positive H. pylori test but declined triple therapy for this condition after repeated discussion of risks and benefits. He continued to say that he thought he was going to die from undiagnosed abdominal illness. \nHe spent his days on the unit socializing with peers,occasionally attending groups, and often spending several hours in bed in the afternoons.\n\n【17】Multiple contentious family meetings were held and it became clear that safety at home was a major concern - in particular,he had been physically aggressive with his mother, and his baby nephew was now also in the care of his mother. Pt's family was not willing to consider having the pt return home. D___application was filed and was accepted. Possible step-down placement was offered, but pt refused. Intermediate care application was completed since no other acceptable disposition could be found. Pt was accepted to ___ with possible subsequent transition to residential placement or intermediate care. \n\n【18】3) Medical: See above. GI consult was called with no acute process found; breath test for bacterial overgrowth remains pending, and will be completed as an outpatient. The pt repeatedly c/o stomach pain and urinary difficulties such as malodorous urine and nausea/vomiting which were unable to be corroborated by staff/RN reports; multiple blood and urine tests to follow this up were negative.\n\n【19】4) Social: The patient participated in occasional groups, and was appropriate and interactive in the milieu.\n\n【20】Attending Addendum :\nOverall the prognosis for ___ remains guarded. His delusions about his illness are best treated by NOT challanging them. He,however, has been able to hear and accept that his sadness and rage is valid and may require treatment. He fights for control and often will accept one out of two propositions (Such as accepting Zyprexa and refusing Prolixin).\n\n【21】He does make a good alliance and i have had a very good rapport with him. He does refuse my suggestions, but that does not mean that he doesnt have an allianceHis family situation is rather difficult to handle. Father is a very clear, straight forward, no superstitions, no confusion like person and is prone to making very clear, sometimes unneeded clarifications and cannot ignore things that dont make logical sense. Mother is almost the opposite and tends to buy___ arguments and fears, not classically as in Folie-a-deux,but more in believing what he says. She tends to play the role of an enabler, but is experienced by him as abandoning him for her husband, sort of complicating his relationship with father.\n\n【22】Ideal situation would be that he can have a residential setting where he can have some independance and not rely on parents, a PCP, ___ ___ and a psychiatrist who have a tightely integrated team approach. Hopefully they can meet with him regularly, (possibly briefly), focus on both, his GI set of sxs and his sadness and anxiety about these sxs. Defending our stance, attacking his delusions have traditionally never worked in such cases and definitely not in his caseHe is an intelligent fellow and we hope that he can be helped.\n\n【23】Medications on Admission:\nabilify 20 q day, zyprexa 30 mg qday, miralax \n\n【24】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Neurology is consulted in the ED. \nHistory is obtained from the patient and his son who is at the bedside. \n\n【9】The patient does not endorse slurred speech or facial droop and so HPI is primarily obtained from his son. Per the son, the patient had roughly 4 transient episodes of slurred speech in the past 48 hours. The first 2 occurred yesterday and were in the context of lethargy from awakening from naps. Today, after going to radiation therapy, he returned home with his son and was very lethargic. He was unable to standup from the car without assistance (unusual for him). His son noted a new, and significant, left facial droop at the same time that he had slurred speech the morning of presentation (___) at about 9 am. \nThis lasted 45 minutes prior to complete resolution of both symptoms. During this time, he was comprehending speech without trouble, but was a bit more confused. There were no other focal neurological deficits. Afterward there was an additional episode of slurred speech x10 minutes without facial droop. He was urged to come to the ED by his PCP. \n\n【10】In the ED, his slurred speech and left facial droop are no longer apparent. He does complain of a mild headache. He is also not performing his normal daily activities (driving a car and performing most IADLs). \n\n【11】In reviewing recent history, it appears that the patient did sustain a fall with possible headstroke on ___ which prompted a hospital admission. Ultimately the fall was attributed to medication error and extra dose of metoprolol causing sinus bradycardia.\n\n【12】On neurologic review of systems, the patient notes dull headache x 2 days.

Acute globular subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure, stable compared to CT from 1 day earlier, without definite underlying mass. Recommend followup MRI after resolution of blood products. \n\n【38】2. Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal sulci and small subacute subdural hematoma at the level of the right superior paracentral lobule, similar to the CT from 1 day earlier. Given the negative CTA from 1 day earlier and the presence of chronic microhemorrhages in the brain parenchyma,these findings may be secondary to amyloid angiopathy. However,the chronic microhemorrhages may also be secondary to hypertension, or less likely secondary to axonal injury from prior trauma or multiple cavernous malformations. \n\n【39】3. Stable minimal blood in the occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle. Stable size of the ventricles, prominent due to global cerebral atrophy. \n\n【40】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a ___ year-old man with a history of Aortic dissection s/p AVR, B cell lymphoma currently on radiation therapy, and recent admission after fall ___ sinus bradycardia from extra dose of betablocker, who presented after a 4 discreet episodes of slurred speech in 48 hours, one accompanied by transient left facial droop. Neurological exam on admission was notable for post-surgical anisocoria and chronic bilateral hearing loss, but was otherwise no focal. Neuroimaging NCHCT and CTA showed a small area of left perislyvian hemorrhage without clear aneurysmal origin. Throughtout admission, the patient had intermittent episodes of facial droop, dysarthria, and left hand weakness that resolved within 10 minutes ___ per day). Repeat CT showed that the hemorrhage was stable. EEG was negative for seizures. The patient was started on Keppra 750BID emperically and the frequency of these episodes decreased significantly. The episodes were attributed to either EEG-negative seizures or simple cortical irritation phenomena from the presence of blood across the right sylvian fissure. He was continued on this medication on discharge. The patient had previously been anticoagulated on coumadin for his AVR. We held the coumadin and will liaise with his outpatient cardiologist for further management. (Appointment already scheduled for ___. \nAlthough he clearly has risk of intracranial hemorrhage, he certainly needs anticoagulation given the mechanical valve. The more the warfarin could be held, the safer from a neurologic standpoint. Although there is no hard evidence to guide our decision with certainty, provided that the head CT is stable, we would feel relatively safe to resume anticoagulation 14 days following the discovery of the hemorrhages.The patient was discharged to rehab per OT recs. \n\n【41】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Acute Renal Failure 3 months s/p Renal Transplant: The acute renal failure was thought to be due to a combination of prerenal etiology and tacrolimus toxicity, which is associated with decreased GFR, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. The creatinine slowly decreased to a stable level of 1.3-1.4 with IV and PO hydration and decreased tacrolimus dosing. Tacrolimus level decreased 22.8->10.4 over his hospitalization. Final tacrolimus dosing was 4mg bid (vs 6mg bid on admission). Renal ultrasound did show some mild hydronephrosis (as well as new slight delay in arterial systolic upstroke). The patient was also advised to stop drinking large amounts of ginseng tea,which has potential interactions with tacrolimus. Cellcept dosing was maintained at 500mg bid. Per renal transplant guidance, valganciclovir and calcium acetate were discontinued. \nBactrim prophylaxis was continued. Close outpatient follow-up with Drs ___ was arranged.\n\n【20】# Hyperkalemia K was 5.3 on admission and rose to max 5.9, with no EKG changes. \n His K was controlled with repeated doses of kayexelate, and when K ws 5.9, he also received calcium gluconate, insulin, and D50W. His K stabilized at 4.7 without need for continued kayexelate. He was maintained on a low potassium, low sodium,heart healthy diet.\n\n【21】# Hypertensive Urgency The patient had fluctuating and high blood pressures during much of his hospitalization, to maximum of 208/80. The patient had a severe headache early in his stay but this did not seem to be related temporally to his hypertension and resolved with Tylenol. He had no signs or symptoms of end-organ damage such as chest pain, SOB, hematuria, confusion, blurry vision, or neuro findings. His BP was controlled with tid labetalol(200-300mg), amlodipine 10mg daily, and IV hydralazine as needed. With this combination, his BP was usually in the 160's-170's systolic. The labetalol was switched to Toprol XL 100mg qhs at discharge, and the amlodipine 10mg daily was continued. He received the first Toprol dose in the afternoon prior to discharge.\n\n【22】# Anemia and leukopenia At baseline (borderline pancytopenia, with platelets in 160's-180's) - on Cellcept and tacrolimus.

The right atrium is markedly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is SEVERE global left ventricular hypokinesis with regional variation. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 20%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with SEVERE global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. There is a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3)are moderately thickened. There is at least moderate (low gradient) aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There is moderate [2+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no pericardial effusionCompared with the prior TTE of ___ , aortic regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are worse.\n\n【25】Brief Hospital Course:___ year old male with PMH significant for mixed etiology(ischemic/non-ischemic HFrEF (last EF 25%) with ICD for primary prevention, non-obstructive CAD, permanent AFib on warfarin,HTN, HLD, and low flow-low gradient AS (not TAVR candidate),presenting with progressive worsening DOE for past several days. \nHe was found to be volume overloaded and was diuresed with IV furosemide before being switched to torsemide PO. His exacerbation was likely triggered by his enalapril being stopped and this was started with good effect.\n\n【26】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES.\n\n【27】- Discharge weight: 198 lbs- Discharge creatinine: 1.3- Discharge diuretic: torsemide 60 mg PO Please check BMP on ___ and fax results to Dr. ___ at___. \n INR fluctuated during hospitalization.

Suspect that this was partially responsible for his volume overload in the setting of increased afterload. \nHis home enalapril was restarted with good effect. Uncontrolled hypothyroidism is also possible contributing etiology, notably TSH was elevated to 8.0 on admission w/ T4 1.1. His levothyroxine dose was increased. Patient with known low flow-low gradient AS, repeat TTE ___ shows EF 20%, severe global LV hypokinesis, AV mean gradient 16mmHg, velocity 2.5,valve area 1.2cm2, and worsening AI/TR, no significant changes and thus he is not candidate for intervention.

In view of the clinical symptoms, this could conceivably represent a developing consolidation. There is also a small area of opacification in the right mid lung laterally that could be a consolidative focus.\n\n【20】CT of Abdomen: IMPRESSION: \n1. Massive distention of the stomach and proximal duodenum with no evidence of perforation. \n2. Evidence of multiple prior bowel resections. \n3. Massive urinary bladder distention, with interval improvement in the hydronephrosis and hydroureter, likely representing a neurogenic bladder. \n4. Possible small varices, associated with hepatic steatosis and massive splenomegaly. \n5. Focal liver lesion not well characterized; ultrasound or MRI is recommended for further evaluation. \n\n【21】Pending Studies:\nBiopsy of Esophagus is pending at time of discharge Blood Cultures from ___ are no growth to date at the time of discharge\n\n【22】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old with a PMHx significant for remote small/large bowel resection secondary to pseudo-obstruction,failed intestinal transplant x 2 with subsequent TPN dependence and prior VFib arrest ___ marked electrolyte abnormalities s/p ICD placement who was admitted with fever after an EGD.\n\n【23】# Fever: Given symptom onset quickly after EGD, this was felt to likely secondary to periprocedural translocation of bacteria. \nInitially there was concern for esophageal perforation given concomitant left upper quadrant abdominal pain, but appearance on CT of the abdomen and CXR made this less likely. Mr. ___was placed on Ceftriaxone and flagyl and was initially febrile for 24 hours. He did subsequently spike to 101 on days 2 and 3 of admission, but each day had reduction in overall fever curve and was afebrile thereafter without change in antibiotic coverage. No definite pneumonia was seen on chest x ray and UA was within normal limits. Given the proximity of fevers to EGD,similar to post-EGD fevers which occurred previously, there was limited concern for other sources of persistent fevers such as endocarditis. There was concern for colonization of PICC, but lack of subsequent fevers while on antibiotics spoke against this. We do recommend changing the PICC for a tunnelled line in the near future if he remains afebrile off of antibiotics. It may also be prudent to prophylax Mr. ___ with antibiotics prior to subsequent EGDs to avoid further bacteremia/fever as he has history of fever following EGD. Mr. ___ was discharged with the instructions to have cultures drawn ___ weeks after he completes his 10 day course of ceftriaxone and flagyl. If he should become febrile once antibiotics are stopped or if he has them while on antibiotics consideration should be given to PICC line infection, endocarditis, or infection of his ICD although endocarditis and ICD infection would be less likely.\n\n【24】#Acute renal failure: Initially, Mr. ___ was had ___ 1.2 elevated from baseline of 0.5. Renal function returned to baseline with IVF (4L NS/day which is his baseline hydration requirement). The initial pre-renal azotemia likely resulted from increased insensible losses in the setting of fever. \n\n【25】# Left upper quadrant abdominal pain: Upon admission, Mr. \n___ complained of left upper quadrant abdominal pain which improved with PRN dilaudid. The exam for this pain was somewhat puzzling in that there was exquisite pain with light touch, no involuntary guarding, and no clear anatomic correlation on CT. \nHis pain gradually improved and IV dilaudid was discontinued.\n\n【26】#Severe esophagitis:\nPatient was noted to have severe esophagitis on EGD. This was felt to be due to stasis of gastric material as he has a blind pouch duodenum and empties his G-tube only a couple times/day. \nHis PPI was increased and he was continued on carafate and patient was advised to empty his G-tube more frequently to prevent buildup of stomach acids on the esophagus.\n\n【27】Transitional Issues:\n- Mr. ___ require ___ venous access and may benefit from a tunnelled line once he is afebrile and stable off of antibiotics. His current PICC has been in place since ___ and may be a site for seeding of bacteria- Please consider antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to future EGDs.\n\n【28】Medications on Admission:\n1.

Uric acid and LDH were all within normal limits. CRP was elevated but ESR was not obtained. The patient was seen by Surgery and Hematology/Oncology and underwent an excisional biopsy of her right inguinal lymph node with preliminary pathology showing reactive lymph nodes. \nTherefore, this result combined with a reduction in white count,including bandemia, suggested that the patient's presentation was most consistent with lymphadenitis and associated lymphedema. The patient was discharged on clindamycin to complete a total of a one week course and with PCP follow up to monitor symptoms and ensure continued improvement of symptoms and lower extremity swelling. Given the recurrent infections,including lymphadenitis, it was recommended that the patient avoid shaving in the inguinal area. \n\n【26】Lastly, it was felt that it may be worthwhile to check immunoglobulin levels in the outpatient setting to assess for common variable immunodeficiency as a cause of repeated infections given the negative heme workup to date.\n\n【27】#Acute renal failure:\nThis was felt to be due to dehydration and renal function improved with hydration.\n\n【28】#Elevated INR:\nThis was felt to be more likely nutritional in etiology than due to liver dysfunction.

If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.\n\n【28】Exercise:\nLimit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. \nDo not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon. \nNo heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days. \nTry to keep leg elevated when able.\n\n【29】BATHING/SHOWERING: \nYou may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A dressing may cover youre amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your ___ appointment.\n\n【30】WOUND CARE:\nSutures / Staples may be removed before discharge.

These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the showerAvoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery.\n\n【31】MEDICATIONS: \nUnless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary. \nRemember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the dayCAUTIONS:\nNO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation.

Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol).

However, it is thought that the scrotal pain is partially related to both the rectosigmoid mass that was found during his hospitalization and from his UTI that was also identified. We originally also considered whether a component of the pain could be related to spinal mets compressing lumbosacral nerve roots, however, MRI of his lumbosacral spine did not reveal metastatic disease or pathologic fracture. The rectosigmoid mass is causing a partial bowel obstruction and may be responsible for part of the pain given that his scrotal/LLQ pain improved after he was given laxatives and had some bloody bowel movements. Scrotal pain may still recur because it the mass in the rectosigmoid continues to be significant. For further details on the rectosigmoid mass, refer to the next problem, Urinary tract infection is being treated as below. \n\n【26】#Rectosigmoid mass: Pt has been having chronic bloody bowel movements x 3 months. He is incontinent, and has had bloody stool leaking from rectum. During his hospitalization, GI performed a flex sigmoidoscopy and found a large exophytic friable mass in the rectum, which was difficult to navigate and may be causing a bowel obstruction. However wet read of abdominal x-ray showed no obstruction or free air. A biopsy was taken from the mass, which did not reveal cancer, though the amount of biopsied tissue was limited by bleeding during the procedure. Colorectal surgery was contacted about this patient,requested KUB to r/o obstruction. While we considered diverting colostomy and interventional GI stenting, surgery did not recommend colostomy and interventional GI deferred stenting because he is not obstructed and they felt it would increase bleeding. Rad onc was consulted to consider radiation therapy to reduce the mass, and did not think that radiation therapy was immediately necessary. Rad-onc will follow-up with him as an outpatient on ___ to do mapping.\n\n【27】#UTI: Pt's urine culture grew enterococci >100CFU susceptible to ampicillin, though pt never c/o dysuria. We started treating him with 875 BID amoxicillin x 7 days. It is possible that a component of his scrotal pain may be related to UTI.\n\n【28】#Metastatic colorectal cancer: Recurrent GI malignancy with mets to the liver. \nTumor status is KRAS wild type with metastasis to the liver that was managed with CyberKnife recently by BI Onc. He was seen by his outpatient oncology fellow and there is no indication for inpatient chemo, they will manage his metastatic cancer as an outpatient once he is discharged.\n\n【29】CHRONIC CONDITIONS:\n\n【30】#HTN: continued home valsartan\n\n【31】#Hyponatremia: Improving. Likely secondary to volume depletion in the setting of poor PO intake and vomiting. \n\n【32】#Stroke- occurred in ___, Left sided hemiparesis Aspirin held during GI bleed, but have continued statin. Aspirin will be restarted on discharge. \n\n【33】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n#Rad-onc and heme-onc will continue to discuss treatment strategies for his rectal mass to reduce pain and bleeding, and will f/u as an outpatient on ___ for mapping. \n\n【34】Medications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete. \nInformation was obtained from PatientFamily/Caregiver.\n1.

We did several imaging tests to see if the pain was due to metastases from your colorectal cancer, but we did not find evidence that your cancer was compression any nerves. Your scrotal pain was improved with bowel movements and pain medication. We did find an infection in your urine which may be contributing to this pain. We are treating you with 10days of antibiotics. \n\n【42】While you were in the hospital, we noticed that you had bloody stools, which you had been having for several months. When we examined you, we noted a mass in your rectum, from which we took tissue in order to test it for cancer. We did not find cancer in the tissue, however, the sample was small and we think that it did not capture the cancerous tissue. We asked many other consulting physicians, surgery, interventional gastroenterology,and radiation oncology, to look at you during your hospitalization to determine what the best approach would be to reduce your rectal mass. At your discharge, we had determined that surgery and placing a device called a stent in the rectum was not necessary for you at this time. However, at your discharge, we would like you to follow-up with hematology-oncology and radiation oncology in order to further evaluate if radiation therapy should be used to reduce your rectal mass.\n\n【43】Followup Instructions:___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He felt okay but started having a productive cough yesterday. He awoke this morning and was sat up in bed by the aides at his facility. He was being washed when he quickly reportedly became pale and diaphoretic, and then he leaned back and was not speaking or moving his left side well. He apparently recovered relatively quickly, but he was transferred to___ where he was evaluated and a CTA head/neck was performed. He was sent here for further ___ after that CTA revealed worsening basilar artery and left vertebral artery stenosis/thrombosis compared to a prior evaluation (he was seen there before transfer to ___ on this prior admission). He was started on a heparin infusion per recommendation of a neurologist there. En route, he developed a headache so the heparin infusion was stopped upon arrival here. A Code Stroke was called.

Right lung base opacity could represent aspiration or pneumonia depending on the clinical scenario. \n2. Bilateral calcified diaphragmatic and pleural plaques are compatible with prior asbestos exposure. \n\n【35】___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nAs compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Massive calcified pleural plaques with massive scarring in the lung parenchyma. In addition to that, however, no new parenchymal opacity is seen. Status post CABG. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema.\n\n【36】___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nIMPRESSION: Massive pleural plaques obscuring parenchymal evaluation. Cross sectional imaging is recommended for evaluation of lungs and if not recently performed, for evaluation of lung malignancy in this high risk patient. \n\n【37】___ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST There three punctate foci of slow diffusion: one in the right cerebellar hemisphere and two in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The foci are too small to be clearly identified on ___ maps. The findings may be artifactual but small infarcts not excluded. The foci in the left cerebellar hemisphere may be explained as T2 shine through given the gliosis associted with prior infarct, but not the right focus. Recommend clinical correlation. \nThere is no acute hemorrhage. \nLeft cerebellar cystic encephalomalacia consistent with a history of prior infarct. \nNonspecific white matter abnormalities likely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.\n\n【38】___ CT CHEST W/CONTRAST IMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of an infectious process. \n2. Extensive bilateral calcified pleural plaques and adjacent scarring suggestive of asbestos related disease. \n3. Multiple pulmonary nodules as well as an area in the right upper lobe which likely represents scarring and less likely a mass and can be further evaluated in the non-emergent setting with a PET given the multiple prominent mediastinal nodes and borderline enlarged right hilar node if there is high clinical suspicion for mesothelioma. Otherwise suggest CT followup in 3 months as clinically indicated to assess the stability of these nodules if prior imaging from elsewhere is not available for comparison of stability. \n4. Bilateral thyroid nodules. A dedicated thyroid ultrasound may be obtained for further characterization. \n5. Mild centrilobular emphysema. \n6. Bibasilar diffuse opacity suggesting atelectasis, scarring,or aspiration, probably to some extent combined with interstitial lung disease. \n\n【39】___ CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO IMPRESSION: \n1. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis at the distal descending colon. There is no evidence of macroperforation or drainable collections at this time. \n2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and branches with ectasia of the infrarenal aorta up to 2.7 cm. \n3. Probably enhancing 1.3 cm exophytic left renal lesion, may represent renal cell carcinoma. Recommend either CT or MRI using renal mass protocol to further evaluate (as clinically indicated). \n\n【40】Brief Hospital Course:\nICU COURSE:.\n\n【41】Mr. ___ was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department. \nHis main exam abnormalities, as outlined in the admission note,involved ataxia greater on the left than right. He was started on a heparin drip and his blood pressure maintained above SBP 110-120 to encourage collateral flow. This did require low dose pressors. Given the heparin drip, his aspirin was held. \n\n【42】He was treated for presumed healthcare-acquired pneumonia as well. His ICU course was otherwise complicated by acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. \n\n【43】STROKE SERVICE COURSE:.\n\n【44】___ with multiple prior strokes and very severe vertebrobasilar disease recently discharged from the stroke service who returns with productive cough, found to be hypoxic with crackles and ?mild encephalopathy. CTA from OSH shows worsening left V4 and basilar artery thromboses compared to prior scan and pt getting abx for presumed PNA and diverticulitis. \n\n【45】# Neuro: as above, pt recently discharged from the stroke service and now returns with worsening basilar occlusion. NCHCT with no new hemorrhage or apparent hypodensities, CTA showing likely worsening left vertebral and basilar artery thrombosis. \nEtiology is unclear however pt with severe intracraial/extracranial atherosclerosis. ICU course was notable for agitation requiring restraints, pt calm ___ and restraints discontinued. no further agitation, remained calm overnight. \nthis AM, pt still calm, not agitated. at time of discharge he has been off of restraints for >72 hours. pt had been on a heparin drip, which was discontinued and he was restarted on aspirin and plavix which he had been taking prior to admission. \nhis neuro symptoms on presentation were most likely attributable to recrudescence in the setting of infection vs. new neurologic process. he has follow-up scheduled with Dr. ___Neurology service. It was felt that the risk of continuing anticoagulation exceeded the potential benefit.\n\n【46】# Infectious disease: patient with RLL infiltrate on CXR,started on vanco + zosyn for PNA and diverticulitis. completed ___. at the time of discharge his WBC count had normalized, he was afebrile and without any clinical signs of infection. \n\n【47】# CV: no acute cardiovascular issues on this admission. \nfurosemide was held and should be restarted on a PRN basis outpatient. patient will be discharged on ASA 325 and clopidogrel 75, and should continue his statin. \n\n【48】# Pulm: PNA as above, pt also with multiple pulmonary nodules on chest CT. Per radiology, they suggest CT f/u in 3 months as clinically indicated to assess the stability of these nodules if prior imaging from elsewhere is not available for comparison of stability.\n\n【49】# Endocrine: CT chest with incidental finding of bilateral thyroid nodules. Recommend dedicated thyroid US outpatient for further characterization. \n\n【50】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:.\n\n【51】- Please follow-up concerning findings on chest and abd CT and re-image as appropriate (lung nodules, thyroid nodule, renal nodule)\n- Discontinued furosemide, restart PRN \n\n【52】A total of 75 minutes was spent in coordination of this patient's discharge\n\n【53】Medications on Admission:\n1.

Advised that she titrate to ___ BMs per day and to call her MD if ___ had a BM for 48 hours.\n\n【39】# 2 weeks of decreased appetite + night sweats: suspect due to yet unconfirmed rectal malignancy (primary vs. metastatic)\n\n【40】# pAFib/SSS/pacer: held home Coumadin on admission due to reports of BRBPR. She did not have significant BRBPR during this hospitalization (nor significant blood loss anemia), but coumadin continued to be held given the plans for colonoscopy with biopsy. Her INR did not decline significantly despite holding coumadin for several days, which we suspect was related to decreased PO intake recently in setting of abdominal pain and severe constipation with resulting poor nutritional status/decreased Vit K intake. Coumadin held at discharge given she had some mild post-biopsy bleeding (CHADSvasc of 4, 4.8%yearly risk of stroke).

He was counseled to watch carefully for similar symptoms after discharge, and report them to his PCP. \nAt the time of discharge, insulin and C-peptide were still pending; these will be reported to his PCP's office. If episodes recur, would consider CT/MRI imaging of abdomen, and Endocrinogoly evaluation. Of note, the patient had not started any new medications recently that would put him at risk for hypoglycemia. There are no family members with diabetes, and therefore accidental ingestion of diabetic medication would be unlikely.\n\n【24】# Presyncope: Initial presentation aconsistent with vasovagal episode vs. hypoglycemia. Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia of unclear origin, as discussed above. Other causes of syncope that are relevant include cardiogenic given his bradycardia;although on review of EKG, it is sinus with normal PR and QTc,which would be less likely to cause syncope. With his of childhood seizures and mild confusion, neurogenic causes could have also caused presyncope although the short period during which the event occured makes this less likely. On further questioning, episode does not seem consistent with childhood epilepsy symptoms. Patient was ruled out with trended cardiac enzymes (all normal), and EKG. He was monitored on telemetry as well. Orthostatic vital signs were normal. Additionally, CXR and UA/UCx did not show evidence of infection. \n\n【25】# Chronic kidney disease / CKD3: Creatinine was stable at 1.5 throughout admission and decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge. Noted to be 1.5 at OSH prior to transfer, and PCP records note ___ 1.5 over the past year. Patient did not know baseline creatinine. Urinalysis did not show evidence of infection, and urine electrolytes were not concerning for prerenal azotemia. Decrease in renal function may be related to recent NSAID use. Patient was counseled not to use NSAIDs as frequently. Should ___ with PCP and consider further w/u and initiation of ACEi. \n\n【26】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n# Sinus Bradycardia: Asymptomatic, PCP notes HR in at 60 the last 2 visits this year. His EKG showed only sinus bradycardia without other abnormalities. He had 2 sets of negative troponins. He was monitored on telemetry, and was noted to have sinus bradycardia, 40's while awake, 30's while alseep. The bradycardia at night may reflect his underlying OSA. No other events on tele noted. Would continue to monitor. \n\n【27】# Anemia: Normocytic. Unknown baseline. No evidence of bleeding. \n Stable during admission.\n\n【28】# Elevated Lipase: Belly exam benign. No e/o pancreatitis clinically. \n\n【29】# Insomnia: Initially held clonazepam and zolpidem, given presyncope. These were restarted once patient was stable. \n\n【30】# OSA, on CPAP: Remained on C-PAP during hospitalization. \nPatient reports that this dx was made pre-gastric bypass. He has an outpatient sleep study scheduled with is PCP to ___ and determine whether he still carries the dx of OSA and needs C-PAP. \n\n【31】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# Given CKD and high BPs, would consider addition of ACE inhibitor# Continue to monitor bradycardia, as you are# ___ consider outpatient Endocrinology referral if episodes recur. Patient was given contact information for ___Endocrinology. Will need to ___ pending hypoglycemia w/u,including C-peptide and insulin levels sent here, as well as C-peptide, insuline, proinsulin and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels sent at OSH\n# ___ consider outpatient CT or MRI Abdomen to evaluate for pancreatic masses, if episodes recur# CODE: full code# Labs pending at the time of discharge: Insulin and C-peptide. \nThese will be communicated to PCP.\n\n【32】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

There are no abnormal soft tissue calcifications identified. \n___ Abd CT:\nHISTORY: Left lower quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting. \nFINDINGS: There is bibasilar atelectasis identified. A large hiatal hernia with an essentially intrathoracic stomach is identified, similar in appearance. The heart is unremarkable. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. The spleen, adrenal glands, liver, and gallbladder are unchanged and normal in appearance. Intra-abdominal loops of bowel are normal in appearance. There is no free fluid or free air. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The kidneys are unchanged with stable appearance of atrophic right kidney. Multiple hypodense lesions within the left kidney are again identified, too small to characterize. \nCT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive diverticulosis, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis. A Foley catheter is identified within the bladder. There is no pelvic free fluid. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. \nSOFT TISSUES: There is a focally dense area of breast tissue in the right breast which is stable when compared to ___. \nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified. Mild compression deformities of the vertebral bodies in the thoracic and lumbar spine are again identified. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Unchanged appearance of intrathoracic stomach. No evidence of \n\n【19】obstruction. \n2. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.\n\n【20】___ ECHO:\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal(LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)are mildly thickened, and display slightly reduced systolic excursion, but frank aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \nThere are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\n【21】Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)of ___, no major change is evident.\n\n【22】___ UGI Barium swallow study: \nProvisional Findings Impression: YMf TUE ___ 8:04 ___Similar appearance of the intrathoracic stomach with moderately delayed gastric emptying, but no evidence of complete obstruction. \nMucosal views of the stomach were not obtained due to patient's limited ability to cooperate with exam.\n\n【23】___ EGD:\nErythema and erosions in the lower third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis. Large hiatal hernia. Otherwise normal EGD to lower third of the esophagus\n\n【24】Brief Hospital Course:\n# Upper GI bleed - Patient had history of spitting up dark flecks suggestive of coffee ground emesis. She was admitted to the floor where serial HCt were checked and remained stable except for one slight drop from 37.1 -> 33.2 on ___. After this drop her HCt remained between 33.2 - 35.0. She did not have any guiac positive stools during the admission. She had one additional episode of emisis which she reported had a few small black flecks, but had no frank hematemesis. She was started on IV BID PPI. During this admission, after being cleared by cardiology, she had an endoscopic study which showed mild erosions in the esophagus that according to the GI fellow could have been a source of some mild bleeding. She was also noted to have a large intrathoracic stomach secondary to a hiatal hernia. \n She also had a barium swallow study which showed the hiatal hernia but did not give any other information regarding possible source of bleeding.\n\n【25】# Abdominal pain - during admission, the patinet complained of intermittend LUQ/L flank pain. She had a CT scan which again demonstrated a large hiatal hernia and diverticulosis. We believe that her abdominal pain is likely due to her hernia. In addition, she had several hypodense lesions on her L kidney which were most likely cysts but in the setting of prior Breast CA need to be followed up by her PCP and oncologist. Before D/C a UA was checked which showed mild microscopic hematuria which was attributed to the foley catheter. Of note, her prior UA from this admission had no red cells in it. She should have a repeat UA at her PCP's office to confirm that she does not have continued hematuria. Should she develop further hematuria in the future, she will need more extensive urologic work up.\n\n【26】# Hiatal hernia - Pt with history of hernia, now with worsening symptoms secondary (regurgitation, shortness of breath,abdominal pain) to hernia, so evaluated by surgery during this admission.

At time of discharge, patient is able to tolerate POs w/out vomiting.\n\n【27】# Cardiac - During this admission, cardiology was consulted for the patient's report of chest pain and DOE as an outpatient. \nCardiology recommended inpatient ECHO, which was performed and was unremarkable. In addition, cardiology recommeds a repeat outpatient stress test pre-operatively and for the patient to re-start ASA at some point when thought safe from a GI standpoint (and is not ___, as well as to start on a low-dose B-blocker, which can be considered by her outpatient cardiologist with whom she has an appointment the day after d/c.\n\n【28】# Gout - The patient was continued on colchicine during this admission with no further gout flares.\n\n【29】# Acute Renal Failure - The patient had acute renal failure during this admission with a Cr rising to 1.5 before returning to the patient's baseline. This was in the setting of post-contrast enhanced CT scan upon admission, as well as decreased PO intake and was likely primarily pre-renal. Upon instituting a regular diet, her renal failure resolved. Of note,the patient did also have small hypodense lesions on her L kidney noted on her CT scan report which should be followed up by her PCP ___ oncologist as an outpatient. She also had an episode of microscopic hematuria upon foley d/c which should be followed up as an outpatient.\n\n【30】# Hypokalemia - The patient had hypokalemia with a K+ to 2.9 during this admission. This resolved with oral potassium and 1 dose of IV potassium therapy. She will be re-started on her home potassium upon discharge and should have electrolytes re-checked as an outpatient.\n\n【31】# Thrombocytopenia - During this admission, the patient had thrombocytopenia which appears to be stable and chronic.

Underwent IV diuresis and subsequently transitioned to Lasix 20mg PO QD. \nAlso with atrial fibrillation with difficult to control rates,had better rate control with metoprolol succinate 100mg BID on discharge. Also with urinary retention requiring foley placement, scheduled for follow-up with urology for repeat void trial. \n\n【33】# Dyspnea on exertion\n# Lower extremity edema\n# New onset HFpEF - Mr. ___ presented with 1 week of weakness, dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema and elevated proBNP concerning for new onset acute heart failure. \nIschemic cardiomyopathy vs. tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. \nEcho with normal BiV systolic function (EF 70%) and initially read as potentially clinically significant aortic stenosis. \nHowever, focused repeat study showed only mild aortic stenosis. \nWith Cardiology input, it was therefore felt that atrial fibrillation with tachycardia was more likely to be primary driver of heart failure. Patient was given boluses of Lasix 40mg IV throughout hospital stay with 11L of output, then transitioned onto 20mg PO when clinically euvolemic. Weight on admission 202 lbs. Discharge weight 182 pounds. Ultimately,tachycardia was controlled with metoprolol tartrate 50mg q6h then transitioned to metoprolol succinate 100mg BID, with goal rates <120.

Given his high fall risk,anticoagulation was deferred. Will defer decision to anti-coagulate to outpatient cardiologist. \n\n【35】# Urinary retention# BPH - History of BPH was previously on tamsulosin, but self-discontinued as he felt he did not need it. However, was noted to be retaining while in hospital. Had placement of Foley catheter. Failed trial of void on ___, therefore required re-insertion of catheter. Restarted tamsulosin and arranged for follow-up with urology on ___ for repeat void trial.\n\n【36】# ___ - Creatinine baseline 1.1. At peak, elevated to 1.5 on___. Most likely cardiorenal in the setting of volume overload,though post-renal also possible in setting of known BPH and urinary retention. Was diuresed with IV Lasix, placed Foley catheter, with improvement in kidney function. On discharge, Cr had normalized to 1.2. \n\n【37】# Leukocytosis\n# Cough - Initially treated for pneumonia in the ED given these findings. CXR with no evidence of consolidation.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe 2 vessel CAD. the LMCA had a 70% stenosis. The LAD had severe calcification and serial 90% stenoses. The distal diagonal artery had a 40% origin lesion. The LCX was occluded at its origin. The RCA was not engaged. \n2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal system pressure. \n\n【24】3. Left ventriculography was deferred. \n4. Successful PTCA, rotablation and stenting of the distal LM and proximal-mid LAD with a 1.25 mm burr at 170K rpm x 3 passess. An overlapping 2.5 x 28 mm Xience and a 3.0 x 12 mm Xience DES were deployed in the LAD/LM. The proximal stent and the stent overlap were post dilated with a 3.5 x 12 mm quantum maverick balloon at high pressure. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stents, no dissection but a AVF from S2 to the CS. \n5. Successful stenting of the RCIA with a 6.0 x 39 mm genesis stent which was post dilated to 9.0 with an admiral balloon at high pressure.

Wife and patient both stated that he had been having intermittent fevers as high as 102 measured at home since the time of transplant, although this had not previously been documented. Blood cultures grew enterococcus and Neisseria, and urine cultures grew pseudomonas. \nHe underwent CT guided drainage of a hepatic collection on ___. \nThe fluid grew out Enterococcus and ___. Vanc and Zosyn were initially started, then coverage was broadened to Vanco, Zosyn,Cipro and CaspofunginUS showed there is slow flow in the main hepatic artery with a tardus and parvus waveform (velocity up to 32 cm/s), but no flow in the right hepatic artery. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The portal vein and its branches are patent. \nPatient was continued on coumadinRegarding failure to thrive: This was likely multifactorial,with acute bacteremia and renal failure playing a role. \nHowever, he had a long history of weight loss and poor PO intake(had required feeding tube for several months after transplant)and was thought to also have some underlying depression. Given that he was on the transplant list, feeding tube was considered however patient had refused initially at admission and then was transplanted. He was maintained on TPN post transplant and was using PO supplements with good tolerance and was encouraged to use the supplements at home following dischargeOn ___ a liver became available and the patient underwent a second orthotopic liver transplant due to the hepatic artery thrombosis and subsequent biliary necrosis and hepatic abscess. He was taken to the OR with Dr ___. \nAn Orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant (piggyback),portal vein - portal vein anastomosis, common bile duct -common bile duct anastomosis (no T tube). Donor iliac artery conduit from the supraceliac aorta was performed. He received routine induction immunosuppression to include Cellcept, solumedrol with prednisone taper and Prograf restarted on the evening of the transplant. The broad coverage with antibiotics was continued with patient receiving 12 days of Vanco, 15 days of Cipro, 19 days of Zosyn and 14 days of Caspo which was then converted to PO fluconazole. \nHe initially did well in the SICU, remained afebrile. On POD 6 his coumadin was restarted. The lateral drain was removed on POD \n3. The medial drain was noted to be becoming more bilious in nature and he was having increased abdominal pain and an elevation in his WBC. An ERCP was attempted and extravasation of contrast was noted at the duct to duct anastamosis and a stent was placed. However, it was determined that he was going to require Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and was taken back to the OR with Dr ___. He did well following the surgery but was continued on the TPN until he was able to start tolerating liquids and started supplements. He was still refusing Dobhoff tube placement and instead wanted to eat and use supplements. \nCalorie counts showed him getting about ___ to ___ of caloric needs and he was instructed to take 4 of the Ensure bottles dailyOn POD ___ he was switched to oral Fluconazole off the Caspofungin with appropriate adjustment in the Prograf dosingID recommended changing to Ceftrixone and getting him off the other antibiotics and keeping him on the antibiotic until the second JP drain was removed. That drain continued with about 1 Liter output daily, but remained serous, so it was decided to remove the drain and suture. The Ceftrixone was taken off at this timeHis Coumadin was managed, INRs followed daily. The INR was 5.4 2 days prior to discharge and the dose was dropped with followup with outpatient labsCholangiogram on ___ showed no leak and tube was capped with no subsequent feverLFTs dropped appropriately and were WNL at time of discharge.\n\n【17】Medications on Admission:\nmetoprolol 25 mg bid Cellcept 250 mg bid tacrolimus 2 mg bid (previously 3 mg bid)metoprolol 25 bid Bactrim SS qd calcium carbonate 500 mg tid (takes bid)coumadin 1 mg qd (previously 2 mg qd)Ambien 5 mg qhs Senna, Docusate PRN (not using) \n\n【18】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Few nonspecific foci of T2 hyperintensities not typical for demyelinating disease. \n\n【19】2. Leptomeningeal enhancement along the inferior aspect of both cerebellar hemispheres with subtle increased FLAIR signal indicates leptomeningeal disease. The accompanying spinal MR also demonstrates leptomeningeal enhancement. Correlation with CSF findings recommended as the differential diagnosis includes inflammatory processes such as sarcoid and infections,lymphoma or metastasis. \n\n【20】CXRAY: IMPRESSION: Normal chest.\n\n【21】CT Torso: IMPRESSION: Striated nephrogram, right worse than left. Differential diagnosis includes infection, vasculitis which could have an autoimmune basis. Lymphomatous infiltration could explain the neurologic and renal imaging findings. \nThere is no evidence of sarcoidosis. No primary malignancy was identified.\n\n【22】Cytometry: Due to paucicellular nature of the specimen, a limited panel is performed to determine B-cell clonality. \nB-cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality. \nT cells combine 65% of lymphoid gated events.\n\n【23】Cytology: Atypical. \n Numerous lymphocytes and scattered monocytes. \n\n【24】Brief Hospital Course:\n(1) Demyelinating Disease (final diagnosis: presumed NMO)\nPatient had an initial spinal tap that showed leukocytosis wth WBC 217. Therefore she was started on Acyclovir for a 7 day___ which was discontinued when the HSV PCR result was negative. EBV and other virus PCR results were also negative. \nHer MR showed lesions at T4, T8, and T12 and also a markedly enhanced right optic nerve. The MR brain also showed leptomeningeal enhancement. A CT torso was done to rule out malignancy and there was no evidence of lymphoma. Since sarcoid was on the differential, ACE was sent and was within normal limits. CXRAY and Chest CT didn't show evidence of sarcoid. She was treated with IV Solumderol for five days with clear improvement in her right eye blurriness and gait. She had a second LP at the end of her admission to add on flow cytometry that showed fewer WBCs (123). \nShe was evaluated for vasculitis with ___ that was positive 1:40, dsDNA was negative. HIV testing was negative.\n\n【25】(2) Papillitis Patient was seen inpatient by Neuro-opthalmologist Dr. ___. It was felt that the underlying leptomeningeal enhancement was the cause of her papillitis. Unilateral involvement of only the right eye was less consistant with NMO (however on next admission she did develop bilateral eye involvement). She did not see any evidence of uveitis or iritis that would make sarcoid or lymphoma a more likely diagnosis. \n\n【26】(3) UTI Pt required a Foley catheter for urination. \nPatient grew E. Coli (___) and was started on Ciprpfloxacin PO to complete a 10 day course. Her CT abdomen showed enhancement in the kidneys that is consistant with infection. \n\n【27】(4) Urinary Retention She failed a trial to urinate on her own. She was trained to do self catheterization in the hospital and discharged home with catheters for q 4 hour catheterization. \n\n【28】(5) Pain Patient had significant headache pain that was treated with IV dilaudid. She was transitioned to PO Percocet at discharge. \n\n【29】Her case was discussed with her primary physician and also Dr. \n___ continued care. \n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\nNone\n\n【31】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Neuro Exam: APD on right, visual acuity of ___ on OD. \nStrength 4+ lower extremities. Decreased sensation lower extremities to level of T10. Bilateral Toes upgoing. Gait is normal. \n\n【35】Discharge Instructions:\nYou were admitted to the hospital with leg numbness, blurry vision, and bladder and bowel incontinence. You had LP to determine the cause of your symptoms. Your MRI showed enhancing areas in the nerve in your eye and also in your spine. You were treated with medications to treat viral meningitis but viral studies were negative. You were also treated with high dose steroids which helped improve your symptoms. While in the hospital, you developed a urinary tract infection for which you will finish a course of antibiotics. You continue to have problems urinating on your own. You should use self catheter to empty your bladder every ___ hours.

She also has poorly controlled BPs since she is unable to swallow her pills. \n\n【19】# Food impaction/odynophagia/esophagitis: Pt was seen by GI and taken to the endoscopy suite. EGD revealed esophageal food impaction, esophageal stricture, and esophagitis. Food impaction was removed, and she was maintained on a liquid diet. She was started on a PPI for her esophagitis. She will need to follow-up with repeat EGD in 1 week for stricture dilation.\n\n【20】# Hypertension: Initially attributed to recent inability to tolerate PO intake and take her home meds. While NPO, severe hypertension was treated with IV metoprolol and IV hydralazine. \nOnce home meds were resumed, the patient had persistent hypertension. Home BP meds were increased, however, due to hypotensive episode (below), these were held. Ultimately her home medications were continued without change on discharge. \nPlease follow up blood pressure closely and adjust as necessary.\n\n【21】# Hypotension: On ___, she developed acute hypotension after a large bowel movement. BP 70/40s, and persistent for 30 min. \nReceived IVF. EKG without no clear acute ischemia. HR in ___and AVSS throughout. Sleepy but arousable. After 30 min her BP improved after 2 L NS. I suspect this event was related to a vagal response from her BM, plus her increased antihypertensive regimen (Lisinopril and HCTZ were increased that morning).\n\n【22】# Troponin Leak: ECG without changes. Attributed to severe hypertension / demand in the setting of chronic kidney disease. \nPt never had any chest pain or chest pressure. Improved during hospitalization.\n\n【23】# RLQ Pain: Attributed to constipation. Pt was treated with aggressive bowel regimen.\n\n【24】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- pt will need repeat EGD with dilation in 1 week\n- BP medication adjustment as needed\n\n【25】Medications on Admission:\nThis is taken from OMR.
