Bilateral dependent pulmonary opacities, most compatible with  删除换行1 aspiration. \n2. Low positioning of the endotracheal tube, which is positioned  删除换行1 2 cm above the carina, and could be withdrawn for optimal  删除换行1 positioning. \n3. Free intraperitoneal air, located anterior to the liver, in  删除换行1 the splenic  删除换行1 hilum, and tracking through the hiatal hernia defect into the  删除换行1 hiatal hernia sac. While highly worrisome for bowel perforation,  删除换行1 the source is unclear. If further evaluation is desired, CT with  删除换行1 enteric contrast could be considered. \n4.

Similar mass effect with a similar approximately 7 mm  删除换行1 rightward shift of midline structures. \n7. No evidence of hydrocephalus. \n\n【22】CXR ___:\nFINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is  删除换行1 diffusely increased prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent  删除换行1 with vascular congestion. In the appropriate clinical setting,  删除换行1 the possibility of superimposed pneumonia, especially on the  删除换行1 left, must be considered. Large hiatal hernia is again seen. \n\n【23】CXR ___:\nFINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with  删除换行1 patient in  删除换行1 sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct  删除换行1 comparison  删除换行1 with the next preceding similar study of ___. Again  删除换行1 there is  删除换行1 perivascular haze indicative of pulmonary vascular congestion. \nBasal  删除换行1 densities exist more marked on the left than on the right. Again  删除换行1 as mentioned on preceding study, consideration for superimposed  删除换行1 pneumonic infiltrates in this patient with CHF must be  删除换行1 considered. There is no significant interval change during the  删除换行1 latest 24 hours examination interval. \n\n【24】ECHO ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left  删除换行1 ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. \nDue to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion  删除换行1 abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

He was then transferred to the MICU.  \n删除1：<u>.</u>\nIn the MICU, we he was taken off sedation, but did not have any  删除换行1 purposeful movements.  A head CT right after the event showed no  删除换行1 major changed from initial scan.  Neuro was consulted and a  删除换行1 second CT was obtained 24 hrs after intubation.  This CT showed  删除换行1 severe bilateral ischemic strokes, likely related to vasospasm  删除换行1 from the initial bleed.  Given his poor prognosis, the family  删除换行1 decide to pursue only comfort care and he was terminally  删除换行1 extubated on ___.

Other findings as described. \n\n【49】Brief Hospital Course:\n The patient arrived intubated but was moving all extremities in  删除换行1 the emergency room and making purposeful movements directed  删除换行1 towards the endothracheal tube. Imaging studies done at the OSH \nshowed multiple facial fractures, a SDH, SAH and a left radial  删除换行1 fracture. Because of the head injury, the patient was started on  删除换行1 keppra.  \n\n【50】Upon admission to the ___, the patient was admitted to the  删除换行1 intensive care unit for vital sign and neurological monitoring.  \nShe developed an episode of hypotension and required dopamine  删除换行1 infusion for cardiovascular support which was weaned off.  The  删除换行1 patient's hemodynamic status remained stable.  A PICC line was  删除换行1 placed on HD #2 because of poor iv access. While in the  删除换行1 intensive care unit, the patient was maintained on ventilatory  删除换行1 support.  The neurosurgery service was consulted and recommended  删除换行1 a repeat head cat scan which remained unchanged. There was a  删除换行1 question of edema and ligamentous injury of C5-C6, as well as  删除换行1 within the paraspinal  and prevertebral soft tissue.  A ___ \ncollar was recommended with neurosurgical out-patient follow-up. \n Because of the multiple facial fractures, the plastic surgery  删除换行1 service recommended surgical intervention after the swelling  删除换行1 subsided.  They also recommended follow-up with the opthamology  删除换行1 service who closely followed the patient  because of a concern  删除换行1 for left optic neuropathy.  To further evalute this, the patient  删除换行1 underwent further testing on the day of discharge.  The patient  删除换行1 was placed on sinus precautions and started on broad spectrum  删除换行1 antibiotics.  She was transitioned to amoxicillin prior to  删除换行1 discharge.  The facial fractures prevented placement of a  删除换行8 ___ tube and an oral gastric tube was placed to provide  删除换行1 nutrition.  The patient's hematocrit decreased on HD #3, likely  删除换行1 reatled to fluid shifts,  and the patient was given 2 units  删除换行1 packed red blood cells. The hematocrit remained stable  删除换行1 throughtout the remainer of the hospital course.  The patient  删除换行1 was successfully weaned and extubated on HD #4 and was making  删除换行1 purposeful movements of all extremities. The patient was  删除换行1 transferred to the surgical floor.   \n\n【51】During the hospital course, the patient had bouts of delirium  删除换行1 which limited participation in daily care.  With the addition of  删除换行1 zyprexa, the patient became more oriented to her surroundings  删除换行1 and by the time of discharge was alert, oriented, and  删除换行1 conversant.   On HD # 9, because of prior failed attempts in  删除换行1 tolerting oral supplements, a speech and swallow study was done  删除换行1 and the patient was cleared for thin liquids and soft ground  删除换行1 solids. \n\n【52】On HD #10, the patient was taken to the operating room for an \nORIF of the left distal radius fracture, left carpal tunnel  删除换行1 release, and a tenotomy of the brachioradialis tendon.  The  删除换行1 operative course was stable with a 20cc blood loss.  The patient  删除换行1 was extubated after the procedure and monitored in the recovery  删除换行1 room.  A sling was applied to the left arm for support and the  删除换行1 patient was started on oral analgesia for post-operative pain.\n\n【53】As part of discharge planning, the patient was evaluated by  删除换行1 physical therapy and recommendations made for discharge to an  删除换行1 extended care facility.  Social worker was available to provide  删除换行1 support to the patient and family. The right PICC line was  删除换行1 removed prior to discharge. \n\n【54】The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on HD \n#13 with stable vital signs. Her electorlytes normalized and the  删除换行1 hematocrit stabilized at 27.  Follow-up appointments were  删除换行1 scheduled with Neurosurgey, Orthopedics, Plastic surgery, and  删除换行1 opthamology.    \n\n【55】Medications on Admission:\nmethimazole 5', ASA 81', ranitidine OTC\n\n【56】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Several apparent poorly defined nodules in the left lung,  删除换行1 concerning for an acute infectious etiology (fungal organisms or  删除换行1 septic emboli) considering absence of nodules on the prior study  删除换行1 of ___ CT.\n\n【14】Brief Hospital Course:\nPatient was initially admitted to Medicine service for an  删除换行1 accelerated workup of potential lung malignancy given CT  删除换行4 findings and symptoms.  A bronchoscopy was performed, which  删除换行1 showed no evidence of malignant pleural effusion but did note  删除换行1 small cell lung cancer.  PET showed evidence of metastatic  删除换行1 disease to the liver and the patient was noted to have elevated  删除换行4 LFTs.  His course on the Medicine service was complicated by  删除换行1 spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (peak uric acid = 18).  The  删除换行1 patient was aggressively rehydrated but in the setting of  删除换行1 continued renal failure was transferred to the Oncology service  删除换行1 to initiate treatment with rasburicase and urgent chemotherapy.\n\n【15】The patient received rasburicase, aggressive hydration, and  删除换行1 began C1 of carboplatin/etoposide on ___ and tolerated this  删除换行1 well.  Despite therapy, the patient's renal function continued  删除换行1 to deteriorate and he became virtually anuric, with ___ cc/day  删除换行1 of UOP.  Additionally, he came severely volume overloaded in the  删除换行1 setting of aggressive IV fluids, which caused an episode of  删除换行1 chest pain with concomitant anterior lead ST depressions on EKG  删除换行4 and a troponin leak to 0.54.  This was discussed with the  删除换行4 Cardiology team, who felt that in the setting of his severe  删除换行1 volume overload, this likely represent heart strain and not  删除换行1 acute coronary syndrome.  No intervention (other than aspirin  删除换行1 administration) was pursued.  His EKG changes later resolved  删除换行1 during his admission.\n\n【16】The patient was initiated on hemodialysis per the Renal team.  \nAn HD line was placed and the patient received ultrafiltration  删除换行1 to remove excess volume, which improved his mobility and  删除换行1 breathing.  The ___ hospital course was further  删除换行1 complicated by neutropenia (likely ___ chemotherapy) and fevers. \n Blood cultures at that time grew out MRSA.  The patient's HD \nline was pulled and the catheter tip was positive for  删除换行4 Staphylococcus, suggesting that this was the likely source.  The  删除换行1 patient was initiated on vancomycin, and per infectious disease  删除换行1 recommendations, should continue this regimen for six weeks  删除换行1 (dosed at HD).  A TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis.  The  删除换行1 patient has a murmur at baseline that did not change in  删除换行1 character.  We opted against TEE given the invasiveness of the  删除换行1 test.\n\n【17】After blood cultures cleared, the dialysis line was replaced and  删除换行1 the patient continued on hemodialysis with ultrafiltration for  删除换行1 volume removal.  Midodrine was added to maintain pressures  删除换行1 during ultrafiltration to enable volume removal.  The patient  删除换行1 did well on this regimen and was assessed by physical therapy,  删除换行1 who recommended rehabilitation at discharge.  Lisinopril should  删除换行1 be continued as an outpatient in the setting of ESRD per Renal  删除换行1 given that he still produces some urine.  The patient's anemia  删除换行1 is being treated with Epogen at time of dialysis.\n\n【18】Briefly around the time of discharge, the patient has had  删除换行1 gradually worsened shortness of breath and cough (without  删除换行1 corresponding hypoxia, fevers, tachycardia, or hypotension) that  删除换行1 could potentially represent a progression of his malignancy, as  删除换行1 these symptoms are similar to the ones he originally presented  删除换行1 with.  CXR revealed L-sided lung nodules suspicious for septic  删除换行1 emboli vs. fungal infection.  Our suspicion for fungal infection  删除换行1 is very low given patient's lack of fevers or other signs of  删除换行1 infection.  We believe septic emboli from the original HD line  删除换行1 during the MRSA bacteremia most likely explain this CXR  删除换行4 findings, and no other intervenion was pursued, as the patient  删除换行1 is already on an appropriate course of vancomycin.  A CT chest  删除换行1 was considered but the patient refused.  After discussion with  删除换行1 his primary oncologist, it was felt that further evaluation  删除换行1 would be deferred to an outpatient setting.\n\n【19】No head imaging has been performed on this patient yet.  An MRI  删除换行4 head was pursued but the patient refused.\n\n【20】The patient has had varying moods and level of cooperativity  删除换行1 during this hospitalization, and it is unclear whether he wants  删除换行1 to continue to pursue chemotherapy at this time.  He wishes to  删除换行1 continue to think about it and discuss it with his family.  The  删除换行1 topic will be re-addressed at his next appointment with his  删除换行1 outpatient oncologists.\n\n【21】Medications on Admission:\nPrednisone 40mg daily (started ___\nMetoprolol 12.5mg twice daily\nAspirin 81mg daily\nIsosorbide Mononitrate ER 30mg daily\nZocor 40mg before bed daily\nNiacin ER 500mg twice daily \nFlovent 110mcg 2 puffs every 12 hours (not taking)\nLisinopril 10mg daily (not taking)\nNitroglycerin dose unknown PRN\nTylenol ___ every 4 hours PRN\nOxazepam 10mg before bed PRN\n删除1：<u>.  </u>\nALLERGIES: NKDA  \n\n【22】Discharge Medications:\n1.

Most likely primary infectious  删除换行1 insult is pyelonephritis (abnormal UA, perinephric stranding on  删除换行1 imaging). She was intubated and placed on the vent. She was  删除换行1 started on CRRT day one for refractory acidosis. She was given  删除换行1 stress dose steroids empirically. She required blood pressure  删除换行1 support with pressors maxing out on norepinephrine, vasopressin,  删除换行1 and epinephrine. Over the course of several days she was  删除换行1 gradually weaned off pressors with some changes in agents based  删除换行1 on perceived need for positive inotropy, although formal TTE \nrevealed that cardiogenic shock was not the primary underlying  删除换行1 problem. Cultures of urine and blood returned negative giving  删除换行1 the diagnosis of culture negative sepsis. She was taken off of  删除换行1 pressors and bridged with midrodine on ___, upon call-out from  删除换行4 MICU midodrine was discontinued. Due to the low concern for MRSA  删除换行4 sepsis, vancomycin was discontinued on day 6 of treatment and  删除换行1 she continued to improve. She completed a 14 day course of  删除换行4 Meropenem for culture negative sepsis. Doxycycline was  删除换行1 discontinued on  ___ as Anaplasma phagocyticum antibodies  删除换行1 returned negative. \n\n【39】#DIC: Patient presented with prolonged bleeding after dental  删除换行1 cleaning, with septic shock, thrombocytopenia, prolonged ___,  删除换行1 low plasma fibrinogen, elevated D-Dimer, schistocytes on smear,  删除换行1 all consistent with DIC, likely provoked by culture negative  删除换行1 sepsis. Hematology consult felt that given her clinical picture,  删除换行1 other causes of DIC such as TTP or APML were unlikely. \nShe got FFP and cryoprecipitate x2 on ___. Hematology  删除换行1 recommended FFP if fibrinogen < 100. Her ___ PTT plt and  删除换行1 fibrinogen was trended and she did not require any further  删除换行1 products. Her coagulation studies remained normal on the floor.\n\n【40】#Acute renal failure: Patient was anuric since arrival. She was  删除换行1 started on CRRT early in her course for refractory acidosis in  删除换行1 the face of a normalizing lactate. Basline creatinine was  删除换行1 unknown, but she has a h/o CKD per records. She was continued on \nCRRT until ___ where it was discontinued with her 1 L positive  删除换行1 for admission. Her HD line in her R IJ was kept in after  删除换行1 stopping CRRT due to concern that patient would need  删除换行1 intermittent HD going forward. She remained nearly anuric as she  删除换行1 was being called out from the ICU. She received intermittent HD  删除换行4 on the floor as she began having little then brisk urine output,  删除换行1 likely reflecting post-ATN diuresis. Her last HD session was on  删除换行8 ___, since then her renal function has steadily improved. Her  删除换行1 temporary HD line was pulled on ___. Creatinine on discharge  删除换行1 was 1.6.\n\n【41】#Hepatic injury: Transaminases peaked in the 1300-1500s on ___  删除换行8 which is time most intense need for pressor support. Hepatocellular (ALT>AST pattern) without cholestasis (normal ALP  删除换行2 and Tbili) are atypical for ischemic hepatopathy though. ALT \ncontinued trending down and nearly normalized as her infectious  删除换行1 injury resolved. HBV and HCV have been ruled out. Leptospira and  删除换行1 anaplasma were ruled out. \n\n【42】#Respiratory Failure: Intubated initially due to concerns for  删除换行1 worsening mental status and inability to protect her airway. Was  删除换行1 put on the ARDSnet protocol. She was Extubated on ___. \n\n【43】# L visual field deficit (resolved): This was transient noticed  删除换行1 on ___ and resolved by ___. Workup with MRI, carotid ultrasound  删除换行1 and EEG was all reassuring that this patient did not have CVA,  删除换行1 seizure, or mass effect. \n\n【44】#Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea: Developed multiple loose bowel  删除换行1 movements on the floor. Was negative for C.difficile NAAT. \nLikely secondary to antibiotic therapy. Was kept on yogurt 1 cup  删除换行1 tid with progressive improvement and resolution at the time of  删除换行1 discharge.\n\n【45】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n===========================\n#Renal function: Creatinine on discharge is 1.6. Unclear  删除换行1 baseline but will need repeat Chem-10 4 days in rehab to assess  删除换行1 creatinine trend. PCP to determine based on plateau whether  删除换行1 patient will have some degree of CKD which may or may not  删除换行1 require her to be followed by a nephrologist.\n#Pulmonary nodules: Multiple small pulmonary nodules are noted  删除换行1 in the lung bases, including a 5 mm perifissural nodule (2:1),  删除换行1 and a 2 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule (2:1).  The 5mm  删除换行1 nodule needs f/u with repeat non-con chest CT scan in 12 months  删除换行1 (___).  \n#Osteoporosis: Age-indeterminate L2 compression fracture  删除换行1 incidentally found on CT Torso. Consider management of  删除换行1 osteoporosis with bisphosphonates or RANKL inhibitors. \n#Congestive heart failure: Please consider starting low dose ACE \ninhibitor as outpatient if continuing improvement in renal  删除换行1 function. In addition, would repeat TTE as outpatient.\n\n【46】#Code Status: DNR, OK to intubate\n#Contact: ___\nRelationship:Son\nCell ___\n\n【47】___ on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Left axis  删除换行1 deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block. Left  删除换行1 atrial abnormality Borderline A-V conduction delay. Right  删除换行1 bundle-branch block. Modest Q-T Interval prolongation.\n\n【30】CXR: ___\nFINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate no  删除换行1 pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  \nProminence of the basilar interstitium is suggestive of a  删除换行1 chronic lung disease.  Streaky atelectasis is also noted at the  删除换行1 bases.  Calcifications within the aortic arch, descending aorta  删除换行1 and arteries of the neck are noted.  The cardiac silhouette is  删除换行1 normal in size. IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. \n\n【31】CXR: ___\nFINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with  删除换行1 patient in semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the  删除换行1 next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during  删除换行1 the same day.  A right-sided pigtail and drainage tube has been  删除换行1 placed through the right lower lateral chest wall and terminates  删除换行1 in right-sided supradiaphragmatic position. Observe that the  删除换行1 line appears kinked a few centimeters proximal to the pigtail  删除换行1 end.  This finding could indicate obstruction of the line. \nComparison with the next previous study, the absence of any  删除换行1 drainage line, the at that time existing massive right-sided  删除换行1 pleural effusion has cleared up almost completely.  Evidence of  删除换行1 left-sided pleural effusion has increased in comparison with the  删除换行1 next previous study. Quantitation of fluid, however, appears  删除换行1 uncertain as more or less increased patient's tilt vary position  删除换行1 of fluid.  The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in  删除换行1 the trachea 3 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax  删除换行1 is seen.  The position of the left-sided internal jugular  删除换行1 approach central venous line is unchanged and terminates in the  删除换行1 mid portion of the SVC at the level of the carina. IMPRESSION:  \nRight-sided pigtail drainage catheter placed in lower pleura  删除换行1 with apparently effective drainage.  Unusual appearance of  删除换行1 pigtail catheter raises suspicion for mechanical obstruction  删除换行1 related to kink.  Clinical correlation recommended.  \n\n【32】RUQ Ultrasound ___\nFINDINGS: The liver is homogeneous in echotexture.  A simple  删除换行1 appearing cyst is seen within the right lobe of the liver and  删除换行1 measures 1.3 cm.  The superior head and neck of the pancreas are  删除换行1 slightly heterogenous in echotexture. The main pancreatic duct  删除换行1 is not dilated.  On doppler examination, normal hepatopetal flow  删除换行1 is seen within the main portal vein.  The spleen is normal. \nThere is a fluid filled gallbladder without cholelithiasis.  \nThere is no gallbladder wall thickening and the common bile duct  删除换行1 is not dilated, measuring 5.4 mm.  There is no intrahepatic  删除换行1 biliary ductal dilation.  A small amount of fluid is seen within  删除换行1 the abdomen and adjacent to the gallbladder.  A sonographic  删除换行8 ___ sign was not elicited. A 5 cm simple appearing cyst is  删除换行1 incidentally noted within the upper pole of the left kidney.  \nThe bladder is markedly distended. \nIMPRESSION: 1.  No evidence for cholecystitis. 2.  Trace amount  删除换行1 of free intra-abdominal fluid. 3.  Superior pancreatic head and  删除换行1 neck heterogenous echotexture is likely from pancreatitis.  No  删除换行1 fluid collections seen, though the tail was not well visualized.\n\n【33】KUB ___\nFINDINGS:  Frontal supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal  删除换行1 radiographs demonstrate gas in the stomach and several  删除换行1 non-dilated loops of small bowel. Mix of gas and stool is also  删除换行1 seen in the right colon. Stool filled cecum appears mildly  删除换行1 dilated measuring 10 cm in diameter.  No air-fluid levels or  删除换行1 free air is seen.  Vascular calcifications are noted. \nIMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with mildly  删除换行1 dilated stool-filled cecum. \n\n【34】Echocardiogram ___\nPoor image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial  删除换行1 septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild  删除换行1 symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular  删除换行1 cavity is small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal  删除换行1 wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left  删除换行1 ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is  删除换行1 probably a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. \nThere is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber  删除换行1 size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic dissection  删除换行1 cannot be excluded (none is seen but image quality is poor). The  删除换行1 aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis  删除换行1 (normal transaortic doppler peak velocity). No aortic  删除换行1 regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly  删除换行1 thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. \nThe pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n\n【35】RUQ Ultrasound ___\nFINDINGS: The liver is homogeneous in echotexture.  The  删除换行1 previously noted cyst within the right lobe of the liver was not  删除换行1 assessed on this limited study.  Again seen is a fluid filled  删除换行1 gallbladder without evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. \n There is no gallbladder wall thickening and the common bile  删除换行1 duct measures .9 cm, slightly enlarged compared to the prior  删除换行1 exam.  There was no evidence of stones within the common bile  删除换行1 duct. Again seen is a small amount of fluid within the abdomen  删除换行1 and adjacent to the gallbladder consistent with ascites.  Note  删除换行1 is also made of presence of a pleural effusion. The spleen  删除换行1 measures 8.6 cm and has homogeneous echotexture. IMPRESSION: 1.  \nFluid filled gallbladder without evidence of cholelithiasis or  删除换行1 cholecystitis.  No evidence of gallbladder necrosis. 2. Slight  删除换行1 increase in the dilatation of the common bile duct now measuring \n删除1：<u>.</u>9 cm, compared to the study on the prior day.  Given the  删除换行1 presence of pancreatitis and slight interval increase in the  删除换行1 size of the common bile duct, a stone at the head of the  删除换行1 pancreas cannot be excluded on this study.  Once the patient is  删除换行1 stable would recommend an MRCP for further evaluation. 3.  \nStable ascites and right pleural effusion.\n\n【36】KUB ___\nFINDINGS:  Frontal supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal  删除换行1 radiographs demonstrate gas within non-dilated loops of small  删除换行1 and large bowel.  Again, a prominent mildly dilated stool-filled  删除换行1 cecum is noted.  No abnormal air-fluid levels or free  删除换行1 intraperitoneal air is seen.  NG tube is curled in the stomach  删除换行1 with the tip pointing superiorly in the region of the fundus. \nIMPRESSION: No significant changes compared to the prior study. \n\n【37】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ with a PMH of hypertension, LVH, primary hyperparathroidism,  删除换行5 DM2 without apparent complications, peripheral arterial disease  删除换行1 that presents with severe pancreatitis (BiSAP score 3) and  删除换行1 admitted to ___ for further care.\n\n【38】#SEVERE PANCREATITIS: The patient was admitted with 1 day of  删除换行1 nausea, vomiting and severe epigastric pain. She was found to  删除换行1 have a lipase ___, lactate 4.0, hct 43 and WBC 12.8. A RUQ \nultrasound was performed in the ED which showed: no evidence for  删除换行1 cholecystitis, trace amount of free intra-abdominal fluid and  删除换行1 superior pancreatic head and neck heterogenous echotexture  删除换行1 likely from pancreatitis and no fluid collections seen, though  删除换行1 the tail was not well visualized. Initial CXR showed no acute  删除换行1 cardiopulmonary process and KUB was largely unrevealing with no  删除换行1 evidence of obstruction or free air. Due to her BiSAP score of 3  删除换行1 she was admitted to the MICU for severe pancreatitis, and a GI \nconsult was obtained. She initially did well after receiving  删除换行1 adequate analgesia and IVF (3 L) in the ED (lactate 4->2),  删除换行1 despite developing a new oxygen requirement. Urine output and  删除换行1 hemodynamics were preserved during the first 8 hours of her  删除换行1 admission. Her new hypoxemia was thought to be due to pulmonary  删除换行1 edema, based on review of past echocardiograms which showed  删除换行1 diastolic dysfunction and LVH. The etiology of her pancreatitis  删除换行1 was unclear, however potentially related to DMII, gallbladder  删除换行1 microlithiasis or thiazide therapy. Late in the evening on HD #1  删除换行1 the patient developed delirium, hemoconcentration and a  删除换行1 progressive lactic acidosis. Aggressive IVF resusitation was  删除换行1 initiated with LR (>10L). She required sedation, intubation and  删除换行1 mechanical ventilation likely due to a combination of ARDS and  删除换行1 pulmonary edema. A left radial arterial line was placed for ABG \nmonitoring and hemodynamic monitoring. Peripheral phenylephrine  删除换行1 was started and a left internal jugular CVL was placed. The  删除换行1 patient developed hypocalcemia, which was repleted. Empiric  删除换行1 antibiotic therapy was initiated with imipenem. Due to her acute  删除换行1 decompensation alternative diagnoses such as gangranous  删除换行1 gallbladder and esophageal perforation were entertained. A \nrepeat RUQ ultrasound showed: fluid filled gallbladder without  删除换行1 evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis and no evidence of  删除换行1 gallbladder necrosis. General surgery and hepatobiliary surgery  删除换行1 were consulted and agreed with the diagnosis of severe  删除换行1 pancreatitis. No acute surgical interventions were recommended. \nVancomycin and fluconazole were added for additional empiric  删除换行1 antimicrobial therapy. A right sided thoracentesis was performed  删除换行1 which showed an elevated amylase, consistent with an effusion  删除换行1 from pancreatitis. The patient eventually required  删除换行1 norepinephrine, vasopressin and phenylephrine drips to support  删除换行1 her hemodynamics. A bicarbonate drip was started for her  删除换行1 progressive acidosis. A family meeting was held and the  删除换行1 patient's extremely grave prognosis communicated; code status  删除换行1 was transitioned to DNR. Nephrology was consulted regarding  删除换行4 CRRT, however no emergent indication for dialysis was met. The  删除换行1 patient expired due to cardiopulmonary arrest on maximum pressor  删除换行1 and ventilatory support.\n\n【39】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Interval increase in size of complex gas containing  删除换行1 collection in the left 删除换行1 hemipelvis with a limb extending into the cul de sac and another  删除换行1 more superior 删除换行1 branch of the fluid collection abutting the uterus.

On HD1-2, patient had increasing abdominal pain  删除换行1 with mild rebounding tenderness with  a stable WBC and lactate.  \nInterventional radiology was consulted and patient received a  删除换行4 CT-guided drainage of the left lower quadrant pelvic collection  删除换行1 which drained purulent fluid. Her antibiotics were changed to  删除换行4 Zosyn. On HD4, a day after her drainage, patient complained of  删除换行1 unimproved abdominal pain, an increase in her WBC to 15.3. After  删除换行1 a long discussion regarding her options for relief of her  删除换行1 condition, it was decided that a surgical removal of her  删除换行1 inflamed/diseased bowel would be beneficial. On HD5, patient was  删除换行1 taken to the operating room and underwent a Sigmoid colectomy ,  删除换行5 ___ procedure and an end colostomy.  The operation was  删除换行1 without complications, and patient tolerated the procedure well. \nShe was extubated immediately after the procedure and was  删除换行1 tranferred to the floor in a stable condition. On POD1, patient  删除换行1 tolerated sips. She had difficulty with pain control for the  删除换行1 next couple of days limiting her mobility and also had slow  删除换行1 return of bowel function. She remained hemodynamicaly stable  删除换行1 with improving WBC and otherwise normal lab results. By POD5,  删除换行1 patient started making flatus and stool through her ostomy and  删除换行1 she was advanced to a clear liquid diet. Patient underwent  删除换行1 another CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis given her slow  删除换行1 recovery and to assess the status of her previous fluid  删除换行1 collections. Findings included multiple ring enhancing fluid  删除换行1 collections in the pelvis, some of which 删除换行1 contain gas with a new hypodense non spherical lesion in segment  删除换行1 8 of the liver not seen on prior examination which could be  删除换行1 perfusion related or reflect inflammation.  Interventional  删除换行1 radiology was consulted again on POD6 and patient underwent  删除换行4 CT-guided aspiration of multiloculated pelvic collection.  A  删除换行4 drain was not placed given the simple appearance of the fluid  删除换行1 and the multiseptated nature of the collection. Patient  删除换行1 tolerated the procedure well. On POD7 patient was advanced to a  删除换行1 regular diet without difficulty and her foley catheter was  删除换行1 removed without event. She continued to receive ostomy teaching  删除换行1 and physical therapy and was cleared for discharge to home with  删除换行1 appropriate ___ services. By POD9, patient was tolerating a  删除换行1 regular diet with adequate ostomy output, demonstrated  删除换行1 independence with her ostomy care,  was hemodynically stable  删除换行1 with normal laboratory values and was ambulated without  删除换行1 difficulty.

On  删除换行1 exam, has L facial droop, and L pronator drift. Found to have a  删除换行4 R frontal IPH on head CT with 5 mm midline shift. He was  删除换行1 admitted to the ICU for monitoring. Etiology of bleed could be  删除换行1 amyloid angiopathy vs HTNsive bleed. MRI brain did not show  删除换行1 extensive evidence of amyloid, although the patient does have a  删除换行1 history of memory decline. His BP may have been in a different  删除换行1 range than normal considering that he had DCed his doxizosin the  删除换行1 week prior to his hemorrhage, (although he had also taken too  删除换行1 much tamsolsin). MRI did not show evidence of underlying mass,  删除换行1 but he should have a repeat MRI in 2 months once blood has  删除换行1 started to resolve to look for underlying structural lesion or  删除换行1 cavernoma. At rehab, the patient should avoid taking any  删除换行1 aspirin, NSAIDs, or blood thinning medication. His blood  删除换行1 pressure should be monitored and blood pressure medications  删除换行1 adjusted as needed, goal is normotension (SBP < 140).\n\n【33】The patient also had symptoms concerning for seizure, with some  删除换行4 R hand shaking followed by L hand shaking. This shaking was felt  删除换行1 to be due to tremor and likely not seizure since he was able to  删除换行1 follow commands with his arms while it persisted. However, he  删除换行1 was evaluated on the afternoon of ___ for decreased  删除换行1 responsiveness and found to have right gaze preference, worsened  删除换行1 perseveration, motor impersistence on the left, and increased  删除换行1 somnolence. Repeat NCHCT showed a stable hemorrhage. It was  删除换行1 thought that he was having seizures of right frontal origin  删除换行1 (with the IPH as a nidus) - totally independent of the  删除换行1 long-standing intermittent arm twitching which may well be  删除换行1 tremor. EEG showed PLEDs but no epileptic activity. The patient  删除换行1 was intitially started on keppra, which did not seem to be  删除换行1 effective, so he was transitioned off of keppra onto phenytoin  删除换行1 instead. He. Phenytoin level at discharged was 9.9, since the  删除换行1 goal is ___, the dose was not adjusted. He should have his  删除换行1 level rechecked on ___ and the dose adjusted as needed for a  删除换行1 goal adjusted level of ___ (need to adjust phenytoin level for  删除换行1 albumin of 3.6 with online calculator).\n\n【34】# Sundowning: the patient became intermittently confused at  删除换行1 night.

It demonstrates T1  删除换行1 hyperintensity to liver parenchyma on in-phase images with  删除换行1 signal loss on  删除换行1 out-of-phase images suggestive of intralesional fat. It is  删除换行1 slightly  删除换行1 hyperintense on T2-weighted images compared to hepatic  删除换行1 parenchyma on axial  删除换行4 T2-weighted fat saturated images 删除1：<u>(series 8, image 15)</u>. Post  删除换行1 gadolinium  删除换行1 injection, the lesion remains isointense to liver parenchyma on  删除换行1 all phases and  删除换行1 is not at all conspicuous. \n\n【28】In addition, there is a 1.6-cm oval arterially enhancing lesion  删除换行1 in segment  删除换行4 II/III 删除1：<u>(best seen on series ___, image 81)</u>. The lesion becomes  删除换行1 isointense  删除换行1 to hepatic parenchyma on the portal venous and delayed phases  删除换行1 and does not  删除换行1 have any corresponding T1 or T2 signal abnormality. There is  删除换行1 adjacent wedge  删除换行1 shaped perfusion heterogeneity. Findings may represent an  删除换行1 arterially  删除换行1 enhancing nodule versus a transient perfusion abnormality. \n\n【29】The liver is enlarged, measuring 17.7 cm in the mid clavicular  删除换行1 line. The left  删除换行1 lobe of the liver extends to wrap around the superior pole of  删除换行1 the spleen. The  删除换行1 surface of the liver is slightly nodular. Overall, there is  删除换行1 patchy/reticular  删除换行1 enhancement of the liver parenchyma consistent with cirrhosis  删除换行1 and underlying  删除换行1 inflammation of the hepatic parenchyma. \n\n【30】There are signs of portal hypertension with multiple varices. \nThe umbilical  删除换行1 vein is recanalized. The portal vein is patent without sign of  删除换行1 thrombosis.  \nThe hepatic artery is relatively large, but demonstrates normal  删除换行1 anatomical  删除换行1 origin and branching. \n\n【31】The spleen measured approximately 20 cm. There is also an  删除换行1 enlarged accessory  删除换行1 spleen in the splenic hilum measuring 3 cm. There is a 1-cm T2  删除换行1 hyperintense  删除换行1 lesion in the tip of the spleen that is obscured by  删除换行1 susceptibility artifact on  删除换行1 the dynamic series and cannot be assessed for postcontrast  删除换行1 behavior, most  删除换行1 probably representing a cyst or a hemangioma. \n\n【32】The gallbladder is unremarkable. No intra- or extra-hepatic  删除换行1 biliary  删除换行1 dilatation. Pancreas is unremarkable, without pancreatic duct  删除换行1 dilatation,  删除换行1 peripancreatic inflammatory changes or signs of chronic  删除换行1 pancreatitis. \n\n【33】There is a small amount of perisplenic and perihepatic ascites. \nThere is no adenopathy. \n\n【34】Kidneys are unremarkable.

He was told that  删除换行1 he most probably has alcoholoc hepatitis. He was, however, lost  删除换行1 to follow up, no liver biopsy was performed and he continued to  删除换行1 consume alcohol. \nMr. ___ now presented to us because of worsening jaundice  删除换行1 w/o any accompanying complaints. His physical examination was  删除换行1 remarkable for stigmata of chronic liver disease . He  删除换行1 did not have symptoms or signs of encephalopathy. Labs on  删除换行1 presentations demonstrated elevated bilirubin, transaminitis and  删除换行1 elevated INR. His MELD score on presentation was 16 and his \nHepatitis Discriminant Function was 34. Mr. ___ was presumed  删除换行1 to have alcoholic hepatitis, this was supported by his history  删除换行1 of alcohol abuse, a reversal of AST:ALT ratio and negative  删除换行1 workup for other causes of hepatitis including hepatitis viruses  删除换行4 A, B and C, alpha 1 anti-trypsin def and hemochromatosis. Work  删除换行1 up for ___ disease included cerruloplasmin levels which  删除换行1 were not depressed, a slit lamp exam which did not demonstrate  删除换行4 K-F rings and a 24 hour urine collection for copper the results  删除换行1 of which were still pending at discharge. Mr. ___ received  删除换行1 no specific treatment. He felt well and was without complaints  删除换行1 throughout his admission and his hepatic function and  删除换行1 coagulation tests improved on observation. At discharge his MELD  删除换行4 score was down to 11.6 and his Hepatitis Discriminant Function  删除换行1 was down to 23. Mr. ___ was advised to abstain completely  删除换行1 from alcohol and will continue outpatient follow up with his PCP  删除换行4 and with the out patient Liver service at ___. Of note Mr. \n___ was found to be immune to HBV and recieved a first dose  删除换行1 of HAV vaccination. He will need a 2nd dose of HAV vaccine  删除换行1 within 6 to 12 months.  \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Fever: Mr. ___ had a temperature of 100.4 upon  删除换行1 presentation to the ED w/o abdominal pain and w/o any other  删除换行1 accompanying complaint except for Jaundice. No acitic fluid was  删除换行1 visualized on US examination. He recieved one dose of  删除换行1 ceftriaxone in the ED due to an initial concern for SBP, this  删除换行1 was not continued on the floor as Mr. ___ continued to be  删除换行1 asymptomatic, without any abdominal tenderness and without  删除换行1 recurrence of fever throughout his admission. Other potential  删除换行1 causes of fever such as UTI and pneumonia were ruled out per  删除换行1 negative UA and CXR. Blood cultures were negative. Mr. ___ \ndoes have small hepatic masses per MRI  and thus HCC  删除换行4 as a cause of fever is not ruled out at this point. Other  删除换行1 possible causes for his transient fever include active hepatitis  删除换行1 or an intercurrent viral infection. \n删除1：<u>.  </u>\n# Liver Masses: MRI of the abdomen demonstrated a 1.3 cm  删除换行1 fat-containing nodule in segment II and a 1.6 cm arterially  删除换行1 enhancing lesion in segment II/III. These lesions are of  删除换行1 undetermined nature. alpha FP was not elevated. A neoplastic  删除换行1 process, however, is not ruled out. Follow up with repeated MRI \nin 3 months is needed. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Esophageal Varrices: EGD was performed and demonstrated  删除换行1 esophageal varrices and gastric venous distention w/o signs of  删除换行1 active bleeding. Nadolol was started for upper GI bleeding  删除换行1 prophylaxis. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Hepatopulmonary Syndrome - Mr. ___ was found to have  删除换行1 orthodeoxia to 93% and exertional desaturation to 88% on room  删除换行1 air. His saturation at rest was normal and he had no tachypnea  删除换行1 or dyspnea at rest. He did, however, report a stable exersional  删除换行1 dyspnea. An echocardiographic bubble study was performed which  删除换行1 was consistent with hepato-pulmonary syndrome. Mr. ___ \nimpressive clubbing and the above respiratory findings raise a  删除换行1 possible differential diagnoses of an underlying primary  删除换行1 pulmonary disorder. Further workup including Pulmonologist  删除换行1 consultation and Pulmonary Function Testing in the out patient  删除换行1 setting was recommened. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Anemia: Mr. ___ was found to have a stable macrocytic  删除换行1 anemia with Hct = 30, MCV =101. His B12 and Folic Acid levels  删除换行1 were wnl. His ferritin level was at the low-normal range. Stool  删除换行1 guiacs were negatives and he had no other sign of active  删除换行1 bleeding. Mr. ___ anemia is most likely multifactorial  删除换行1 secondary to the combination of liver failure, iron deficiency  删除换行1 and hypersplenism. Blood counts will need ___ followed up in  删除换行1 the outpatient setting. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Thrombocytopenia: Mr. ___ was found to have a stable  删除换行1 thrombocytopenia at levels ranging between 50,000 and 65,000. \nThis has been observed for over a year and is m/p secondary to  删除换行1 hypersplenism. Mr. ___ has no history of abnormal bleeding.  \n\n【41】删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Alcohol Abuse: Mr. ___ has a long history of alcohol abuse  删除换行1 w/o seizures or DTs in the past. He had his last drink 1 week  删除换行1 prior to this admission. His serum alcohol was negative on  删除换行1 presentation. His CIWA scores were 0 throughout this admission  删除换行1 and he developed no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The  删除换行1 implications of continued alcohol consumption including  删除换行1 irreversible liver failure and death were discussed and  删除换行1 explained to him and he expressed his determination to abstain  删除换行1 from alcohol. We recommended that he see his PCP for ___  删除换行8 to an alcohol abstention program. Multivitamin, Thiamin and \nBoost nutritional supplement were started. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Dialated cardiomyopathy: echocardiography was obtained due to  删除换行1 a systolic murmur heard on physical exam. A mild enlargment of  删除换行1 the left atrium and moderate dilatation of the left ventricle  删除换行1 were demonstrated without significant valvular dysfunction. LVEF \n= 50-55%. Mr. ___ describes some ___ exertional  删除换行1 dyspnea but otherwise has no signs or symptoms of heart failure. \nThe above echocardiographic findings are consistent with  删除换行1 alcoholic cardiomyopathy. \n\n【42】Medications on Admission:\n1.

She  删除换行1 underwent pre-transplant evaluation but her labs stabilized and  删除换行1 she did not develop acute liver failure. \n\n【25】ACTIVE ISSUES\n-------------------\n\n【26】# Acute Hepatitis: Most likely drug-induced liver injury from  删除换行1 disulfiram. Given elevated AST/ALT in the 2000s, differential  删除换行1 included acute viral hepatitis, ingestion/medication (tylenol,  删除换行1 mushroom), alcohol, ischemia, Budd-Chiari, autoimmune,  删除换行1 hemochromatosis, malignant infiltration, ___. Acetaminophen  删除换行1 and alcohol levels were negative, patient had no hypotension to  删除换行1 suggest ischemic process, ultrasound ruled out budd-chiari, CTA \nruled out liver malignancy. Serologies were unremarkable. \nTransjugular liver biopsy was most consistent with drug-induced  删除换行1 liver injury and showed significant necrosis. \n\n【27】Patient had coagulopathy on arrival but did not have  删除换行1 encephalopathy to suggest fulminant liver failure. MELD was 22. \nDid not meet transplant criteria per ___ criteria. \nShe was treated with NAC in the ICU and transferred to the floor  删除换行1 on ___. Given severity of lab abnormalities and degree of  删除换行1 necrosis on biopsy, patient underwent pre-transplant evaluation. \nShe did not develop confusion and labs stabilized, so she was  删除换行1 not listed for transplant. \n\n【28】Patient's disulfiram was stopped and listed as an allergy. Other  删除换行1 home medications, including psychiatric medications,  删除换行1 minocycline, and Linzess were held. Patient will discuss safety  删除换行1 of resuming these medication at her ___ appointment  删除换行1 with Dr. ___.

Additionally, small pockets of ascites, too small  删除换行1 to tap were seen. Patient was covered with Levaquin and Flagyl  删除换行1 for GI pathogens with improvement in symptoms. Surgery was  删除换行1 consulted and recommended MRCP which showed a cirrhotic liver  删除换行1 with lesions not suggestive of HCC as well as an edematous  删除换行1 gallbladder that was felt to be more c/w portal hypertensive  删除换行1 venous congestion than cholecystitis. Over the course of  删除换行1 admission the patients abddominal pain and diarrhea subsided. \nStool studies and blood cultures were all negative. However,  删除换行1 given the patients initially bandemia, leukocytosis, and  删除换行1 pan-colitis on CT, the patient was discharged to complete a one  删除换行1 week course of levaquin and flagyl.

He did  删除换行1 not have significant withdrawal during hospitalization. Pt was  删除换行1 counseled on importance of abstaining from etoh.\n\n【26】#Pancytopenia: This was felt to be due to the patient's  删除换行1 underlying liver disease/portal hypertension and HCV.

She was seen  删除换行1 throughout her stay by orthopedics and pain management. THere  删除换行1 was also extensive discussion with Interventional Radiology. She  删除换行1 unforunately after her kyphoplasty had extrusion of cement that  删除换行1 was in the spinal canal but not compressing the cord. Throughout  删除换行1 her stay she had very difficult to control left sided mid-back  删除换行1 pain. One reason was her intolerance of many medications. She  删除换行1 had nausea, vomiting, flushing, and fatigue to opiates and  删除换行1 muscle relaxants. She was attempted to be treated with  删除换行1 anti-emetics, however her QTc was prolonged which made treatment  删除换行1 difficult. She initially was treated with topical medications  删除换行1 including capsaicin and lidocaine patch but developed marked  删除换行1 skin irritation. Her pain was attempted to be controlled with  删除换行1 oral medications as well including tizanidine, baclofen, and  删除换行1 dilaudid but while these imprved her pain, she still had pain  删除换行1 that limited her to the point where she could not lie on her  删除换行1 back, sit in a chair, or move from sit to stand. She did improve  删除换行1 after spinal injection with steroids. There was discussion of  删除换行1 repeate kyphoplasty, but there was concern of spinal procedures  删除换行1 destabilizing her other vertebrae and putting her at more risk  删除换行1 of addtional fractures. Orthopedics was asked about the  删除换行1 possibility of removal of the cement, but they thought that any  删除换行1 procedure on her spine was dangerous given how soft her bones  删除换行1 were. They did recommend she be in TLSO brace at all times. She  删除换行1 was evaluated by ___ who noted that she still retained enough  删除换行1 functional strength that she did not need inpatient ___. She was  删除换行1 discharged with a new pain regimen, home ___, recommendation to  删除换行1 continually wear the TLSO brace, and close follow up with her  删除换行1 outpatient pain team to continue management and to decide if she  删除换行1 needed further surgical intervention.\n\n【25】#Osteoporosis - Patient had presented with a diagnosis of  删除换行1 osteoporosis with confirmation previously with DEXA scan based  删除换行1 on outpatient records. In hospital she had multiple images  删除换行1 consistent with osteoporotic bones. She had a family history of  删除换行1 osteoporosis. Initially there was concern that her symptoms  删除换行1 could be related to a malignancy, however, upon contacting the  删除换行1 neurosurgeon who had treated her previously, she had a negative  删除换行1 bone biopsy during her previous kyphoplasty. Her SPEP/UPEP were  删除换行1 not  consistent with multiple myeloma. Her recent MRI of her  删除换行1 spine and her xrays of hips and ribs did not show any  删除换行1 destructive lesions consistent with malignancy. Additionally her  删除换行1 calcium remained normal during her stay. Her rheumatologist had  删除换行1 planned to start Prolia for her osteoporosis, which should be  删除换行1 continued after she was discharged from the hospital. She was  删除换行1 continued on her calcium and vitamin D. \n\n【26】#Hypovolemic Hyponatremia - She was initially hyponatremic in  删除换行1 setting of decreased PO intake. She was dry on exam, and this  删除换行1 resolved with fluids making the most likely reason a prerenal  删除换行1 etiology. \n\n【27】#Hypothyrodism - She appeared euthyroid and was continued on her  删除换行1 levothyroxine\n\n【28】#CAD s/p CABG - She remained asymptomatic and was continued on  删除换行1 her statin and aspirin.\n\n【29】#Hypertension - She remained normotensive and was continued on  删除换行1 losartan and nifedipine.\n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

A midline was placed in order  删除换行1 to facilitate continued IV cefepime treatment after discharge to  删除换行1 rehab.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Atrial fibrillation:  the patient has not previously had known  删除换行1 a-fib, but the exact time of onset was not clear.  She had a  删除换行1 recent echo on her last hospitalization, showing normal EF,  删除换行1 normal left atrium.  This study was not repeated.  She was given  删除换行1 multiple liters of IV fluid in the first 24 hours after  删除换行1 admission, and started on IV diltiazem.  Diltiazem appeared to  删除换行1 improve rate control initially, but it was held once for  删除换行1 hypotension, held again for altered mental status overnight  删除换行1 (likely hospital-induced delirium), and despite max does of  删除换行1 diltiazem she remained persistently tachycardic.  Metoprolol was  删除换行1 then started, first at very low doses with good response, but  删除换行1 this also proved to be unsuccessful in fully controlling her  删除换行1 heart rate.  She was given several fluid boluses for clinical  删除换行1 dehydration, but this did not significantly help with rate  删除换行1 control.  Finally on ___ it was decided to start digoxin -  删除换行1 this decision was informed partly by Ms. ___ son in law  删除换行1 (who is a physician) explaining that she has a significant  删除换行1 history of depression, and that he would be concerned about  删除换行1 increasing the beta blocker dose too high in that context.  She  删除换行1 was given a loading dose of 500 mcg digoxin that evening, and on  删除换行1 re-evaluation 6 hours later her heart rate remained stably in  删除换行1 the normal range, so no further loading doses were given.  She  删除换行1 was discharged to rehab on ___ with continued atrial  删除换行1 fibrillation, with rate mostly in the 70's and 80's\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Strength, deconditioning:  The patient's daughter and son in  删除换行1 law expressed their concern at her level of deconditioning  删除换行1 during her last hospitalization.  We attempted to arrange some  删除换行1 physical therapy, or at least moving from bed to chair, but her  删除换行1 persistently rapid heart rate during much of her stay made this  删除换行1 difficult. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Hypertension:  the patient was continued on her usual regimen  删除换行1 of lisinopril, but losartan and HCTZ were held in the setting of  删除换行1 new antihypertensive agents.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Recent history of admission for back pain:  seen in ___  删除换行8 clinic after discharge, reports that her back pain is now  删除换行1 resolved.

She was continued on  删除换行1 digoxin, metoprolol, and diltiazem, with a plan to taper down  删除换行1 the diltiazem dose after discharge.\n\n【15】Medications on Admission:\n1.

Left  删除换行1 ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic  删除换行1 function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical  删除换行1 quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully  删除换行1 excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed  删除换行1 free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at  删除换行1 the sinus level. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly  删除换行1 dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). \nThere is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  删除换行1 seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial  删除换行1 mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic  删除换行1 pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate sized  删除换行1 circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic  删除换行1 signs of tamponade. \n\n【15】IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular  删除换行1 cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function. Right  删除换行1 ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. \nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable  删除换行1 for review) of ___, a small-moderate circumferential  删除换行1 pericardial effusion is now present. The severity of tricuspid  删除换行1 regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic  删除换行1 pressure are now reduced. \n\n【16】___ 09:35AM BLOOD WBC-14.8* RBC-2.79* Hgb-7.8* Hct-23.8*  删除换行11 MCV-85 MCH-28.0 MCHC-32.8 RDW-16.8* Plt ___\n___ 09:35AM BLOOD ___ PTT-37.2* ___\n___ 09:35AM BLOOD Glucose-119* UreaN-25* Creat-0.6 Na-140  删除换行11 K-4.0 Cl-98 HCO3-35* AnGap-11\n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ was admitted and given Vitamin K for an INR 6.7.  He  删除换行1 remained on bed-rest until INR came below 5.  His echo revealed  删除换行1 a small, 1.2 cm circumferential pericardial effusion without  删除换行1 evidence of tamponade. Sternal erythema was noted and IV  删除换行4 vancomycin and oral cipro were started.  Additionally, he  删除换行1 developed small, fluctuant collections of the sternal incision.  \nThese were incised and drained to reveal blood and serous fluid. \n There was no pus or evidence of infection.  He remained on  删除换行1 antibiotics and wound was the packed. His INR continued to drift  删除换行1 down.  The erythema continued to progress on antibiotics and the  删除换行1 sternum became unstable.  The patient was brought to the  删除换行1 operating room on ___ for sternal exploration and  删除换行1 debridement with a vacuum dressing placement.  He underwent a  删除换行1 subsequent debridement on ___ with the plastic surgery  删除换行1 service.  On ___ he had a third debridement with a vacuum  删除换行1 dressing placement.

He was seen in consultation by the ID service for an \nOR culture that grew pseudomonas and for c.diff (PCR positive)  删除换行1 diarrhea.  He was placed on oral Vancomycin and ceftazapine.  He  删除换行1 was started on TPN due to poor oral intake.  He was started on  删除换行1 wellbutrin to help with smoking cessation and any depression  删除换行1 that may be inhibiting his poor oral intake.  Coumadin was  删除换行1 started for atrial fibrillation and history of pulmonary  删除换行1 embolism, but due to his extreme sensitivity toward coumadin,  删除换行1 only low doses were used and INR was checked daily. His  删除换行1 permanaent pacemaker was interrogated secondary to what appeared  删除换行1 to be oversensing, but the electrophysiology service felt that  删除换行1 it was pacing appropriately to APCs.  He complained of a painful  删除换行1 abdomen but was given maalox with resolution of his symptoms. By  删除换行1 post-operative day 25 he was ready for discharge to rehab.

Given her sudden decline with cancer and  删除换行1 chemotherapy complications which would contraindicate further  删除换行1 treatment the decision was made to focus on her comfort and  删除换行1 dignity and attempt to get her home with hospice care. However,  删除换行1 given her rapidly declining clinical status, it was felt that  删除换行1 she was too unstable to transport home. Family were asked to  删除换行1 come and medical care was transitioned to focus on comfort and  删除换行1 dignity. She passed ___ at 2:10PM with family at bedside.\n\n【23】Course was complicated by the issues below:\n# Hypotension and tachycardia: She initially met ___ SIRS \ncriteria with tachycardia, hypotension, elevated Cr and lactate. \nHypotension was thought to be due primarily to extensive  删除换行1 bleeding from site of enterocutaneous fistula/malignant lesion. \nShe was transfused with 2units PRBCs and platelets. Infection  删除换行1 was initially considered. Potential sites of infection are  删除换行4 Port-A-Cath, as well as large, fungating enterocutaneous  删除换行1 fistula. She was given 25 g 5% albumin for fluid resuscitation,  删除换行1 lactate was trended to normal levels. She was given empiric  删除换行1 vancomycin and zosyn to cover GI flor and MRSA/skin flora, as  删除换行1 well as potential post-obstructive pneumonia.

Drained during last  删除换行1 admission, cytology negative for malignant cells. ___ still be  删除换行1 malignant, or related to hypoalbuminemia. In order to provide  删除换行1 comfort at home, a thoracentesis with drainage catheter was  删除换行1 placed by interventional pulmonology. \n\n【25】# Thrombocytopenia: recent increase in pazopanib may be  删除换行1 contributing. She was transfused for platelets <30 and active  删除换行1 bleeding. Given concern for dramatic drop in platelets prior to  删除换行1 admssion there was also concern for HIT and DIC. DIC labs were  删除换行1 borderline normal and HIT labs were pending at time of  删除换行1 discharge. All heparin products were discontinued and port  删除换行1 flushes where changed to sodium citrate.\n\n【26】# Anemia: element of chronic disease together with bloody  删除换行1 fistula output. She was transfused with 2units PRBC for active  删除换行1 bleeding and low Hgb.\n\n【27】# Abdominal pain: patient has a history of a large, metastatic  删除换行1 leiomyosarcoma, complicated by enterocutaneous fistula. Recent  删除换行1 discussions with her outpatient oncology team were centered  删除换行1 around still wanting to continue with treatment, however,  删除换行1 hospital referral admission note included mention of palliative  删除换行1 care. After discussion of goals of care, she was changed to CMO,  删除换行1 and was treated for pain with hydromorphone and oxycodone.\n\n【28】# Metastatic leiomyosarcoma: Recently on chemotherapy with  删除换行1 pazopanib. After discussions with oncology and palliative care,  删除换行1 her decline in functional status and enterocutaneous fistula  删除换行1 precluded further chemotherapy.\n\n【29】# Mucositis: likely secondary to chemotherapy.

There is no spondylolisthesis  删除换行1 or vertebral STIR abnormality to suggest acute fracture. Normal  删除换行1 spinal cord signal characteristics are maintained. There is no  删除换行1 evidence of mass lesion or abnormal enhancement to suggest  删除换行1 metastatic disease. There is multilevel heterogeneous bone  删除换行1 marrow signal predominantly involving the vertebral endplates  删除换行1 which are irregular and presumably related to degeneration.\n\n【14】At C1-2 and C2-3, there is no significant central canal or  删除换行1 neural foraminal stenosis. \n\n【15】At C3-4, the disc space is narrowed and there is hyperintense  删除换行4 STIR signal of and mild enhancement of the disc. The adjacent  删除换行1 vertebral endplates show degenerative irregularity but no edema  删除换行1 or enhancement. A broad-based disc bulge and facet hypertrophy  删除换行1 cause bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, moderately severe on  删除换行1 the left and moderate on the right. There is mild central canal  删除换行1 stenosis.\n\n【16】At C4-5, a left paracentral disc protrusion along with facet  删除换行1 hypertrophy causes moderate left neural foraminal stenosis. \nThere is mild right neural foraminal stenosis. In combination  删除换行1 with ligamentum flavum thickening, there is moderate central  删除换行1 canal stenosis.\n\n【17】At C5-6, a mild broad-based disc bulge causes mild bilateral  删除换行1 neural foraminal stenosis and mild central canal stenosis. \n\n【18】At C6-7, a mild broad-based disc bulge and uncovertebral  删除换行1 hypertrophy causes bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, moderate  删除换行1 on the left and mild on the right. There is mild central canal  删除换行1 stenosis. \n\n【19】At C7-T1, uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet hypertrophy cause  删除换行1 mild-to- moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis but no  删除换行1 significant central canal stenosis.\n\n【20】IMPRESSION:\n\n【21】1. No evidence of fracture, spondylolisthesis, or mass lesion.\n\n【22】2. Edema and mild enhancement of the C3-4 disc without  删除换行1 involvement of the adjacent vertebral endplates is probably  删除换行1 inflammatory and related to degenerative changes.\n\n【23】3.

The mid LAD was calcified 删除换行1 and had a 90% stenosis at the origin of a septal branch.\n\n【21】LCX:  The LCX had minor lumen irregularities in the proximal and 删除换行1 distal segment.   There was a large OMB that supplied the 删除换行1 posterolateral myocardium.   There was a medium sized left 删除换行1 posterolateral branch that was also free of disease.   The LCx 删除换行1 terminated in small left PL branchs that supplied the inferior 删除换行1 myocardium. \n\n【22】RCA:  The RCA was a small vessel and gave rise to a small PDA 删除换行4 that supplied the inferior basal portion of the myocardium.  \n\n【23】Interventional details\nThe patient presented to the catheterization laboratory with 删除换行1 chest pain and a positive stress test for anterior ischemia (ST 删除换行2 depression) consistent with unstable angina. \n\n【24】The procedure was performed from the right radial artery.  He 删除换行1 developed radial spasm with use of a ___ Fr Guiding catheter and 删除换行1 the equipment was downsided to a ___ Fr XB3.5 guiding catheter  删除换行1 that 删除换行1 did not cause discomfort.   Heparin, 5000U, was given at the 删除换行1 initiation of the procedure, and double bolus eptifibatide was 删除换行1 given for PCI.  The ACT was > 300 seconds. \n\n【25】Using a 2.5 mm balloon and a 0.014 BMW wire, the mid LAD was 删除换行1 dilated.  A 2.5 mm x 12 mm Promus Premier would not cross the 删除换行1 stenosis and a 3.0 mm balloon was inflated to 12 atms.  This  删除换行1 then 删除换行1 allowed crossing of the mid LAD with a 2.5 mm x 12 mm Promus 删除换行4 Premier drug-eluting stent and this was deployed to 16 atms. \nPost dilatation was performed using 3.0 mm balloon to 20 atms.  \nThe resulted in no residual stenosis and TIMI 3 flow into the 删除换行1 distal vessel.  \n\n【26】The 80% stenosis in the distal LAD was directly stented with a\n2.25 mm x 15 mm Resolute stent to 8 atms.   There was a focal 删除换行1 narrowing more proximally and a 2.25 mm x 9 mm Resolute stent  删除换行1 was 删除换行1 placed more proximally.  The distal stent was then post dilated 删除换行1 with the 2.25 mm balloon to 12 atms.  This resulted in no 删除换行1 residual stenosis within the stent.   There was a 40% dynamic 删除换行1 distal stenosis that was unchanged from prior to examination.  \nThis was not stented due to the dynamic nature of the vessel in 删除换行1 this region. There was no edge dissection at the distal edge of 删除换行1 the stent. \n\n【27】ASSESSMENT \n\n【28】1. Single vessel coronary artery disease\n2. Successful drug-eluting stent of the mid and distal LAD\n\n【29】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with history of recent unstable  删除换行1 angina in setting of abnormal exercise stress who presents for  删除换行1 aspirin desensitization in anticipation of cardiac  删除换行1 catheterization. Pt s/p cath without complications with DES to  删除换行1 mid and distal LAD.  \n\n【30】ACUTE PROBLEMS:\n# Aspirin Desensitization: The patient presented with a history  删除换行1 of localized urticarial rash in response to aspirin use. Given  删除换行1 unstable angina, it was determined that he would benefit from  删除换行1 lifelong aspirin. An aspirin desensitization protocol was  删除换行1 performed with close monitoring in the CCU as follows: \npremedicated with montelukast 1 hr prior to first dose of ASA,  删除换行1 followed by 10 sequential escalating doses of ASA finishing with  删除换行1 325, with epi and diphenhydramine PRN. The patient had two  删除换行1 itchy, urticarial hives on the top of his head when given the  删除换行4 Aspirin 325 which went away with Benadryl. Given this failure of  删除换行1 desensitization, allergy was consulted who recommened  删除换行1 pre-medicating the patient with Loratidine and Montelukast and  删除换行1 the patient tolerated aspirin well. He was continued on  删除换行4 Loratidine and Montelukast through the rest of the hospital stay  删除换行1 and was told to stop 2 days after discharge. The patient was  删除换行1 advised to restart the Loratidine and Montelukast if at any  删除换行1 point he developed rash while on aspirin in the future.   \n\n【31】# Unstable Angina:\nThe patient was admitted with evidence of new unstable angina  删除换行1 for the past two weeks. An abnormal stress test performed at an  删除换行1 outside institution further suggested the presence of CAD.  The  删除换行1 patient underwent aspirin desensitization protocol which was  删除换行1 successful. On ___, patient underwent a left heart  删除换行1 catheterization which showed an 80% occlusion of the distal LAD  删除换行4 for which he received 3 drug eluting stents to the mid to distal  删除换行4 LAD. The rest of the vessels were patent. He will be continued  删除换行1 on aspirin and Plavix as an outpatient. He was started on  删除换行4 Atorvastatin 80, and continued on Lisinopril 5. A beta blocker  删除换行1 was held   删除换行1 given the patient's bradycardia. \n\n【32】CHRONIC PROBLEMS:\n\n【33】# Asthma: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma that is  删除换行1 currently well-controlled. There was no evidence of acute  删除换行1 exacerbation during this hospitalization. He was continued on  删除换行1 home Albuterol and Symbicort. \n\n【34】# HTN: Blood pressures were well controlled. He was continued on \nLisinopril 5. \n\n【35】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n- Patient was advised to not stop his aspirin or plavix for any  删除换行1 reason. If he develops hives, he should restart Montelukast and  删除换行4 Loratidine.  \n\n【36】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

They were prepared to send the  删除换行1 patient home; however, his EKG showed new ST depressions in the  删除换行1 lateral leads, and given his history of CAD, he was admitted to  删除换行1 medicine for further workup of his cardiac issues. He was given  删除换行1 the first dose of Keppra and ASA in the ED, and his VS at the  删除换行1 time of transfer were P 68, BP 119/81, R 18, O2 98% on RA.  \n删除1：<u>.  </u>\nOn the floor, the patient states that overall he feels very  删除换行1 well, but he was concerned about the event that happened this  删除换行1 morning.

Complicated by lower  删除换行1 extremity edema, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy. MELD on  删除换行1 admission 29, up from 25 in ___. MELD remained at this level  删除换行1 throughout hospitalization. Likely contracted Hep C from blood  删除换行1 transfusion in ___ during ectopic pregnancy. Underwent  删除换行1 expedited transplant workup due to progressive liver  删除换行1 disfunction. Had pre-transplant lab tests, endoscopy,  删除换行1 colonoscopy, pulmonary function tests, echocardiogram (normal  删除换行1 biventricular function), PAP smear (negative), abdominal and  删除换行1 chest imaging, and surgical tooth extractions (extraction of  删除换行1 teeth numbers 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 28). Mammogram obtained from  删除换行4 OSH. Accepted by transplant committee but not listed as she  删除换行1 developed severe pancytopenia with ANC <1000. \nHematology/oncology who believed pancytopenia was secondary to  删除换行1 antibiotics (as she was started on cefepime after tooth  删除换行1 extractions as she developed fever and likely transient  删除换行1 bacteremia in the setting of teeth extractions). Please see \n\"Pancytopenia\" for further explanation of pancytopenia course. \n\n【50】As part of pre-transplantation, patient had a CT chest with  删除换行1 contrast. Results of the CT chest showed \"diffuse mediastinal  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy.that could be due to inflammatory, infectious,  删除换行1 or neoplastic etiology.\" Also CT chest showed \"masslike  删除换行1 appearance of lower thoracic esophagus.\" To further assess the  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy and ?esophageal mass, she underwent Upper EUS. \nThe Upper EUS did not reveal any esophageal mass. A biopsy of a  删除换行8 ___ subcarinal mediastinum lymph node was performed. \nimmunophenotyping of the lymph node showed findings that \"raise  删除换行1 the concern for, but are not diagnostic of a possible B-cell  删除换行1 lymphoproliferative disorder.\" A PET-Scan was performed which  删除换行1 showed \"unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy with low level  删除换行1 uptake. These may be reactive in nature. Scattered  删除换行1 abdominal/periportal lymphadenopathy with low level uptake,  删除换行1 likely sequelae of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Periapical  删除换行1 lucency and focus of FDG uptake in the left maxilla concerning  删除换行1 for dental disease/abscess.\" Dental was consulted and panorex  删除换行1 was ordered to asses ?left maxilla dental disease/abscess who  删除换行1 did not believe there was any infection present. \n\n【51】Given immunophenotyping concerning for a possible B-cell  删除换行1 lymphoproliferative disorder, Hematology/Oncology was  删除换行1 re-consulted. They believed the lymphadenopathy was most likely  删除换行1 reactive. However they performed a bone marrow biopsy on ___ as  删除换行1 was essential for her candidacy. Bone marrow biopsy results were  删除换行1 pending at the time of discharge. Additionally, final biopsy  删除换行1 results of the ___ subcarinal mediastinum lymph node  删除换行1 were pending at the time of discharge. \n\n【52】**MELD AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE 28** Total bilirubin 7.8, INR \n3.5, Cr 0.4. \n\n【53】# Volume Overload Secondary to Cirrhosis: Patient presented on  删除换行1 furosemide 20 mg PO every other day and spironolcatone 50 mg PO \ndaily.

There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  An  删除换行1 opacity at the right hilus could represent pulmonary congestion;  删除换行1 although, infection cannot be excluded.  There are small  删除换行1 bilateral pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Chronic rib  删除换行1 deformities on the right are noted.  No displaced acute rib  删除换行1 fracture identified. Dual chamber pacemaker in unchanged  删除换行1 position. \n\n【21】Echo ___: \nConclusions\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial  删除换行1 pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular  删除换行1 hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional  删除换行1 left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the  删除换行1 inferolateral, inferior, and inferoseptal walls. The remaining  删除换行1 segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). [Intrinsic left  删除换行1 ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the  删除换行1 severity of mitral regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber  删除换行1 size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. \nThe diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels  删除换行1 are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> are mildly thickened  删除换行1 but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation  删除换行1 is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. \nThere is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)  删除换行1 mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery  删除换行1 systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small  删除换行1 circumferential pericardial effusion. \n\n【22】IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with  删除换行1 normal cavity size and regional systolic dysfunction c/w  删除换行1 multivessel CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation most  删除换行1 likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction. \n\n【23】Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,  删除换行1 regional biventricular systolic dysfunction is now more  删除换行1 extensive and the severity of mitral regurgitation is increased. \n\n【24】CXR ___:\nCONCLUSION:  Hazy obscuration of the central pulmonary  删除换行1 vasculature and left hemidiaphragm suggesting CHF, though no  删除换行1 interstitial lines are visible. \n\n【25】CXR ___:\nIMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: \n\n【26】Severe widespread somewhat asymmetric pulmonary opacification  删除换行1 probably  删除换行1 pulmonary edema in most lung regions, but I cannot exclude  删除换行1 pneumonia or  删除换行1 pulmonary hemorrhage in the left perihilar and lower lung zone.  \nCardiomegaly is moderate to severe.  Transvenous right atrial  删除换行1 and ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left  删除换行1 axillary power pack.  Pleural effusions are presumed, and could  删除换行1 be small but not large.  No pneumothorax. \n\n【27】AVF Duplex ___:\nIMPRESSION:  Occluded right upper extremity arteriovenous  删除换行1 fistula.\n\n【28】CXR ___:\nAP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to  删除换行8 ___. \n\n【29】Cardiomegaly is unchanged as well as the mediastinal contour.  \nWidespread  删除换行1 parenchymal opacities with predominantly perihilar distribution  删除换行1 have minimally improved since the prior study and are still  删除换行1 substantial.  Clearance of the left lung base is noted.  Small  删除换行1 pleural effusions are most likely present.  There is no  删除换行1 pneumothorax and the pacemaker leads appear to be in unchanged  删除换行1 position. \n\n【30】CXR ___:\nIMPRESSION: 1.  On the initial view, the Dobbhoff feeding tube  删除换行1 appears to be coiled just above the gastroesophageal junction.  \nOn the second projection, the tube now traverses below the  删除换行1 diaphragm with the tip coiled within the stomach.  Dual-lead  删除换行1 left-sided pacer remains in place.  The heart remains stably  删除换行1 enlarged.  There continues to be a bilateral interstitial and  删除换行1 parenchymal process which is not significantly changed and may  删除换行1 reflect pulmonary edema, although underlying interstitial lung  删除换行1 disease should also be considered.  There are likely small  删除换行1 layering effusions.  No pneumothorax. \n\n【31】CXR ___:\nIMPRESSION: 1.  Feeding tube and left-sided dual-lead pacer  删除换行1 remain in place.  Stable cardiac enlargement. Calcification of  删除换行1 the aortic knob and descending aorta consistent with  删除换行1 atherosclerosis.  Overall, there continues to be a diffuse  删除换行1 bilateral interstitial abnormality but when compared to a prior  删除换行1 study dating ___ at 8:02, the degree of interstitial  删除换行1 abnormality has substantially subsided, and therefore these  删除换行1 findings are suggestive of resolving pulmonary and interstitial  删除换行1 edema.  There is a persistent deformity of the right lower  删除换行1 ribcage consistent with previous fractures.  No large effusions. \n No evidence of pneumothorax. \n\n【32】PERTINENT MICRO:\n================\n\n【33】BCx: NGTD x2\nUCx: NGTD\n\n【34】DISCHARGE LABS:\n===============\n\n【35】___ 06:27AM BLOOD WBC-11.1* RBC-3.67* Hgb-11.0* Hct-35.5*  删除换行11 MCV-97 MCH-30.1 MCHC-31.1 RDW-13.1 Plt ___\n___ 06:27AM BLOOD ___ PTT-46.1* ___\n___ 06:27AM BLOOD Glucose-214* UreaN-120* Creat-5.2* Na-145  删除换行11 K-4.3 Cl-100 HCO3-22 AnGap-27*\n___ 06:27AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-8.9* Mg-2.8*\n\n【36】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is an ___ with history of CAD, CHF with diminished  删除换行4 EF, atrial fibrillation, and CKD presenting with worsening  删除换行1 dyspnea and cough c/w heart failure decompensation.  On  删除换行8 ___, the patient went into PEA arrest and expired.\n\n【37】CARDIAC ARREST NOTE:\n====================\n\n【38】(Copied from OMR, see note by ___ dated ___ for  删除换行1 full details):\n\n【39】\"At approximately 8:15pm today, I was called to the bedside by  删除换行4 RN of Mr ___. He had apneic breathing at a rate of  删除换行1 approximately 8 breaths per minute, and had a dusky appearance. \nHe was on CPAP at the time. He was found to be pulseless. A \n\"code 删除换行1 blue\" was called and CPR was initiated immediately. It was our  删除换行1 understanding from previous conversations with the family and  删除换行4 HCP that he and they would want everything done. He initially  删除换行1 was in PEA arrest, and coded per PEA ACLS algorhythm. His rhythm  删除换行1 then became ventricular fibrillation, and he was shocked  删除换行1 multiple 删除换行1 times. After approximately 30 minutes of CPR, all indicated  删除换行1 medications, and multiple rounds of defibrillation, his rhythm  删除换行1 was asystole and the code was called. Time of death was recorded  删除换行1 as 8:45pm on ___. The attending physician of record was  删除换行1 notified. \n\n【40】The family was alerted and was at the bedside within 30 minutes. \nThey were not present in time to witness the code. We debriefed  删除换行1 extensively with the family afterwards. They expressed  删除换行1 significant concern that, prior to the code, one daughter 删除换行1 reported finding the patient without an oxygen delivery device. \nI was not present during this event but my understanding is that  删除换行1 the patient may have pulled off the O2 delivery device secondary  删除换行1 to his acute confusional state of the last several days, and  删除换行1 that the oxygen delivery was promptly put back on. This was 删除换行1 approximately 60 minutes prior to the code, when he was on CPAP  删除换行4 with adequate oxygenation, and I do not believe played a role in  删除换行1 the PEA arrest. I explained this to the family and believe they  删除换行1 are in agreement.\" \n\n【41】ACTIVE ISSUES:\n==============\n\n【42】# CHF exacerbation: \nHistory of ischemic CHF with EF 40% in ___, admitted with  删除换行1 evidence of volume overload on exam and vascular congestion on  删除换行1 imaging in setting of atrial fibrillation with heart rates from  删除换行1 100-120. Diuresis was initially attempted with high-dose  删除换行1 furosemide IV, though significant urine output was not achieved. \nHis initial respiratory status was tenuous, requiring 5LNC. An  删除换行1 echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated a further-reduced  删除换行4 EF of 30% with worsening (now severe) mitral regurgitation. The  删除换行4 Heart Failure team was consulted, and he was transferred to the  删除换行4 CCU for diuresis with a lasix gtt.  He briefly required BiPAP  删除换行4 for worsening respiratory status with ___  删除换行8 respirations; however, his mental status deteriorated and he  删除换行1 could not tolerate BiPAP.  He was maintained on high-flow (FiO2  删除换行1 70%) face tent.\n\n【43】# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Creatinine on presentation  删除换行1 was up to 3.7 from baseline ~3.0, thought to be most likely  删除换行1 secondary to poor renal perfusion in setting of CHF \nexacerbation.  Suitable diuresis with boluses of Lasix and  删除换行4 Metolazone, as well as a Lasix gtt, could not be achieved.  \nDialysis was initiated during this admission.\n\n【44】# COPD: The patient's CXR was suggestive of chronic lung changes  删除换行1 given large lung volumes and flat diaphragms. The patient was  删除换行1 continued on his home regimen which was supplemented by nebs. He  删除换行1 did not have significant wheeze on exam, thus a COPD \nexacerbation was not considered to be a primary process. \n\n【45】# Fecal incontinence: Family concerned about fecal incontinence \nX 3 wks.

Evaluation through the lower lung is  删除换行1 limited due to underpenetrated technique.  Allowing for this, no  删除换行1 definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusions are  删除换行1 seen. Aorta is unfolded.  The heart size is within normal  删除换行1 limits.  The bony structures appear intact. \nIMPRESSION:  Limited, negative. \n\n【24】CT Head ___ - FINDINGS:  There is no acute intracranial  删除换行1 hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial  删除换行1 infarction.  There is no shift of normally midline structures.  \nPeriventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are  删除换行1 compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  \nVentricular and sulci are prominent, compatible with age-related  删除换行1 involutional changes.  Imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air  删除换行1 cells are well aerated.  There is no fracture. \nIMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. \n\n【25】UE U/S ___ - FINDINGS: \nThere is normal gray scale appearance with compression,  color  删除换行4 Doppler flow, and spectral Doppler waveforms of the right  删除换行1 subclavian, axillary, and brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins. \n Numerous thyroid cysts in the right thyroid lobe are  删除换行1 incompletely assessed. \nIMPRESSION: No DVT in the right upper extremity. \n\n【26】CXR ___ - Heart size is top normal.  Mediastinum is within  删除换行1 normal limits.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural  删除换行1 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.   \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality  删除换行1 demonstrated. \n\n【27】CTA CHEST ___ - Dense atherosclerotic mural calcifications  删除换行1 are present along the thoracic aorta.  The aorta is of normal  删除换行1 caliber without aneurysm or dissection.  Contrast bolus is  删除换行1 suboptimal for evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary  删除换行1 arteries.  The main, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries are  删除换行1 opacified without filling defect.  A linear hypodensity through  删除换行1 a right lower lobe medial basal subsegmental pulmonary artery  删除换行1 (4:106, 502a:65), which is not expanded, may be artifactual.  \nBovine arch is incidentally noted. \nCHEST:   The visualized portion of the thyroid is unremarkable.  \nNo axillary, supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar  删除换行1 lymphadenopathy.  Dense calcification is present in the left  删除换行1 anterior descending, circumflex, and right main coronary  删除换行1 arteries.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Trace pericardial  删除换行1 effusion is similar to prior. \nMild to moderate upper zone predominant centrilobular emphysema  删除换行1 is similar to ___.  4 mm perifissural right middle lobe  删除换行1 nodule is stable since ___.  No new pulmonary nodule.  \nThere is bibasilar dependent atelectasis, similar to prior.  No  删除换行1 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or  删除换行1 pneumomediastinum. \nAirways are patent to subsegmental levels.  The esophagus is  删除换行1 normal.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of the  删除换行1 subdiaphragmatic organs.  Within this limitation, the visualized  删除换行1 upper abdominal organs are unremarkable. \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion  删除换行1 concerning for  删除换行1 malignancy. \nIMPRESSION: \n1.  Quality of contrast bolus allows exclusion of pulmonary  删除换行1 emboli up to the segmental pulmonary arteries.  Filling  删除换行1 heterogeneities within the pulmonary arteries beyond this level  删除换行1 are equivocal.  Curvilinear hypodensity within a right lower  删除换行1 lobe medial basal subsegmental pulmonary artery may be  删除换行1 artifactual, but a subacute pulmonary embolism is not entirely  删除换行1 excluded. \n2.  Mild upper zone predominant centrilobular emphysema. \n3.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Three-vessel coronary artery  删除换行1 calcification. \n4.  4-mm right middle lobe perifissural pulmonary nodule, with  删除换行1 demonstrated two year stability since ___.\n\n【28】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ with a h/o COPD on 3___, s/p resp arrest in ___, HTN, DM,  删除换行1 dementia, schizoaffective d/o, tardive dyskinesia presents for  删除换行1 worsening ambulation, confusion, dyspnea.\n\n【29】# Altered Mental Status: Concern for slowing of speech and  删除换行1 slowness to respond on admission, though it appears per  删除换行1 communication with PCP and family that this has been a subacute  删除换行1 to chronic process. UA unremarkable for UTI, and CXR limited but  删除换行1 w/o evidence of pna. Electrolytes were normal. CT head w/o  删除换行1 bleed, and neuro exam w/o focal deficits. Patient was not  删除换行1 delerious, but could converse really in few word responses.  \nPsych was consulted and they recommended continuing to hold the  删除换行4 Olanzapine. She seemed to tolerate the Perphenazine. While this  删除换行1 can cause TD, they recommended outpatient ___ with her  删除换行1 psychiatrist.  Neuro was consulted for AMS and concern for  删除换行1 possible truncal weakness.  They found no reason to EEG or MRI.  \nPer review of old psych notes, pt has had word finding and  删除换行1 memory difficulties. H/o schizoaffective d/o.  TSH, B12 and  删除换行4 Folate were normal.  Initially tetrabenzapine was discontinued. \nHowever, pt's family reports that pt needs this medication for  删除换行1 her tardive dyskinesias. Mental status was continuing to improve  删除换行1 at the time of fall.\n\n【30】# Worsening ambulation, fall: No focal defecits on neuro exam,  删除换行1 head CT unremarkable.  ___ & OT consults were placed.  The  删除换行1 patient is being discharged to rehab for continued physical  删除换行1 therapy.\n\n【31】# Urinary inc, frequent voiding: UA/Ucx neg. Foley catheter  删除换行1 placed in ED was taken out. Could be related to underlying  删除换行1 cognitive impairment. Per family happened 1 month ago as well.\n\n【32】# Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation-Pt with severe COPD on 3L \nNC at baseline. Pt appeared to be at her baseline status ___  删除换行8 word sentences and intermittent tachypnea that family reported  删除换行1 was worse in the evenings. Pt did have several episodes of acute  删除换行1 dyspnea/tachypnea often in the evenings during admission. EKG's  删除换行1 were unchanged. Cardiac enzymes were normal. CTA of the chest  删除换行1 did not show any large PE and there were never any clinical  删除换行1 signs of pneumonia. It was discovered that combivent had  删除换行1 erroneously been on the patient's medication allergy list. She  删除换行1 had been taking this medication QID at home without any  删除换行1 difficulities. She was therefore, started on steroids and  删除换行1 nebulizer therapy. With this, her respiratory status improved.\n\n【33】# DM 2: Pt was continued on home lantus, ISS was continued. \nMetformin was held while in-house and restarted on discharge. Of  删除换行1 note, Lantus was uptitrated ___ hyperglycemia in the setting of  删除换行1 steroids. This will likely need to be readjusted after her  删除换行1 steroid burst is complete.\n\n【34】#HTN - Home diltiazem was continued. Hydralazine was  删除换行1 added/uptitrated for better blood pressure control. BP was still  删除换行1 noted to be elevated at the time of discharge. If blood pressure  删除换行1 remains elevated, diltiazem will likely need to be further  删除换行1 increased.\n\n【35】#Schizoaffective d/o - Olanzapine stopped\n\n【36】#Sleep Apnea - on CPAP\n\n【37】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Pt with new leukocytosis on the day of discharge. \nAsymptomatic, afebrile. Likely related to steroid burst. Please  删除换行1 repeat CBC ___ days after discharge to ensure stability.\n- Please monitor BP's and uptitrate diltiazem as needed.\n- Please monitor fingersticks. Lantus has been increased for  删除换行1 better glucose control. However, after steroid burst is  删除换行1 complete, pt's Lantus dose will likely need to be decreased.\n- Pt with a cognitive neuro ___ appt scheduled for ___ \n___. Also with an upcoming ___ appt .\n- Pt will need PCP ___ appointment at the time of discharge from  删除换行1 rehab.\n\n【38】Medications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Family/CaregiverwebOMR.\n1.

Exertional desaturation, lung crackles,  删除换行1 and boarderline pulmonary edema on presentation argued for some  删除换行1 degree of left heart involvement. Diuresis was started with a  删除换行1 lasix drip and continued for 4 weeks until ___. Good response  删除换行1 with daily goal ___ neg. Creatinine never rose. Eventually  删除换行1 transitioned IV pushes before home dose of PO lasix started on  删除换行8 ___.

ECHO and Right Heart Cath on  删除换行8 ___ are mentioned in results. Pt was changed back to his home  删除换行1 regimen of lasix 80mg PO BID with the new addition of  删除换行1 spironolactone two days before discharge. He was achieving a net  删除换行1 negative output for two days on this regimen before discharge.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n#删除2：<u>. </u>Hemoptysis:\nPt had intermittent cough which started to be productive of  删除换行1 small amounts of blood. Pt was on either warfarin or heparin gtt  删除换行1 while experiencing this trace hemoptysis. Pulmonary saw pt in  删除换行1 consult and lung imaging was obtained which did not show  删除换行1 evidence of pulmonary process. All anticoagulation was stopped  删除换行1 for the period of 1 week and hemoptysis resolved, but reocurred  删除换行1 within 24hrs of reinitiation of heparin gtt. When ENT saw pt  删除换行1 regarding vocal cord paralysis they described traumatic changes  删除换行1 to both nares likely caused by prolonged use of a nasal cannula. \nBecause of this and the patient's report that he often felt  删除换行1 bloody tasting drainage at the back of his throat, he small  删除换行1 amount of hemoptysis was believed due to dry upper airway  删除换行1 mucosa, worsened when pt was on anticoagulation.

Pt was placed on tiotropium and  删除换行1 fluticasone/salmeterol inhalers with PRN short-acting coverage  删除换行1 while inpt. Initially required supplementary O2 both at rest and  删除换行1 with exertion, but after large volume diuresis was satting  删除换行1 between 90-96% on RA at rest and rarely used O2 throughout day. \nThe day before discharge patient was able to tolerate 5 minutes  删除换行1 of ambulation which brought his heart rate up to 130s without  删除换行1 dropping his room air sat below 94%. As a result it appears  删除换行1 unlikely that pt needs daytime supplementary oxygen s/p the  删除换行1 large volume diuresis from this hospitalization.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Lower Extremity Edema/Wounds: \nMost likely ___ to heart failure.

There, her systolic blood  删除换行1 pressures were reportedly around 260s, and she was placed on a  删除换行1 nitroglycerin drip. Her CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema,  删除换行1 and bedside echo was concerning for EF around ___. She was  删除换行1 also placed on lasix for concern for new HF and pleural  删除换行1 effusion.  She required BiPAP for her SOB but was not intubated. \nShe was subsequently transferred to ___, where she was  删除换行1 admitted to the ICU. She was weaned off BIPAP to NC, and  删除换行1 nitroglycerin gtt was weaned as well. Her blood pressures were  删除换行1 controlled with labetalol, valsartan, and the lasix she received  删除换行1 for diuresis. She was diuresed with IV lasix 80, transitioning  删除换行1 to 80 mg po by discharge. She did have a formal TTE that showed  删除换行4 EF 40-45%, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, mild LV  删除换行4 concentric hypertrophy, and restrictive physiology with  删除换行1 depressed global longitudinal strain. EKG showing no evidence of  删除换行1 ischemia to suggest ischemic etiology of new heart failure. \n\n【28】#HFpEF with restrictive physiology: patient's  删除换行1 hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory distress, BNP 35___ at  删除换行1 admission, and pulmonary edema were concerning for HF \nexacerbation as above. TTE was consistent with EF 40-45% and was  删除换行1 also notable for restrictive physiology as stated above. She may  删除换行1 have had HFpEF prior to this admission, although these echo  删除换行1 findings are new and are likely the result of hypertensive  删除换行1 emergency. As above, she was placed on aspirin 81, pravastatin  删除换行1 80 mg qHS, labetalol, valsartan, lasix 80 mg \n\n【29】#T2DM: Her blood sugars were controlled with NPH, which was  删除换行1 transitioned to glargine by the time of discharge. Of note, she  删除换行1 was on much higher dose of glargine (36U) in outpatient setting  删除换行1 than were required inpatient. The suspicion is that she has been  删除换行1 noncompliant with glargine as an outpatient and that her true  删除换行1 insulin requirements are lower. This explains her complaint of  删除换行1 hypoglycemia when she takes her insulin at home. \n\n【30】#Troponinemia: Patient noted to have troponins to 0.___hanges on EKG concerning for STEMI. This most likely  删除换行1 represents demand in setting of HF exacerbation, hypertensive  删除换行1 urgency, and ___.\nShe was continued on aspirin, statin, BB, ___ as above. \n\n【31】#Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr is 0.6. She presented with  删除换行1 creatinine to 1.0. This was felt to be due to hypertensive  删除换行1 emergency versus complication of poorly controlled diabetes. Her  删除换行8 ___ was initially held but restarted prior to discharge.\n\n【32】#Anemia: Hgb 12.1 four months prior to admission, 9.0 on  删除换行1 presentation.  Fe studies consistent with ACD most likely in  删除换行1 setting of DM and HTN.\n\n【33】#Microscopic hematuria: found on U/A, most likely secondary to  删除换行1 pyuria, urine cultures negative.

The diameters of  删除换行1 aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The  删除换行1 aortic valve leaflets 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> appear structurally normal with good  删除换行1 leaflet excursion and minimal aortic stenosis. Trace aortic  删除换行1 regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are  删除换行1 structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The  删除换行1 tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] \ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic  删除换行1 pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial  删除换行1 effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular  删除换行8 ___ systolic function. Type Ia left ventricular  删除换行1 diastolic dysfunction with elevated left ventricular  删除换行1 enddiastolic pressure and mild to moderate left atrail  删除换行1 enlargement.

Unclear etiology, but  删除换行1 differential includes seizure vs. orthostatic hypotension vs. \nmechanical vs. cardiogenic. This could also be related to  删除换行1 increased narcotic use prior to fall. History of seizure  删除换行1 disorder and subtherapeutic depakote raises suspicion for  删除换行1 seizure. Neurology was consulted and recommended prolonged EEG  删除换行4 which showed predisposition to seizures but no epileptic  删除换行1 activity. He was given IVFs for orthostais. He was monitored on  删除换行1 telemetry without event and troponins negative x 2. ECHO  删除换行4 obtained and without significant valvular disease. He had no  删除换行1 further events while in hospital. Olanzapine changed to prn as  删除换行1 can lower threshold and patient did not require.\n\n【36】# Hypoxia/Aspiration Pneumonia: New oxygen requirement, focus of  删除换行8 ___ opacities in the left lower lobe, and rhonchi on  删除换行1 exam raised concern for aspiratin pneumonia. He was treated with  删除换行1 levofloxacin, D1 ___ for planed 7 day course to end on  删除换行8 ___. Patient was weaned from oxygen prior to discharge.\n\n【37】# C7 vertebral body fracture: Seen on imaging. MRI c-spine  删除换行1 obtained without evidence of ligamentous injury. Ortho spine  删除换行1 followed and recommended ___ C-collar to be worn at all  删除换行1 times, although may be removed to eat if necessary. Duration of  删除换行1 collar will be determined at ortho follow up on ___.\n\n【38】# Anemia: Patient noted to have guiac positive emesis in ED with  删除换行1 no further episodes on admission. However, Hct down trended  删除换行1 throughout hospitalization to 25.2 (baseline per nursing home  删除换行1 facility ___. He was also noted to have guiac positive brown  删除换行1 stool. He was started on PO BID PPI. GI was consulted who felt  删除换行1 no intervention necessary at this time. The patient was  删除换行1 hemodynamically stable throughout and required no transfusions.\n\n【39】# Seizure disorder: Subtherapeutic depakote level on admission. \nNeurology consulted. EEG obtained which showed predisposition to  删除换行1 seizure but no epileptiform activity. He was continued on home  删除换行1 regimen of oxcarbazepine 300mg QAM/450mg QHS and divalproex \n___ BID. Neurology recommended taper of patient divalproex  删除换行1 given subtherapeutic level not felt to be helping and only  删除换行1 leading to potential side effects. Taper recommendations as  删除换行1 follows: short acting depakote formulation 50mg TID x 1 week  删除换行1 followed by 25mg TID x 1 week and then stop. Outpatient  删除换行1 neurology follow up set up prior to discharge.\n\n【40】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n# CKD: Near baseline (recent baseline at facility 1.5-1.6). Cr  删除换行1 on discharge 1.7.\n\n【41】# Dementia: Patient with baseline confusion, history of  删除换行1 psychosis. Initially slightly more confused than baseline,  删除换行1 however mental status improved prior to discharge. On discharge  删除换行1 patient was alert, interactive, and oriented x ___ (self and  删除换行1 hospital).

Despite several doses of D50 blood sugars  删除换行1 remained ___ at ED.  She does not have history of DM, does  删除换行1 not take insulin or hypoglycemic agents, and does not have  删除换行1 history of hypoglycemia.  She was started on D10 drip which was  删除换行1 continued in ICU untiil sugars were consistently in 100s.  Drip  删除换行1 was stopped and sugars remained in normal range.  She was  删除换行1 tolerating po without difficulty.  Endocrine was curbsided in ED \nwho recommended sending pro-insulin, sulfonylurea, C-peptide,  删除换行1 beta-hydroxybutyrate levels.  TSH and cortisol were checked  删除换行1 given concern for panhypopituitarism.  AM cortisol was wnl; TSH  删除换行4 was low but free T4 within normal range.  There was some  删除换行1 suspicion that she ___ have accidentally been administered  删除换行1 insulin at rehab, which the rehab denied. Possible infectious  删除换行1 causes were investigated but CXR and U/A were unremarkable.  \nBlood cultures were sent, which are both no growth to date.  EKG  删除换行4 was unremarkable.  Only possible source of infection were ulcers  删除换行1 on dorsum of both feet which were treated per below.\n\n【31】While on the floor, the patient's blood sugars were checked  删除换行1 every four hours initially, then spaced out to q8h.  The patient  删除换行1 maintained her sugars between 85-200.  After discharge, it was  删除换行1 found that the patient's c-peptide levels were elevated.  The  删除换行1 patient's grand daughter and the patient's PCP were both  删除换行1 contacted, as there is concern that the patient ___ have an  删除换行1 insulinoma.

She was  删除换行1 ultimately started on bactrim/keflex for presumed cellulitis.  \nHowever, on transfer to the floor, the decision was made to d/c  删除换行1 antibiotics, as the patient remained afebrile.  The patient is  删除换行1 also s/p ORIF--> there was a thought of posisbly having infected  删除换行1 hardware in the setting of elevated CRP/ES; however, plain film  删除换行1 of the hip was negative for any acute hardware complications.  \nHer CRP and ESR should be repeated as an outpatient.\n\n【33】# Cellulitis: Pt had an ulcer on dorsum of each feet with dried  删除换行1 blood; no active purulent draiange.  While in the MICU, it was  删除换行1 noted that the surrounding skin was erythematous and warm to  删除换行1 touch.  After lactate had normalized, she was started on bactrim  删除换行1 and keflex for cellulitis.  Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) were  删除换行1 checked which were elevated.\n\n【34】While on the floor, the patient was seen by podiatry who  删除换行1 recommended wet to dry dressing for the R ulcer, and collagenase  删除换行1 for  ulcer.  A plain film of her feet were both negative for  删除换行1 osteomyelitis or any fractures.  Because the patient was  删除换行1 afebrile with white count normalizing, the patient's antibiotics  删除换行1 were discontinued.  It was thought that her initial elevated  删除换行1 white count could be a stress response to the state of  删除换行1 hypoglycemia.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# foot ulcers: While in the MICU, it was initially thought there  删除换行1 was some surrounding erythema that could be consistent with  删除换行1 cellulitis around each foot ulcer, and the patient was started  删除换行1 on Bactrim/Keflex.   On the floor, the patent had plain films of  删除换行1 her feet which were normal.  Podiatry was consulted and  删除换行1 recommended collagenase to the L ulcer and wet to dry dressings  删除换行1 to the R foot ulcer.

While in house the  删除换行1 patient's Lasix was held.  She was instructed to restart her \nLasix as an outpatient.  This should also be followed up as an  删除换行1 outpatient. \n\n【36】Transitional Issues: \n- The patient was found to have an elevated C-peptide, which  删除换行1 suggests that there was endogenous insulin secretion; she will  删除换行1 have to have an endocrine evaluation, including imaging, to  删除换行1 assess for an insulinoma. The patient's PCP was contacted with  删除换行1 this information, as was the patient's grand daughter ___.  \nThe patient was made a follow-up appt with ___ for further  删除换行1 work up of this insulinoma on ___.  The patient's  删除换行1 granddaughter was also cautioned about the signs/symptoms of  删除换行1 hypoglycemic events and that fast administration of sugar is  删除换行1 necessary, as well as immediately calling an ambulance and  删除换行1 bringing the patient to the emergency room for evaluation. \n\n【37】- The patient will need to have a CRP/ESR repeated as an  删除换行1 outpatient.  \n\n【38】- The patient is not currently on a bisphosphonate in the  删除换行1 setting of her recent hip fracture.

FINDINGS: From T10-11  删除换行1 to L5-S1 level and in the upper sacral region no evidence of  删除换行1 epidural abscess or intraspinal mass identified. There is disc  删除换行1 bulging identified at T12-L1 level with a small central  删除换行1 protrusion best visualized on the sagittal images as the axial  删除换行1 images do not cover this area. There is no evidence of  删除换行1 significant compression of the thecal sac seen. From L1-2 to  删除换行4 L5-S1 level no significant disc bulge, herniation or spinal  删除换行1 stenosis seen. Schmorl's nodes are seen in the superior  删除换行1 endplates from L2 to L5 vertebral bodies and upper sacrum. This  删除换行1 is an incidental finding. No marrow edema or compression  删除换行1 fracture is identified.

No obvious cause for his seizure could be identified. He was started on levetiracetam 1000mg BID. Initial leukocytosis  删除换行1 with PMN predominance resolved after transfer to ___, and can  删除换行1 likely be attributed to his seizure. EEG performed after  删除换行1 admission was normal. MRI Head showed marked improvement from  删除换行1 last MRI in ___ with no new lesions. Lumbar puncture performed  删除换行1 on ___ showed ___ WBC with lymphocyte predominance, 41 prot,  删除换行1 46 gluc. (On initial presentation to ___ in  删除换行2 ___, his CSF had 550 WBCs.) The patient is afebrile without  删除换行1 meningismus. Extensive work-up during his ___ ___ \nshowed no evidence of CSF infection. During this admisison, CSF \nEBV PCR (patient has had positive serum EBV IgG in the past)and  删除换行4 MS ___ were sent. Serum ACE was also sent as sarcoid was on  删除换行1 the differential. It could be CSF pleocytosis is due to his  删除换行1 recent seizure. Alternatively, the patient could have MS, and  删除换行1 this might explain his seizure in addition to increased CSF WBC. \nThe patient had no oligoclonal bands on initial evaluation in  删除换行8 ___.\n删除1：<u>.</u>#Neurology- ?cervical cord disease: The patient has Lhermitte's  删除换行1 sign (reports sensation of vibrations running down his body  删除换行2 during neck flexion). MR ___ spine showed minimal residual  删除换行1 hyperintensity in the dorsal spinal cord, nearly completely  删除换行1 resolved compared to prior exam, with no abnormal enhancement. \nAt this point, seems sensory symptoms are most consistent with  删除换行1 residual cervical cord disease due to ADEM. Multiple sclerosis  删除换行1 profile and neuromyelitis optica evaluation were sent.  \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n#DVT PPx: Patient has history of saddle pulmonary embolism. INR remained at 1.1-1.3 despite increasing warfarin to 7.5mg from  删除换行1 his previous home dose of 5mg. Warfarin dose was therefore  删除换行1 further increased to 10mg. There is some concern for a  删除换行1 hypercoagulable disorder as patient developed PE after only  删除换行1 several days of hospitalization in ___. SPEP and UPEP were  删除换行1 performed in ___ and were normal and were again checked during  删除换行1 this hospitalization. We will send Factor V Leiden and  删除换行1 prothrombin gene mutation (can't eval Protein C, Protein S or  删除换行2 ATIII as patient is on warfarin and enoxaparin). These results  删除换行1 will be reviewed with patient during his follow-up appointment  删除换行1 with Dr. ___.

Per  删除换行1 discussion with ___ ___, patient at  删除换行1 baseline has very limited movement in RUE and RLE, and now has  删除换行1 had significant muscle atrophy of those extremities. She does  删除换行1 however ambulate with a cane but has had several falls at prior  删除换行1 assisted living facilities. Regarding her fall etiology, cardiac  删除换行1 etiologies were possible but less likely. EKG with TWI but no  删除换行1 prior to compare to. Bradycardia with no evidence of heart  删除换行1 block. Reassuring that trop negative x2. TTE was deferred given  删除换行1 low concern for AS (no murmur on exam, patient not likely  删除换行1 exerting herself at home). Given patient's prior CVA, subsequent  删除换行1 stroke possible but CT head was negative for acute process. Rest  删除换行1 home was able to endorse that dysarthria/aphasia and right  删除换行1 hemiparesis were baseline. MRI and carotid ultrasound were  删除换行1 deferred given a stroke that causes syncope without new neuro  删除换行1 deficits would be less likely. Also not thought to have had  删除换行1 seizure given history. CT without evidence of PE. Also had  删除换行1 slight leukocytosis but no evidence of UTI (now resolved) or  删除换行1 pneumonia as a precursor to decompensation. She was seen and  删除换行1 evaluated by physical therapy prior to discharge, who  删除换行1 recommended rehabilitation.\n\n【42】#Increased CK\nUnclear etiology, but possibly second to fall and being down for  删除换行1 several hours. Given 500cc NS. CK initially 232, downtrended  删除换行1 upon discharge.\n\n【43】#leukocytosis:\nUnclear etiology and occurred on admission UA without evidence  删除换行1 of UTI and UCx with no growth. CT without evidence of pneumonia  删除换行1 or colitis. Afebrile but neutrophilic predominance. Could be ___  删除换行8 to stress response given fall. Patient remained afebrile during  删除换行1 hospital course.\n\n【44】#positive blood cultures\nBlood cultures from ___ grew coagulase negative  删除换行1 staphylococcus. Given that the first report of the blood  删除换行1 cultures was gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, the  删除换行1 patient was placed on IV vancomycin. However, blood culture grew  删除换行1 coagulase negative staph so given her lack of fever or  删除换行1 localization, was believed to be a contaminant. No  删除换行1 fevers/leukocytosis once the patient's vancomycin was  删除换行1 discontinued.\n\n【45】#Left distal extremity erythema: erythema on distal left arm not  删除换行1 warm to palpation. No signs of thrombophlebitis. IV discontinued  删除换行1 and patient's exam improved.\n\n【46】#Bullae on right upper extremity:\nPt with blisters on left upper arm.

Upon speaking with ___, the patient 删除换行1 did not have these blisters last week. Furthermore, with eye 删除换行1 symptoms, concern for SJS, especially since per her NP, 删除换行1 gabapentin was a new medication. Bullae isolated to 删除换行1 her arm, no oral mucosal lesions, and reassuring that LFTs  删除换行1 negative, making a drug reaction less likely. Given that bullae  删除换行1 on erythematous base, some concern for cellulitis, but patient  删除换行1 did not develop fevers or progression of rash, even off  删除换行1 vancomycin so believed to be secondary to trauma from fall. \ngiven swelling and erythema in arm ___ RUE ultrasound negative  删除换行1 for arm DVT.\n\n【47】#eye pain:\nPt complained of eye pain and had mild conjunctival injection. \nIn 删除换行1 speaking with ___ and her NP, she has had eye pain 删除换行1 previously but not injection. Intact ROM and reactive pupils  删除换行1 made orbital cellulitis and glaucoma unlikely. Fundoscopic exam  删除换行1 unremarkable. Will have patient follow up as an outpatient.\n\n【48】#Hypernatremia. Na 146 ___ from 141 on ___. Possibly related 删除换行1 to poor free water intake. Resolved without intervention.\n\n【49】#Abdominal pain:\nUnclear events surrounding the fall. CT-Torso with no acute 删除换行1 intra-abdominal findings. Patient's complaints inconsistent. H 删除换行4 and H stable so no evidence of intra-abd bleed.

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for  删除换行1 signs of bleeding, of which there were none. Given left groin  删除换行1 hematoma, a soft tissue ultrasound was performed to ensure  删除换行1 integrity of vascular structures in proximity to the access  删除换行1 site. This showed a relatively small hematoma in the area with  删除换行1 no pseudoaneurysms and appropriate vascular waveforms. Given  删除换行1 reassuring findings, patient was cleared to be discharged to  删除换行1 home. She was started on aspirin and Plavix and instructed to  删除换行1 continue treatment until instructed otherwise. \n\n【16】At the time of discharge, Mrs ___ was doing well, afebrile  删除换行1 with stable vital signs.

She had tachycardia around 100-110s at  删除换行1 rest with worsening up to 160s with ambulation; there is no  删除换行1 change in blood pressure. Patient described occasional dyspnea  删除换行1 on exertion at home with this, and darkening of vision though  删除换行1 never syncope. \nCTA for PE was negative. Electrocardiogram pre and post walking  删除换行1 showed sinus tachycardia, no arrythmia. Her orthostasis was  删除换行1 mildly responsive to fluids, but not considerably and she  删除换行1 appeared euvolemic throughout. She was given 1 unit of packed  删除换行1 red blood cells, which decreased the sensation of palpitations  删除换行1 and pounding in her ears, though did not resolve them, and did  删除换行1 not change heart rates. Repeat TTE ___ showed inferobasal  删除换行1 hypokinesis unchanged from prior. TSH normal. AM cortisol was  删除换行1 normal. She had had a 1.3cm right ventricular mass noted on  删除换行1 prior cardiac MRI, though repeat cardiac MR this admission  删除换行1 showed no mass and review of the original scan is suggested  删除换行1 there may not have been a mass, but instead, a prominent  删除换行1 moderator band. \n\n【22】Patient was seen by cardiology, who diagnosed orthostasis with  删除换行1 sinus tachycardia, and suggested fluid repletion, compression  删除换行1 stockings, and outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___. She was  删除换行1 also evaluated by neurology, in particular, Dr. ___ who is  删除换行1 an expert in autonomic dysfunction. She went for autonomic  删除换行1 testing and results are pending at time of discharge though the  删除换行1 team suggested that they had no concerns about her discharge. \n\n【23】On discharge, the patient continued to have tachycardia to the  删除换行1 160s with activity, though her resting heart rate sitting  删除换行1 upright significantly decreased from the time of admission, to  删除换行1 the ___. Furthermore, she reported less palpitations, no  删除换行1 dyspnea or decreased vision. It was felt that symptoms in part  删除换行1 related to anemia, and that her orthostasis was multifactorial,  删除换行1 including fluctuating fluid status, deconditioning, effect of  删除换行1 recent chemotherapy, and possible small fiber neuropathy and  删除换行1 autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic testing will be following up by  删除换行1 outpatient oncologist, as will further symptoms. No new  删除换行1 medications were started.\n\n【24】ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES\n====================\n# Sinus tachycardia\n# Orthostasis\n# Palpitations\nPresentation as above. Afebrile, not neutropenic, no signs or  删除换行1 symptoms of infection and negative cultures and chest xray. TSH,  删除换行5 AM coristol were normal. She was given 2L in the ED without  删除换行1 improvement in symptoms or orthostatic signs. She received 1U \nPRBC with mild improvement in symptoms. Patient reported that  删除换行1 she had frequent urination as well as nocturia, so workup was  删除换行1 pursued for diabetes insipidus and was negative for such. This  删除换行1 is most likely due to polydipsia. Cardiology and neurology were  删除换行1 consulted as above. Etiology of symptoms likely caused by both  删除换行1 anemia and orthostasis. And orthostasis was multifactorial,  删除换行1 including fluctuating fluid status, deconditioning, effect of  删除换行1 recent chemotherapy, and possible small fiber neuropathy and  删除换行1 autonomic dysfunction.\n\n【25】#History of right ventricular mass\nRight ventricular mass was noted during previous admission. She  删除换行1 is now completed additional chemotherapy and no further mass was  删除换行1 noted on repeat cardiac MRI this admission. Cardiologist we read  删除换行1 the prior cardiac MRI, and called the initial finding into  删除换行1 question. They suggested there may be more prominent moderator  删除换行1 band rather than an intracardiac mass.\n\n【26】#Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nPatient recently completed cycle 3 DA-EPOCH-R, which she  删除换行1 tolerated well. Prophylaxis with Bactrim and acyclovir were  删除换行1 continued. \n\n【27】CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES\n======================\n# History of pulmonary embolus\nDiagnosed ___. None on CTA this admission. She was continued  删除换行1 on study dalteparin ___ units daily.\n\n【28】# Fertility Preservation: She continues on monthly leuprolide at  删除换行1 maintenance dosing, last received on ___.\n\n【29】# Vitamin D Deficiency: As she was mildly hyperphosphatemic,  删除换行1 vitamin D level was checked and was low normal.
