Her symptoms gradually improved and started \nto tolerate oral intake with transition of medications to oral \nregimen. Constipation seemed to be a likely cause of her \nsymptoms which resolved once constipation resolved. CTA \nabdomen-pelvis didn't show mesenteric ischemia.  showed increase \nin size of left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm which was \nevaluated by vascular surgery. CTA lower extremity was done per \nvascular surgery recommendations for further outpatient \nmanagement to be preceeded by a cardiology clinic visit for \n___ evaluation. She is discharged home in stable \ncondition. \n\n【20】#Abdominal pain: Likely due to constipation.  Patient has had \nextensive work-up for abdominal pain in the past, including CT \nabd, EGDs, Colonoscopy, EGD/EUS showing slightly atropic \npancreas which did not meet criteria for chronic pancreatitis. \nCTA abdomen was negative for mesenteric ischemia. Diet was \ngradually advanced as tolerated along with transitioning her \nanti-nausea and pain medications from IV to PO. She was able to \ntolerate food without nausea and her pain was well controlled. \nWe continued PPI and ranitidine. She was instructed to take \nsenna and colace standing doses and to hold if develops > 2 \nloose stools per day.

On ___ ___ \ngiven hypoxemia, patient was transferred to the MICU for \nstabilization and further workup of underlying etiology of \ndestabilization. On ___ AM the patient received a bronchoscopy \nand biopsy of her lung mass. This bronchoscopy was complicated \nby an arterial bleed that did not resolve with tamponade. She \nwas brought to interventional radiology suite for ___ \nembolization of the bronchial artery. This embolization was \nsuccessful. Patient received a unit of platelets and two units \nof pRBCs during this time and was brought back to ICU. However, \nshe continued to have bleeding sunctioned in her ET tube . She was transferred to the FICU on ___ for urgent \ninitiation of chemotherapy. She self-extubated on arrival and \nwas reintubated successfully. She underwent treatment with \ncisplatin and dose reduced etopiside. She received pre/post \nhydration, mannitol and dexamethasone with cisplatin. She was \nmonitored closely with tumor lysis labs. After chemotherapy the \npatient developed neutropenia and was placed on the appropriate \nprecautions. She was transferred to the MICU to enable further \nprocedures by IP or bronchs. Her neutropenia resolved with \nfilgastrim, however she received a few transfusions of blood and \nplatelets (unclear if pancytopenia was only due to chemo versus \nbone marrow infiltration by cancer).A non-contrast head CT was \nobtained for further workup or metastasis but there were no \nrelevant findings and an MRI was recommmended but this was \ndeffered as patient unable to lay flat in scanner and would \nlikely not change treatment. The patient was eventually stable \nenough to be transferred to the oncology floor. She was \ncontinued on 4 L NC. She no longer had any episodes of \nhemoptysis and her Ht remained stable.\n\n【37】#Hypoxemic respiratory failure c/b hemoptysis: \nMost likely ___ collapse of RLL with lung mass, +/- \npost-obstructive PNA and possible multifocal pneumonia on CT \nchest. LENIs were negative. Bronchoscopy on ___ showed mixed \nintrinsic and extrinsic disease in the RUL anterior segment and \nRLL basal and superior segments, and extrinsic compression RML. \nThey were unable to stent the obstructed bronchi. EBUS TBNA was \nperformed, c/b arterial bleeding (250 ml EBL), hemostasis \nachieved with epi and APC followed by particle and coil \nembolization of the right bronchial artery by ___. Repeat bronch \non ___ showed diffuse frothy alveolar secretions were present \nin both lungs. Patient received multiple platelet transfusions. \nShe was also treated with Vancomycin/Pip-Tazo/Azithromycin for \npossible post-obstructive PNA (day ___. Given ongoing \nhemoptysis, radiology oncology was consulted. Bedside bronch in \nFICU showed large bloody obstruction in right mainstem bronchus \nthat could not be suctioned. Transferred to MICU orange for \ninterventional pulm bronch on ___. Bronch showed complete \nobstruction of the RMS and BI by clot and near complete \nobstruction LMS by clot; active bleed at proximal LMS (6 \no'clock); Slow ooze RLL. She also had interventional radiology \nbronchial artery embolization ___. She had another bronch on \n___ to evaluate the airway which looked stable. She was \nsuccessfully extubated on ___ and briefly required BiPAP but \nquickly came off this as well. At discharge she continued on \nBiPAP during all sleeping.  This should be reevaluated by \npulmonologist if there is evidence of tumor shrinkage causing \ndecompression of lung. \n\n【38】#Afib with RVR: On transfer to the ICU, patient experienced A \nfib with RVR requiring digoxin and diltiazem. She converted to \nsinus rhythm and these agents were discontinued. Patient became \nhypotensive in the setting of A fib with RVR and sedatives, \nbriefly requiring pressor support. She went off pressors and \ndilt drip and pressures were stable throughout the rest of her \ntime in the ICU.  \n\n【39】# Severe Epistaxis\nUnclear if etiology is due to thrombocytopenia or sinus issue. \nENT was consulted who performed packing and recommended Afrin. \nPlatelets were transfused given hemoptysis. As above hemoptysis \nwas worked up with bronch and ___ embolization. Given low \nplatelets and risk of hemoptysis and epistaxis, patient was \ntransfused platelets on multiple times for plt <20 or plt <50 \n(if bleeding).\n\n【40】#Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: BM biopsy was performed which showed \nmetastatic lung cancer. During hospital stay she required 8 pRBC \ntransfusions,12 platlet transfusions. On day of d/c her WBC 8  \nHt20  Plat77.\n\n【41】#Transaminitis/CBD/pancreatic duct dilation: \nMRCP with benign hepatic lesions but also pancreatic duct \ndilation. Based on her RUQ ultrasound, a small concerning liver \nlesion was found that may represent metastatic malignancy. She \nhad slightly elevated LFTs and bilirubin and a repeat RUQ did \nnot show obstruction. \n\n【42】#Hyponatremia: \nPreviously hyponatremic to 117 as outpatient. During hospital \ncourse, Na in 130s-140s and was felt to be due to mild SIADH \nfrom SCLC. She did not need to be on a fluid restricted diet \nwhile here however her Na should be trended at rehab and if \nneeded a fluid restricted diet should be initiated.\n\n【43】# Hypokalemia: Patient became frequently hypokalemic. This was \nthought to be due to chemo treatment (specifically cisplastin \nwhich can induce a Gitelman like syndrome) and cause loss of K \nin the setting of low magnesium. His TTK gradient was \ninappropriately elevated given his low serum K. K and Mg were \nboth repleted aggressively.\n\n【44】#Compression Fractures T10, T12: \nLikely in context of metastatic malignancy. ___ have 1' \nosteoporosis due to hx of oophorectomy.

Her overall \nrespiratory failure was thought to be ___ to HF ___ to OHS & \nOSA. She was aggressively diuresed  w/ improvement in \noxygenation status. She required oxygen and work a  BiPAP every \nnight and will continue to do so on discharge.\n\n【31】# Newly diagnosed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction\nAs above, hypoxia, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, ___ edema, \nelevated proBNP and a CXR with pulmonary edema and bilateral \npleural effusions suggested new HF exacerbation. Troponins were \nmildly elevated and downtrended (0.15 to 0.11) and ECG was \nwithout ischemic changes, so there was a low suspicion for \nactive ischemia. TTE ___ demonstrated RV dilation without \nsegmental wall motion abnormalities and LVEF >55%. Thus, a new \ndiagnosis of HFpEF was made. She was diuresed aggressively on a \nLasix drip for a total of negative >60 liters with significant \nimprovement in her respiratory status. She underwent a right \nheart cath as below which showed pulmonary hypertension, and is \nlikely the major contributor to her heart failure. At discharge, \nher diuretic regimen was torsemide 100 mg BID, and weight was \n167.7 kg.\n\n【32】# Pulmonary hypertension: Prior to discharge, she underwent a \nright heart catheterization which showed moderate-to-severe \npulmonary hypertension and a normal PCWP. Her PA pressures \nimproved significantly with oxygen and nitrates. This was felt \nto be due to OSA and OHS, though an outpatient V/Q scan was \nrecommended to evaluate for CTEPH (currently anticoagulated for \nother reasons). Pulmonology was consulted, and recommended \ncontinued home O2 and BiPAP at night. They did not feel \nsildenafil would be helpful at this time. She will need to \nfollow up with pulmonology and have a repeat RHC in ___ months.\n\n【33】# Severe obstructive sleep apnea with in-house BiPAP titration\nShe had significant overnight desaturations while sleeping. \nSleep was consulted and performed an in house BiPAP titration \nwith arterial line placed for frqeuent arterial blood gas \nmonitoring. Her settings on discharge were: \n- Model: Resp dream station Bipap\n- Settings: I-18, E-10, PS 8\n- Mask size: Simplus FFMASK medium\n\n【34】# Hypokalemia: She had significant hypokalemia with diuresis, \nthus was started on spironolactone 100 mg daily and potassium 40 \nmEq po BID.\n\n【35】# New Atrial Fibrillation: On ___ telemetry demonstrated \nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates in the 150s bpm range \nwith stable BPs. CHA2DS2-VASc = 3, so heparin gtt (started for \nDVT, see below) was transitioned to warfarin with goal INR = ___ \n(warfarin chosen due to lack of evidence of efficacy for NOACs \nin morbid obesity). Metoprolol 6.25 mg PO Q6H was started for \nrate control, and transitioned to metoprolol succinate 50 mg PO \ndaily by time of discharge. Consider whether there is a need for \nlifelong anticoagulation for this given that it occurred in the \nsetting of acute respiratory failure.\n\n【36】# Venous Thrombosis: LENIs on ___ demonstrated a thrombus in \neither the gastrocnemius vein or a superficial lesser saphenous \nvein with inability to distinguish due to poor image quality. \nShe was anticoagulated for this, as well as for atrial \nfibrillation, as above. Due to her hypoxia we desired to obtain \nCTA chest to rule out PE, however the patient was unable to fit \nthrough the bore of the CT scanner. It is likely that this clot \nwas provoked given that she reports being very sedentary, \nalthough we cannot rule out underlying hypercoagulability. \n\n【37】# New T2DM: Found to have HbA1c = 6.5 %. Consider starting \nmetformin as an outpatient. She inquired about an outpatient \nreferral with Bariatric Surgery which should be followed up.\n\n【38】# R Breast Cellulitis: Pt complained of R breast rash on ___. \nOn further exam, R breast was diffusely red with vague borders, \ntender to palpation. No breast discharge. She was treated for \ncellulitis with cephalexin 500mg PO for a 7 day course (last \nday: ___.\n\n【39】# Microscopic Haematuria: This was a chronic stable problem, per \nMs ___, since her gynaecologic procedure in ___. We \ntrended daily CBCs with no evidence of active gross bleeding. \nUrine cultures demonstrated no growth.\n\n【40】# Elevated LFTs: Presented with mildly elevated LFTs, likely in \nthe setting of congestion and CHF exacerbation. They normalized \nwithin 36 hours of admission after diuresis.\n\n【41】Transitional Issues: \n====================\n通用删除6(英):<u>[ ]</u> Will need potassium checked on ___ and then as needed to \nmaintain potassium within normal range.\n通用删除6(英):<u>[ ]</u> PULM HYPERTENSION: Discharged on home O2 and CPAP.

While here, you underwent an \nultrasound of your heart, which showed dilation in the setting \nof excess fluid, as well as intact squeeze (a condition called \nheart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF). We \ngave you IV medications in order to take fluid off, and as fluid \nwas removed, your breathing improved. When you left the \nhospital, a total of 136 pounds of fluid were removed. Your \"dry \nweight\" was 369.7 lbs. You were discharged home with a \nmedication called torsemide at a dose of 100 milligrams two \ntimes a day. This medication will help you keep fluid off. \nBecause of low potassium caused by this drug, we started you on \na drug called spironolactone to keep your potassium up and you \nwill need to take oral potassium as well. Please weigh yourself \nat home every day, and if your weight increases by more than 2 \nlbs in a day or by more than 5 lbs in a week, please call your \ndoctor.\n\n【51】You also had an ultrasound of your legs, which showed a possible \nblood clot. In addition, you were noted on the heart monitor to \nhave an abnormal fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. \nFor the blood clot and for the abnormal heart rhythm, you were \nstarted on blood thinner medications (initially heparin through \nan IV, and later an oral medication called warfarin). In \naddition, in order to prevent your heart from beating too fast, \nyou were started on a medication to slow the heart rate called \nmetoprolol. Finally, given the blood clot we saw, it shall be \nimportant for you to follow-up with your primary care physician \nfor blood tests for a condition called hypercoagulability, which \nis the tendency to form blood clots.\n\n【52】During routine blood tests, you also tested positive for type 2, \nor adult-onset, diabetes (more specifically, your HbA1c test was \n6.5 %, and 6.5 % is the cut-off for being positive for diabetes, \nwith higher numbers indicating higher average blood sugars). In \naddition, you were started on a medication called atorvastatin, \nwhich prevents heart disease and lowers cholesterol. You might \nalso consider starting a medication called metformin for the \ndiabetes, and your PCP can decide whether to do this. In \naddition, we discussed how weight loss and exercise (even \nexercise in the absence of weight loss) will be key to \ncontrolling your blood sugars and diabetes in the future. \n\n【53】Throughout your admission, you were noted to have low oxygen \nlevels. These oxygen levels improved with a breathing machine \nand mask called BiPAP. We suspect that you may have a condition \ncalled obstructive sleep apnea as well as \"obesity \nhypoventilation syndrome\", which causes your lungs to not fill \nadequately. You underwent a \"right heart catheterization\" to \nmeasure pressures in your lungs, and we found that you have high \nlung pressures called \"pulmonary hypertension\". Because of this, \nyou will need to wear your oxygen every day and your CPAP every \nnight to help you reduce your lung pressures. You will need to \nsee a pulmonologist (lung doctor) as an outpatient when you \nleave.\n\n【54】You expressed interest in Bariatric Surgery during this \nadmission, which is a type of surgery that can help patients \nlose weight. Diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea and overall \ngeneral health can all be improved with weight loss. Please talk \nto your PCP to receive ___ referral to Bariatric Surgery. \n\n【55】It was a pleasure taking care of you,\n- Your ___ Team\n\n【56】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Course complicated by AVN of left\nhip. Patient also with hx of hemolytic anemic. Recent DAT neg. \nPatient required frequent HLA-matched platelets approximately\ntwice a week.  There was a question of an immune component and\nhad been on and off Prednisone in this setting. Also has had\nperiodic course of Rituxan in this setting. Just prior to\ntransplant we had trial of Promacta but did not have any\nsignificant improvement in platelet count.  Due to refractory\ndisease proceed with bone marrow transplant. She is current day \n+\n___ ___ reduced intensity Bone \"marrow\" transplant from unrelated\ndonor with Fludarabine/Cytoxan/Campath for conditioning regimen. \n\n【11】Her transplant course was complicated by ICU admission with\ndyspnea, hypoxia, elevated troponin and acute heart failure with\nacute global cardiac dysfunction in setting of bone marrow\ninfusion. Etiology of Ms. ___ decompensation not \ncompletely\nclear though ? of some capillary leak  process.  She got pure\nmarrow--not peripheral stem cells--and it's likely that the\nproduct contained hemolyzed cells, fat,\ncellular debris, etc. that caused her to react.  Although her\npost-infusion labs looked like she was hemolyzing, the DAT was\nnegative and her hemoglobin did not drop.  Most likely she had\nbeen transfused lysed cells (?likely happened during harvesting\nprocedure) that gave her a transaminitis, elevated bili, blood\ninurine, etc.  Unfortunately however, even after washing the\nbonemarrow, Ms. ___ continued to have this reaction and the\nreaction was to the same bag. DAT was negative. It was felt that\nshe had some sort of endothelial, microvascular damage from the\nbone marrow transplant.  Was supported through this episode.

He was pan scanned (including repeat HCT) and \nunderwent plain films of the right hand and shoulder which were \nunremarkable beyond the HCT findings found at the OSH. \nNeuro-surgery and neurology were consulted. Both services \nrecommended admission to neurology, Decadron 4mg TID, and \nseizure prophylaxis with Keppra. Of note, patient was known to \nneurology because he was admitted in ___ for work-up of a brain \nmass. An MRI at the time was suggestive of an organizing \nhemorrhagic contusion with no findings to suggest underlying \nmass lesion or vascular abnormality. \n\n【10】While in the ED, the patient became stuporeous and tremulous \nrequiring 5mg Ativan and 130mg Phenobarb with improved symptoms. \nHe remained normotensive however had one episode of bradycardia \ninto the ___ which resolved spontaneously.

Right frontal lobe mass is unchanged in size with no change \nin degree of  mass effect on the ipsilateral ventricle amd \nleftward midline shift.  There is  increased thickness of the \nhyperdensity on the periphery of the lesion.  As  the patient \nhas had 2 boluses of IV contrast in the last 10 hours, this may  \neither represent retained IV contrast or interval hemorrhage \nwithin the tumor. \n2.  Hyperdense round 9 mm lesion adjacent to the right sylvian \nfissure is \nunchanged. \n\n【20】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ y/o M w/hx EtOH abuse found down with altered mental status, \nrhabdomyolysis and head CT showing right frontal brain lesion. \nEventually, he was made full comfort focused care with a \nmorphine gtt and died on ___ at 1:40 ___.\n\n【21】# Frontal brain mass: Patient has edematous right frontal brain \nlesion of unclear etiology but possibly an ICH within a tumor. \nLikely contributing to patient's AMS.  He is now s/p dilantin \nload and steroids to control edema. Neuro-surgery and neurology \nwere consulted.  On exam mild L>R anisocoria and perhaps mild R \nhemiparesis concerning for mass effect on from right uncus on \ncerebral peduncle and CN III.  He was continued on seizure \nprophylaxis with levetiracetam 1g IV BID and treated with high \ndose steroids.\n\n【22】# Goals of care: In discussion with his family, they decided not \nto pursue aggressive treatment and did not elect for repeat \nbrain MRI since it is very likely that he had a glioblastoma and \nthey would not like to attempt aggressive treatment. Ongoing \ngoals of care discussions were held, and eventually patient was \nmade full comfort focused care, withdrawing all medications \nexcept those to that goal. He was managed with morphine IV and \nlorazepam for comfort and died from likely uncal herniation.\n\n【23】Issues managed initially in ICU prior to transition to comfort \nfocus on general floor:\n# EtOH Withdrawal: In the MICU he was tremulous and altered \nalthough hemodynamically stable. If in withdrawal would also \nexpect consistent autonomic instability and agitation as opposed \nto his current somulence and hemodynamics. Given time frame of \nhis last drink, monitored closely for signs of DTs or seizure \nactivity and non were observed. For his tremulousness and \noccasional tachycardia and hypertension he was treated with \nvalium on a CIWA. ___ required 2.5mg valium in afternoon. ___ no \nlonger scoring and CIWA dc'd.  Social work was consulted, and he \nwas treated on thiamine, folate and multivitamin. These were \nstopped on transition to comfort focused care as above.\n\n【24】#Anemia. ___ had hematocrit drop along with proportionate drop \nin WBC and plt count after massive fluid resuscitation (+8L). \nLikely dilutional, with underlying anemia perhaps from EtOh \nabuse.  Nutritional supplementation continued and continued to \nmonitor HCT.  Labs were stopped on transition to ___ focused \ncare as above.\n\n【25】# Rhabdomyolysis: Found to have mild rhabdomyolysis with CK 2706 \nwhich is likely due to patient being found down for unknown \nperiod of time. While his U/A did not have RBCs, there was \nlikely a myoglobin component as well given his elevated CK. His \ncreatinine was normal suggesting good renal function currently. \nCK trending down ___. He was treated with IVF, stopped on \ntransition to ___ focused care as above.\n\n【26】# Altered mental status: Patient is altered although unclear \nwhat his baseline usually is. This is likely multifactorial from \nthe ___ w/associated edema, alcohol withdrawal, \ndehydration, possible hepatic encephalopathy, and sedation \nmedications for withdrawal symptoms. No infectious etiology \ncurrently. U/A, CXR, and imaging unremarkable for infectious \nprocess. His mental status continued to decompensate, likely \nfrom uncal herniation and tumor mass effect. He was transitioned \nto ___ care as above.\n\n【27】# Skin ulcerations/breakdown: Appears to be dependent and likely \nrelated to being down for unknown length of time. Imaging does \nnot show fracture or dislocation. Unable to obtain a complete \nexam given patient's mental status but there is some concern for \na possible nerve palsy of the right arm given his exam findings. \nWill need to follow closely when patient less altered.  Hand \nsurgery consulted for to evaluate for compartment syndrome; no \nsurgical intervention indicated. \n\n【28】# Hypovolemia: Based on the history, patient was likely \nhypovolemic on initial presentation particularly with an \nelevated lactate of 2.4 without another clear source. He \ncurrently appears euvolemic clinically after receiving 4L fluids \nprior to getting to the MICU and continues to make to UOP. \nHowever, bedside ultrasound showed collapsable IVC and IJs and \nhe received additional IVF. Lactate normalized with fluids. \n\n【29】# Liver disease/Cirrhosis: Patient has know EtOH cirrhosis and \nvarices (s/p banding) with baseline mild transaminitis. His \ncoags were at baseline which is reassuring for maintained liver \nsynthetic function. CT did not show evidence of cholecystitis or \nductal dilation and AP is normal. His T bili was slightly \nincreased from his baseline of 1.2 which may be related to \nbreakdown given his time down.  \n\n【30】# Hypertension.  Home meds were held. \n\n【31】Transitional Issues\nPatient died at 1:40PM on ___. Patient's daughter ___ \n___ ___  \nwas kept notified throughout the day and after his passing. No \nautopsy requested.\n\n【32】Medications on Admission:\n1. Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY HOLD for SBP<100  \n2. FoLIC Acid 1 mg PO DAILY  \n3. Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY RX  \n4.

You were admitted to the hospital and underwent \nadjustment stent graft in your aorta to strengthen the part of \nthe artery that was weakened by an aneurysm.  To perform this \nprocedure, small punctures were made in the artery of your right \ngroin.  You tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be \ndischarged from the hospital.   Please follow the \nrecommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful \nrecovery, in preparation for a second surgery needed to remove \nthe residual aneurysmal sac and ligate your lumbar arteries. \n\n【25】Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery\nEndovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Discharge \nInstructions\n\n【26】PLEASE NOTE: After endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), it is very \nimportant to have regular appointments (every ___ months) for \nthe rest of your life.  These appointments will include a CT \n(CAT) scan and/or ultrasound of your graft.  If you miss an \nappointment, please call to reschedule. \n\n【27】WHAT TO EXPECT:\nBruising, tenderness, and a sensation of fullness at the groin \npuncture sites (or incisions) is normal and will go away in \none-two weeks\n\n【28】CARE OF THE GROIN PUNCTURE SITES:\nIt is normal to have mild swelling, a small bruise, or small \namounts of drainage at the groin puncture sites.  In two weeks, \nyou may feel a small, painless, pea sized knot at the puncture \nsites.  This too is normal.  Male patients may notice swelling \nin the scrotum.  The swelling will get better over one-two \nweeks.\nLook at the area daily to see if there are any changes.  Be \nsure to report signs of infection.  These include: increasing \nredness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage \nthat is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more.  (If \nyou have taken aspirin, Tylenol, or other fever reducing \nmedicine, wait at least ___ hours after taking it before you \ncheck your temperature in order to get an accurate reading.)\nFOR SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or \nincision)\nIf you have sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either of \nthe groin puncture sites: \n-Lie down, keep leg straight and apply (or have someone apply) \nfirm pressure to area for ___ minutes with a gauze pad or \nclean cloth. \n-Once bleeding has stopped, call your surgeon to report what \nhappened.   \n-If bleeding does not stop, call ___ for transfer to closest \nEmergency Room. \nYou may shower 48 hours after surgery.  Let the soapy water \nrun over the puncture sites, then rinse and pat dry.  Do not rub \nthese sites and do not apply cream, lotion, ointment or powder. \nWear loose-fitting pants and clothing as this will be less \nirritating to the groin puncture sites. \n\n【29】MEDICATIONS\nTake aspirin daily.  Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that \ncould form in your repaired artery. \nIt is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or \nother blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless \nthe surgeon who repaired your aneurysm tells you it is okay to \nstop.   Do not stop taking them, even if another doctor or nurse \ntells you to, without getting an okay from the surgeon who first \nprescribed them. \nYou will be given prescriptions for any new medication started \nduring your hospital stay.\nBefore you go home, your nurse ___ give you information about \nnew medication and will review all the medications you should \ntake at home.  Be sure to ask any questions you may have.  If \nsomething you normally take or may take is not on the list you \nreceive from the nurse, please ask if it is okay to take it. \n\n【30】PAIN MANAGEMENT\nMost patients do not have much pain following this procedure.  \n Your puncture sites may be a little sore.  This will improve \ndaily. If it is getting worse, please let us know.\nYou will be given instructions about taking pain medicine if \nyou need it.\n\n【31】ACTIVITY\nYou must limit activity to protect the puncture sites in your \ngroin.  For ONE WEEK:\n-Do not drive\n-Do not swim, take a tub bath or go in a Jacuzzi or hot tub\n-Do not lift, push, pull or carry anything heavier than five \npounds\n-Do not do any exercise or activity that causes you to hold your \nbreath or bear down with your abdominal muscles.\n-Do not resume sexual activity\nDiscuss with your surgeon when you may return to other regular \nactivities, including work.  If needed, we will give you a \nletter for your workplace. \nIt is normal to feel weak and tired.  This can last six-eight \nweeks, but should get better day by day.   You may want to have \nhelp around the house during this time.\n___ push yourself too hard during your recovery.  Rest when \nyou feel tired.  Gradually return to normal activities over the \nnext month.\nWe encourage you to walk regularly. Walking, especially \noutdoors in good weather is the best exercise for circulation.  \nWalk short distances at first, even in the house, then do a \nlittle more each day.\nIt is okay to climb stairs.  You may need to climb them slowly \nand pause after every few steps. \n\n【32】DIET\nIt is normal to have a decreased appetite.  Your appetite will \nreturn over time.\nFollow a well balance, heart-healthy diet, with moderate \nrestriction of salt and fat. \nEat small, frequent meals with nutritious food options (high \nfiber, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables) to maintain your \nstrength and to help with wound healing.\n\n【33】BOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION\nYou should be able to pass urine without difficulty.  Call you \ndoctor if you have any problems urinating, such as burning, \npain, bleeding, going too often, or having trouble urinating or \nstarting the flow of urine.   Call if you have a decrease in the \namount of urine. \nYou may experience some constipation after surgery because of \npain medicine and changes in activity.  Increasing fluids and \nfiber in your diet and staying active can help.  To relief \nconstipation, you may talk a mild laxative.   Please take to \nyour pharmacist for advice about what to take. \nSMOKING\nIf you smoke, it is very important that you STOP.   Research \nshows smoking makes vascular disease worse.  This could increase \nthe chance of a blockage in your new graft.  Talk to your \nprimary care physician about ways to quit smoking. \n\n【34】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He received full\ndose of IV tPA at the OSH and was transferred here for further\nmanagement. CTA H&N did not reveal significant vessel occlusion\nand the patient did not have any motor deficit, hence he was not\nconsidered a candidate for endovascular intervention\n\n【29】NEURO: Mr ___ was admitted to the ICU for post tPA \nmonitoring. He remained stable overnight and CT the following \nday which showed a small but stable hemorrhage in the right post \ncentral gyrus. The follow morning the patient's language had \nimproved so that he was able to express himself though still \nwith frequent neologisms and phonetic replacements. He also had \na notably elevated mood and would frequently interrupt the \nexaminers. He was transferred to the floor and continued to show \nimprovement in his language. At this time his wife noted that \nhis personality was very different, more energetic and happy. He \nhad an echocardiogram which showed no cardioembolic source. He \nwas monitored on telemetry and remained in normal sinus rhythm. \nMRI showed posterior insula and inferior parietal lobes \nbilaterally, as well as medial temporal lobes. Given the initial \nreports or shaking the patient underwent EEG which showed no \nsigns of seizure. When the patient was able to contribute to the \nhistory he reported that he had a baseline tremor that was \nlikely the source of this report. Given the location of the \nstroke and the history of atrial fibrillation it is most likely \nthat the stroke was due to embolus. The patient was therefore \nstarted on coumadin. He was seen by OT and speech and language \nand was discharged home with no services. \n\n【30】1. Dysphagia screening before any PO intake? (x) Yes - () No\n2. DVT Prophylaxis administered?

Likely had \ncomponent of volume depletion and component of cardiogenic shock \ngiven CI of 1.2 from ___ cardiac cath.  Lactate initially \nelevated at 3.6, with ABG demonstrating acute respiratory \nalkalosis. We initially gave 1L NS, and the orthostasis \npersisted.  When the AM cortisol level returned lower than \nexpected at 2.5, we gave a single dose of 100mg hydrocortisone, \nagain with persistent orthostasis and no increase in heart rate \nwith standing.  Endocrine was consulted and did not believe this \nwas due to adrenal insufficiency. The EP service interrogated \nthe AICD, which was pacing 27% of the time with a single lead in \nthe right ventricle.  There were no events, however, which would \nexplain the patient's orthostasis.  We continued to give back \nfluids, a total of 5L while holding lasix/ spironolactone and \nmetoprolol.  Physical therapy worked with the patient and \ndetermined that he was safe for home with ___. ECHO from ___ \ndid not have any evidence of valvular disease or LVOT \nobstruction to explain the patient's symptoms.  Additionally, \nthere was no longitudinal shortening of the base of the heart \nand the E' waveform, both arguing against amyloidosis.  \nNonetheless, we sent off the a sample of the patient's lung \ntissue for ___ Red staining, which was pending at time of \ndischarge. Given that patient remained orthostatic despite \nholding diuretics, moderate fluid repletion, and ruling out \nstructural/ arrhythmogenic/ adrenal causes of the orthostasis, \nwe decided to start a small dose of fludrocortisone to help \nincrease intravascular volume, with the understanding that the \nserum sodium ___ rise and the patient was asked to drink free \nwater.  He was also asked to monitor for signs of edema and \ncontact his PCP as well as hold the fludrocortisone if that \ndevelops.  We also gave the patient information for follow up \nwith neurology at time of discharge to investigate other \netiologies of the orthostasis (i.e. autonomic dysfunction).\n\n【39】# Question of adrenal insufficiency: Endocrine did not believe \nthe patient has adrenal insufficiency.  When dose is decreased \nto 10 mg, the taper should be continued very slowly. Would also \nconsider checking an AM cortisol at that time to assess for \nendogenous adrenal function.\n\n【40】# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS II of 2 for CHF and HTN (almost age \nas ___).  We continued dabigatran 150mg BID and Digoxin 125mcg qd \nand as above interrogated the pacemaker.  We held metoprolol \ngiven hypotension and lack of tachycardic response.  The EP team \nrecommended considering starting an antiarrhythmic as sotalol.\n\n【41】# Severe Emphysema/BOOP/Cryptogenic PNA and spiculated lung \nlesion: Patient is currently stable and at baseline.  He was \ncontinued on 2L NC on and off as well as a Prednisone taper. He \nwas given fluticasone in place of formoterol nebs. Prophylaxis \ncontinued with Clindamycin and Primaquine.  We also continued \ntiotropium and Guaifenesin.\n\n【42】#Gout: Not currently active:  We continued allopurinol ___ \ndaily.\n\n【43】#Depression: patient euthymic and in good spirits while in \nhouse.  We continued bupropion 200mg qd and fluvoxamine 100mg \nBID.\n\n【44】#Hypothyroidism:  TSH returned at 0.24 and we decreased \nlevothyroxine from 200 to 175mcg daily.\n\n【45】#GERD:  Not active, we continued pantoprazole 40mg daily.\n\n【46】#HL:  We continued simvastatin 20mg daily.\n\n【47】#Transitional:\n\n【48】-Outpatient sodium level check on ___, was 146 on \n___, expect to increase with fludrocortisone, although asked \npatient to drink free water.\n-Outpatient TFTs within the next month as levothyroxine \ndecreased while in house to 175mcg daily\n-Follow up ___ red stain on lung tissue to rule out \namyloidosis\n-consideration of starting an antiarrhythmic as sotalol per EP \nteam  \n-consider checking an am cortisol when Prednisone tapered to \n10mg daily to assess for endogenous adrenal function.\n-Follow up spiculated lung lesions with short interval CT \nscheduled ___\n\n【49】Medications on Admission:\nALLOPURINOL -

He was \nunit-restricted.  There were no acute behavioral issues during \nthis hospitalization.\n\n【20】LEGAL: ___\nPSYCHIATRIC: Though initially stating he was depressed and \nhaving suicidal thoughts, given that during admission he stated \nhis SI was vague and later not present, the use of contradictory \nstories about whether past overdoses were deliberate, making \nmultiple specific medication requests on floor, making jokes \nabout going to ___ during the day and going back inpatient at \nnight, we became more concerned later in hospitalization for \ninstrumental behavior and personality disorder with antisocial \n+/- dependent elements.  He was kept on quetiapine 50 mg PO qhs \nPRN insomnia/anxiety/agitation, kept on home methadone 100 mg \ndaily which was confirmed.  He has history of alcohol use \ndisorder and severe opiate use disorder, initially was put on \nCIWA valium, due to intermittently scoring high on subjective \nparts of score, this was switched to a standing diazepam taper \nof 10 mg QID for 1 day, then 10 mg TID for one day.    \n\n【21】On ___, he was found to have increased blood pressure, brief \nsweating and diaphoresis, stated he had previously been taking \nclonidine, and was placed on clonidine 0.2 mg PO BID and then \nTID while in hospital, in addition to adding back CIWA valium in \nthe short term.  24 hours before discharge he was not scoring on \nCIWA 通用删除7(英):<u>(0, 0, 3, 5, 3, 0)</u> and briefly appeared slurred as per \nnursing.  His symptoms were less concerning for withdrawal at \nend of hospitalization, we stopped CIWA checks and standing \nvalium before discharge.  He was observed by staff to be \nintermittently attempting push-ups and sit-ups before vitals.  \nAt end of hospitalization, we waited 10 minutes of sitting \nbefore taking vitals and they were T 97.8, BP 114/75, P 61, RR \n18, O2 Sat 100% RA.  \n\n【22】After appropriate referrals were made he felt safe to go to \nshelter after hospitalization, with no SI/HI and no AVH.  He \nstates he plans to follow-up at ___ for the \nHomeless clinic and with Arbor HRI partial program. He will be \ngiven a short prescription for Seroquel to be reevaluated at the \nPartial Hospital program; we do not feel there is a clear \nindication for the long term use of this medication. \n\n【23】GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS:\n #HTN-Chronic, BP increased briefly over weekend, with concern \nfor rebound hypertension after stopping clonidine in combination \nwith signs of alcohol withdrawal, improved with reinstatement of \nPO clonidine.  He was found to be attempting push-ups and \nsit-ups before vitals were drawn, end-of-hospitalization vitals \nwere done with 10 minutes of observed resting beforehand, and \nvitals were stable as above.  Therefore we will discharge Mr. \n___ with a ___ 3-day prescription for clonidine and have \nrecommended he follow up with Healthcare for the Homeless within \nthat time frame for management of his hypertension, including \ntapering of the clonidine unless that is felt the appropriate \ntreatment for his hypertension. We currently do not believe \nthere is a long-term need for this medication for psychiatric \nreasons. \n #HCV-Chronic, not currently active, LFTs were stable.  \n #Migraines- chronic, currently stable.  \n\n【24】PSYCHOSOCIAL:\n#) GROUPS/MILIEU: Pt was encouraged to participate in units \ngroups/milieu/therapy opportunities. Use of coping skills and \nmindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. Therapy was \nfocused on social and housing issues.  \n\n【25】#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS: Patient did not wish for us to attempt \nto reach family during inpatient stay.  \n\n【26】#) FAMILY INVOLVEMENT: Family was not actively involved during \nhospitalization.  \n\n【27】#) INTERVENTIONS:\n- Medications: Psychotropic adjustments, specifically use of \ndiazepam briefly for alcohol withdrawal.  \n- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu \ntherapy.\n- Coordination of aftercare: Suggested outpatient follow-up with \n___ for the Homeless, which patient has used in \nthe past, and ___ HRI partial program.   \n- Behavioral Interventions (e.g. encouraged DBT skills, ect): \nMainly supportive therapy.\n\n【28】INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, \nintended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of \nstarting these medications, and risks  and benefits of possible \nalternatives, including not taking the medication, with this \npatient.   We discussed the patient's right to decide whether to \n take this medication as well as the importance of the patient's \nactively participating in the treatment and discussing any  \nquestions about medications with the treatment team, and I  \nanswered the patient's questions.  The patient appeared able to \nunderstand and consented to begin the medication.\n\n【29】RISK ASSESSMENT:\n\n【30】Chronic risk factors include chronic medical problems,\nchronic mental health problems, multiple past psychiatric\nhospitalizations, past overdoses.  \n\n【31】Modifiable risk factors- depressed\nmood and anxiety-addressed with psychotherapy and coordination \nof aftercare, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal-CIWA valium and \nthen switch to valium taper, suicidal ideation-improved with \ntime within inpatient unit and with counseling. \n\n【32】Protective factors include being treatment seeking, with good\nreality testing.  \n\n【33】PROGNOSIS: Guarded-Though patient has good reality testing and a \ndesire to get more help, the nature of likely personality \ndisorder with cluster B traits combined with recurrent unstable \nliving situation (homelessness) and polysubstance abuse puts him \nat chronically elevated risk of self-harm; however, at this \ntime, he states he no longer is having suicidal thoughts and is \nbetter able to delineate his future plans once he leaves the \nhospital.  \n\n【34】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Overall etiology of somnolence unclear \nbut likely combination of infection, poor PO intake, and \npotentially seizures in setting of lowered dosing of AEDs. Her \nsomnolence improved with no additional intervention though \nworsened with home dose of oxycontin, which was decreased. Upon \ndischarged, she was intermittently somnolent but frequently \nawake, oriented, and interactive. \n\n【35】# Malignancy associated pain\nDue to somnolence, home oxycontin dose reduced from 40mg BID to \n20mg BID. Mirtazapine was discontinued as was not felt to be \nimproved symptoms and was likely contributing to somnolence. As \nsomnolence improved, oxycontin was restarted at reduced dose of \n20 bid though with continued pain. An attempt was made to \nincrease to 40 bid, though resulting in somnolence.\n\n【36】# New DVT\n# Right atrial mass \nFound on ___ to have on ___ a symptomatic occlusive DVT \nextending from the R common femoral vein throughout the entirety \nof the R lower extremity to the right calf veins. She was \nstarted on heparin gtt in the ED after confirming NCHCT did not \nreveal any hemorrhagic mets. She was noted to have R atrial \nabnormality on MRI, and TTE showed mass in RA moving in and out \nof tricuspid valve. Likely clot per cardiology, given GOC not \nfurther worked-up. Switched to lovenox then given GOC, apixaban \nto decrease daily injections.  \n\n【37】# Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma\nPrimary oncology team met with patient, as did palliative care, \ninpatient oncology team, and HCP. Discussed progression of \ndisease, and patient and HCP felt hospice was best course for \nher.\n\n【38】# Anemia\nPatient with hgb 6.7 on ___ though hemodynamically stable, \nreceived 1U pRBCs . The cause of thought to be less likely \nhemolysis given elevated haptoglobin levels and with possible \ncomponent of marrow suppression given inappropriate reticulocyte \nresponse as well as dilutional component.\n\n【39】# Severe malnutrition\nNutrition team consulted, tried to encourage PO intake, tube \nfeeds or TPN not within patient's GOC. \n\n【40】CHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n# Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be slightly elevated and free \nT4 low (0.9), so home dose of synthroid increased to \n200mcg/daily. \n# Constipation: senna and bisacodyl PRN\n# DM2: ISS\n\n【41】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] Ensure good pain control\n[] Note patient intermittently somnolent for long amounts of \ntime throughout the day, this is not abnormal for her, and she \ntends to be more lively when her friends visit.\n[] Note patient has chronic, bilateral lower extremity weakness \nof unclear etiology.

He proceeded to\nhave two bowel movements there, which were \"black\" and \"bloody,\"\nmeaning bright red. He adds, \"It was very loose. It was pouring\nout of me.\" A bowel movement earlier that day, around 11:00, was\napparently formed and non-bloody. He returned home, where he had\na third episode of the same. He rose from the toilet without\nissue and ambulated to a chair, where he proceeded to sit, but\ninadvertently missed, falling on his rear end and outstretched\nright hand. He adamantly denies having lost consciousness or\nstriking his head. He, moreover, denies presyncope,\nlightheadedness, dizziness, visual disturbance, or\ncardiopulmonary symptoms preceding his fall and so thinks it was\nentirely accidental.

No further \nclinical seizure activity was evident.  A routine EEG was \nperformed and demonstrated encephalopathy but no epileptiform \nactivity.  An underlying trigger could not be readily \nidentified.  Phenytoin level on day of discharge was 16.2.  The \npatient's lamotrigine should be increased to 150 mg daily in 1 \nweek after discharge, and continued at that dose thereafter.  \nThe phenytoin will be weaned.  It should be given at 300mg PO \ndaily for 2 weeks, then 200mg PO daily for 1 week, then 100mg PO \ndaily for 1 week, then stop.  He received his daily doses of \nlamotrigine and phenytoin on the day of discharge.\nAs the patient was found on the floor at ___, a CT of the \ncervical spine was performed; there was no evidence of fracture. \n A non-contrast CT of the head revealed no contributory \nintracranial pathology.

Fusiform 5-mm dilatation of the V4 segment of left vertebral \nartery is \nmost suggestive of a fusiform aneurysm. \n2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n\n【24】___ ECHO:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size \nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well \nseen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation \nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space \nwhich most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\n【25】IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with probably preserved left ventricular \nfunction. Cannot exclude regional wall motion abnormality due to \ntechnically limited windows.  \n\n【26】___ Head CT:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Status post right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter \nplacement, \nwith stable appearance of the ventricle size. \n2. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular \nhemorrhage, stable. \n\n【27】___ Head CT:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Status post coiling of the left vertebral artery aneurysm, \nstable \nappearance of the extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular \nhemorrhage. \n2. Status post right frontal ventriculostomy, with interval \ndecompression of the right frontal horn greater than the left. \nNo significant interval change in size of the ventricles. \n3.A right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter appears to \nterminate in the right frontal lobe medial to the anterior \nclinoid process on the right.  \n\n【28】___. Interval repositioning of a right frontal ventriculostomy \ntube, which \nappears to terminate within the anterior horn of the right \nlateral ventricle.  There is a new 13 x 12 mm hyperdense focus \nadjacent to this, just right of midline, which appears to be a \nfocus of hemorrhage. \n2. Interval decrease in effacement of the right lateral \nventricle. \n3. The remainder of the examination is stable \n\n【29】CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of ___ \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged in extent, \nthough slightly less dense. Small subdural hemorrhage is \nunchanged. \n2. Slightly decreased amount of intraventricular blood. \nDecreased size of \nlateral and third ventricles since ___. Persistent blood \nalong the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter. \n3. Unchanged diffuse cerebellar edema with sparing of a small \nportion of the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Unchanged \ncompression of the fourth ventricles and herniation of the \ncerebellar tonsils. Concurrent head MRI demonstrates extensive \ncerebellar infarction. \n4. Severe vasospasm in the posterior circulation. Mild vasospasm \nin the \nanterior circulation. \n5. Questionable mild increase in mean transit time in the \nsuperior right \nmiddle cerebral artery territory, without a matched decrease in \ncerebral blood volume. In the setting of vasospasm, this could \nindicate mild ischemia.  Concurrent head MRI demonstrates no \ninfarction in this territory. \n\n【30】CT PERFUSION ___: There is a questionable minimal increase \nin mean transit time \nin the superior right middle cerebral artery territory, without \na matched \ndecrease in cerebral blood volume. \n\n【31】HEAD MRI WITHOUT CONTRAST ___ \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Evolving acute to early subacute infarction involving almost \nthe entire \ncerebellum, with sparing of a small portion of the right \ninferior cerebellar hemisphere. Associated herniation of the \ncerebellar tonsils and compression of the fourth ventricle, \nsimilar to prior studies. \n2. Unchanged extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unchanged small \nsubdural \nhemorrhage. Decreased intraventricular blood. \n3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles compared \nto ___. \n\n【32】Head CT ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Interval decrease in size of lateral ventricles, with stable \neffacement of the basal cisterns. The foramen magnum is poorly \nevaluated due to metallic streak artifact. \n2. Stable appearance of external ventricular drain, as well as a \nfocus of \nhigh density adjacent to it consistent with hemorrhage which is \nstable in \nsize. \n3. Hypodensity of the posterior fossa consistent with evolution \nof \ninfarction. \n4. Opacification of the ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses \nconsistent \nwith intubated state. \n\n【33】Head CT ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Slightly decreased mass effect on the fourth ventricle status \npost \noccipital craniectomy. \n2. Evolving cerebellar hemispheric infarcts. \n3. Interval decrease of diffuse subarachnoid and \nintraventricular hemorrhage. \n4. Unchanged effacement of the basal cisterns. \n5. No new acute intracranial hemorrhage or new acute infarction. \n\n【34】LENIS BLE ___:\nIMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen within both of the right \nposterior \ntibial veins and partial thrombus seen within the right common \nfemoral vein and superficial femoral vein. No DVT seen in the \nleft leg. \n\n【35】CTA Head ___:\nIMPRESSIONS: \n1. Severe diffuse vasospasm in the posterior circulation and \nmild diffuse \nvasospasm in the anterior circulation are overall little changed \ncompared to ___, except to note slight worsening in the now \nmarked narrowing of the P1 segment of the right posterior \ncerebral artery. The appearance on both the ___ and current \nstudy is new since the admission study of  \n___. \n2. Progressive confluent low-attenuation throughout both \ncerebellar \nhemispheres; while this may represent widespread infarction, as \nsuggested \npreviously, the findings on the MR study of ___, including \nthe virtual sparing of the pons, are somewhat atypical, and a \ncomponent of diffuse vasogenic edema is a consideration. \n\n【36】EEG ___ - ___:\nDiffuse encephalopathy, no seizure activity. \n\n【37】___: MRI C-spine:IMPRESSION: \n1. No gross cord signal abnormality. If there is continued \nclinical concern for cord infarction, axial T2 and diffusion \nsequences can be performed which significantly increases \nsensitivity for subtle cord signal abnormality. \n2. Areas of altered signal intensity in the CSF space likely \nrelates to \nblood products from the known subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nIncompletely imaged postoperative changes of the suboccipital \ncraniectomy, \nbetter evaluated on the brain MRI performed the same day. \n\n【38】___: CT Head: IMPRESSION: \n1. Expected evolution of intracranial hemorrhage without \nevidence of new \nhemorrhage. \n2. Increased size of the fourth ventricle, likely related to \ndecreased \ncerebellar swelling. \n3. Decreased size of the lateral and third ventricles, which are \nnow \nslit-like. New subdural fluid collections along the cerebral \nconvexities and cerebellar hemispheres. These findings suggest \nthe possibility of \novershunting. \n\n【39】___: MRI Head: IMPRESSIONS: \n1. No evidence of acute infarction. \n2. Decreased cerebellar swelling. Some of the persistent edema \ncould be \nvasogenic due to vasospasm, and some of it could be due to \nsubacute \ninfarction. Recommend continued follow-up. \n3. Increased size of the fourth ventricle due to decreased \ncerebellar \nswelling. New subdural fluid collections along cerebral \nconvexities and \ncerebellar hemispheres, which suggest the possibility of \novershunting, given the decreased size of lateral and third \nventricles. \n4. Decreased severity of upward transtentorial herniation as \nwell as downward tonsillar herniation compared to MRI of \n___. \n\n【40】___ EEG : IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence principally \nfor a moderately severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy. There \nare no clear epileptic features to this. Additionally, the \ncardiac rhythm is significantly abnormal. \n\n【41】___ Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison \nto ___. \n\n【42】The tracheostomy tip is at the midline being 6 cm above the \ncarina. The right central venous line tip is at the level of \nsuperior SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Multifocal \nopacities mostly located in the lower lobes are grossly \nunchanged. No interval increase in pleural effusion has been \ndemonstrated. \n\n【43】IMPRESSION: Overall no significant change since the prior study \nincluding \nmultifocal mostly basal opacity. \n\n【44】___ CHEST \nHISTORY: PICC line placement. \nOne view. Comparison with ___. Multifocal opacities persist. \nThere \nappears to be slight interval worsening at the lung bases. The \ntracheostomy tube and right-sided central venous line remain in \nplace. A PICC line has been inserted on the left and terminates \nin the mid superior vena cava. There is no other definite \nchange. \n\n【45】IMPRESSION: Multifocal opacities with evidence for slight \ninterval worsening at the bases. PICC line as described. \n\n【46】Head CT ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Resolution of cerebellar swelling and herniation through the \ncraniectomy defect. While small infarcts may be present in the \ninferior cerebellar hemispheres, the remainder of the cerebellum \nappears to have resumed normal architecture. \n2. The lateral and third ventricles remain small s/p \nventriculostomy removal. The bilateral posterior fossa subdural \nfluid collections remain unchanged.  The right convexity \nsubdural fluid collection is smaller, and the left convexity \nsubdural fluid collection is larger, with new minimal rightward \nshift of midline structures.  \n\n【47】___  Head CT :\nFinal read is pending at this time.  It was reviewed by Dr. \n___ and is stable. \n\n【48】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe CT scan was evaluated in the ED and it was determined that \nEVD placement was necessary. This was performed in the ED \nwithout complication and was set to 20cm H20 and open. The pt \nwas then admitted to the Neurosurgical service for Q1hr \nNeurochecks in the ICU. He was started on nimodipine and keppra \nfor prophylactic purposes.  Cerebral angiogram was requested and \nobtained on ___ and coils were placed and the left vertebral \nartery was sacrificed. Post-angio a Heparin drip was initiated \nand discontinued the next morning. \n\n【49】On ___ the EVD was pulled back. ___ he had new Afib and \nrequired a Dilt drip to be initiated. His ICPs were also high \nand required two doses of Mannitol. \n\n【50】___ AM a head CT was done to reassess the shunt which showed \nthe ventricles to still be large but stable bleed. His drain was \ndropped to 10cm from 15cm. \n\n【51】Over the weekend of ___ his ventriculostomy drain was \nflushed as there was air in the line and likely inaccurate \nreadings.  Following the flushing, a good waveform was obtained, \nand his true ICP readings were ___.  Mannitol was discontinued. \nOvernight on ___ the patient had ___ isolated episodes of \nasystole lasting ___ seconds.  he spontaneously converted to \nNSR, and difib pads were placed on the patient.  His code status \nremained full code.  He was noted to have a fever >101.3 on ___, \nand CSF/Blood/Urine cultures were obtained.  A CTA head was done \nwhich showed vasospasm in the posterior circulation and mild \nvasospasm in the anterior circulation.\n\n【52】On ___ he was taken to the OR for a posterior fossa \ncraniectomy/duratomy as his ICPs remained elevated and there was \nconcern for increased edema due to a cerebellar infarct. He \nremained stable on ___. Stroke Neurology was consulted.\n\n【53】On ___ a CTA was done which showed no change from the ___ CTA \nbut there was increased vasospasm to the R P1. He was then noted \nto have rigors. He was brought to angiogram and verapamil was \ninjected. On ___ he also underwent a trach/peg at bedside and an \nIVC filter in ___. Decadron was started per Stroke Neurology \nrecommendations.\n\n【54】On ___ he was again febrile and cultures were sent. Decadron was \ndiscontinued. \n\n【55】On ___ he remained stable and his EVD was elevated to 15cm from \n10cm. His blood pressure parameters were liberalized. \n\n【56】On ___ his neurochecks where liberalized to q4hours and his EVD \nwas increased to 20cm from 15cm.  He had no ICP issues.  Later \nin the day he underwent a brochoscopy which showed thick \nsecretions and he continued to be febrile.  CSF was sent \novernight as well.\n\n【57】On ___ in the early morning, he was experiencing 4 second pauses \nwhich occured approximately 10 times per the SICU staff.  His \ndiltizaem drip was discontinued at that time. On morning rounds \nhis EVD was raised to 25cm from 20cm however he had increased \nICP's and the drainw as again lowered to 20cm.  He continued to \nhave pauses and episodes of bradycardia so the SICU consulted \nElectrophysiology to evaluate him.  \n\n【58】___ patient was evaluated by Cardiology who recommended that \npatient's heart rate be moderately controlled. They believed \nthat overly agressive management of his heart rate in Afib had \nlead to frequent pauses and asystolic events. He has at this \ntime tolerated his EVD at 25cm of H2O for 24 hours, but \nclinically it apeared that he was not tolerating the pressure \nand started leaking CSF from his posterior fossa incision, \ntherefore the EVD was dropped to 15cmH20.\n\n【59】A CT of his Brain showed expected evolution of intracranial \nhemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage. Overnight EEG \nrevealed seizure activity lasting ___ minutes therefore Keppra \nwas increased to 1500mg BID. \n\n【60】On ___ the patient remained neurologically unchanged. The wound \nremained dry with the EVD at 15cmH20.\nOn ___ & ___ the patient again remained stable without \nevidence of leakage from the incisional site, therefore it was \ndetermined that he did not need to go to the operating room at \nthis time. \n\n【61】His EVD remained clamp for 48 hours and was finally removed on \n___.  His SOC site remained dry and his sutures were \nremoved on ___.\n\n【62】A Ct scan was performed on ___ to evaluate for increase in \nexternal hydrocephalus and this scan was stable.

The patient's \nadmission EKG showed sinus rhythm with non-specific ST-T wave \nchanges in leads I, aVL and V2-V6 and QT prolongation. It was \nthought that the patient had the stroke in the setting of \nconverting from atrial fib/flutter to sinus rhythm in the \nsetting of sub-therapeutic INR (1.2). \nLipid panel showed: Tchol 199, LDL 135, HDL 45, ___ 97, and the \npatient was started on Atorvastatin 40 mg daily. It should be \nnoted that the patient has a history of rash with Simvastatin \nuse, so this should be monitored for as an outpatient. HgA1C \n5.6. Urine/serum tox negative. His Lisinopril was held to allow \nfor autoregulation in the setting of acute stroke, and his SBP \nwas 120-140 at the time of discharge. His Lisinopril can be \nadded back in rehab if needed for hypetension. \nHis CK was 863 on admission with CK-MB 14 and TropT 0.04. His CK \npeaked at 1018 but was trending down at the time of discharge. \nHis elevated CK was thought to be due to myositis since the \npatient was found down. Less likely, he had demand ischemia. He \nwas continued on Metoprolol 25 mg bid.\nThe patient was continued on Amiodarone 100 mg daily. His TSH \nwas found to be up to 17 and Free T4 0.39. This was thought to \nbe due to amiodarone use, and his Levoxyl was increased to 125 \nmcg daily.\nRoutine CXR on admission showed increased elevation of the left \nhemidiaphragm which may be due to increased intraabdominal \npressure. His PCP reported this was not previously known. This \nshould be followed up as an outpatient.\nThe patient complained of right knee and left shoulder pain \nafter being found down. X-rays of those regions showed a large \nknee effusion, but no evidence of fracture or dislocation.\nHis Hct was 47.2 on admission, but trended down likely due to \ninitial hemoconcentration. His Hct was 36.9 at the time of \ndischarge, and he was found to have macrocytosis. He had Vitamin \nB12 and folate levels pending at the time of discharge.\n\n【31】Medications on Admission:\nAMIODARONE - 200 mg Tablet - ___ Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nFUROSEMIDE - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth prn as needed\nLEVOTHYROXINE - 100 mcg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nLISINOPRIL - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day for\nblood pressure\nMETOPROLOL TARTRATE - 50 mg Tablet - 0.5 (One half) Tablet(s) by\nmouth twice a day\nPROPOXYPHENE N-ACETAMINOPHEN - 100 mg-650 mg Tablet - 1 \nTablet(s)\nby mouth twice a day as needed for severe arthritis pain\nWARFARIN [COUMADIN] - 2 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth qd as\ndirected 2 mg every day except 1 mg every ___ and ___\n\n【32】Discharge Medications:\n1.

CT A/P found likely partial SBO. No history of \nabdominal surgery, although had VP shunt placed. ACS evaluated \nhim and recommended conservative management with NPO, fluid \nresuscitation, NG tube to low wall suction, as well as \nperforming serial KUBs with oral contrast to evaluate for \nprogression of obstruction. Immediately after placing the NG \ntube, there was copious return of 1.2L of bilious contents, \nwhich improved his symptoms. Managed conservatively with NG tube \ninitially to suction, subsequently clamped. He was maintained on \na bowel regimen, and diet was advanced as tolerated. At time of \ndischarge, able to tolerate a regular diet with regular bowel \nmovements and passing gas. \n\n【29】#AFib with RVR: Likely iso hypovolemia and pain from SBO. \nInitially refractory to IV dilt boluses, requiring ICU transfer. \nIn the ICU he was loaded with IV amiodarone, which helped with \nrate control. Upon transfer to the floor, amiodarone was \ndiscontinued and he was maintained on fractionate doses of his \nhome diltiazem and metoprolol with good effect. While he was \nNPO, he was maintained on a heparin drip in place of his home \napixaban. Apixaban was resumed once able to tolerate PO meds. \n\n【30】CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=========================\n___ on CKD\nCr 1.8 on admission from recent baseline 1.3.

Significant aortic stenosis (not \nquantified). Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall \nhypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No prior study available \nfor comparison.\n\n【12】CXR ___\nThere is an intraaortic balloon pump, which terminates 2.0 cm \nbelow the top of  the aortic arch. The cardiac silhouette is \nmildly enlarged and there is moderate pulmonary  edema. Trace \nbilateral pleural effusions (left greater than right) are noted. \n There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. No acute \nosseous abnormalities are identified. \n\n【13】Brief Hospital Course:\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n===================== \n___ is a ___ year old man with history of severe  AS, \nprior CVA, HTN, HLD, and ulcerative colitis who presented to \n___ with dyspnea, found to have an NSTEMI s/p cath with DES \nto mid-LAD and Cx, also found to have severe AS, with low \npressures requiring norepinephrine and IABP, transferred to \n___ CCU for management. Subsequently weaned off pressors and \ncalled out to the floor. He was kept in the hospital pending \nTAVR work up. He unfortunately went into an unstable VT and \narrested ___ and died shortly after code attempted. \n\n【14】ACUTE ISSUES:  \n=============  \n\n【15】#Code Blue\n#Unstbale VT\n#Death\nHe was well on ___, awaiting a TAVR, when he developed \nventricular tachycardia at 18:36. He was hemodynamically stable \nat first so was intended for amiodarone\nbut lost his pulse shortly thereafter. CPR was commenced and a \nshock was delivered as soon as pacing pads were applied. He \nreceived an amiodarone bolus. His rhythm became unshockable/PEA \nso we then followed that algorithm instead. This later\ndegenerated into ventricular fibrillation. He received four \nshocks in total, a second bolus of amiodarone, lidocaine, \nseveral rounds of epinephrine, and empiric magnesium and \ncalcium. After 25 minutes of CPR, he was in asystole with \ncardiac standstill on bedside echocardiogram. His family was at \nhis bedside for the\nduration of the code. A shared decision was made to withdraw \nresuscitation efforts. Time of death was 17:04. Immediate cause \nof death was ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Chief cause \nof death was ischemic cardiomyopathy. Antecedent causes of death \nwere multi-vessel coronary artery disease and critical aortic \nstenosis. \n\n【16】#Cardiogenic Shock\n#Acute on chronic HFrEF (EF 21%)\nInitially presented to OSH with shock iso NSTEMI and severe AS. \nThere he underwent DESx2 to LAD and LCx. There he was started on \ndopamine and NE and had IABP placed. His shock is believed to be \nsecondary to be due to newly reduced EF in the setting of his \nNSTEMI and concomittent severe aortic stenosis. Eventually IABP \nwas weaned and was intermittently on and off pressors. He \nimproved with diuresis and was called out to the floor. \n\n【17】#Severe AS\nValve area known to be <1cm this past ___, but asymptomatic. \nLikely contributed to his cardiogenic shock stemming from his \nNSTEMI. He was evaluated by C-Surge who deemed him a poor \ncandidate for SAVR. TAVR work up was ongoing\n\n【18】# NSTEMI\n# CAD\nHad DESx2 to LAD and LCx ___ at ___ of ___.\n- cont ASA, atorvastatin, plavix\n- metop as above \n- ___ \n\n【19】___\n#Hyperkalemia\nBaseline creatinine 1.2, 2.4 on admission. Most likely secondary \nto above mentioned cardiogenic shock causing ATN. Hyperkalemia \nlikely related. Improved with resolution of shock and diuresis. \n\n【20】#Acute on Chronic Normocytic Anemia\nPatient with a hemoglobin of 8.4 which has down trended from his\nbaseline of 11.6. He does not have any BRBPR or melena. No other\nobvious evidence of bleeding. Iron studies consistent with ___\n-Daily CBC\n-Type and Screen\n-Transfuse for a Hgb <7\n\n【21】CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES\n=======================\n#Respiratory failure\nlikely flash pulmonary edema iso cardiogenic shock and severe AS\nas above, his oxygen requirement reduced to 2L NC on arrival to\n___.

The flap is not visualized in \nthe left brachial artery at the antecubital fossa.  The left \nsubclavian artery is patent with a PSV of 132 cm/sec.  The left \naxillary artery is patent with a PSV of 180 cm/sec.  The left \nbrachial artery is patent with a PSV of 147 cm/sec.  The AV \nfistula anastomosis is patent with a PSV of 166 cm/sec.  The \nleft radial artery is patent with a PSV of 30.3 cm/sec.  The \nleft ulnar artery is patent with a PSV of 16 cm/sec. \nAll studied arteries presented with monophasic Doppler \nwaveforms, most likely due to presence of AV fistula. \n\n【20】IMPRESSION:  \n\n【21】The left upper extremity arteries and the left upper extremity \nAV fistula are patent. \n\n【22】The dissection flap is seen from the left subclavian artery to \nthe distal left brachial artery.  The flap is not visualized in \nthe left brachial artery at the antecubital fossa. \n\n【23】CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___:\nCoronary Anatomy\nDominance: Right\nLMCA: The LMCA had mild 25% in-stent restenosis.\nLAD: The LAD was 75% stenosed at the ostium immediately prior to \na chronic total occlusion of the calcified proximal LAD.\nRamus intermedius: The stented proximal ramus intermedius was \npatent and provided collaterals to several RPLs.\nLCX: The CX arose perpendicular to the LMCA and ramus \nintermedius and was severely diseased with proximal tapering. A \nmodest caliber OM1 had an origin 90% stenosis arising just after \nthe atrial branch.\nRCA: The RCA was severely diseased proximally with serial \nchronic total occlusions mid vessel prior to some non-opacified \nnon-perfused mid RCA stents. The native RCA only perfused some \nRV branches.\nSVG-OM: The SVG-OM was patent with retrograde filling of the \ndistal AV groove CX and antegrade filling of several LPLs.\nLIMA-LAD: The LIMA was very difficult to engage and arose next \nto the thyrocervical trunk and other head and neck vessels. The \nLIMA was tortuous and attached to the mid LAD. There was \nretrograde filling\nof several septal branches. The LAD downstream of the \nanastomosis had an eccentric 80% stenosed that had progressed \nfrom ___. The distal LAD supplied diagonal collaterals to \nsome OMs and septal\ncollaterals to the distal RCA system. Flow in the LIMA was TIMI \n2 and pulsatile.\n\n【24】Impressions:\n1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease with chronic \ntotal occlusions of the LAD and RCA and\nchronic subtotal occlusion of the CX.\n2. Patent LIMA-LAD with progression of downstream native LAD.\n3. Patent SVG-OM/LPL.\n4. Left common femoral calcific atherosclerosis.\n5. Successful deployment of a drug-eluting stent in the native \nLAD via the LIMA in a fibrotic somewhat\nresistant lesion.\nRecommendations\n1. Cycle CK-MB and troponin-T.\n2. ASA 81 mg daily (do NOT load with 162 or 324 mg even if \npatient develops acute coronary syndrome as this may blunt the \ncardioprotective effects of ticagrelor by exceeding the FDA \nlabeled maximal daily dose of ASA 100 mg daily).\n3. Ticagrelor 90 mg BID for an additional year for post-MI \nsecondary prevention with ACS indication of newly placed \ndrug-eluting stent and for post-MI mortality benefit if no major \nissues with bleeding.\n4. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against PAD, CAD \nand NSTEMI.\n5. Suggest EP interrogation of pacemaker to see if patient is \nactually ventricular pacing with tracking of a rapid atrial rate \nrather than mode switching.\n6. LFA sheath to be removed when ACT falls.\n7. Referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation if not \npreviously completed.\n8. Hemodialysis per usual schedule.\n9. F/U with Dr. ___.\n\n【25】___ PCXR\n\n【26】FINDINGS:  \n\n【27】A moderate right pleural effusion is similar, and adjacent \nconsolidation, \nlikely from atelectasis is mildly more prominent.  Decreased \nretrocardiac \nopacity.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The \nmediastinal \nsilhouette is stable.  Left pectoralis cardiac pacemaker leads \nare unchanged \nin position.  Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact.  \nMediastinal \nclips are grossly unchanged.  A right IJ central venous catheter \ntip projects \nover the right atrium.  Stable right clavicle fracture. \n\n【28】IMPRESSION:  \n\n【29】Stable partially loculated right pleural effusion, with worsened \nadjacent \nright basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.  Consider aspiration \nor pneumonia \nif clinically appropriate. \n\n【30】___ CTA chest and LUE\nFINDINGS:  \n\n【31】Limited images through the base of the neck demonstrate no \nabnormalities. \n\n【32】There is no mediastinal mass.  There is a similar appearance of \nmildly \nenlarged mediastinal lymph nodes including a 1.0 cm right \nparatracheal lymph \nnode on 02:34, unchanged from the prior CT of the chest.  These \nare likely \nreactive to pulmonary hypertension.  There is no axillary or \nsupraclavicular \nadenopathy. \n\n【33】The main pulmonary artery at the level of the right pulmonary \nartery is \nenlarged at 3.6 cm and there is reflux of contrast into the \nintrahepatic IVC \nand hepatic veins, compatible with the known history of \npulmonary arterial \nhypertension.  There is an abnormal positioning of the pulmonic \nvalve, as seen \non prior echocardiogram, possibly related to known right \nventricular \ndysfunction (02:40).  There is cardiomegaly with biatrial \nenlargement. \n\n【34】The pulmonary arteries are well opacified to the subsegmental \nlevel, with no \nevidence of filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar, \nsegmental or \nsubsegmental pulmonary arteries. \n\n【35】The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy wire \nsutures appearing \nintact.  The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber with scattered \nareas of \nextensive atherosclerotic calcification including at the origin \nof the left \nsubclavian artery.  There is no evidence of ulcerated or \npenetrating plaque.  \nThere is partial visualization of a left chest wall pacemaker \nwith 2 leads \nterminating in the right atrium and right ventricular wall. \n\n【36】There is a left subclavian artery dissection flap beginning \napproximately 9 mm \ndistal to the origin of the left subclavian artery immediately \nproximal to the \norigin of the left vertebral artery (02:19 on the CTA chest \nimages).  Both \nlumens are opacified and the dissection flap does not extend \ninto the left \nvertebral artery, likely due to the presence of significant \natherosclerotic \ncalcification at its origin (02:12 of the CTA chest images).  \nThe dissection \nflap within the subclavian artery is difficult to visualize on \nthe CTA chest \nimages due to significant streak artifact from the left chest \nwall pacemaker, \nhowever this flap is much better seen in this region on the CTA \nupper \nextremity images, notably series 4 a images ___.  The \ndissection flap \nextends into the left axillary artery and brachial artery (4A: \n19, 35, 36, 65, \n101, 109) to the bifurcation of the brachial artery.  The flap \ndoes not appear \nto extend into the radial and ulnar arteries.  Throughout the \ncourse of the \ndissection, both flaps are opacified.  The proximal radial and \nulnar arteries \nare opacified.  Both arteries demonstrate severe calcified and \nnoncalcified \natherosclerotic plaque in their mid and distal portions with \nsignificant \nnarrowing in several segments where opacification cannot be \ndefinitely \nidentified. \n\n【37】A patent AV fistula is noted in the distal upper extremity.  \nThere are \nnumerous collateral vessels. \n\n【38】There is no pericardial effusion.  There is a chronic loculated \nsmall right \npleural effusion with areas of pleural thickening similar \ncompared to the \nchest x-ray from ___ when accounting for differences \nin modality but \nprogressed from ___.  The left pleural space is \nclear. \n\n【39】There is upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema.  There \nis upper lobe \npredominant interlobular septal thickening compatible with \ncongestive heart \nfailure.  There is compressive atelectasis and pleural \nthickening in the right \nlung which has progressed since ___.  Diffuse \nbronchial wall \nthickening and cephalization of the pulmonary vessels compatible \nwith \npulmonary edema. \n\n【40】No lytic or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is \nidentified.  \nBilateral gynecomastia. \n\n【41】Limited images through the upper abdomen demonstrate extensive \natherosclerotic \ncalcification and mild splenomegaly measuring 13.5 cm.  There is \na slightly \nnodular contour of the liver with hypertrophy of the left \nhepatic lobe and \ntrace perihepatic free fluid.  There is a subcentimeter \nlow-density lesion in \nthe upper pole of the right kidney which is incompletely \ncharacterized \n\n【42】IMPRESSION: \n\n【43】1. Dissection of the left subclavian artery beginning 9 mm \ndistal to its \norigin and extending to the bifurcation of the brachial artery.  \nBoth lumens \nare opacified and there is no extension of the dissection flap \ninto any of the \nbranching vessels including the left vertebral artery, radial \nartery, or ulnar \nartery.  The dissection does not extend into the aortic arch or \nthe left upper \narm dialysis AV fistula which is patent. \n2. No acute aortic abnormality identified.  No evidence of \npulmonary embolism. \n3. Findings compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema and \npulmonary \narterial hypertension.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are \nstable and likely \nreactive. \n4. Cardiomegaly with biatrial enlargement and abnormal \npositioning of the \npulmonic valve, as seen on prior echocardiogram, likely related \nto global \nright ventricular dysfunction. \n5. Chronic loculated small right pleural effusion with areas of \npleural \nthickening appears overall similar compared to the chest x-ray \nfrom ___ when accounting for differences most in modality but \nprogressed from the \n___. Limited images through the upper abdomen demonstrate nodular \ncontour of the \nliver with hypertrophy of the left hepatic lobe, trace \nperihepatic free fluid, \nand stable mild splenomegaly, compatible with hepatic \ndysfunction/cirrhosis \nwith portal hypertension likely related to right heart failure.  \nBilateral \ngynecomastia also supports this diagnosis. \n7. Subcentimeter low-density lesion in the upper pole of the \nright kidney is \nincompletely characterized and could be further evaluated with \nnonemergent \nrenal ultrasound.  This statistically most likely represents a \nrenal cyst. \n\n【44】Brief Hospital Course:\nNSTEMI and ACUTE DISSECTION:\n\n【45】The ___ hospital course was complicated by an \nintraprocedural dissection due to the difficult access to the \nLAD through the LIMA. He developed an acute dissection which was \ndetected through loss of the AV Fistula on the left upper \nextremity, which was subsequently restored.  He also developed \natrial fibrillation during the case, which resolved.  Vascular \nSurgery was consulted and recommended starting a Heparin drip \nand obtaining a CT Scan of the chest and the upper extremity.  \nThese studies revealed a left subclavian artery dissection flap \nbeginning approximately 9 mm distal to the origin of the left \nsubclavian artery immediately proximal to the origin of the left \nvertebral artery and did not extend into the left vertebral \nartery due to the presence of significant atherosclerotic \ncalcification.  The flap extends into the left axillary artery \nand brachial artery to the bifurcation of the brachial artery.  \nIt does not appear to extend into the radial and ulnar arteries. \n.  ___ was consulted and he was provided a script for \ncardiac rehab.  He will have early follow up with Dr. \n___.  An echocardiogram will be done outpatient. \n\n【46】He will continue with his home medications, including his \nchronic Aspirin 81 mg and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily.  He will \nnot receive any other anticoagulation for the dissection given \nhis propensity to bleed and his GAVE syndrome.\n\n【47】It is expected the dissection will heal on its own with time.  \nWe recommend close follow up with his Renal physicians at \n___, that allowing ___ weeks and a re-evaluation of the \nleft upper extremity under ultrasound and compared to his study \nhere will ensure there has been no progression and a decision \ncan be made to resume use of the AV fistula on the left upper \nextremity. He was seen by the Transplant team who weighed in on \nuse of the fistula.  Precautions were taken at the request of \nthe Cardiology Interventionalist team and the decision was made \nto refrain from its use for the immediate future as described \nabove.\n\n【48】ESRD on HD:\nHis hemodialysis, which he receives on ___ schedule was \ndeferred on ___ due to reluctance to use the AV fistula on \nthe left arm and possible complications with the dissection.  He \nhad a tunneled IJ dialysis catheter placed on ___ with no \ncomplication. Because of the concern for clot with the acute \ndissection, the Heparin drip was resumed.  This was subsequently \ndiscontinued ___ mid afternoon given continuous oozing and \nabdominal discomfort. He underwent dialysis on ___ with \nsubstantial improvement in respiratory status and improvement in \nhis ascites.  \n\n【49】ACUTE EXACERBATION OF COPD/BRONCHITIS:\nHe continued to have a persistent cough and dyspnea with rhonchi \nand profound wheezing at times. A CXR revealed possible RLL \npneumonia and he was again started on treatment for COPD \nexacerbation and pneumonia. In the setting of frequent \nlevalbuterol nebulizer treatments Mr. ___ again went into \natrial fibrillation but with rate controlled and no symptoms.\nPulmonary was consulted who initially recommended Solumedrol \n60mg IV BID, and he was markedly improved with  minimal cough \nwithin 12 hours of the first dose. He transitioned to a \nprednisone taper with initiation of Spiriva and flovent at the \nend of the prednisone taper. They felt it best to avoid ___ due \nto his history of AF. He will be treated for pneumonia with \nrenally dosed Levaquin which will continue until ___. He will \nfollow-up with his pulmonologist, Dr. ___ as scheduled at his \nPCP office for COPD management and as well as recommended formal \npulmonary rehab program which he would benefit from. He remains \n02 dependent at 0.5L and goal saturation of 90%. \n\n【50】GAVE SYNDROME, BLEEDING DUE TO ACUTE USE OF HEPARIN DRIP POST \nDISSECTION:\nHe continued to have significant oozing from the IJ site and \nnoted dark stools.  These were guaiac positive, to be expected \nin GAVE syndrome, for which he has a history.  Of note, he has \nfailed anticoagulation in the past for his AFIB due to the risk \nof bleeding, and increased bleeding.  The heparin drip was \nstopped and the oozing improved.  GI was consulted and he was \nstarted on twice daily IV Protonix until he could be seen for \nrectal examination. He had no further bleeding the remainder of \nhospitalization.\n\n【51】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Finasteride 5 mg PO DAILY \n2.

Eventually she required Amiodarone for \naflutter correction and this along with metoprolol both rate and \nrhythm controlled her.  \n\n【39】# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Pt was in cardiogenic \nshock with poor cardiac output, requiring pressors/inotropes and \nballoon pump, and became volume overloaded. Balloon pump had to \nbe d/c'd in the setting of LLE compartment syndrome.  She was \neventually diuresed aggressively with CVVH, and was then felt to \nbe volume depleted.  She was eventually weaned off of pressors, \nher EF was largely preserved at 50%.  She intermittently became \nhypotensive with acute blood loss s/p multiple LLE debridment.  \nShe was intermittently requiring pressors and CVVH in this \nsetting.  She was eventually started on milrinone on HD days, \nand metoprolol was held to allow for large volume shifts \nassociated with HD.  \n\n【40】#Arrythmias: In NSR in the unit but had an episode of sinus \narrest in cath lab. Temp pacer in but now mostly native \ncomplexes, pacer removed ___.  Her heart rate ranged from \ntachycardic to normal sinus.  She was observed to be at various \ntimes in Atrial tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial \nfibrillation, atrial flutter, the atrial tachycardia, atrial \nfibrillation, and atrial flutter eventually resolved with \namiodarone on board.  She remained in NSR for the remainder of \nher hospitalization.  \n\n【41】# Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to \n___ from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure \nand probably exacerbated by 320 ccs of contrast recieved in cath \nlab.  She developed muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Due to \nhyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria immediately post cath, she was \ntreated with CVVHD for volume overload and hyperkalemia.  She \nfailed repeated trials off of CRRT.  Eventually it was felt that \nshe no longer required volume removal and she tolerated \nintermittent HD without pressors.  Likely now dialysis-dependent \nwith oliguria, however renal consultants believe that urine \noutput should be followed closely as she continues to have \npotential to regain renal function.  \n\n【42】# LLE compartment syndrome: treated with removal of balloon pump \nand fasciotomy on ___.  In this setting she developed \nrhabdomyolysis with a peak CK of >100,000.  This eventually \ntrended down to normal ranges with CVVH and fasciotomy.  Wound \nVac was placed by vascular surgery who observed her on a daily \nbasis.  She was debrided on ___ and planned for closure \nhowever the wound was felt to be too big and not appropriate for \ngrafting.  At that time deep tissue cultures grew out ___ \nalbicans.  Vascular and plastics colaboratively decided to allow \nfor healing by secondary intention (vs. graft placement).  She \nwas started on fluconazole, with duration of treatment for \nosteomyelitis given proximity of this deep tissue infection to \nbone.  She received multple further debridments in the OR and at \nthe bedside.  Wound vac was in place on both leg wounds.  She \nhas follow up with vascular surgery and plastic surgery as \noutpt.  \n\n【43】# Respiratory Failure: Likely due to acute pulmonary edema in \nthe setting of cardiogenic failure. She required vent support \nand was given lasix and ultimately CVVHD for volume overload.  \nAfter volume overload was corrected she eventually required less \nand less respiratory support, however as she was intubated for \ngreater than 2 weeks, she was trach'd in the OR.  She eventually \ntolerated CPAP, and trach mask.  ___ trials were \nsuccessful on ___.\n\n【44】# Elevated LFTs: Markedly elevated at admission. Likely shock \nliver combined with rhabdo.  Statin was temporarily held.  Liver \nfunction tests eventually trended down on there own.  They again \nstarted to trend upwards on fluconazole.  However, she was also \non amiodarone and high dose statin at that time.  LFTs should be \nfollowed as outpt and medications should be adjusted if LFTs \ncontinue to trend upwards.  \n\n【45】# Anemia: S/p 27 units pRBC, 2 units FFT, 2 units platelets, 2 \nunits cryo. Ms. ___ had persistent anemia throughout her stay \nwhich required greater than many units of of PRBC. DIC, \nhemolysis, and anemia of chronic disease, were all worked up and \nconsidered as causes, and eventually hepatic dysfunction was \nsettled on as the cause, given concomitant coagulopathy.  As she \nstabilized from a hepatic perspective, she continued to have \nchronic anemia from renal disease, worsened by acute blood loss \nanemia due to leg debridment. Currently receiving EPO with HD. \nHCT has been stable for several days.   \n\n【46】# GI bleed: on ___ she was noted to have frankly melanotic \nstool.  GI was called who felt she was oozing secondary to \nhepatic dysfunction.  The melena resolved with IV protonix for \n72 hours, and then BID.  GI bleed self resolved. \n\n【47】# ID: In the setting of intermittent fevers and WBC elevations \nto the 30___ she was empirically started on vanc and cefepime to \ncover skin flora infecting her leg.  She was ruled out for \nC.Diff several times and cultures never revealed a source aside \nfrom klebsiella in her sputum, and coag negative staph in her \nA-line (thought to be contaminant).  Her deep tissue cultures \nrevealed ___ albicans.  ID followed her  and she was \ndischarged only on at least a 30 day course of fluconazole, with \ninstructions to follow up with ID in 3 weeks to determine if abx \nregimen at that point is sufficient.  Monitoring of liver \nfunction, CBC, and markers of inflamation should be followed at \nrehab and faxed to the ID doctor, ___. \n\n【48】# IDDM: Initially high BS on admission.  She was initially \ntreated with insulin gtt and then transitioned to long acting \nwith ISS. ___ was consulted and recomended ISS given her \nhighly variable insulin clearance given her volatile renal \nfunction.  Once a regular HD schedule is begun, it is expected \nthat her insulin requirements will stabilize.  Discharged on 12u \nlantus qAM + humalog SSI.  Insulin sliding scale may be titrated \nas outpt to achieve glucose of 150-250.  \n\n【49】#Lower extremity plegia - Pt was in state of reduced mental \nstatus during the critical portion of her hospital course.  When \nshe aroused sufficiently to be able to participate in \nquestioning and physical exam maneuvers it was discovered that \nshe was unable to move either of her lower extremities and had \nminimal to no sensation in both.  Neurology was consulted.  \nSpinal MRI showed no sign of anterior spinal infarct given h/o \nhypotension in setting of baloon pump.  However, EMG showed \nevidence of critical illness neuropathy with sign of anterior \nhorn involvement.  Pt should be followed up with Neurology as \noutpt in one month for reassesment of diagnosis and prognosis of \nlower extremity function.  \n\n【50】# FEN: Ms ___ was fed through tube feeds.  Multiple feeding \noptions were used throughout hospitalization, including OG/NGT, \nDobhoff, and attempted PEG placement which failed ___ body \nhabitus.  Thoracic surgery felt that laparoscopic G-tube \nplacement was an option but that her medical issues should be \noptimized further before surgery, as they felt that this was \nsomewhat risky.  Goal is to maintain an albumin of > 2.5 to be \nan operative candidate for PEG placement.  She was discharged \nwith ability to take thin liquids and pureed foods.  She also \nhad a dobhoff tube placed in the stomach for additional tube \nfeeds.  Oral intake should be encouraged. Medications should not \nbe administered through NGT, as it tends to clog. Please \nadminister medications crushed in puree orally. \n\n【51】Medications on Admission:\nClonidine 0.3mg patch qwk\nLasix 40mg PO BID\nDiovan 320mg PO daily\nZaroxolyn 2.5mg PO daily\nASA 81mg PO daily\nProzac 20mg PO daily\nlevothyroxine 100mcg PO daily\nPrilosec 20mg PO daily\nAtenolol 100mg PO daily\nZocor 80mg PO daily\nmeclizine 2.5mg PO daily\nPotassium 10meq PO daily\nNovolog ISS\nLantus 30 units qhs\nVit D 50K units qwk\n\n【52】Discharge Medications:\n1.

She tolerates her tracheotomy well and \nsuccessfully passed a ___ placement trial.  Her \nneurologic status is difficult to determine; the patient \ngenerally responds to simple commands but is intermittently \neither uncooperative or otherwise nonresponsive to questioning.  \nShe moves both upper extremities and her head spontaneously but \nhas not been noted to have spontaneous movement of either lower \nextremity during this hospitalization.\n\n【58】Discharge Instructions:\nMs. ___ was seen at ___ for ST-elevation myocardial \ninfarction complicated by shock.  She spent an extended period \nof time in the hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of \nshock.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was initially placed to aid \nheart flow but this led to a complication of left lower \nextremity compartment syndrome, which necessitated surgery on \nthe left leg.\n\n【59】Mrs. ___ required mechanical ventilation for respiratory \nfailure.  Because she was intubated for a prolonged time, a \ntracheostomy was placed with a special valve so she could talk \nthrough her tracheostomy hole.  \n\n【60】Additionally, her hospital course was complicated by acute renal \nfailure.  She required regular dialysis during her \nhospitalization and it is felt that she will be dependent on \ndialysis from this point.\n\n【61】She will need continued wound care for the left leg, and is \nfollowed by vascular and plastic surgery.  An ultimate plan has \nnot been decided as to how her wound will be closed at this \ntime; she will need to follow up with these services as an \noutpatient.\n\n【62】During her hospital course, Mrs. ___ was found to have severe \nlower extremity weakness.  She was seen by the neurologists who \nbelieve that her weakness is due from her prolonged critical \nillness.  However, during her heart attack she may have suffered \nfrom a stroke in the spinal cord.  She will need to be followed \nby neurology as an outpatient.\n\n【63】During surgical debridement, her deep tissue culture was found \nto grow out ___ albicans, sensitivities pending.  Per the \nrecommendations of our infectious disease specialists, she was \nplaced on fluconazole, with instructions to continue for at \nleast 3 weeks through her next outpatient appointment, at which \ntime further recommendations will be made regarding duration of \ntreatment.  While on the fluconazole, she will need to have \nweekly monitored blood work with CBC with differential and LFTs. \n\n【64】She will need continued dialysis, most likely three times a \nweek.\n\n【65】Many changes were made to Mrs. ___ medication regimen.  PLease \nsee attached sheet for medication administration.\n\n【66】Please return to the emergency room or call Mrs. ___ \nphysician if she develops increased lower extremity pain or \ndischarge, fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other \nconcerning symptom.  \n\n【67】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The \npatient was transferred from ___, and later from the \nneurosurgical service to the medicine service at ___ for \nmanagement of further medical issues and fall work-up; no \nneurosurgical intervention was indicated. His antiplatelet \ntherapy with aspirin and plavix was held. He was discharged with \na stable mild headache and no neurological deficits.\n#SYNCOPE: The patient had unwitnessed fall of which he has no \nrecollection. He was conscious when found by daughter in \nadjacent room without post ictal changes or bowel/bladder \ndysfunction. He had systolic dysfunction EF 40% with regional \nwma on recent echo from ___ but not aortic stenosis \nor outflow tract obstruction that could precipitate syncope. The \npatient had history of recent diarrhea and also could have been \nhypovolemic initially. He had also labile blood pressures \ninitally ranging high with SBP 160-180, then low 100's. With \nImdur 30 daily and Hydralazine 10mg TID, the patient's BP fell \nto SBP ___ssymptomatic. As his BP started to run \nlower and as significant afterload reduction can lead to \northostatis and falls, his blood pressure medications were \nchanged: Toprol decreased to 25mg daily. Hydralazine \ndiscontinued. Imdur was changed to 15mg qhs. In addtion, he also \nhad frequent episodes of NSVT with improved with betablocker. On \nbeta blocker the patient was bradycardic to 50-60 but \nassymptomatic. Cardiology consult was called to determine the \nrole of possible tachy-brady syndrome in his syncope. Per \ncardiology, the did not think that he had tachy-brady sundrome \nand they advised against pacemaker placement. At discharge, he \nhad ___ beat runs of NVST ___ times daily with resting sinus \nbradycardia at 50-60. Ultimately, the cause of his syncope is \nunknown but was most likely due to orthostatic hypotension due \nto medications.\n# OSTEOMYELITIS; The patient was followed by the ID service \nhere. He currently exhibits signs of healing chronic \nosteomyelitis with a small superifical papule on his elbow. His \nESR was 47 and CRP 4.9 which is lower than ESR 68 in ___ while \nat ___. He was admitted on doxycline which was started while \nhospitalized at ___ in ___ for MRSA found on right \nelbow arthrocentesis. However, his platelets were decreasing. \nDoxycline and Imuran were stopped given their potential for \nmarrow suppression. Temporaly, doxycline is the most likely \nculprit. He was then briefly on vancomycin, but then switched to \nBactrim. Bactrim had been initally started at ___ then \ndiscontinued in the setting of renal failure. However, it was \nnow decided that his renal failure ___ not have been due to \nBactrim but rather to overdiuresis and lasix. Given that his \nMRSA was only sensitive to Vanc, doxy and bactrim, it was \nthought that rechallenging him with the plan to closely monitor \nhis platelets was the best plan of action at this point. He \nshould have his ESR and CRP checked on a regular basis to \nmonitor for worsening osteomyelitis.\n#THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  PLT count 160 in ___ at ___, 100 on \nadmission, 75 at discharge. Per discussion with his outpt \nhematologist, his MDS diagnosis is not firm and the patient has \nnever had thrombocytopenia. Plavix and ASA were held. Imuran was \nstopped. HIT antibody negative. Hemolysis labs also WNL with nl \nfibrinogen and haptoglobin making TTP unlikely. Doxycycline was \nthought to be the most likely reason for a drop in platelets \ngiven that it was started just before his platelets began to \nfall. Per pharmacy, doxycline has a 24 hour half life and will \nbe fully out of his system in ___ days on ___ at which \npoint we should see his platelets recover if indeed doxycline \ncaused his thrombocytopenia. His platelets should be followed \nclosely. As bactrim can also cause marrow supression, if his \nplatelets continue to fall or if they do not recover in one \nweek, bactrim should be stopped. Close follow up with his outpt \nhematologist was arranged.\n#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Suspected prerenal azotemia, on acceptance \ncreatinine 1.8. Improved with fluids and then PO intake with \ncreatinine returing to baseline of 1.3\n.\n#MYASTHENIA ___: Imuran discontinued as above. Pt will follow \nup with neurologist.\n# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC CHF: Newly diagnosed at ___ one month ago \nwith EF 40%, fixed inferior wall motion abnormality. He arrived \non Imdur and Hydralazine for afterload reduction. He was on no \nstanding lasix. On admission and throughout his stay, he did not \nhave any signs of heart failure, SOB or distal edema. Imdur and \nHydralazine were reduced as above. The patient is not on an ACEi \nas it is contraindicated with Imuran. If the patient remains off \nof Imuran, he should start an ACEi or ___.\n\n【13】Medications on Admission:\nDoxycycline 100 mg bid ...CONTINUED\n\n【14】Plavix 75 mg qd ....HELD\nASA 325 mg qd  ....HELD\nToprol 50 mg qd  ....LOPRESSOR 12.5MG PO BID\nIsordil 10 mg tid  ...IMDUR 30MG PO DAILY\nApresoline/Hydralazine 20 mg bid  .DISCONTINUED\nSimvastatin 20 mg qhs ...DISCONTINUED\nLisinopril 20mg PO daily  ..DISCONTINUED\n\n【15】Imuran 150 mg qd  ...HELD\n\n【16】Lactobacillus T qd ...HELD, NF\nLoperamide as needed ...DISCONTINUED\nSenekot prn  ....HELD\n\n【17】Iron 325 mg qd  ....HELD\n\n【18】Flomax 0.4 mg qd  ...CONTINUED\n\n【19】Xalantan  .....CONTINUED\nAlphagan eyedrops  ...CONTINUED\nTrusopt eye drops  ...CONTINUED\nRestasis eye drops  ...CONTINUED\n\n【20】Discharge Medications:\n1.

The LAD was occluded \ndistal to the \ngreat septal and proximal to the first diagonal vessel. The LCx \nand RCA \nwere free of angiographically significant disease. \n2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of left (PCW mean \n25mmHg) and \nright sided (RVEDP 19mmHg) filling pressures with mild pulmonary \nartery \nhypertension (mean PASP 35mmHg with PASP 46mmHg). The cardiac \nindex was \ndepressed at 1.9 L/min/m2 with an elevated SVR at ___ \ndynes*sec*cm-5. \nPVR was also elevated at 235 dynes*sec*cm-5. \n\n【14】FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. One vessel coronary artery disease with LAD occlusion distal \nto first \nseptal and proximal to the first diagonal with fresh thrombus. \n2. Systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction. \n.\n___ ECHO:\nSuboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated. Left \nventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular \ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with septal, \nanterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or \nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular \nseptal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve \nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral \nregurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  \n.\n___ CXR (Portable)\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Mild pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. \n2. Round density overlying the superior left hemithorax, \nprobable bone island. Recommend non-urgent lordotic views for \nfurther evaluation. \n.\n___\nLimited ECHO to evaluate LV function:\nThere is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with near akinesis of the mid to distal anterior \nseptum and anterior wall. There is no ventricular septal defect. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThere is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is \nseen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a \nprominent fat pad. \n\n【15】IMPRESSION: mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfuntion \nconsistent with mid-LAD infarction. The other segments are \nhyperdynamic. No LVOT gradient seen. \n\n【16】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ y/oF with PMH of Turner's Syndrome on chronic HRT transferred \nto the CCU following STEMI s/p DES to LAD\n\n【17】# CAD: Presented with STEMI to LAD and went to cath lab where a \nDES was placed with no significant atherosclerosis in remainder \nof coronary arteries.  Does have significant CAD as well as risk \nfactors including longterm hormone replacement therapy and \nTurners Syndrome.  She was started on Aspirin, plavix, \nmetoprolol, and atorvastatin.  Her premarin was discontinued as \nit puts her at risk for CAD.  ECHO showed left ventricular \nsystolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with \nseptal, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis.  Hemoglobin \nA1c was 5.6 and lipid panel showed Cholest 193 Triglyc 93 HDL 62 \nCHOL/HD 3.1, LDLcalc 112.  The patient was monitored on the \nCardiac ICU for over 24 hours and then she was transferred to \nthe cardiac floor.  On the floor she continued to be \ntachycardica dn her heart rate would increase to the 130s with \nminimal exertion, her metoprolol XL was doubled to 100mg PO \nDaily.  She continued to be tachycardic.  While this was to be \nexpected to an extent given her myocardial injury a limited ECHO \nof the LV was performed which showed mild to moderate regional \nLV systolic dysfuntion consistent with mid-LAD infarction. The \nother segments are hyperdynamic. No LVOT gradient seen. She was \ndischarged home with follow up in the outpatient setting.    \n.  \n# CHF: Appears mildly volume overloaded with crackles on \npulmonary auscultation and evidence of elevated filling \npressures on RH catheterization. Pt was started on \nspironolactone because EF was less than 40%.  Lisinopril 10mg PO \ndaily was also started.  She was satting well on room air and \nwas transferred to ___ 3 for further care.  She will need a \nrepeat ECHO in the coming weeks to re-evaluate the extent of \ndisease. \n.  \n# Turners Syndrome: Given her CAD, we held her hormone \nreplacement therapy.  Calcium/ vitamin D was started given risk \nof osteoporosis.  She was not restarted on her premarin as it \nincreases her risk of CAD.\n# leukocytosis: WBC count elevated to 15, likely stress response \nto recent STEMI.  No evidence of infectious etiology such as \nfever, cough, dysuria.  She was not started on Abx and her WBC \nnormalized on hospital day 2.  \n.  \nCODE: Full Code  \n\n【18】Medications on Admission:\n- premarin 0.625mg daily\n- medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily during luteal phase\n\n【19】Discharge Medications:\n1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Patient and son would like to pursue aggressive \ntreatment with experimental chemotherapy despite poor prognosis \nand significant recent decline. Biopsy was requested for genetic \ntesting and \"to see if there is any adenocarcinoma\" or if the \nmalignancy had changed to adenocarcinoma.  They were advised \nthat this was highly unlikely. The reasoning was that if there \nwas a facility that was willing to treat the patient with a gene \ntargeted chemotherapy, or if any of his lung disease was due to \nadenocarcinoma that could be treated, then the biopsy would be \nready for them and they would ask for treatment. Per last visit \nwith IP and Oncology here, no further treatment is planned or \nindicated ___ setting of his clinical deterioration, recurrent \ninfections, etc. We recontacted heme-onc as a courtesy and this \nwas confirmed.\n\n【51】# Goals of ___: There were multiple attempts to discuss \npatient's recurrent hospitalization, infections, and \ncomplications.

Fever.\n\n【16】COMPARISONS: CT torso ___hest ___ and ___.\n\n【17】TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained through the \nchest in standard and lung algorithm. No intravenous contrast \nwas administered. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were \nobtained.\n\n【18】CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The tracheobronchial tree is patent \nto the segmental level bilaterally. However, there is a \nwidespread interstitial lung abnormality most prominent at the \nbases where there is mild basilar and peripheral pulmonary \nfibrosis with mild bronchiolectasis. Additionally, throughout \nthe lung parenchyma are seen multiple solid and ground-glass \nnodules, several of which are new or larger than on the prior \nexamination. For example, a left upper lobe 4-mm nodule with \nground-glass halo is new (4:51). Another left upper lobe solid \nnodule measuring 7 mm is new.\n\n【19】Also new is an area of ground-glass opacity adjacent to the \nright mediastinum\nin the right upper lobe measuring 24 mm (4:63). There is no \ninterstitial or airspacer pulmonary edema.\n\n【20】A rind of density along the right major fissure likely \nrepresents a combination of pleural thickening and subpleural \natelectasis. Atherosclerotic calcifications in the coronary \narteries, aortic arch, and descending aorta are moderate in \nseverity. Mitral annulus calcifications are moderate. There is \nno pericardial effusion.\n\n【21】Again seen are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to \n9 mm in the precarinal station, 10 mm within the aortopulmonary \nwindow, and 10 mm within the right paraesophageal station. There \nis no pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar nodes.\n\n【22】Limited images through the upper abdomen show unremarkable \nportions of the liver and spleen. The imaged adrenal glands are \nunremarkable.\n\n【23】BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous \nlesions.\n\n【24】IMPRESSION:\n1. Marked diffuse interstitial and nodular pulmonary parenchymal \nabnormalities, including interval development of fibrosis at the \nlung bases, new small pulmonary nodules, could all be \nmanifestations of granulomatous lung disease, including \nvasculitis. No pulmonary edema or volume overload at this time.\n\n【25】2. The only area of possible pneumonia is a small region of new \nground glass density in the right upper lobe.\n\n【26】3. Stable cardiomegaly and prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\n【27】Brief Hospital Course:\nThis ___ yo male with known granulomatous disease of the lungs, \nESRD on HD admitted from HD with confusion and fever.\n\n【28】1.  Fever--the patient was pancultured in the ER and given \nempiric ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  CXR showed volume overload \nand there was no obvious infiltrate.  A CT scan was obtained for \nfuther evaluation (results listed above).  The patient had only \na mild cough on exam and no oxygen requirement.  He was anuric \nand UTI was felt to be a less likely source.  The patient \nrefused straight cath for a urine sample.  The patient's mental \nstatus was at baseline per family the evening of admission but \nthe following day he was disoriented and agitated.  This \nresolved without pharmacoligical intervention and with \nreassurance from the family.  Given the possible right upper \nlobe infiltrate it was decided to place the patient on levaquin \nfor CAP for a 10 day course (renally dosed).  In discussion with \nthe renal service it was felt that the vancomycin could be held \nsince it was less likely to be a line infection (has AV \nfistula).  The patient had no leukocytosis and defervesced prior \nto discharge.  He will follow up at outpatient HD on ___.  \nHe was instructed to return to the ER or call his PCP if he were \nto develop any fevers, chills, cough or new symptoms.\n\n【29】2.  ESRD--the patient received HD prior to dc without \ncomplicaitons.\n3.  DM type II--the patient was maintained on his home regimen.\n4.  HTN, benign essential:  the patient was maintained on his \nprior regimen.\n5.  AMS--? related to fever, PNA on CXR.  Resolved by the time \nof discharge.  There were no meningeal signs and no evidence of \nmeningitis.  ? if the patient's benadryl prior to HD would cause \nhis delirium.  Patient may also have some mild senile dementia \nat baseline.\n6.  Granulomatous lung disease:  the patient had no oxygen \nrequirement as described above.  He will complete a 10 day \ncourse of levaquin for possible CAP.  He will follow up with \npulmonary upon discharge.\n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\nASA 81 mg daily  \nBenadryl and acetaminophen (not in OMR - takes prior to \ndialysis)  \nGlipizide 5 BID  \nLopressor 50mg BID  \nNorvasc 5mg daily  \nRanitidine 150 mg QHS  \nRenaphro 1 daily  \nSensipar 90mg daily (not in OMR, but patient states his is on \nand on dialysis record)  \nUnivasc (moesipril) 15 mg daily (not in OMR, unclear if on)  \nVit E (not in OMR, but patient states he takes and is on \ndialysis record)  \nZemplar 5mcg/mL Q3weeks at dialysis  \n\n【31】Discharge Medications:\n1.

CTA \nshowed a large retroperitoneal hematoma with inferior extension \ninto the right groin with active arterial extravasation. ___ \nconsulted and patient underwent diagnostic angiogram with \nembolization. H/H stabilized initially post-procedurally, \nhowever dropped again on AM ___ requiring transfusion. Repeat \nimaging showed no active extravasation of blood. H/H stabilized \nfor 24 hours prior to discharge without requiring further \ntransfusion. \n\n【35】# Acute blood loss anemia on chronic anemia\n# Thrombocytopenia\nPresented with acute blood loss anemia due to spontaneous RP \nhematoma. Cause of bleed was unclear as the patient's \ncoagulation tests were normal and his platelet count was normal \nupon admission. Discussed with hematology who did not think this \npresentation was consistent with an underlying coagulopathy \ngiven his relatively normal laboratory values. Uremic platelet \ndysfunction was considered, however patient has not been \nsignificantly uremic and has been compliant with dialysis. \nPatient likely developed thrombocytopenia throughout his \nadmission from a consumptive process. Continued home ferric \ncitrate (auryxia).\n\n【36】# Bilateral pleural effusions\nCT A/P showed bilateral pleural effusions that had increased in \nsize from ___. There was concern that these represented \nhemorrhagic pleural effusions based on radiologic evaluation of \nhoundsfield units. IP was consulted and placed b/l chest tubes \nwith serosanguinous output. Fluid studies consistent with \ntransudative effusion, likely secondary to volume overload after \nUF has been limited with recent dialysis sessions. No evidence \nof hemorrhagic effusions. Chest tubes were subsequently removed.\n\n【37】CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:\n========================\n# ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy, on HD MWF \nHD dependent since ___ and patient does not make urine. Renal \ndialysis was consulted and patient continued MWF dialysis \nsessions. Received urgent dialysis session on ___ for \nhyperkalemia, likely in the setting of only undergoing a partial \ndialysis session on the day of admission and increase of serum \npotassium from blood product breakdown. Continued cinacalcet \n90mg daily.\n\n【38】# Moderate Aortic stenosis\n# New heart failure with reduced EF (45-50%)\nAsymptomatic and without evidence of heart failure per \noutpatient records. Euvolemic during this admission. Prior \ndiagnosis of HFpEF, now HFrEF thought to be secondary to a \ntachyarrhythmia. Volume managed with HD. Held home \nspironolactone and metoprolol succinate in the setting of acute \nhemorrhage. Continued atorvastatin 40mg qhs.\n\n【39】# History of atrial fibrillation not on AC\nPatient had recent isolated episode of atrial fibrillation in \nthe setting of sepsis from prior infected LUE AVF.

Podiatry was consulted and felt that there was no \nevidence of ongoing cellulitis and no need for surgical \nintervention, they recommended outpatient follow up. There was \nno evidence of gout and no significant tenderness on exam. The \nRLE ulcer was superficial and recceived daily wound care in \nhouse.  The right foot film from the ED raised concern for \nunderlying osteomyelitis.  However, the ESR of 0 and repeat of 3 \nmade osteo very unlikely.  Records were obtained from ___ \n___ that document 3 different admissions in ___ \nof the his year for the similar complaints of lower extremity \npain.  Pt had a thorough work up for osteomyelitis including MRI \nand bone biopsy on ___.  The pathology report described \nreactive changes not consistent with infection.

On the day of discharge from ___, pt \nexpressed frustration about the lack on inhospital care for his \nfeet. However, there were no ongoing medical issues requiring \nhospitalization.  The negative bone biopsy and ESR of zero made \nosteomyelitis very unlikely and Podiatry felt his ongoing \nonychomycosis & superficial skin ulcers were appropriate for \noutpatient follow up.  Pt was not requiring any medication for \npain control and was scheduled to see podiatry four days after \ndischarge .  He was given a prescription for topical \nclotrimazole BID and recommended to perform daily foot care to \nkeep the wound clean.  \n.  \n2.

You continued to have some mild streaking of blood with \nyour stools but this is likely aggravated by hemorrhoids which \ncan bleed when you're constipated and straining. Your blood \ncounts and vital signs were stable and as a result, a \ncolonoscopy was not consistent with your goals at this time. You \nwere given a bowel regimen to soften your stools and to reduce \nstraining and therefore bleeding. \n\n【53】Your urine also showed a urinary tract infection for which you \nwere started on antibiotics and you will complete your last dose \nof antibiotics tonight.\n\n【54】You should take your medications as listed below and attend your \nfollow-up appointments.\n\n【55】It was a pleasure taking care of you!\n\n【56】Your ___ Team\n\n【57】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Patient states that \nyesterday afternoon while driving he developed sudden throat \npain on both sides of his neck from his jaw down to his upper \nchest.  Describes this feeling as \"tightness.\" He also states \nthat his face felt diaphoretic with occasional shortness of \nbreath, described as if his neck was closing in.  He drove to an \nOSH, where he was felt to have angioedema and started on \nsolumedrol, benadryl, and zantac.  Patient denies any dysphagia, \nodynophagia, N/V/D, abd pain, f/c, HA, palpitations.  Also \ncomplained of bilateral calf tenderness overnight that has since \nresolved.  \n\n【9】At the OSH, ENT was consulted and a fiberoptic laryngoscopy was \nperformed, with the larynx felt to be edematous with normal \nvocal cord mobility with a patent airway.  The patient this \nmorning had a neck and chest CTA that was read at the OSH as \npartial thrombus of right IJ and occlusion of the right \nsubclavian with tiny peripheral pulmonary emboli. The patient \nthen requested transfer to ___ for further evaluation.  Per \nverbal report during transfer, the patient may have been \nhypotensive during transfer, but in the setting of having a \nnitroglycerin patch placed.\n\n【10】Currently, the patient states that he continues to have neck \npain described as tightness or pressure from his jaw to his \nupper chest bilaterally.  Also states that his face is swollen \nand flushed, and that he occasionally feels short of breath \ndescribed as the airway in his neck closing off.\n\n【11】Past Medical History:\nHTN\nCAD (3 AMI s/p 5 stents most recently in ___\nHyperlipidemia\nGERD\nChronic low back pain s/p 20+ surgeries after hit and run \naccident\nDiverticulitis s/p partial colectomy\nTonsillectomy and adenoidectomy\n\n【12】Social History:\n___\nFamily History:\nCAD.

Study performed in \narterial phase, making interpretation of venous system \nunreliable for detecting thrombus. Airway patent, chest CTA does \nnot demonstrate pulmonary emboli.  \n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a PMH \nsignificant for CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and T+A transferred \nfrom OSH for possible right IJ and subclavian thrombus.\n\n【18】1. Facial/neck swelling and erythema: At OSH, initially \nconcerning for angioedema.  ENT at OSH performed fiberoptic \nlaryngoscopy that demonstrated a patent airway with laryngeal \nedema.  A CTA at OSH was initially read as R IJ and subclavian \nthrombus as well as multiple small PE, although read by \nradiology here is more likely to be mixing defect.  At this \ntime, this still most likely represents angioedema in setting of \nACE-I or aspirin therapy, as patient demonstrates significant \nfacial and neck swelling and erythema with accompanying \nlaryngeal edema. Patient may also have been hypotensive during \ntransport, which would also support angioedema as the underlying \ncause.  Other potential etiologies include SVC syndrome, facial \nlymphedema, or facial cellulitis.  Vascular surgery evaluated \nthe patient while he was admitted, and agreed that the patient \ndid not have a thrombus, and that heparin gtt was not necessary. \n The patient was continued on a steroid taper and benadryl, and \nhe remained stable for the remainder of his admission.  He was \nadvised on discharge to avoid driving while taking benadryl, and \nto coordinate with his PCP having ___ repeat CT venogram of his \nneck and CTA chest to reassess for interval change in 2 weeks.  \nHe was also instructed to discontinue aspirin and lisinopril \ntherapy, and to call his cardiologist on ___ in order to \ninquire as to whether he needs to continue with his clopidogrel.\n\n【19】2. Consolidation on CXR: Patient on CXR had a LLL consolidation \nat the costodiaphragmatic angle.  He did not demonstrate any \nclinical signs of pneumonia including fever, cough, shortness of \nbreath, or pleuritic chest pain, and so antimicrobial therapy \nwas deferred.  He remained stable during his hospital course.\n\n【20】3. CAD: Lisinopril and aspirin held during this admission. The \npatient reports that he has had a past allergy to aspirin where \nhis uvula became swollen. He underwent aspirin desensitization \nand has not had any significant problems since.  The patient was \nadvised to stop taking both lisinopril and aspirin and to \nfollow-up with his PCP. His plavix was initially held on \nadmission, but was restarted during his hospital course and he \nremained stable without any changes to his airway. He states \nthat his last stent placement was in ___, and the he thinks \nthat it was a bare metal stent.  He was advised on discharge to \ndiscuss with his cardiologist immediately if he needs to \ncontinue clopidogrel therapy.  Patient was continued on his beta \nblocker and statin during admission.\n\n【21】4. Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to steroid therapy.  Patient \ndoes not have significant signs or symptoms of infection.\n\n【22】5. Hypertension: Continued on metoprolol during hospital course.\n\n【23】6.

Patient has noted almost daily \nheadaches for the past 1.5 months. Her headaches are described \nas bilateral, sharp pain with ocular pressure. She denies a \nchronic history of headaches prior to this. Additionally, \npatient has a history of hypertension and was on Lisinopril \n40/HCTZ 50 and Atenolol 50 mg until she was hospitalized in \n___ for what was later determined to be gout. Her HCTZ was \nstopped at this time and for reasons that are unclear, her \nLisinopril was decreased from 40 to 20 on discharge. She \ncontinued on her dose of Atenolol 50 mg. Since that time, her \nblood pressure has been progressively poorly-controlled and \nLisinopril was eventually increased to 40 mg PO QD. Her BP \ncontinued to be poorly-controlled and she began to relate her \nheadaches to her blood pressure noting that when she took her \nblood pressure medications, her headache would subside. She \ndenies any visual changes, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, \nfevers/chills, neck stiffness with these headaches. She also \ndenies stress and in fact notes that she recently retired from \nher job of ___ years and reports a smooth transition into \nretirement.\n\n【9】Today, patient had a headache and wanted to have her blood \npressure checked in the hospital, in an effort to compare the \nblood pressure readings she would get at home with another \nreading by a medical professional. She presented to ___ and \nwas found to have a BP of 211/86. She received Labetalol 20 mg \nIV and Cardizem 30 mg PO which eventually brought her SBP down \nto 180s, but she was still having a mild HA. Additionally, she \nhad a UA that showed 100 protein without blood, but she was also \nnoted to have 100 of protein in her urine in ___. A head \nCT and CXR were both unremarkable. She was then admitted for \nfurther work-up of hypertensive emergency.\n\n【10】Upon arrival to the floor, patient's blood pressure was 187/87 \nand she was still experiencing a mild headache, though improved \nfrom prior. Further history revealed no reports of focal \nweakness, slurred speech, hematuria/dysuria, chest pain or \ndietary indiscretions. She reports infrequent palpitations and a \nchronic history of back pain, spanning back years without acute \nworsening.\n\n【11】Past Medical History:\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.  Hypertension\n2.

CXR was unremarkable for widened mediastinum \nsuggesting dissection was less likely. Also patient did not give \na classic history of chest and back pain. In addition, cardiac \nenzymes were checked and were negative for two sets. After this \nwork-up was completed, hypertension was thought to be most \nlikely attributed to changes in blood pressure medications \nduring last hospitalization. Given that HCTZ was discontinued \ndue to concerns for gout and that the patient had been \nwell-controlled on that medication, we initiated amlodipine at 5 \nmg per day. This intervention had a noticeable effect on blood \npressure at it was approximately 130 systolic at time of \ndischarge. Patient was educated on importance of low salt diet \nand follow-up was arranged for her to have a BP check by a nurse \npractitioner on ___ and then follow-up with her PCP later \nthat week. In regards to her urine dipstick showing mild \nproteinuria, it was noted that this is not a new finding and was \nattributed to damage caused by chronic hypertension.\n\n【22】# HA:\nAppears to be related to hypertension as headaches improved with \ncontrol of blood pressure and when SBP was at ~130, patient had \ncomplete resolution of headache. At presentation Head CT was \nnegative for intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. History and \nexam did not otherwise suggest infectious process as she denied \nfever and chills and had no leukocytosis and a supple neck at \npresentation. Headaches are not consistent with migraines and \npatient denies excessive stress to suggest tension headaches. \nGoal for headache prevention in future should be focused on \nblood pressure control.\n\n【23】# Gout:\nNo acute issues while hospitalized, though patient is not on \nallopurinol as an outpatient and would likely benefit from \nmaintenance dose given her uric acid level of 6.8 on ___.\n\n【24】# Glucose Intolerance:\nReported in history, but not on hypoglycemic agents as an \noutpatient. Fingersticks while hospitalized revealed \npost-prandial sugar of 166 and fasting sugar of 113 the morning \nfollowing admission.

She was admitted for management of her leg swelling \nand pain.       \n\n【15】# LEG PAIN AND SWELLING: Given her chronic diastolic HF, \ncongestion on CXR, her progressive SOB with exertion and her 6 \nlb weight gain, she was felt to have worsening CHF. Her last \nECHO was in ___, found to have EF >55%. She missed her dose of \nTorsemide the day prior to admission which may have acutely \nworsened her volume status. She admits that she misses doses \noccasionally if she won't be near a bathroom for several hours. \nThe patient was restarted on torsemide and realized a net 1.5L \ndiuresis on HD#2. Her torsemide was continued through the visit \nwhich improved both her lower extremity edema and SOB. She was \nprovided with additional counseling about the importance of \nlimiting salt and fluid intake and medication compliance.\n# CHEST TIGHTNESS: Patient developed chest tightness while lying \nin hospital bed, and reported that she has had it intermittently \nover past few days, not associated with difficulty breathing, \nSOB or chest pain. She received an albuterol nebulizer with \nrelief of symptom. Cardiac enzymes were neg X3. ECG had T wave \ninversions with some mild ST depressions, consistent with LV \nhypertrophy. She remained without chest symptoms the remainder \nof her hospital stay. The patient was questioned about her \nhistory of chest \"tightness\", pain, or pressure. She reported \nthat she does occasionally have tightness with and without \nexertion as well as episodes of shortness of breath and \ndiaphoresis. After discussion with PCP, it was determined that \npatient would not remain inpatient for stress testing and \ninstead pursue testing as outpatient per PCP.\n# WHEEZING, SOB: Symptoms are exertional and had been getting \nprogressively worse for past week. CXR showed evidence of \nvascular congestion and pt appeared volume overloaded on \nclinical exam. She was treated with 200 mg Torsemide with \nresulting 2+ L diuresis overall. Pt remained asymptomatic during \nhospitalization.\n# HYPOKALEMIA: Patient had mild ST depressions on ECG and a run \nof ventricular tachycardia. She received 40mg KCl to replete \npotential urinary K+ losses from diuresis. The hypokalemia \nresolved.\n#Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: Patient with generally well-controlled \ndiabetes at home, last A1c was 6.4%. Her fasting sugars while \ninpatient were tight around 110-140. Her metformin was held \nwhile admitted and she was placed on sliding scale insulin.

On the \nfloor, patient slept with legs elevated above the level of the \nheart, wore ACE compression bandages, and used topical \ntriamcinilone and emollient therapy as barrier protection. She \nhad workup and treatment for CHF as below. By discharge leg pain \nand swelling had significantly improved.\n\n【31】#CHF: Given peripheral lower extremity edema and chronic venous \ninsufficiency, it is likely that the patient has some degree of \ndiastolic heart failure. She has an outpatient cardiologist, Dr. \n___ in ___, but she has not seen him since ___. Here workup \nwas done for heart failure that included elevated BNP (___) and \nEcho that showed normal ejection fraction but moderate pulmonary \nhypertension and dilated right and left atria. It is possible \nthat she has diastolic heart failure with a normal ejection \nfraction. Chest X ray on admission showed ___ B lines \nsuggesting volume overload, so patient was started on IV Lasix \nfor diuresis. O2 sats improved and follow up chest X ray showed \nno signs volume overload. Her weight decreased four kilograms \nfrom admission to discharge, as she was likely fluid overloaded \nwhen she came in.  Discharge weight 66kg.  Patient worked with \n___ and desaturated to 90 on ambulation. This was felt to be most \nlikely due to her known COPD and she had a history of refusing \nhome O2 for this in the past. She unfortunately refused home \noxygen despite the risk of worsening lung disease and other \nserious consequences. We arranged close follow up with her PCP \nand outpatient cardiologist. \n\n【32】#CKD vs ___: The patient had no documentation of previous values \nof creatinine until ___. Creatinine at admission was 2.0 \ncompared to baseline creatinine 1.5. This was likely in the \nsetting of dehydration vs poor forward flow from CHF. FeNa was \n4% making prerenal less likely, however this was in setting of \ndiuretics which could mask prerenal. FeUrea was 3.8%. All \nmedications were renally dosed, and her lisinopril was held. \nCreatinine remained stable at 2.0 during this hospital stay.\n\n【33】CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES\n\n【34】#Atrial flutter: No acute issues this hospitalization. Patient \nhad documented previous atrial flutter and has a CHADS 2 score \nof at least 2 (given her age and history of hypertension). Per \noutpatient cardiology notes, she is not anticoagulated given \nfall risk due to decreased vision. She is on aspirin 81mg daily \nand diltiazem 180 for rate control.

There is fullness of the \napex along anterolateral wall that is most likley trabeculation \n(better defined on prior study, no Lumason used on either study \nbecause of pulmonary hypertension). The right ventricular cavity \nis moderately dilated with moderate global free wall \nhypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is \nlikely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid \nregurgitation.] The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \naortic valve leaflets 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> are mildly thickened but aortic \nstenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate \n(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow \npattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with \nelevated left atrial pressure. Severe [4+] tricuspid \nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] The end-diastolic pulmonic \nregurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery \ndiastolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. \nThere are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\n【21】 IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion without evidence of \ntamponade.

As per Toxicology, \"Soma is considered a skeletal \nmuscle relaxant but likely works by agonizing GABA.Jerking \nmotions are common s/p carisoprodol ingestions, likely due to \nmyoclonic jerks. These should be self limiting.If jerking \nmotions are not self-limiting upon paralysis wearing off, \nprobably reasonable to rule out sz activity w/ EEG, though this \nwould not likely be from a Soma ingestion.\"  ASA, APAP, ETOH \nscreens were negative.  Patient was able to be weaned from \nmidazolam and extubated within an hour of arriving to the MICU.  \nWhen extubated, she reported that she had taken 15 Soma (unknown \nstrength) at around 2pm as a suicide attempt.  She denies any \nother ingestion.  She did not have spontaneous myoclonus in the \nMICU, but initially had clonus when elicited on exam; this \nresolved within 12 hours. Her initial EKG looks WNL (sinus), and \nthere was no evidence of MAO-I ingestion.  Repeat labs are WNL.  \nEspecially given possible aspiration, the patient's respiratory \nstatus was monitored after intubation.  No respiratory distress, \nfever, or elevated WBC. Repeat EKG was reassuring.  Patient was \ngiven PO thiamine.  She complained of pleuritic chest pain and \ncough the morning after the ingestion, but her lungs were clear \non exam, she was sat-ing well on room on air, and she was not \ntachypneic.  CXR was WNL and showed no acute cardiopulmonary \nprocess.  \n.\n# Medical Clearance for Psychiatric Hospitalization - The \npatient was intubated and possibly aspirated, but we do not \nbelieve she currently has a PNA .  If she develops \nfever or SOB, she may need to be evaluated for PNA, but right \nnow she is medically cleared.  She is eating, drinking, and is \nable to tolerate normal physical activity.\n# Hypothroidism (?) - Chronic diagnosis.  Patient reports that \nshe's on Synthroid 50mcg at home, but husband and psychiatrist \nreport that she is not as per psychiatry.  She was given one \ndose of Synthroid 50mcg the morning after her ingestion, as we \ndid not know the patient was no longer on this medicaiton.  She \nthen developed tachycardia to 110.  We initially thought this \nwas related to volume depletion and/or anxiety, and she was \ngiven 1L LR.  TSH level was sent before she was given the \nSynthroid and is still pending.  When we realized she is no \nlonger on this medication, it was discontinued. \n.\n# Suicidality/Anxiety/Depression - Ingestion was suicide \nattempt.  Psychiatry was consulted and recommended inpatient \npsychiatric hospitalization.  The patient had a 1-to-1 sitter \nwhile in the MICU.  Her home Cymbalta, lorazepam, trazodone, \nAmbien, and prazosin (for nightmares) were continued.  Her home \ndextroamphetamine was held.\n# Transitional Issues\n- Pending TSH study.  Unclear significance, given critical \nillness and intubation.  Recommend rechecking in 6 weeks.\n\n【18】Medications on Admission:\nCymbalta 90 mg delayed\nlorazepam 1 mg tablet q6-8 hrs\ntrazodone 150 mg QHS\nAmbien CR 12.5 mg QHS\nprazosin 2mg QHS (for nightmares)\ndextroamphetamine -- unknown dose\nSynthroid 50 mcg tablet QD  \n\n【19】***Patient's record lists an allergy to trazodone.

The etiology of the \nmarked bladder wall thickening is unclear.  Considerations \ninclude neoplasm versus infection or inflammatory \nchange and or superimposed chronic outflow tract obstruction. \n2. Two echogenic lesions within the liver.  A lesion in segment \n4A a could \nrepresent a hemangioma, although a lesion in segment 5 is more \nill-defined and further evaluation with either CT or MRI would \nbe recommended for better characterization. \n3.

The \npatient was admitted to the ICU and seen by the renal consult \nservice. His hyponatrema was attributed to beer potomania, \nthiazide diuretic with possible contribution of chronic urinary \nobstruction. The patient was treated in the ICU with hypertonic \nsaline administration and free water restriction in addition to \na high protein diet. Sodium was followed closely and remained in \nthe 129-132 range. It is important that the patient continue a \nhigh protein diet and a 1.5L fluid restriction.

He has follow up scheduled with \nnephrology. \n\n【43】# Acute renal failure, likely chronic kidney disease:\nEtiology not entirely clear and baseline creatinine unknown. It \nwas thought that the renal failure was possibly related to \nobstructive process. Renal was consulted. Bilateral PCN \nplacement was discussed, but pt adamantly refused. Cr remained \nstable in the 2.0-2.2 range throughout hospitalization. The \npatient will need close urology follow up on discharge.\n\n【44】# Hematuria / Hydronephrosis / Bladder Wall Thickening:\nThe patient was seen by urology and underwent cystoscopy showing \ntrabeculated bladder concerning for chronic outlet obstruction. \nUrine cytology and bladder pathology negative for malignant \nprocess.

Pt w/troponin of 0.03 (baseline 0.02) \nand had no EKG changes, making ACS unlikely trigger. PNA was \nconsidered given CXR and slight leukocytosis, although much less \nlikely given lack of fever. Pt was given Zosyn in the ED, but \nadditional abx held. Pt was intubated for increased WOB shortly \nafter arrival into the CCU. She was aggressively diuresed and \nextubated on ___, post-extubation she had an episode of \nstridorous upper airway sounds; she was given nebs + racemic \nepi; stridor on exam, the symptoms appear positional, better \nwhen leaning forward. ENT performed a scope which was normal. \nShe was not striderous at the time. Satting well on 2L NC and \n40% FiO2 by face tent. No edema or vocal cord dysfunction. No \nfurther episodes of stridor occured. Her oxygen was titrated \ndown and she was able to ambulate without difficulty on room air \nat her time of discharge.\n\n【24】# Volume overload: Pt appeared to be volume overloaded on exam, \nalthough this was not particularly impressive. As above, it is \nlikely that she flashed, and the precipitant is likely to be \nHTN. Renal was consulted and followed patient throughout. \nOtherwise she was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix and \nmetolazone, and transitioned to PO lasix prior to discharge with \ngood urinary output and improvement in symptoms.  She was \ndischarged on a regimen of 120mg PO Lasix.\n\n【25】# Stage V CKD: Pt s/p fistula placement on ___, and per \nnephrology notes, this is now OK to use. Pt diuresed fairly well \nwith IV lasix, but may ultimately need HD soon. Strict I/Os were \nkept with Foley. Medications were renally dosed for CrCl < 15. \nHer inpatient and outpatient providers decided to initiate \nhemodialysis given her multiple episodes of pulmonary edema, and \nshe had five cycles of HD as an inpatient.  She was set up with \nan outpatient dialysis schedule prior to discharge.  Her home \nsodium bicarbonate, sevelamer, calcitriol, and ferrous sulfate \nwere discontinued after dialysis initiation. Hepatitis \nserologies and TB testing were initiated prior to HD, and she \nwas found to be Hep B negative (prior exposure, Core antibody \npositive, surface antibody positive, surface antigen negative) \nand C negative and had a negative PPD. \n\n【26】# Hypertension: In the MICU, pt was initiated on nitro drip for \nHTN. As above, it is possbile that HTN contributed to flash pulm \nedema.  Initially continued home hydral/amlodipine. Initially \nheld home imdur, but restarted prior to transfer out of ICU.  \nAfter transfer from ICU, patient was initiated on HD, and \namlodipine and hydralazine were discontinued given the \nimprovement in her blood pressures. She was discharged on \nCarvedilol and Imdur. It is imperative that she stagger these \nmedications throughout the day so that she does not become \ndizzy. Her outpatient blood pressure regimen was discussed with \nthe renal team and is as follows:\n\n【27】1. Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID (8 am and 8pm) on NON-DIALYSIS days.\n2. HOLD all BP medications prior to dialysis (11:30 ___. \nShe will take Carvedilol 12.5 mg at night. \nHer medications are staggered to prevent hypotension, which she \nexperienced in the hospital when her antihypertensives were \ngiven at the same time. \n\n【28】# CAD: Reassuring stress test in ___. Continued ASA and \ncoreg.\n\n【29】# IDDM:  Patient had poorly controlled DM2 on admission and was \ncontrolled on long acting insulin and a sliding scale that was \nfrequently titrated during her admission.  She will require \nclose follow up for monitoring and further titration of her \ninsulin regimen.\n\n【30】# Peripheral neuropathy: Continued gabapentin\n\n【31】# Chronic anemia: H/H at baseline, thought secondary to CKD. \n\n【32】# COPD: Patient received albuterol nebs PRN and Ipratropium MDI \nwhile intubated.\n\n【33】# Depression: Continued home citalopram and amitryptiline \n\n【34】#FEN: Maintained on carb control, heart healthy diet.

There is evidence of a residual disc fragment measuring \nroughly 7 mm, in \nthe left lateral recess at the mid-L3 level, the site of \nprevious \"wrapped\" \ndisc, with significant mass effect on the left anterolateral \naspect of the \nthecal sac and likely impingement upon the traversing left L4 \nand possibly, \nmore caudal nerve roots. There is no overall canal stenosis at \nthis level. \n2. L3-4: Persistent moderate bulging with left foraminal \ncomponent to the \npreexistent herniation and possible impingement upon the exiting \nleft L4 nerve \nroot at this site, as on the pre-operative study. \n2. Rim-enhancing fluid in the deep dorsal soft tissues overlying \nthe spinous \nprocesses, as well as in the left laminotomy bed, which likely \nrepresents \npost-operative seroma. \n\n【15】Brief Hospital Course:\n1. Acute Back Pain: Ms. ___ was admitted for back pain likely \nsecondary to L3-L4 disc herniation with impingement of her L3 \nnerve root leading to worsening radicular symptoms radiating \ndown left extremity to left knee. She was evaluated in the ED by \n___ who recommended L-Spine Xray and admission for pain \nmanagement.  No neurological compromise was demonstrated. She \nhad a chronic decreased rectal tone and perianal paresthesia \nsecondary to a history of Pudendal Nerve entraptment which was \nbeing treated with corticosteroid injections by her OBGYN; there \nwere no new neurological changes consistent with cauda equina. \nPlain knee films were obtained of the left knee given her pain \nhowever there was no evidence of inflammation or fracture.  Pain \nmanagement was initiated with IV dilaudid; she also had several \nhome medications, including percoset for her chronic pudendal \npain, which we discontinued but which made her relatively \nresistant to the effects of the dilaudid. Given her refractory \npain, neurosurgery decided to intervene: they performed a \ndiskectomy of L4 and foramenotomy; following the surgery she \nbecame mildly hypotensive and dizzy with relief with IV fluids.  \nFollowing the surgery, an oral pain medicine regimen was \nestablished that seemed to provide relief: oral steroids (a \nmedrol pack) to decrease inflammation, oxycontin 20 mg BID, PO \ndilaudid ___ mg PO q3 hours, naproxyn 500 BID, nortrpytiline 25 \nmg qhs, and gabapentin 300 mg TID.

We admitted you to make sure that you had no \nother concerning neurological symptoms from spine compression.  \nBased on the X-rays that we took and the evaluation the \nneurosurgeons performed, we did not detect any concerning \nneurological symptoms.  The X-rays also suggested that you did \nnot have any fractures.  We attempted to treat your severe pain \nwith IV medications, including Dilaudid and toradol, however, \nyour pain did not improve significantly.  We increased the doses \nof these medicines with some effect.  Given that your pain \ncontinued to be severe, neurosurgery decided to intervene.  They \nperformed a microdiskectomy, in which they removed the bulging \ndisk, relieveing the pressure on the compressed nerve.  This \nshould improve your pain considerably, both in your low back and \nthe pain radiating down your left leg.  When you return home, \nyou are likely to continue to experience pain; it will take time \nfor the pain to resolve.  We have sent you home with several \npain medications as well as steroids which will help decrease \ninflammation.  All medicine changes are listed below as follows:\n通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> You should stop taking all percosets that you take at home.  \n\n【23】通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Take gabapentin 300 mg three times a day.\n通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Take nortryptiline 25 mg at bedtime.\n通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> Take oxycontin 25 mg twice a day.\n通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Take naproxen 500 mg twice a day.\n通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> Continue to take your steroid pack as directed.\n通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u> If you continue to experience pain on this regimen, you can \ntake an oral dilaudid ___ mg; at maximum you can take this every \nthree hours, but you should limit its use.\nIf you experience any sleepiness or if you notice that you are \nhaving trouble with breathing, you should stop taking pain \nmedicines and call your primary care doctor for further \ndirection.  These medicines can sedate you and lower your \nrespiratory rate, so it is very important to take these \nmedicines as directed and carefully.  \n.\nYou can continue your other home medications but please \ndiscontinue percocet.\nWe encourage you to ambulate frequently; avoid bedrest as this \ncan make back pain worse.  Gentle, frequent walking is useful; \nover-exercise and under-exercise are both detrimental.  \n.\nIf you experience any new symptoms, chest pain, shortness of \nbreath, or any other concerning symptoms, please call your \nprimary care physician or return to the emergency department.  \nIt's important to remember that your pain is likely to be \npersistent for several days and it may increase at times and go \naway at others; don't panic: try to adhere to your medication \nregimen.  If your pain continues to be persistently severe, \nplease call your primary care physician.  \n\n【24】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Additional imaging through the lower legs at a \nslight delay was also provided.  Multiplanar reformations as \nwell as 3D MIP and curved reformats were provided. \n\n【17】FINDINGS: \n\n【18】CTA: Non-contrast imaging demonstrates extensive atherosclerotic \n\n【19】calcification along the abdominal aorta, iliac branches \nextending into the \narterial branches of the lower extremities. Following the \nadministration of IV contrast, there is brisk opacification of \nthe abdominal aorta with patency of the celiac artery, SMA, \nrenal arteries and ___. The aorta is somewhat tortuous, there is \nno aneurysmal dilation. There is progressive narrowing of the \nlumen of the infrarenal abdominal aorta and complete occlusion \njust beyond the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery. The \naorta remains completely occluded through the bifurcation with \nocclusion of the common iliac arteries bilaterally. There is \nreconstitution of the bilateral common iliac branches within the \npelvis. On the right, there is patency of the right external \niliac artery and distal branches into the right lower extremity. \nHowever, on the left, there is occlusion of the left proximal \nsuperficial femoral artery just distal to the takeoff of the \nprofunda branch. There is no distal reconstitution of the left \nsuperficial femoral artery or distal branches into the left \nlower extremity. \n\n【20】ABDOMEN: The liver enhances normally without definite sign of \nfocal lesion on \nthis arterial phase exam. The gallbladder, atrophic pancreas, \nand adrenal \nglands appear unremarkable. There is a small hypodensity in the \nspleen which is new from prior study most compatible with a \ncyst. The kidneys enhance symmetrically without focal worrisome \nlesion. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  \n\n【21】The stomach is decompressed. \n\n【22】PELVIS: Loops of small and large bowel demonstrate no signs of \nileus or \nobstruction. There is a lobulated solid mass in the left adnexa \nmeasuring \napproximately 10.4 (AP) x 6.4 (transverse) x 6.8 (craniocaudal \ndimension) cm . \nThis mass was seen on the prior exam though has decreased in \nsize in the \ninterval and is of unknown etiology though diagnostic \nconsiderations include an exophytic fibroid versus ovarian mass. \nThere are extensive calcifications within the myometrium of the \nuterus. There is no right adnexal mass. The urinary bladder \ncontains a small amount of gas which could be iatrogenic and \nclinical correlation is advised. There is no free pelvic fluid. \nNo pelvic side wall lymphadenopathy. \n\n【23】BONES: No worrisome lytic or blastic osseous lesion is seen. \nBones are \ndemineralized. Mild anterior wedging of T12 vertebral body is \nnoted. \n\n【24】IMPRESSION:  \n\n【25】1. Arterial occlusion in the left proximal small superficial \nfemoral artery without distal reconstitution. \n\n【26】2. Chronic-appearing occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta, \nwith reconstitution at the common iliac bifurcation bilaterally. \n\n【27】3. Left pelvic mass, solid-appearing increased in size from \nprior exam \nmeasuring up to 10.4 cm in maximal dimension, could represent an \nexophytic \nfibroid versus ovarian tumor. Please correlate clinically and \nwith non-emergent pelvic ultrasound to further characterize. \n\n【28】Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ vascular surgery at \nthe time of \ninitial review. \n\n【29】___. ___ \n___: WED ___ 3:19 ___ \n\n【30】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was admitted on  ___ and was emergently taken to the \noperating room for a left above the knee amputation. She \ntolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating \nroom.  Her immediate postoperative course was uneventful. Her \nelectrolytes were repleted and she was fluid resuscitated with \ncrystalloid appropriately.\n\n【31】On ___ she received lopressor and hydralazine for \nhypertension, levaquin for a previously diagnosed UTI, and was \nplaced on our AKA pathway. \n\n【32】On ___ her medications at ___ were resumed, but \nholding coumadin. She was given milk of magnesia for \nconstipation. Physical therapy attempted to work with her, but \nshe was very combative and her mental status remained not \noriented to person, place, or time. \n\n【33】On ___ she underwent a speech and swallow test which she \npassed for ground solids and thin liquids. However, on ___ \nshe had nausea and emesis. Her abdomen was very distended and \nshe had yet to make a bowel movement since admission. Physical \ntherapy and ___ diabetes department continued to follow and \nleave recommendations, which our team followed. A KUB was \nperformed which showed a very distended stomach. An NG tube was \nplaced and Ms. ___ was made NPO.  \n\n【34】On ___ it's location was check on KUB and it was pulled \nback.  Ms. ___ went on to self discontinue the NG tube  on \n___. While the NGT was in place, she was made NPO and \nstarted on a diltiazem drip and she could not take her usual \nantihypertensives as PO.  \n\n【35】On ___ speech and swallow reevaluated the patient for \nrecommendations.\nOn ___ palliative care came to see the patient and \nmethylnaltrexone was started on the patient.  This actually did \nhelp improve her distended stomach.  Her diet was advanced and \nher distention improved in the subsequent days.  \nAt this point, it was still too difficult to move the patient to \nthe chair, even with assistance secondary to dementia and lack \nof cooperation from the patient.\nThrough this time period since POD1, Ms. ___ left leg stump \nbecame slowly more ecchymotic and mottled. The vascular team \nfelt that the stump was becoming ischemic and made the family \naware of this.    \nAt the palliative care team meeting, the family was in \nunderstanding of the patient's debilitating left amputation site \nand did not want to pursue further surgery. They wanted to make \nher more comfortable.  \nSince then she has been tolerating a diabetic nectar thickened \ndiet and is on a  comfortable pain medication regimen which \nincludes a lidoderm patch, tylenol, and oxycontin.  \n\n【36】From an infectious perspective, Ms. ___ had  a urine culture on \n___ that grew out gram negative rods and one on ___ that \ngrew out e.col. She was originally on levaquin, which was \ntransitioned to include vancomycin and flagyl on ___, along \nwith her levofloxacin.  On ___ she was started on cefepime.  \nHer culture is sensitive to bactrim, for which she will finish a \n7 day course of in rehab.  \n\n【37】From ___ until discharge, the focus of her care has been on \nmaking her more comfortable and improving her nutritional \nstatus. Her left amputation stump on day f discharge did look \nechhymotic and mottled but it was decided that no further \nsurgical measures would be done. \n\n【38】Neuro wise she is at her baseline with dementia and episodes of \nsun downing.\n\n【39】Cardiovascular wise, her BP has improved, although still mild \nhypertension to 140s occasionally.\n\n【40】Respiratory wise she has NWOB with no distress at any point \nduring her hospital stay.\n\n【41】GI wise she is tolerating a soft ground and nectar thickened \ndiet. \n\n【42】GU wise her foley is still in place and she will need to \ncontinue bactrim for 7 days for her UTI\n\n【43】Activity wise she cam move to the chair with assistance and will \nneed to go to rehab.\n\n【44】Medications on Admission:\nasa 81',diltiazem 180', kclor 40', lasix 20', metop tart 25'', \nnamenda 10'', senna''', calcium carb'', docusate'', simvastatin \n20', lidoderm patch', tylenol, lantus 30u'', humalog ss, \ncoumadin 4', levaquin 500' (started ___\n\n【45】Discharge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Capsule PO BID (2 \ntimes a day).

Milder \ninterstitial edema is seen elsewhere, accompanied by small right \npleural effusion. Heart is top normal size, increased since \nprior examination. No pneumothorax. \n.\nCXR ___: Lung volumes are even lower today. Severe \nconsolidation in the left perihilar\nlung extending to the base is stable, more widely distributed \nconsolidation in\nthe right lung is more severe today. Findings could in large \npart be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but I suspect \nextensive pneumonia as well. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is \nstable.\nSmall-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No \npneumothorax.\n\n【15】LENIS ___: No DVT of the bilateral lower extremity.\nCXR ___: In comparison with the study of ___, there is \nmildly improved inspiration. The diffuse bilateral pulmonary \nopacifications are consistent with severe pulmonary edema. \nHowever, a more coalescent area of opacification with air \nbronchograms in the left perihilar region is suggestive of \nsuperimposed pneumonia.\nCXR ___: Compared to most recent prior, there has been \nimprovement in bilateral perihilar and upper lobe opacities. \nThere is persistent, but improved pulmonary edema with near \nresolution of bilateral pleural effusions. Please refer to \nconcomitantly performed chest CT for more detail. IMPRESSION: \nImproving multifocal consolidations and pulmonary edema.\nCT chest (___): The visualized portions of the thyroid \ngland are normal. Atherosclerotic vascular calcification is \nextensive throughout the visualized vascular tree. Calcification \nof the ascending aorta is dense. Similarly calcification of the \ncoronary arteries is global and extensive. Calcification of the \nmitral valve annulus may extend into the papillary muscle. \nCalcification at the left ventricular apex is thin and arc-like, \nlikely reflecting myocardial scarring. The interventricular \nseptum is well seen, suggesting anemia. The left brachocephalic \nvein is stenotic and calcified. Enlargement of the left atrium \nis moderate. The caliber of the pulmonary arteries is within \nnormal limits. Edema of the mediastinal fat is diffuse. No \naxillary or mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged. No pericardial \neffusions. Bilateral pleural effusions are symmetric and simple. \n\n【16】The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels. Diffuse \nbilateral ground-glass opacities are predominantly central with \nsubpleural sparing likely cardiogenic pulmonary edema. No \ncavitating lesions seen.  This study is not tailored for \nevaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures.  \nVisualized portions of the liver and spleen are unremarkable. \nCalcification of the renal arteries is extensive. Atrophy of the \nnative kidneys bilaterally is severe.  BONY STRUCTURES: No \ndestructive lytic or sclerotic bony lesions suspicious for \nmalignancy are seen. IMPRESSION: Given the sequence of \nradiographic findings from ___ to ___, despite \nthe initial appearance of lingular consolidation, the findings \nare most consistent with resolving cardiogenic pulmonary edema. \n.\nECHO (___): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. \nThere is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction \nwith inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Intrinsic systolic \nfunction likely worse given the severity of mitral \nregurgitation. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with \ndepressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no \npericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images \nreviewed) of ___, the function of the inferior and \ninferolateral walls appears moderately depressed on the current \nstudy. Function of these segments may have been borderline \ndepressed on the priror studies, although not reported as such. \nThe right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic on the \ncurrent study. Degree of mitral regurgitation is probably \nworsened by tethering of the chordae by the hypokinetic \ninferior/inferolateral walls. The right ventricle appears \ndilated and hypokinetic on the current study. Estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar.  \n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ year old female with history of coronary artery disease s/p \nNSTEMI ___ with DES to the PDA, DES to RCA x2 in ___ \ncomplicated by post-procedure MI and left femoral arterial \npseudoaneurysm, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, T1DM \ns/p kidney transplant x 2 and pancreas transplant, peripheral \nvascular disease, currently undergoing an evaluation for kidney \nretransplantation and possible mitral valve repair, transferred \nfrom OSH with chest pain, SOB, and cough.\n\n【18】ACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n【19】#. Chest pain: Differential included NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia \nin setting of HTN and worsening HF, vs. pericarditis or \nmyocarditis. Her presentation was initially felt to be most \nconsistent with a myopericarditis given recent URI symptoms and \nmild troponin leak. Unlikely NSTEMI given symptoms dissimilar to \nchest pain from previous MI. Demand ischemia possible in setting \nof worsening heart failure given orthopnea, increasing DOE, and \nelevated JVP on examination.  Serial ECG's demonstrated ST \ndepressions in inferolateral leads. Trop at OSH 0.16, with \nprevious flat trops last in ___. Cardiac enzyme was 0.08 X1 \non arrival, in the setting of renal failure. She was treated \nwith ASA 325mg, Atorvastatin 80mg (which she refused, and was \neventually transitioned back to her home ___). She was on \nheparin gtt overnight, which was discontinued the morning after \narrival given higher suspicion of perimyocarditis, pleuritic \nchest pain from possible pneumonia, hypertension vs. acute \ncoronary syndrome. ACE-inhibitor was held initially given acute \nkidney injury. She was initially placed on IV labetalol for \nimproved BP control, in addition to nitroglycerin gtt, and was \neventually transitioned back to her home Coreg, with addition of \nImdur for better blood pressure control. The ___ has a \nhistory of recent antihypertensive titrations, including trials \nof hydralazine, clonidine and amlodipine to which she developed \nside effects (such as headache, ___ edema, fatigue).  She had \nseveral additional episodes of chest pain after transfer from \nthe MICU to the floor, without EKG changes or rise in cardiac \nenzymes.  ___ will likely benefit from cardiac cath, though \nthis has been on hold given concern that additional dye load \nwill precipitate need for HD.  ___ will follow-up with \ncardiologist Dr. ___ discharge on ___.  She \nremained CP free for several days prior to discharge, and it was \nfelt that her chest pain may have been secondary to demand \nischemia in setting of ___ exacerbation.  \n#. ___: ___ dyspnea likely due in part to ___ \nexacerbation.  Chest imaging confirmed pulmonary edema, and TTE \n___ demonstrated LVEF of ___.  ___ was diuresed, with \nsubsequent improvement in dyspnea and decreased oxygen \nrequirement.  ___ was back to baseline weight of ~115 pounds \nprior to discharge.  She was discharged on lasix 40mg PO BID, \nand will continue on this regimen through her follow-up visit \nwith Dr. ___ on ___.\n# Mitral regurgitation: Per TTE from ___, pt had preserved EF \nwith moderate to severe MR, though may have been underestimated. \nPt now with likely decompensated worsening MR in setting of \nillness and possible demand vs. myocarditis as above. As above, \nACEI was initially held. Beta blocker was used in addition to \nNitroglycerin gtt for initial blood pressure control. ___ \nlater transitioned to oral anti-hypertensive regimen of \ncarvedilol 25mg BID and Imdur 30mg daily.  Repeat TTE ___ \ndemonstrated worsened MR.  ___ will follow-up with \ncardiologist Dr. ___ ___.  \n.\n# ? Pneumonia: Bilateral infiltrates seen on CXR at OSH. Repeat \nCXR here showed bilateral consolidation. Pt's exam notable for \nrales bilaterally and poor air exchange. She was initiated on \nbroad spectrum abx with Vanc, Cefepime and Azithromycin. Blood \ncultures did not show any growth, urine legionella was negative. \n___ refused both nasopharyngeal swab and aspirate on >3 \noccasions for rapid respiratory viral illness screens, although \nthe risks and benefits of this test was discussed. Ultimately \n___ Disease was consulted.  Cryptococcal antigen \nnegative, beta D glucan and galactomannan also negative. CT \nchest was more consistent with resolving cardiopulmonary edema \nthan overt infectious process.  Given decreased suspicion for \nPNA, antibiotics were discontinued.  ___ completed ___ days \nof azithro, as well as 5 days of vanc/cefepime.  Rapamune \npneumonitis was considered but in discussions with Renal \nTransplant and Infectious Disease, her infiltrative process on \nCXR and CT chest was not suggestive of this. Sputum cultures \nshowed did not show significant growth.  ___ remained \nafebrile, and without leukocytosis.  She was satting well on RA \nprior to discharge. \n.  \n# Acute on chronic kidney disease s/p kidney transplant: Cr \nbaseline unclear, was 3.4 on last discharge in ___ but had \nalso had some spikes into Cr3s during ___. Urine lytes \ndemonstrated FeUrea in the ___ twice, suggestive of an intrinsic \nprocess. The renal transplant team was consulted and felt she \ncontinues with chronic rejection of her renal graft. She may \nhave had a prerenal, poor forward flow --> ATN component and was \ngently diuresed. She was continued on her home regimen of \nTacrolimus, Sirolimus, Prednisone; with levels checked daily. \nShe was continued on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis until her WBC, \nRBC, platelets all declined with concern for myelosuppression.  \nBactrim was held, with subsequent improvement in cell counts.  \n___ Cr peaked at 5.1 on ___, and there was concern \n___ may need HD during this admission.   However, Cr trended \nback down to near baseline at 3.4 on day of discharge.  ___ \ndid not meet criteria for urgent dialysis during this admission, \nthough it is possible she will require HD in near future.  She \nhas difficult access, and will likely require tunneled HD line \nin R IJ when dialysis is initiated.  The ___ was instructed \nto follow-up with her nephrologist as soon as possible, and will \ncontinue to have outpatient monitoring.  \n.  \n# HTN: Presented with BP elevated to systolic 160s. She was \nplaced on a nitro gtt initially. On hospital day 1, IV labetalol \nwas used. Her BP improved, and she was transitioned to oral \nCoreg 25mg twice daily.  Imdur was added with subsequent \nimprovement in BP.  ___ was discharged on previous home \nregimen of carvedilol 80mg daily, with Imdur 30mg daily added to \nregimen.  She will follow-up with her cardiologist Dr. ___ on \n___.  \n# Diabetes mellitus type 1: ___ is status post pancreas and \nkidney transplant, and has not been on any therapy.  QID \nfingersticks were checked, and she was placed on an insulin \nsliding scale as needed.  \n# Hyperlipidemia:  On Crestor 10mg qhs at home. Started on \nAtorvastatin 80mg daily, given initial concern for acute \ncoronary syndrome, which the ___ declined. She was resumed \non her home Crestor.  \n# Anemia, normocytic: Chronic, most likely ___ CKD. Recent iron \nstudies one month PTA demonstrated normal iron levels, low \ntransferrin and low TIBC. Vitamin B12 and folate were high. HCT \ndecreased to 22.4 during this admission, and given ___ \nworsening fatigue and general malaise, she was transfused 2 \nunits pRBCs with subsequent appropriate rise in HCT.  HCT \nremained stable, and was at approximate baseline at time of \ndischarge.  ___ should continue to receive weekly Aranesp \ninjections; was converted to 3x/week epo while inpatient as \nAranesp non-formulary.\n# Pancytopenia: Likely in part due to immunosuppressant \nmedications +/- Bactrim, and cell counts improved after Bactrim \nwas held.  ___ tested for G6PD and was not deficient; could \nbe on dapsone in future if need for PCP ___. HIT antibody was \nnegative. \n.\nLABS/STUDIES PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:\n-CMV viral load\n-Hepatitis serologies\n-Blood cultures ___\n\n【20】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-___ was a full code during this admission.\n-___ will follow-up with cardiology regarding ___, \nworsening MR, HTN, CP, and CAD.

We were \nconcerned you may have a pneumonia, and started you on \nantibiotics.  A CT scan of your chest later showed that your \ntrouble breathing was most likely due to extra fluid in the \nlungs, caused by an exacerbation of your heart failure, and not \ndue to an infection.  You received lasix to help remove the \nfluid, and your symptoms improved.  We stopped your antibiotics. \n An echocardiogram of your heart showed that the heart is not \npumping as well as it previously was, and that your mitral \nregurgitation (leaky valve) has also worsened.  It is very \nimportant that you follow up with Dr. ___ as scheduled.\n\n【33】While you were here, you kidney function appeared to be \nworsening.  We monitored your BUN and creatinine closely, and \nthe levels were decreasing at the time of your discharge.  Your \ncreatinine was 3.4 on the day of discharge. It is still likely \nthat you may need dialysis soon, and you should follow-up with \nDr. ___ as soon as possible.\n\n【34】We noticed that your blood cell counts were low while you were \nhere, which may have been a side effect of the bactrim.  We \nstopped the bactrim, and your cell counts improved.  You were \nvery anemic, and we gave you 2 units of blood.  Your hematocrit \nimproved and remained stable after the transfusion.\n\n【35】We made the following changes to your medications:\n1. INCREASED aspirin to 325mg daily\n2. DECREASED ranitidine to 150mg daily\n3. STOPPED bactrim \n4. STOPPED Zemplar\n5. STARTED isosorbide mononitrate 30mg daily (for high blood \npressure)\n6.

This response most likely \nindicates pulmonary edema as the cause, but the differential dx \nfor shortness of breath includes cardiac ischemia/MI, PNA (esp \naspiration), PE, PTX, and COPD exacerbation ___ smoking hx). \nCXR did not reveal any infiltrates indicative of PNA and did \nhave vascular congestion + BNP >6000. Cardiac enzymes have been \nnegative and level x3.  Her shortness of breath improved with \ndiuresis on Lasix 20mg PO and she required minimal oxygen (0.5L) \nto maintain adequate saturation. A repeat CXR prior to discharge \ndid not show iterval change, though had poor inspiratory effort. \nThe pt uses O2 at home for exertion only though will be \ndischarged on O2 at rest as well to help maintain oxygenation.\n\n【15】.\n# Urinary tract infection: Previous urine culture done earlier \nin the week showed Proteus mirabilis, resistant to Cipro. She \nwas originally taking Cipro and was changed to cefuroxime.  She \nreceived 1 dose prior to admission. Repeat UA done in ED still \nconsistent with UTI. Patient started on ceftriaxone IV but \nswitched to cefuroxime PO to take for 10 more days after \ndischarge.  Urine culture done in the ED is negative. Per the \nson, pt had a history of large left kidney stone ___ years ago, a \nrenal ultrasound was ordered before the pt went home with a \nfollow-up scheduled with urology at ___ later this month.\n\n【16】.\n# Altered mental status: The patient was somnolent/confused and \nnot following commands. Her mental status waxed and waned.  Per \nher son, this is not her baseline.  Head CT was negative.  \nPotential etiologies include hypercarbia (though she is likely a \nchronic CO2 retainer) vs infection. Per Dr. ___, she is \nquite sensitive to infections and the treatment of her urinary \ntract infection is the best way to bring her back to her \nbaseline.  Upon discharge, the pt was more alert and oriented \nthough still had difficulty speaking, likely a combination of \nbaseline mental status and dysarthria or difficulty without \ndentures. \n.\n# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine bumped to 1.5, with a baseline \nof 1.0.  Given response to Lasix, this decreased kidney function \nwas likely due to poor forward flow/perfusion secondary to \ndiastolic CHF exacerbation. Before discharge, Cr improved to 1.2 \nand then to 1.0.\n# Hypernatremia: 140 -> 147 -> 143 -> 140.  This was likely due \nto decreased PO intake at home and improved with an increased \nappetite in the hospital.\n# Atrial Fibrillation: On warfarin and metoprolol tartrate. INR \nwas stable throughout hospitalization after warfarin was \ndown-titrated to 2mg from a home dose of 4mg. Pt's INR prior to \ndischarge was 1.7 so her dose was increased back to home dose of \n4mg daily.

Patient found to have \nsubacute hypodensity on CT head, concerning for stroke. An MRI \nhead was obtained and showed multiple, bilateral, embolic \nstrokes that were acute to subacute in nature. Patient was \nstarted on rosuvastatin 40mg daily but was unable to be \ninitiated on aspirin therapy given her history of HHT/bleeding \nrisk. Patient's outpatient hematologist was involved in this \ndiscussion and confirmed that her bleeding risk, chronic RBC \ntransfusion dependence, and chronic iron infusion dependence \nmade her a poor candidate for indefinite anticoagulation or \nantiplatelet agents of any kind (including long duration baby \naspirin). Neurology was consulted on ___ for assistance with \nfurther stroke work-up. Patient was monitored on telemetry for \nevidence of atrial fibrillation and was found to have no acute \narrhythmia. Implantation of a loop recorder was discussed, but \nthe decision was made to defer this; if atrial fibrillation were \nto be identified, the patient is not a candidate for \nanticoagulation, however one could consider surgical vs. \npercutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion.  However, afib was \nfelt less likely to be the culprit of her ongoing strokes.  \nCarotid ultrasound showed less than 40% internal carotid \ndisease, bilaterally. A CTA head/neck was obtained and was \nnegative for significant carotid artery or circle of ___ \nvessel disease. Further work-up for lower extremity deep vein \nthrombosis with LENIS and CTV pelvis (to evaluate her IVC \nfilter) were both negative. Patient underwent TTE with bubble \nstudy and was found to have a large patent foramen ovale with \nsevere right ventricular dysfunction. A follow-up TEE with \nbubble study showed that there was a continuous right to left \nshunt through the PFO.  TEE read shows no definitive evidence of \nearly bubbles entering the left atrium from the pulmonary veins \n(however on repeat read with various imaging cardiologists, this \ncannot be definitiely ruled out).  It is possible that she is \nhaving paradoxical emboli via pulmonary AV malformations, \nhowever the degree of shunting via PFO vs. pulmonary AVMs is \nunknown a this time. Cardiac surgery was consulted to discuss \nsurgical PFO closure.  There was concern as to whether she would \nbe an optimal surgical candidate.  Pt. was eager to be \ndischarged from the hospital to take care of various personal \nmatters.  Interdisciplinary discussions occurred with \nhematology, cardiology, structural cardiology, cardiac surgery, \nneurology, and pulmonary hypertension.  Pt. will be seen as an \noutpatient and likely re-admitted within a week to have ongoing \ndiuresis, assessment of her pulmonary hypertension, \nconsideration of pulmonary vasodilator therapy pending degree of \npre vs. post capillary pulmonary hypertension, and then \nconsideration of percutaneous PFO closure at that time.  The \npatient's hematologist, was included in these discussions and \nrecommended that anti-platelet therapy with aspirin for ___ \nmonths would be acceptable based on pt's ongoing risk of stroke.\n\n【48】# Acute on chronic HFpEF \nPatient presents with elevated pro-BNP, weight gain, CXR with \npulmonary vascular congestion, and evidence of volume overload \non exam, consistent with CHF exacerbation. Unclear trigger, \npossibly in the setting of dietary indiscretion vs. medication \nnon-compliance vs. infection secondary to UTI . Other \npossibilities include ischemia, though unlikely given absence of \nangina type symptoms and ST changes on ECG. Received IV diuresis \nthen was transitioned to PO torsmide 80mg daily. She initially \nreceived her home lisinopril for afterload reduction, but this \nmedication was discontinued in the setting of hyperkalemia. She \nwas started on amlodipine 5mg daily after discontinuation of \nlisinopril. Upon discharge, pt did have evidence ___ edema and \nis unlikely to be at her dry weight .\n\n【49】# Abdominal pain \nPatient presented with ___ LLQ pain that was worse with eating \ncertain foods. She had a CT A&P that was negative for ischemic \ncolitis or other acute pathologies, and a lactate was within \nnormal limits. Her abdominal exam was benign. Patient was \ntreated with Tylenol and oxycodone as needed for her pain. She \nrefused her home gabapentin. \n\n【50】# Acute kidney injury\nCreatinine elevated to 1.7 on presentation, from baseline 1.0. \nThought to be cardiorenal in the setting of volume overload, and \ninitially improved with diuresis back to 1.0. Patient's \ncreatinine fluctuated between 1.0-1.3 throughout admission. \nCreatinine on day of discharge was 1.2.\n\n【51】# Urinary tract infection\nPatient presented with several days of dysuria and was found to \nhave dirty UA. She was started on vancomycin and cefepime in the \nED on ___ and narrowed to ceftriaxone on ___ for treatment \nof a UTI. Her urine cultures ultimately were positive for \nproteus mirabilis. \n\n【52】# Troponemia\nElevated trop 0.___hanges on ECG. Unlikely to be \nischemia. Most likely secondary to decreased renal clearance in \nthe setting of acute kidney injury. \n\n【53】# Elevated D-dimer\nPatient found to have slightly elevated D-dimer in ED, which was \ninitially obtained to rule-out PE in the setting of patient's \nacute kidney injury. She had no symptoms or vital sign \nabnormalities suggestive of acute PE, so a V/Q scan and CTPA \nwere not obtained. Additionally, she has several medical \ncomorbidities that could explain her mildly elevated D-dimer. \n\n【54】# Possible alcohol use disorder\nReportedly, family called patient during her time in the MICU \nand expressed concen about alcohol use. Per patient, she does \nnot drink alcohol at all, and serum/urine toxin screen was \nnegative for EtOH on admission. She had no signs of withdrawal \nduring her admission. \n\n【55】# Encephalopathy \nNoted to have altered mental status in ED that resolved upon \ntransfer to the floor. Neurologic work up is noted above given \nabnormal CT head. Possible etiologies include reduced clearance \nof gabapentin in the setting of acute kidney injuy vs. infection \nin setting of known urinary tract infection. \n\n【56】CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: \n=======================\n# IDDM\nBG well controlled on admission, no ketones in urine. Continued \nhome glargine with ISS and held home linagliptim and \nempagliflozin during admission. \n\n【57】# COPD\nUses home BiPAP ___, 2L via face mask during the day PRN \ndyspnea. Treated with duonebs as needed during admission. \n\n【58】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n[] New medications: Rosuvastatin 40mg PO daily, amlodipine 5mg \nPO daily (in place of lisinopril) \n[] Changed medications: Torsemide 20mg daily changed to 80mg PO \ndaily \n[] Stopped medications: Lisinopril 10mg PO daily (stopped due to \nintermittent hyperkalemia), Simvastatin 40mg PO daily (replaced \nwith rosuvastatin), Colchicine 0.6mg daily (unclear indication, \nper OMR, was ordered for neuropathic pain)\n\n【59】[] Discharge weight: 190.19 lbs\n[] Discharge Cr: 1.2 \n\n【60】[] Risk of Afib: Pt. will require serial monitoring for afib as \nthis also may be a source of cryptogenic stroke.  If pt. \nundergoes PFO closure, this has been associated with an \nincreased risk of afib.  As such, recommend ILR as an \noutpatient.\n[] PFO Plan:  Ensure follow up with cardiac surgery / structural \ncardiology to discuss PFO closure.  If plan will be surgical PFO \nclosure, perhaps would consider surgical ___ ligation at that \ntime.  \n[] If decided by OP providers, consider planned admission for \nfurther IV diuresis and RHC to determine if pulmonary \nhypertension is pre- or post-capillary and whether patient would \nbenefit from pulmonary vasodialators. Additionally, will be \nimportant to assess RV function and determine QP/QS ratio. This \ndata will help determine whether or not PFO closure will be safe \nand beneficial.\n[] Check CBC and ferritin on ___ and consider transfusion for \nHgb < 7, to be managed by OP hematologist \n[] Check chem 10 at follow-up with PCP to ensure electrolytes \nare within normal limits (increased torsemide to 80mg during \nthis admission) \n[] Pulmonary Nodule:  Found to have 6-mm left apical lung \nnodule. RECOMMENDATION(S): For incidentally detected single \nsolid pulmonary nodule measuring 6 to 8 mm, a CT follow-up in 6 \nto 12 months is recommended in a low-risk patient, optionally \nfollowed by a CT in ___ months. In a high-risk patient, a CT \nfollow-up in 6 to 12 months, and a CT in ___ months is \nrecommended. \n[] IVC filter may be a source of emboli, but was placed in ___ \nand has likely endothelialized.  No associated thrombus seen on \nCTV this admission.  Unclear if it is possible to remove device. \n However, given pt's hx. of DVT/PE and inability to tolerate \nanticoagulation, it may make sense to leave in place\n[] Patient found to have multiple bilateral embolic strokes on \nMRI head. She was initiated on therapy with a high-intensity \nstatin, but given her risk of bleeding, antiplatelet / \nanticoagulant agents were not initiated\n\n【61】#CONTACT: ___ (___)\n Phone: ___ \n#CODE: DNI/DNR \n\n【62】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

A chest xray did \nnot indicate any acute intrathoracic process. Azithromycin was \nstopped. Respiratory status and oxygen saturation remained \nstable.\n# RUE Erythema: Following pneumovax injection RUE became \nerythematous and mildly swollen. A RUE ultrasound did not show a \nblood clot. We intially thought this could be a cellulitis and \npt received 2 doses of dicloxacillin. After starting this \nmedication the erythema resolved which was more suggestive of a \nbruising phenomena so antibiotics stopped. \n.\n# Constipation: Pt required manual disimpaction prior to \ndischarge. She had large bowel movement and reported feeling \nmuch better. Likely she became constipated from oxycodone. She \nshould continue daily senna,colace and miralax as needed for \nconstipation.\n\n【27】Medications on Admission:\nTramadol, prinivil, Azithromycin,\nNorvasc, Aspirin\n\n【28】Discharge Medications:\n1.

You were admitted for headache, \nconfusion, and arm pain after your recent fall. Imaging studies \nshowed that you had a fracture of your left collar bone and a \nbleed around the membranes that line the brain. The orthopedic \nsurgeons saw you and determined the collar bone would heal on \nits own and simply recommended you wear a sling on your left arm \nfor comfort. The neurosurgeons followed you while you were in \nthe hospital and determined the bleeding in your head had \nstopped and did not require a surgical procedure. You continued \nto have headaches and occasional dizziness and nausea that was \nfelt to be related to the bleed near the membranes lining your \nbrain. These symptoms were treated with pain medications which \nyou will likely need to continue taking for a few weeks until \nyour symptoms resolve. Your blood pressure was occasionally \nelevated while you were in the hospital. This was felt to be \nrelated to the pain you were experiencing and your blood \npressure responded to treatment with pain medications. We also \nincreased the dosage of your amlodipine and lisinopril. Your \nblood pressure appeared to mildly improve on this regimen but \nmay remain elevated for a few weeks due to the effect of the \nbleed in your head. The sodium levels in your blood were found \nto be low during your hospitalization. This also was related to \nthe effects of the bleed in your head.

Multilevel degenerative changes are \nnoted in the thoracic spine.\nIMPRESSION:\nMild pulmonary vascular engorgement.\nCT HEAD (___)\nFINDINGS:\nThis study was performed in 2 acquisitions due to patient \nmotion.  Within this limitation, there is no CT evidence for \nacute intracranial hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, \nor hydrocephalus.  Prominence of the cisterna magnais likely \nsecondary to an arachnoid cyst ___ cisterna magna.  The \nbasal cisterns appear patent.  Mild ventricular prominence \nsuggests mild atrophy. \nPeriventricular white matter hypodensity is likely secondary to \nsequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  No acute \nbony abnormality is detected. The visualized portions of the \nparanasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.\n IMPRESSION:\nSlightly limited study due to patient motion without CT evidence \nfor acute\nintracranial process.  \n.\nCT CSPINE (___)\nFINDINGS:\nStudy is slightly motion degraded.  There is no CT evidence for \nacute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.  There is no \nprevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Mild multilevel degenerative \nchanges are seen with disc space narrowing and anterior bridging \nosteophytes. No critical central canal stenosis is present. The \nproximal esophagus is patulous.  \nIMPRESSION:\nNo CT evidence for acute cervical spine fracture.\nMR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST (___)\nFINDINGS:\nThe exam is severely limited secondary to motion artifact.  \nWithin the\nconfines of this limitation:\nMRI HEAD:  There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to \nsuggest acute\ninfarct.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, midline shift, \nmass effect,\nhydrocephalus or extra-axial fluid collections.  The ventricles \nand sulci are age appropriate.  Note is made of a cavum septum \npellucidum.  There are patchy and round scattered T2/FLAIR \nhyperintensities throughout the periventricular and deep white \nmatter, most likely sequela of chronic microvascular ischemic \ndisease. Prominent cisterna magna versus arachnoid cyst in the \nposterior fossa is also noted. Visualized paranasal sinuses and \nmastoid air cells are clear. The orbits and soft tissues are \ngrossly unremarkable.\nMRA HEAD:  Vessel detail is markedly limited in the setting of \nsevere motion artifact, but there is possibly mild narrowing of \nthe bilateral middle cerebral arteries with atherosclerotic \ndisease. The anterior and posterior circulation vasculature is \nvisualized, without definite large aneurysm or significant \nstenosis.  The internal carotid, anterior cerebral, middle \ncerebral, posterior cerebral and basilar arteries are grossly \nnormal. Anterior communicating artery cannot be discerned.  \nThere are prominent posterior communicating arteries, with \nlikely fetal PCA configuration of the right posterior \ncommunicating artery. \n IMPRESSION:\n1. Markedly limited study secondary to significant motion \nartifact, but\npossibly demonstrating mild narrowing of the bilateral middle \ncerebral\narteries and their distal branches with atherosclerotic disease.\n2.

Left peroneal veins not seen.  \n.\nFEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT (___)\nFINDINGS:\nNo acute fracture is seen in the left femur.  No significant \nperiosteal\nreaction or erosive change is seen to suggest osteomyelitis.  \nModerate\ndegenerative change is present at the left hip with spurring and \njoint space loss.  Additionally, within the left knee, there is \ntricompartmental spurring with mild joint space loss.  A joint \neffusion is also present.\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of osteomyelitis.  Joint effusion \nwithin the knee and degenerative change as detailed above.\nANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT; FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT (___)\nFINDINGS:\nLEFT ANKLE:  Marked soft tissue swelling is present about the \nankle. \nIntra-articular fracture line through the medial malleolus is \nagain\ndemonstrated.  Minimal bridging callus is seen.  Healing \ndeformity of the\ndistal fibula is seen.  Overall, the ankle mortise is congruent. \n No new\nfractures are seen.  Talar dome is intact.\nLEFT FOOT:  No acute fracture or subluxation is seen.  Mild \nosteopenia is\npresent along the phalanges.

Left ventricular wall \nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \nnormal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion \nabnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular \nsystolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging \nsuggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure \n(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is \nnormal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline \nnormal free wall function. There is abnormal septal \nmotion/position. The aortic valve leaflets 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic \nstenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nno mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure \ncould not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No definite vegetations \nseen.\n\n【21】Brief Hospital Course:\nPRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: ___ with MR, schizoaffective \ndisorder presenting with AMS, red/hot/tender leg, fever/chills \nand tachycardia.\n\n【22】ACTIVE ISSUES:\n#) Group C Strep Septicemia: Pt presented with fevers, rigors, \ntachycardia and found to be growing Group C Strep in blood \ncultures. Initially started on IV vanco and transitioned to \nceftriaxone after specification. Given history of recurrent \ncellulitis  and the bacteremia, ID was consulted.

Ultrasound also was negative \nfor fluid collection or signs of abscess. Inspection of foot and \nleg revealed significant evidence of fungal infection in the web \nspacing of her toes and it is possible that the skin breakdown \nmay have made her more susceptible to infection. Pt and \ncaretakers were educated about the importance of cleaning these \nareas carefully. By time of discharge, her foot looked markedly \nimproved with decreased erythema and less tenderness\n.\n#) Facial droop: Pt was noted to facial asymmetry with concern \nfor left sided weakness.

He was able to identify \nsocial isolation as a trigger for suicidal thoughts and was able \nto outline for the team a robust activities schedules for \npost-discharge . He also was future orientated upon \ndischarge with plans to record an album and then sell/distribute \nat least 25 copies and his main concern on the unit before \ndischarge was ensuring his taxi/transportation schedule was in \nplace for the upcoming week. He noted he has a history of help \nseeking behavior and if he ever feels unsafe or in danger of \nself harm he will immediately again seek help or call ___.\n\n【18】#Schizoaffective Disorder: The patient was admitted with \nsuicidal ideations and depressive symtpoms as noted in the \nhistory of present illness.  We continued all of the patient's \nhome medications and made no changes to such: Aripiprazole 25mg \ndaily, Buproprion 150mg BID, Clozaril 12.5 mg qhs, Gabapentin \n300mg qhs, and Lamictal 25mg QOD. On the second day on the unit \nthe patient noted he \"felt better: and \"could talk now.\" He \nexplained that he benefited from the numerous groups and many \npatient's and staff on the unit and felt that because he was \n\"active\" he was \"better.\" The patient was able to elaborate and \nexplain that he recognizes that social isolation is a trigger \nfor suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms for him. The \npatient was able to outline a robust activities schedules upon \ndischarge with plans to records an album, attend his regular day \ngroup, attend open microphone nights, and partake in social \nactivities at ___. The patient noted that while he has \nchronic, or as he terms it \"always\", some auditory \nhallucinations even at baseline, while on the unit his auditory \nhallucinations became \"less\" and the patient also noted that \nsuch made him feel \"better.\" On discharge he reported a \"good\" \nmood, good energy, good sleep, good appetite, and less guilt \nover his recent accessing explicit material (although he noted \nhe still regrets such and plans to never access such again and \nfollow up with his therapist about) and did not appear \ndepressed.  \n\n【19】----Medical\n\n【20】# ___ Disease and Autonomic Instability\n-Pt reports at baseline\n-Continued home med fludrocortisone 0.1mg\n-Continued home med compazine prn nausea\n-Continued home med midodrine 2.5 mg daily\n\n【21】# Tremor\n-Continued home med primidone 50mg qAm and 100mg qhs\n\n【22】#COPD\n-Continued home med albuterol \n-Continued home med advair disk\n\n【23】#OSA\n-BiPAP on unit\n\n【24】#Hypothyroidism\n-Continued home med levothyroxine 50mg daily\n\n【25】----Psychosocial\n#Groups/Milieu\nThe patient was noted to attend many groups and always be an \nactive participant.  Group leaders commented on his insightful \ncomments and pleasant demeanor. The patient was interactive with \npeers, active on the unit, and had no safety problems on the \nunit.\n\n【26】#Family Meeting / Discussions: Family (sister) lives in ___ \nand was unable to be present for a family meeting although she \nwas contacted via telephone (please see below)\n\n【27】#Collateral\n\n【28】-___ Admission Coordinator: They noted they would be \n\"pleased\" to have the patient return and noted they feel \ncomfortable and safe with him leaving the hospital.\n\n【29】- Therapist, ___, ___: who asked how pt was \ndoing and requested help in finding him more services vis-a-vis \nhis sexual attraction to boys. She notes she feels assured that \nhe has not acted on these feelings, aside from his visits to the \nwebsite which contained stories featuring boys. She noted that \nhe has denied being in any kind of inappropriate contact with \nchildren. She asked whether the Abilify, which she heard could \nbe activating, might be fueling some of these\ninterests. She said she would see him probably on ___ or \n___.\n\n【30】- Younger sister, ___, ___: She \nexplained\nshe is in contact with her brother a few times a month and \noversees a small special needs trust that their father set aside \nfor pt. She notes ___ hospitalization at age ___ for ___ yrs at \n___,\nfollowing attempt to kill himself by putting head in the oven. \nShe has never been sure if brother is actually mentally ill or \nif this is more of a personality d/o or attention-seeking. She \ndescribes their mother as extremely angry, \"hateful\", and \nverbally abusive toward them both, but particularly toward pt. \nShe describes father as unwilling/unable to protect them from \nmother's rage, as she would then turn it on him. She states she \nwas asked by mother to come home after college to care for pt; \nshe declined and was cut off from family for ___ yrs; states pt \nwas told by mother that sister left the family because\nof him. Sister reconnected with family after having her dtr and \nhas tried to help her brother ever since; notes that her brother \nis very \"narcissistic\" and seems upset/jealous when something \ngood\nhappens to someone he knows.\n\n【31】----Legal Status: Patient was admitted on a CV which was \naccepted.\n\n【32】----Risk Assessment\nThis patient has a low to moderate risk of imminent danger to \nhimself or others. The patient has numerous protective factors \nincluding a longstanding history of help seeking behaviors, a \nsupportive living environment, a busy social calendar, close \nmental health followup, no active or recent substance abuse, no \naccess to weapons or guns. Still he does have numerous risk \nfactors including his age, race, gender, and marital status as \nwell as his distant history of a suicide attempt as a teen, as \nwell as the burden or both chronic mental and medical illness. \nWhile in the hospital we addressed his modifiable risk factors, \nnamely his decompensated schizoaffective disorder. We worked \nwith the patient to identify social isolation as primary trigger \nfor his suicidal ideations and on the unit engaged him both in \npersonalized as well as group therapy regarding such. We also \nensured he had a busy social calendar with many planned social \ninteractions upon discharge. Still given the static nature of \nmany of the patient's risk factors such as his demographics, \npast suicide attempt, and chronic medical and mental illness, \nupon discharge the patient does remain at an elevated risk of \nself harm or suicide but no longer presents an imminent danger \nto himself requiring inpatient level of care. \n\n【33】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Per records and nursing facility report, the patient c/o \nof back pain. He lives in an apartment in a dementia wing at a \nnursing facility. He has had back pain ___ days. Today he had an \nunwitnessed fall at 1PM. His vitals at that time were 190/110 \nand HR 64. In a half hour his BP had dropped to 125/62 HR 72. \nUnclear if there was a head injury. EMS was called. Plain films \nof his pelvis taken at the ___ were negative for acute fracture. \nGiven recent low back pain and new fall, the patient was \ntransported via EMS to the ED for further evaluation of his \nfall.  \n.  \nOn discussion w/ daughter on arrival to floor and review of \nprior notes, the patients recent medical history has been \ncomplicated by a hospitalization in ___ after a fall w/ \ncomplaints of back pain. A chest xray at that time revealed \nevidence of a lung nodule. The family was already aware of this \nnodule and further imaging was not pursued in the inpatient \nsetting. The patient was ultimately discharged back to his \nnursing facility. Since that admission the patient was \nhospitalized at an OSH last year w/ a pneumonia which was \ntreated w/ levaquin. He deveoped anorexia and significant \nweightloss and was transitioned to hospice and all cardiac \nmedications were discontinued including hctz, lisinopril, \nmetoprolol. His clinical course turned and his status improved \nsuch that he was taken off hospice. His cardiac regimen was not \nrestarted given not in line w/ goals of care being comfort \nfocused. Lastly, it appears an ESR was checked recently and was \nfound to be elevated so he was started on prednisone every other \nday.  \n.  \nIn the ED, initial VS: 97.7 59 178/83 20 98%. Labs were \nsignificant for an unremarkable CBC and chem7. A CT head \ndemonstrated no acute processes. A CT abdmen and pelvis \ndemonstrated a lytic focus in the T11 vertebral body concerning \nfor a focus of metastasis or multiple myeloma and without \nevidence of fracture. A CT c-spine noted pleural thickening at \nthe left apex concerning for a malignancy although further \nimaging would be recommended for further characterization. Given \nthe suggestion of metastatic disease, admission to medicine was \nrequested for further evaluation and w/u. Vitals on transfer \nwere: 76, 18, 161/100, 96%RA  \n.  \nOn arrival to the floor inital vitals were 97.8 86 18 97RA \n172/72. The patient appeared comfortable. Was oriented to \nhimself and had not recollection for the reason of his \nadmission.  \n.  \n.  \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Pan negative ROS including cough, fevers, \nchills, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, abdominal \npain, diarrhea or constipation, dysuria, myalgia. \n\n【9】Past Medical History:\nDementia - likely Alzheimer's  \nFrequent falls  \nAS s/p AVR in ___  \nBladder Cancer  \nBPH  \nDepression  \nAnemia  \nCKD (1.5 on d/c from ___ in ___  \nPulmonary nodule - solitary  \nHTN  \nHL  \n\n【10】Social History:\n___\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory\n\n【11】Physical Exam:\nVS - 97.7 59 178/83 20 98%  \nGENERAL - Alert, pleasant, well-appearing in NAD  \nHEENT - EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear  \nCARDIAC: irregular rate, mechanical S2. ___ systolic loudest at \nRUSB  \nLUNGS: Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use.

Suspicious lytic lesion in the left portion of the T11 \nvertebral body with no evidence of fracture at this time. \nDifferential considerations including metastatic disease or \nmultiple myeloma although may represent metastatic lung cancer \nnoting a suspicious irregular opacity in the left upper lobe. \nSince the chest is only partly visualized, chest CT is suggested \nor alternatively PET-CT.  \n\n【16】2. An 8 x 7 mm hyperdense focus is visualized in the right \nkidney and too small to characterize. Further characterization \nwith ultrasound or alternatively MR is recommended. \n\n【17】3. Multiple subcentimeter hyperdensities are visualized in the \nbladder consistent with history of bladder polyps. Correlation \nwith prior imaging or direct visualization is recommended. \nMalignancy cannot be excluded by this study.  \n\n【18】4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. There is \nmild extrahepatic and central intrahepatic biliary ductal \nprominence although probably not out of proportion to age. \nCorrelation with liver function testing and other clinical \nfactors could be considered. \n\n【19】5.

Again noted are nodular densities and nodular areas of \npleural thickening at the left lung apex which are incompletely \nevaluated but concerning for malignancy. A dedicated chest \ndiagnostic chest CT or PET CT is recommended to evaluate the \nfinding more fully. \n\n【25】CT head:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.\n\n【26】Femur x-ray:\nScattered small lucencies in both femurs, which could \npotentially represent metastatic foci in this patient with a \nhistory of lung mass and T11 lesion \n\n【27】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ yo man with history of aortic stenosis s/p AVR in ___, HTN, \ndementia, and atrial fibrillation/flutter not on \nanticoagulation, s/p unwitnessed fall and chronic worsening back \npain due to T11 lytic lesion in setting of lung nodule.  \n# T-11 LESION/LUNG NODULE: Lytic focus in the left T11 vertebral \nbody is suggestive of a focus of metastasis.  Differential for \nlytic lesions specifically more likely include breast, thyroid, \nrenal, myeloma or GI malignancy.  Evidence of a lung .nodule on \nCT cspine in addition to prior studies. \nGoals of care were discussed with daughter on ___, who is HCP \nand confirmed that patient's son (oncologist in ___) agreed with \nplan: Focus should be on comfort care and interventions should \nbe done with the purpose of providing information which would be \nuseful in treating the patient's symptoms.  At this point, she \ndoes not think a work-up of the etiology of the lesions would be \nuseful information to have.  She described that in the past \npatient has not tolerated procedures such as cystoscopy and that \nhe would not want such interventions done as his quality of life \ncurrently is sometimes below what may be considered acceptable \nto him.  Thus, no diagnostic tests were performed.\nFamily meeting the following day helped clarify goals of care- \nfocus will be on symptom control and maximizing functional \nstatus.  Patient has been able to ambulate with walker at \nassisted living.  Symptoms and exam improved, likely due to \nprednisone.  He also received standing acetaminophen and \nlidocaine patch.  He was discharged with this regimen, which \nincluded a short prednisone taper to maximize anti-inflammatory \neffects while limiting side effects. \n.\nPlease note, the Palliative Care Consult Service was involved in \nboth the family meeting re: Goals of care, as well as the plan \nfor symptom / pain control with Prednisone.  \n.  \n# FALL: History of frequent falls in the past. CT head w/out \nsignificant findings. Unwitnessed. Possibly due to delerium in \nsetting of dementia. No evidence of trauma on exam or imaging, \nand pt appears at baseline.  \n# ELEVATED ESR/PREDNISONE: Discussed with PCP- started for \npossible PMR vs. temporal arteritis.  Prednisone was given as \nnoted above.  \n# CONSTIPATION: Evidence of significant stool in colon w/ mild \ndistention but no evidence of obstruction.  Continued bowel \nregimen of colace / senna / miralax- added dulcolax.  \n# HYPERTENSION: Permissive hypertension, and BP normalized at \ndischarge.  \n.  \n# AORTIC STENSOSIS: Currently euvolemic. \n.  \n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: No anticoagulation given frequent falls. \nMetoprolol was discontinued in setting of transition to comfort \nfocused care.  \n.  \n# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: Cr 1.2 which is better than baseline.  \n\n【28】.  \n# DEMENTIA: Lives in dementia wing at ___.

US spleen showed no focal \nlesions or evidence of infarction. Transthoracic echo was \nnegative for vegetations, and patient had no cardiac murmurs on \nexam. Blood culture was found to be positive for Staph \nepidermitis, and patient was started on nafcillin following \nspeciation. Given high grade bacteremia and the prolonged \nsymptoms of fatigue he had prior to admission, even with a \nnegative TTE, the concern for endocarditis remained high. \nHowever, trans-esophageal echo was considered too risky given \npatient's ongoing requirement of oxygen and thrombocytopenia. \nWith consultation from infectious disease, decision was made to \nempirically treat patient for endocarditis. Patient remained \nafebrile and subsequent blood cultures were negative. Patient is \nto continue nafcillin 2 g IV Q4H for a total of 4 weeks (last \nday ___.\n\n【34】# Essential Thrombocytopenia/Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient's \npresentation of subacute fevers, nightsweats, 50lb weight loss \nand WBC of 20.8 on admission was concerning for transformation \nto acute leukemia. Patient was found to have 9% blasts on \nperipheral flow cytometry. Bone marrow biopsy found <5% of \nblasts; results consistent with myelofibrosis post-JAK2 V617F \npositive essential thrombocythemia. Anemia and thrombocytopenia \nmost likely secondary to myelofibrosis as pt had no evidence of \nbleeding or hemolysis. Massively enlarged spleen (30.9 cm on CT) \nmost likely resulted from extra-medullary hematopoesis. Jackafi \n5 mg PO BID was started and patient responded well to treatment. \nPatient received a total of 7 units pRBC during this \nhospitalization. At discharge patient's hemoglobin is 8.7 (s/p \n2U pRBC on ___. \n\n【35】# Acute on Chronic Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: Patient was \nhypoxic, tachypnic, and required 4L oxygen at admission. CTA of \nchest was negative for PE. Patient had no symptoms or imaging \nconsistent with pulmonary infectious process. PPD was negative. \nEtiology multifactorial and includes volume overload and \nrestrictive etiology due to compression from massively enlarged \nspleen. Patient's respiratory status improved with diuresis and \ninitiation of Jackafi. At discharge patient saturated well on \nroom air and did not require oxygen supplementation, though \nintermittently requiring ___ O2 in the few days prior to \ndischarge. Discharge ambulatory sat 91%/RA. \n\n【36】# Severe protein calorie malnutrition. Patient had history of \ndecreased oral intake, nausea, and early satiety. These symptoms \nmost likely secondary to essential thrombocythemia as well as \ncompression from enlarged spleen. Patient received symptomatic \nmanagement and supplements. Following initiation of Jackafi \npatient's symptoms gradually improved and patient tolerated PO \nwell at discharge.\n\n【37】# Supratherapeutic INR. During admission patient's INR was 1.6. \nThought to be secondary to vitamin K deficiency in setting of \nprolonged decreased oral intake. Patient received vitamin K. At \ndischarge his INR is 1.3.\n\n【38】CHRONIC ISSUES \n==============\n\n【39】# HTN: Pt has been prescribed anti-HTN medications in the past, \nbut was not taking them at home.

She has a history of AAA s/p repair in ___ \nwhich was complicated by type 2 endoleak (s/p ___ embolization \nin ___ with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm at OSH \nnoted to be 10.2 x 7.3 x 9.9 cm. She was subsequently \ntransferred to ___ for vascular surgery evaluation, who \nreviewed the CT Abdomen/Pelvis results, found the AAA to be \nstable in size s/p repair, without any evidence of endoleak. The \npatient's abdominal pain resolved gradually, and vascular \nsurgery recommended maintenance of blood pressure < 140mmHg \nsystolic. This required the patient to briefly be in the ICU for \ntitration of esmolol and nicardipine, both of which were \ndiscontinued and the patient was transitioned to PO Labetalol at \nthe time of being called out from the ICU. The patient's \nsymptoms were monitored upon arrival to the floor and remained \nstable. She was started on an aggressive bowel regimen in the \nsetting of constipation, as stool burden may have contributed to \nthe patient's discomfort. Vascular surgery further recommended \ninitiation of aspirin and statin, but the patient has a history \nof GI bleeding on aspirin, and has a history of CK elevation on \nLipitor. As patient with multiple allergies, this was deferred \nat the time of discharge to outpatient providers for further \nevaluation and discussion with the patient. OF note, while \nabdominal pain was first described as sudden-onset, after \nfurther discussion with patient throughout hospitalization, it \nappears that abdominal pain may be more of a chronic issue. She \nwas urged to continue to follow up with her providers regarding \nthis.\n\n【24】# Left Hip Pain: Patient experienced left hip fracture s/p \nsurgical intervention in ___, and presented with \nprogressive L hip pain with limited range of motion and limited \nstrength secondary to giveway from pain. A left hip X-ray was \nobtained and was negative for hardware malpositioning or \nhardware failure, but did show some evidence concerning for \navascular necrosis of the femoral head. Orthopedics was called, \nrecommended no acute intervention, and the patient is to \nfollow-up with orthopedics on an outpatient basis. The patient \nwas maintained on her pain regimen.\n\n【25】# R lower extremity swelling: On examination, there was concern \nfor RLE > LLL edema, for which a venous ultrasound study was \nconducted, which was negative for DVT.\n\n【26】# Anxiety: The patient takes alprazolam 0.5mg BID at home, which \nwas switched to BID:PRN anxiety given concerns for mild \nconfusion on presentation.\n\n【27】# Depression: The patient was continued on her home regimen of \nsertraline 12.5mg daily\n\n【28】# GERD:  The patient was continued on her home regimen of \nomeprazole 20mg BID\n\n【29】# Guaiac Positive Stools: Patient had guaiac-positive stools \nwhich were noted at OSH, Hgb/Hct was stable, and patient \nremained hemodynamically stable. Would consider further \nevaluation on outpatient basis within patient's overall goals of \ncare.\n\n【30】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\n# Labetalol: Patient was started on labetalol while in the \nhospital for blood pressure control, as vascular surgery \nrecommended goal SBP < 140mmHg. Patient discharged on Labetalol \n200 mg PO Q8H. She will likely require further titration of \nlabetalol, as she still had some intermittent elevated BP \nvalues.\n- Uptitrate as indicated and tolerated\n\n【31】# AAA: Patient with a history of AAA s/p repair. She was \nevaluated for abdominal pain out of concern for evolution/leak \nof AAA, but none was seen on imaging, and was stable per \nvascular surgery. Vascular surgery recommended initiation of \nstatin/aspirin therapy, but patient with a history of GI \nbleeding with aspirin, and CK elevation with Lipitor.\n- Can consider initiation of alternative statin therapy\n\n【32】# L Hip Pain: Patient s/p ORIF in ___ for fracture, who \ncomplained of ongoing L hip pain.

He is \nnot a good surgical candidate and declines interventions. \nInfectious disease was consulted and recommended continuing \nceftriaxone, completed 6 week course of antibiotics (including \ninitial two weeks gentamicin) on ___.\n\n【22】# Cardiogenic shock:\nAfternoon of ___ patient with with low urine output, cool \nextremities. Received 500cc x2 with minimal increase in urine \noutput. Lactate rising, venous O2 sat 48, which was concerning \nfor poor perfusion in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Dosed \n80mg IV lasix and patient with improved urine output overnight \nand increased perfusion (lactate downtrending and extremities \nwarm). The following afternoon patient with lactate trending \ndown to 1.4, good urine output and perfusion. Patient no longer \nvolume overloaded on exam ___, and with creatinine, lactate \nnormal. As I/Os and electrolytes (creatinine) stabilized, \ndischarged to SNF.\n\n【23】# Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation \nLast echo ___ with normal LVEF. On echo ___ EF 40-45% with \nmoderate systolic dysfunction. Patient on amiodarone for rate \ncontrol of atrial flutter.  Blood pressure and heart rate could \nnot tolerate beta blocker at prior dose with ACEI (both which \nwould be indicated in systolic CHF). Lowered metoprolol to \n12.5mg bid and discontinued lisinopril. Continued aspirin, \nstarted atorva 40 (interaction with amio, reduced from max \ndose).\n\n【24】# Atrial Fibrillation/A flutter: \nAs demonstrated by ECG. Etiology unclear. Initially with rhythm \ncontrolled by amio gtt, metop PO. However after became \nbradycardic to HR ___ (but still in atrial flutter) discontinued \namio gtt and metoprolol PO, restarted amio 200mg daily PO. \nRecords show patient on anticoagulation with warfarin, taking \n2.5-5mg daily. INR goal 2.5-3.5 because of prosthetic valves. \nDiscontinued heparin gtt once confirmed patient's INR \ntherapeutic. Patient with therapeutic INR for past month, \nconfirmed from OSH and nursing home records. Discussed \ncardioversion with EP; they do not recommend cardioversion at \nthis time. They suspect that he will likely not benefit and \nremain in NSR. On discharge continued amiodarone po 200mg daily, \nmetoprolol succinate 37.5mg daily and warfarin 2.5-5mg daily to \nINR level.\n\n【25】# Strep salivarius bioprosthetic MV endocarditis  \nHas history of AVR and MVR and recent endocarditis, diagnosed at \n___ ___.

However, on echocardiogram ___ vegetation \non mitral valve with gradient. OSH records obtained. Cardiac \nsurgery was consulted and discussed surgical options with \npatient. He is not a good surgical candidate and declines \ninterventions. Infectious disease was consulted and recommended \ncontinuing ceftriaxone, completed 6 week course of antibiotics \n(including initial two weeks gentamicin) on ___. \n\n【26】# Delirium: \nPatient with worsening delirium, agitation overnight ___. \nDifferential included infection (known endocarditis), septic \nemboli from mitral valve vegetation, as well as complication of \npoor perfusion in setting of cardiogenic shock. Somnolent \nthroughout the day, likely secondary to seroquel, as head CT \nnegative for septic emboli, acute intracranial process. Patient \nwith improved mental status by afternoon ___. Alert, oriented. \n\n【27】# Elevated troponin\nTroponin 2.0 on admission, and rising. Likely demand ischemia in \nsetting of a fib/flutter with RVR. Patient denies any episodes \nof chest pain prior to or at ___ reported in records \nfrom outside hospital), no ST-T changes on EKG; therefore low \nsuspicion for ACS. Therapeutic on warfarin for prosthetic valve \nand afib/aflutter.  \n\n【28】# CAD\nStarted atorva 40mg daily. Adjusted metoprolol succinate to \n37.5mg daily.

She then developed bright \nred blood per rectum after initiation of heparin gtt for atrial \nfibrillation with RVR, which ___ be a second etiology of GI \nbleeding. She underwent EGD which showed gastritis and \nduodenitis. ___ colonoscopy prep was unsuccessful. The \ndifferential of ___ bright red blood per rectum is broad and ___ \nhave been related to ischemic colitis during cardiac \ndecompensation of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular \nrate. She still requires colonoscopy to rule out any underlying \nstructural causes of ___ GI bleeding in order to most safely \nstart anti-coagulation. She was discharged on a high dose PPI.  \n\n【23】# Atrial Fibrillation: Possible transient AF in the setting of \nmultiple risk factors including anemia, NSTEMI and CHF \nexacerbation causing atrial stretch.  She remained in NSR during \n___ hospitalization. CHADS2-VASC = 6 (9.8% yearly CVA risk). \nCardiology was consulted and recommended starting \nanti-coagulation given elevated stroke risk. However, due to the \nproximity to ___ GI bleed and an inability to rule out \nstructural issues related to ___ GI bleed, starting \nanti-coagulation while inpatient was deferred. \n\n【24】# NSTEMI: Elevated troponins on admission to OSH were suspicious \nfor NSTEMI. This likely provoked by combination of CHF \nexacerbation from worsening renal failure and anemia from GIB \ncausing demand ischemia. Patient reports she never had CP \nalthough she did have nausea which would be anginal equivalent \nbut more likely the nausea is a result of GIB. ___ elevated \ntroponins were most thought to be most consistent with demand \nischemia. She was briefly heparinized prior to developing ___ GI \nbleed. She was continued on an aspirin and beta-blocker. \n\n【25】# CHF: Clinically presented to OSH with worsening symptoms of \nvolume overload, including progressive shortness of breath and \nbilateral pitting edema. ___ volume status was managed with \nhemodialysis. On discharge, she weighed 74.8kg.\n\n【26】# End Stage Renal Disease on HD: Initated on HD during this \nadmission given volume overload and contrast load in setting of \ncatheterization for NSTEMI. ___ AV fistula was found to have a \nlarge hematoma requiring placement of a tunneled HD line.  ___ \nlast HD session was ___. ___ HD schedule will be at:\n___ Dialysis ___\nPhone: ___\nNephrologist: Dr. ___: ___ @ 11:45 AM\n\n【27】# Diabetes Mellitus: A1c 6.9% during this admission. ___ oral \nhypoglycemics were held and she was continued on lantus and an \ninsulin sliding scale while hospitalized. She was transitioned \nback to ___ on discharge to rehab. \n\n【28】# Hypertension: Many anti-hypertensives had been held in the \nsetting of acute GI bleed. She was continued on metoprolol \n(which was transitioned to metoprolol succinate) and amlodipine \nat time of discharge. ___ hydralazine was discontinued because \nshe was normotensive.  \n\n【29】# Hyperlipidemia: continued home atorvastatin but at an \nincreased dose of 80mg daily.\n\n【30】# Neuropathy: continued home gabapentin.\n\n【31】# Depression/anxiety: continue home Sertraline/Alprazolam\n\n【32】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n* AV fistula with large hematoma requiring healing and \nre-cannulation prior to re-accessing.

You were admitted from a different \nhospital for management of your multiple medical problems, \nincluding a bleed from your gastrointestinal tract. While you \nwere here, you underwent endoscopy, which took pictures of your \nstomach and part of your intestines. This showed that there was \na lot of irritation in your stomach called gastritis. You will \nneed to take a medication called pantoprazole that suppresses \nacid in your stomach to help this heal. \n\n【41】The GI doctors wanted to ___ a colonoscopy but unfortunately, you \ndid not tolerate the prep. This will have to be done in the near \nfuture since you have never had a screening colonoscopy. Also, \nthe colonoscopy will help us know if it is safe to thin your \nblood since you have atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation \nputs you at increased stroke risk and this is minimized by \nthinning your blood with a medication like coumadin. \n\n【42】You also continued dialysis while you were here. It was noted \nthat your fistula wasn't working properly. You underwent a \nfistulogram which showed a large blood clot in your fistula. \nBecause of this, you got a tunneled line placed to get \nhemodialysis. Your next dialysis session will be ___. \n\n【43】___ is confirmed to begin dialysis on ___, \n___ at 11:15am at:\n\n【44】___ Dialysis ___\nPhone: ___\nNephrologist: Dr. ___\n\n【45】___ hd schedule will be every ___ & ___ at 11:45am\n\n【46】Since you have heart failure, it is important to weigh yourself \neveryday. Your weight on discharge was 74.8 kg.\n\n【47】___ Gastroenterology will contact you for an appointment in \nabout 3 weeks for an outpatient colonoscopy. You will need this \nto rule out any masses prior to starting anticoagulation.\n\n【48】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

The patient was given 2 puffs of \nalbuterol prior to exercise secondary to expiratory wheezing on \n100% oxygen 2L/min with an O2 saturation of 97%. The patient \nexercised for 13.5 minutes of a modified ___ protocol and \nstopped for shortness of breath and fatigue. The estimated peak \nMET capacity was 5.3 which represents a fair physical working \ncapacity for his age. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was \nreported by the patient throughout the study. The baseline EKG \nshowed prominant voltage with LAE and NSSTTWs. There was 0.5 mm \nof downsloping ST segment depression in the inferolateral leads \nat peak exercise. The O2 saturation at peak exercise on 100% O2 \nwas 91%. By minute 1 of recovery the O2 saturation increased to \n96%. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated apbs. Appropriate \nincrease in systolic BP with exercise. \nIMPRESSION: Oxygen desaturation with exercise on 100% oxygen (2 \n___ via nasal canula) in the absence of anginal type symptoms \nor interpretable EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately. \n.\n___ Stress Test/Cardiac Perfusion: \nHISTORY: Chest pain  \nSUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  \nExercise protocol: Modified Gervino  \nResting heart rate: 69  \nResting blood pressure: 120/78  \nExercise Duration: 13.5 min  \nPeak heart rate: 131  \nPercent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 82%  \nPeak blood pressure: 162/68  \nSymptoms during exercise: No chest pain  \nReason exercise terminated: Dyspnea and fatigue  \nECG findings: No ischemic changes  \n\n【13】METHOD:  \nResting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m tetrofosmin. \nTracer was  \ninjected approximately 30 minutes prior to obtaining the resting \nimages.  \nAt peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of \nTc-99m  \ntetrofosmin was administered IV. Stress images were obtained \napproximately 15 \nminutes following tracer injection.  \nImaging Protocol: Gated SPECT  \nThis study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial \nperfusion model.  \n\n【14】INTERPRETATION:  \nIncidentally noted is unusual liver configuration on the raw \nprojection images, \nconsistent with know status post hepatectomy.  \nLeft ventricular cavity size is normal.  \nResting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake \nthroughout the \nleft ventricular myocardium.  \n\n【15】Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  \n\n【16】The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 58%.  \n\n【17】Compared with the study of there is no change.  \n\n【18】IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of \nexercise achieved.  \n2. Normal left ventricular size and function. LVEF=58%.  \n\n【19】Brief Hospital Course:\n# Dyspnea: \n\n【20】Mr. ___ presented with worsening dyspnea and some chest pain \non the evening of admission. The patient called EMS and was \nnoted to be 93% on RA, tachypneic and using accessory muscles. \nThey gave him a nebulizer and brought him to ___. In the ___, VS T \n97.2 HR 116 BP 117/79 RR 18 O2 Sat 96% on RA 2L. He was given \nalbuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and azithromycin 500mg IV. \nOn the floor, patient was not SOB at rest, but did complain of \nSOB on movement if not on 02 (e.g. with using the restroom \nwithout his 02). Given his history, medication non-compliance \nwas suspected to be the most prominent contributing factor. He \nwas restarted on Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol, which \noffered some relief. He was also thought to benefit from a short \ncourse of steroids, which were begun. However, his history of \ncough/nasal drainage was concerning for a COPD exacerbation \ntriggered by bronchitis or URI, and the Azithromycin was \ncontinued. On ambulation with 02, patient's 02sat remained in \nthe ___. However, 02 sat dropped to 84% without oxygen. Thus, it \nwas felt it would necessary for him to received home 02; several \nmembers of the medical team including his PCP discussed the \nrisks of fire/death with smoking + 02 with the patient.  He was \ndischarged with instructions to continue Azithromycin 250 mg for \n3 more days (5 days total: 500 mg x1, 250 mgx4), continue \nprednisone: 40 mg 1 more day, 30 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 \ndays; during this taper he will follow up with his PCP.  He will \nalso continue dapsone for PCP prophylaxis for duration of \nsteroid course.  He also was instructed to continue advair and \ntiotropium.  A home nebulizer was also arranged, and the patient \nwill continue albuterol nebs 4 times a day.  Many members \nencouraged smoking cessation and emphasized the potential health \nbenefits of cessation.  \n# Chest pain: The patient noted an episode of chest pain on the \nevening of admission 'like a vice,' substernal without \nradiation, that came on while playing a computer game. It lasted \n15min, resolved spontaneously, and with no associated symptoms \nincluding SOB, N/V, dizziness, or palpitations.  In the \nhospital, 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were drawn, which were \nnegative. No acute EKG changes were noted. Thus, acute coronary \nsyndrome was thought to be unlikely. However, the patient had \nnot had a stress test since ___, and given his difficulty with \nkeeping prior appointments and cardiac risk factors, was ordered \nfor a myocadial perfusion study (baseline EKG abnormalities \nprecluded use of a stress test), which showed 1. Normal \nmyocardial perfusion at the level of exercise achieved. 2. \nNormal left ventricular size and function with LVEF=58%. Thus, \nAspirin was not continued. Again, smoking cessation was felt to \nbe the best way to reduce cardiac risk.  As above, many members \nof the medical team including the residents and attending \nemphasized the health benefits of smoking cessation and offered \nassistance and resources.\n\n【21】Medications on Admission:\n**following list per OMR** -- pt stated he was only using \nalbuterol and clonazepam for the past ___ weeks: \nPrednisone 50 mg daily-> per pcp note on taper to reduce by 10mg \nq week but does not appear to have kept that timeline  \nOmeprazole 20mg daily  \nRaniditine 150mg daily  \nSpiriva 18mcg once daily inhaled  \nCalcium carbonate 500 BID  \nVit D 400 bid  \nAlendronate 70 q week  \nAdvair 500mcg/50mcg bid inhaled  \nCitalopram 10mg daily  \nKlonipin 0.5-1 mg BID: recently started on taper as 'neighbor \nstealing'  \ndapsone 100mg daily po  \n\n【22】Discharge Medications:\n1.

A \nmajority of T-cells are a mixed population of CD4(+) and CD8(+) \nT-cells without major antigenic aberrancy. However, there is an \nexpanded population of double negative T-cells (CD4-, CD8-) that \ncomprise 7% of total CD3(+) T-lymphocytes. A major subset of \nthese appear to express TCR-alpha-beta.\nSince expansion of double-negative alpha-beta type T-cells can \nbe seen in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) \ncorrelation with clinical findings and possible molecular \nstudies (e.g. FAS/FAS-mutational analysis) is suggested if \nclinically indicated.\n\n【40】Hematopath: \nCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND ERYTHROID\nPREDOMINANT MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND AN EXTENSIVE T \nCELL\nINFILTRATE; SEE NOTE.\n\n【41】Note: The bone marrow aspirate smears revealed numerous \nlymphocytes which are predominantly small to medium in size as \nwell as admixed erythroid and myeloid precursors and a small \nnumber of megakaryocytes. The bone marrow biopsy shows similar \nfindings with extensive lymphoid aggregates present which \naccount for the vast majority of the cellularity. In areas \nwithout lymphoid cells the cellularity is approximately ___. \nBy immunohistochemistry, CD3 highlights the lymphoid infiltrate \nwhile CD20 highlights only rare small scattered cells. CD4 and \nCD8 highlight subsets of T cell with the CD4 positive population \nslightly predominating. A clear double negative (CD4 \nnegative/CD8 negative) T cell population is not seen by \nimmunohistochemistry. TdT is negative. CD45RO is positive in the \nlymphoid infiltrate. A mast cell tryptase highlights a \npopulation of mast cells that are scattered singly with \noccasional cells having a spindle shape morphology.\n\n【42】Corresponding flow cytometry revealed a large T cell population \ncomposed of both CD4 positive and CD8 positive cells that did \nnot show major antigenic aberrancy and a small population of \ndouble negative T cells representing 7% of total CD3 positive T \ncells with a major subset of these appearing to express TCR \nalpha-beta. TCR gamma-delta expressing cells were scant . C-Kit D816V \nmutational analysis was negative. T-Cell receptor gamma gene \nrearrangement performed at ___ diagnostic was negative \nconsistent with a polyclonal T cell population. Molecular \ntesting repeated through NeoGenomics revealed a clonal results \nby TCR gamma PCR only and a polyclonal result by TCR beta PCR \nand these results are of unclear significance. Cytogenetics \nwork-up revealed a normal female karyotype and a MDS FISH panel \nwas negative .\n\n【43】In summary, the bone marrow aspirates and biopsy show a large \npopulation of T cells that are a mix of CD4 and CD8 positive \ncells that do not show major antigenic aberrancy. \n\n【44】CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 46,XX通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u> Normal female karyotype\n\n【45】IMAGING: \n========\n___ Liver/Gallbladder US: \n2 gallbladder polyps up to 0.8 cm. \nRECOMMENDATION(S):  ___ year follow-up is recommended for polyps \nbetween 0.7 cm and above.\n\n【46】___ PET CT: \nMildly FDG avid cervical, mediastinal, and inguinal \nlymphadenopathy  with a max SUV of 3.15 in the right inguinal \nlymph nodes.  This likely represents reactive lymphadenopathy\n\n【47】___ MRI Mediastinium:\n1.  Small amount of physiologic normal thymic tissue, which is \nnot unexpected in a patient of this age.\n2.  Small amount of fluid in a pericardial recess.\n3.  No worrisome anterior mediastinal mass.\n4.  Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, unchanged from \nthe recent CT.\n5.  Nodule within the gallbladder may represent an adherent \nstone or small polyp.  Recommend correlation with a right upper \nquadrant ultrasound.\n\n【48】___ CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis  with contrast: \nThyroid is unremarkable.  Thymus is physiologic.  Interposed \nbetween the thymus an the aortic arch is a homogeneous new \nencapsulated abnormality with attenuation values consistent with \nexudate or edematous soft tissue, ___ ___.  Although the space \nconforms to pericardial recess, there is no pericardial \nabnormality elsewhere.\n\n【49】Mediastinal lymph node enlargement is borderline in the lower \nparatrachealsstations, but unequivocal extending from the \nsubcarinal to the right para esophageal station reaching the \nmaximum diameter of 18 mm, where it is contiguous with \nadenopathy in the lower pole of the right hilus.  Left hilar \nlymph nodes range up to 9 mm across.  Vital structures are not \nimpinged. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.\n\n【50】Atherosclerotic calcification is not evident in head and neck or \ncoronary arteries.  Aorta and cardiac chambers are normal size.  \nMain pulmonary artery is borderline enlarged, but right and left \npulmonary arteries are normal size.\n\n【51】A triangular 5 mm subpleural nodule in the left lower lobe is \nmost likely a lymphoid aggregate.  Lungs are otherwise clear and \nthe tracheobronchial tree is normal to subsegmental levels.\n\n【52】There are no bone lesions suspicious for malignancy or infection\n\n【53】1. Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are borderline \nenlarged and morphologically abnormal though not pathologically \nenlarged right inguinal lymph nodes.  These could be reactive \nthough given history of pancytopenia, a hematologic malignancy \nsuch as lymphoma or leukemia would be on the differential.\n2. Hyperdense material along the wall of the gallbladder fundus. \n Recommend further evaluation with right upper quadrant \nultrasound.\n\n【54】___valuation of the aerodigestive tract demonstrates no mass, and \nno areas of focal mass effect.\n\n【55】The salivary glands enhance normally and are without mass or \nadjacent fat stranding.

We \ndiscussed your case with an expert in this syndrome at the ___. \nYou were treated with high dose steroids (methylprednisolone and \nnow prednisone), and another immunosuppressant medication called \nrapamycin. You were also given injections of neupogen to \nstimulate the production of white blood cells. All of your blood \ncounts improved with this treatment. In addition to prednisone \nand rapamycin, you have a number of new medications to take, \nwhich protect you from viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. \n\n【72】You will follow up with Dr. ___ this week. He will \nfollow up your blood tests and may adjust your medications. \nPlease make sure you do not take your rapamycin that morning so \nthat we can check a level at that visit.\n\n【73】It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay in the \nhospital.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. \nAsymmetric soft tissue swelling with heterogeneous mixed-low \nattenuation pattern diffusely involves left parapharyngeal space \nfrom the level of of the medial pterygoids posterior to the \nmaxillary sinus inferiorly to the level of the larynx and \ndeformity and narrowing of the hypopharynx, and marked narrowing \nof the left piriform sinus. No discrete well circumscribed \nperipherally enhancing collection or abnormal soft tissue gas is \nseen; I suspect that much of this represents phlegmonous \ninfectious process without discrete drainable collection yet \npresent. Direct inspection and needle aspiration may be \nwarranted, however. Extensive left anterior and posterior \ntriangle lymphadenopathy with less pronounced reactive right \nanterior-posterior triangle lymphadenopathy.\nThe parotid and submandibular glands are symmetric and normal. \nThe larynx, false and true cords, thyroid gland visualized \nportions of the superior mediastinum are normal. The vessels are \nwell opacified and normal.\nConclusion: Extensive left parapharyngeal phlegmon as detailed \nwith associated asymmetric lymphadenopathy. While no discrete \nwell circumscribed collection is yet visible, I cannot exclude a \ndeveloping parapharyngeal abscess within the extensive phlegmon, \nand direct visual inspection is recommended, and possible needle \naspiration.

This \nhas been progressive over the past ___ years, and much worse \nafter discontinuation of alcohol use. On exam, he has a left \nfoot drop, and a pronounced intention tremor with brisk reflexes \nthroughout. Muscle bulk is decreased. The patient's gait \ndisorder is likely of multifactorial etiology. Contributive \netiologies include: decreased nutrition secondary to alcohol \nuse, C5-6 spinal stenosis (but no cord signal change)causing \nweakness, and idiopathic tremor. Patient received folate and \nthiamine supplementation during admission and was discharged on \npo vitamin supplements, was started on Primidone to target his \ntremor, and should wear a soft collar at night for cervical \nstenosis.\n\n【37】NEURO:\n- MRI C/L-spine shows C5-6 stenosis, no cord signal change. \nPatient should wear a soft collar at night to decrease \nirritation to nerve roots, in order to improve gait\n- Continue thiamine 100mg IV daily x 5 days, folate IV x 5 days, \nmultivitamin - switched to po upon discharge to maintain \nnutritional status\n- B12, TSH wnl\n- EtOH level not done in ED, patient was on CIWA protocol but \ndid not score (this was precautionary, pt reported quitting \nalcohol in ___\n- primidone 50 mg qhs for tremor - tremor has improved on this \nmedication, which has improved the patient's gait\n\n【38】TACHYCARDIA\n- pt triggered on ___ for HR 200s, asymptomatic. Junctional \nrhythm on telemetry, spontaneously resolved to sinus tachycardia \nby the time EKG obtained. Pt stated that he was anxious, and was \ntreated with 0.5 mg ativan. There was concern for volume \ndepletion as the patient stated poor po intake for several days, \nso IV fluids were given. K and Mg were low on admission, not \nwell repleted in ED, so additional repletion was given. Lytes \nwere monitored and repleted daily. Pt continued to have sinus \ntachycardia to 160s with activity (not at rest). Per Cardiology \nconsult, pt had AVnRT on ___.

It was determined that your \ndifficulty walking is likely related to several causes, \nincluding nutritional deficiencies, tremors, and some narrowing \nof your cervical spine (c5-c6 spinal stenosis), which caused \nweakness. To address your nutritional deficiencies, we gave you \nFolate and Thiamine. You should continue to take folate an \nthiamine supplements at home. We also started you on Primidone, \nwhich you tolerated well without side effect, and reported a \nconsiderable improvement in your tremor. For your stenosis, we \nwould recommend that you continue to wear a soft cervical collar \nat night to decrease irritation of your nerve roots and \nassociated weakness. \nDuring your time in the hospital you had an episode of \ntachycardia (fast heart rate), and were found to have AV nodal \nre-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT). We started you on Metoprolol, \nwhich you tolerated well. Echocardiogram showed no structural \nabnormality. You should follow up in Cardiology Clinic - ask \nyour PCP for ___ referral. Finally, your Magnesium and Potassium \nlevels were low on admission. We have given you potassium and \nmagnesium supplements throughout your time in the hospital, and \nyou should continue these at home upon discharge. \nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your time at ___. \nPlease continue to take your medications as directed and attend \nall follow-up appointments. \n\n【49】With best wishes,\n\n【50】You ___ team\n\n【51】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

He describes the back pan as sharp and \nconstant low on the right side, and does not remember any \nactivity which precipitated this. This pain is better with \nwalking and worse with lying still/flat.It is not associated \nwith any weakness or sensory changes in the lower extremities. \nThe abdominal pain originates in the pelvis midline and radiates \nup to the LUQ. This pain usually starts after the back pain \nintensifies, and then precipitates nausea which is partially \nalleviated by self-induced retching. He does not vomit when \nretching. This is not related to food. He is still able to \ntolerate a small diet, is not nauseous with food, has BMs\nabout every 5 days without changes in color or caliber which has \nbeen his normal routine for the past several months. He \ncontinues to pass flatus and has no diarrhea or constipation. He \nhas not had any fevers/chills/sweats at home, no chest pain or \nshortness of breath.\nDr. ___ saw him in clinic near the end of ___. He \nhas had nausea/abdominal pain prior to this, and an EGD was done \nwhich revealed gastric ulcers. He was placed on a PPI and \nCarafate, with some resolution in symptoms before this new \nback/abdominal pain started. He was due for a repeat endoscopy\nthis week, but due to scheduling issues, he is awaiting a call\nback to reschedule.  For the current symptoms, he has been in \nand out of ___ several times. He has had \nmultiple CXRs, KUBs, and CT abdomen, which have revealed no \ndistinct intraabdominal pathology to explain his symptoms. His \ngastric sleeve staple line is reportedly intact. The back pain \nis thought to be musculoskeletal, and he has been discharged on \ntramadol several times. There was some question of a mild \npancreatitis from ?EtOH on his last admission to ___ \n___ ~2days ago during which his lipase was slightly \nelevated at 113, but this has since resolved. He does have a \nhistory of smoking and drinking, even after the gastric sleeve, \nand has been warned that this may exacerbate any ulceration. He \nstates now that he last had a drink\n~1mo ago and that he last smoked ~2weeks ago because his \npain/nausea have decreased his craving for cigarettes, but this \nhistory remains questionable.

Septic shock: Patient admitted with septic shock secondary to \npolymicrobial bactermia with liver abscess.  She underwent \ninitial early goal directed therapy with 4L IV fluid, right IJ \nplacement with initiation of levophed, and broad spectrum \nantibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn. CT abdomen/pelvis was done, showing \nan abscess amenable for U/S-guided drainage. ___ placed \ntranscutaneous transhepatic catheter with drainage of purulent \nfluid.  The CT scan did not show any diverticulitis or other \npotential source for bacteremia. Despite some mild gall bladder \nthickening, the surgery team did not feel that there was \ncholecystitis. CEA and alpha-fetoprotein were normal.  TTE \nshowed no evidence of endocarditis as source of infection. \nFollowing drain placement, septic physiology resolved and \npatient was able to wean off pressors.  Patient became afebrile, \nleukocytosis resolved and LFTs slowly normalized.  Purulent \nfluid from liver abscess grew fusobacterium and blood cultures \nreturned with strep anginosus and fusobacterium.  Vancomycin/ \nzosyn was tailored to zosyn and then to ertapenem on discharge. \nPicc line was placed once patient was afebrile for > 24 hrs and \nblood cultures were negative.  \n\n【19】Patient will need 4 weeks of ertapenem ___ - ___ \nwith weekly monitoring of CBC, BMP and LFTs.  She will need a CT \nscan in 3 weeks to ensure resolution of abscess prior to \ndiscontinuation of antibiotics/ drain.

In addition, an ongoing investigation is \nrecommended for source of initial infection, in particular she \nwill need full dental evaluation.   \n\n【20】2. Tachypnea: on admission, patient was noted to be tachypneic, \nand had intermittent wheezing and respiratory distress through \nICU stay. On ___ she required non-invasive positive-pressure \nventilation in the setting of severe tachypnea.  Respiratory \ndistress was felt to be multifactorial from reactive airways \ndisease (despire no hisotory of asthma/ COPD), atelectasis from \nshallow breathing and b/l pleural effusions in the setting of \nvolume resuscitation and sepsis.\nOn ___, she was started on solumedrol for empiric treatment of \nreactive airway disease which was changed to inhaled steriod on \n___ as there was no improvement in symptoms. On ___ she had \na lung CT which showed bilateral effusions and airspace disease \nfrom likely atelectasis.  She was diuresed gently given acute \nkidney injury and respiratory status improved.  By time of \ndischarge, patient was breathing comfortably on room air. \n\n【21】3.  Rash: On ___ patient was noted to have an erythematous \npuritic rash on her back.

Blood \ncultures grew Staph epi with a difficult resistance pattern. \nStarted on vancomycin and subsequent surveillance blood cultures \nwere negative. CVC tip culture grew both proteus and\nresistant serratia. His wound culture grew resistant \npsudeomonas. As suseptibility pattern became more clear, he was \nstarted on cefepime and then changed to meropenem and then back \nto cefepime. Chest wall ultrasound demonstrated a small fluid \ncollection, but this could not be aspirated. Given his poor \naccess options and multiple throbosis sites, he was treated with \nIV antibitotics through a left EJ triple lumen catheter until he \ncompleted his antibiotic course for the pseudomonas, proteus, \nand serratia. \n\n【28】He completed a course of cefepime of 7d duration on ___ and \nvancomycin on ___.\n\n【29】He received a dose of oritavancin 1200mg to treat the coag neg \nstaph epi infection on ___.  This drug has a long duration of \naction and will have systemic effects for approximately ___ \nweeks.  The reason this was administered was to allow for an \nextended course of antibiotics without the need for further \nindwelling central access.  His EJ catheter was removed on ___. \n Oritivancin can cause a temporary elevation in INR but does not \naffect Coumadin pharmacodynamics or effect.  The original \nindication for the Hickman line had been IV access in case of an \nemergency.  The risk and benefits of replacing a long-term \ncentral line was discussed with the patient, who expressed a \nstrong preference to not have the line replaced. Thus, the \npatient has no IV access on discharge.\n\n【30】THe ID physician summarizes his blood stream infection the \nfollowing way:\n\n【31】\" ___ year old male with progressive MS resulting\nin quadraplegia, who has had multiple urinary tract infections \nin\nthe past due to suprapublic tube, and more recently multiple \nCoNS\nbacteremias due to indwelling ___ line.  He presented with\nSSTI around ___ site and CoNS bacteremia.  Line was pulled\n___, and the only possible access (tried both central and\nperipheral) was an EJ placed in ___ under guidence.  Per ___, due to clots, the only place a new line could go is back\ninto the left chest.\n\n【32】He was treated with cefepime for the SSTI (Pseudomonas, Proteus\nand Serratia from line tip and Pseudomonas with mixed flora from\nwound swab) in the hospital.  U/S showed a small pocket of fluid\nat the site, ___ tried to sample it, but there was no fluid left. \n\n【33】They injected saline and sent this for culture and it was\nnegative.\n\n【34】For CoNS bacteremia, he received IV Vancomycin in house. \nMultiple discussions with patient, hospitalists, and other\noutpatient providers decided that risks of putting a central \nline\nback in would outweigh risks of keeping it out (which is that he\nwill lack easy access in the case of an emergency/sepsis). \nTherefore he received Vanco in house and will receive a dose of\noritavancin on his last day inpatient. This will provide him \nwith\nclose to 3 weeks of treatment.  \n\n【35】-->Given the relatively short course for his CoNS bacteremia, \nand\npossibility that it could have seeded his clots, would ask his\nSNF to check surveillance blood cultures at 2,3, and 4 weeks\nafter he leaves the hospital.\n\n【36】-->ID follow up arranged for ___\n\n【37】# Afib: Rate controlled.

He presented to ___, a CT was \nperformed showing interval worsening of type B dissection. He \nwas started on esmolol gtt and transferred to ___ for further \nmanagement. On presentation, patient was taken to the CVICU for \ncare, where he received Q4H neuro checks, a right radial a line \nwas placed for BP monitoring, and he was continued on and \neventually weaned off an esmolol drip. The vascular medicine \nteam followed this patient for recommendations on \nantihypertensive agents, with a systolic blood pressure goal \n<120.

The intra-abdominal small bowel is \nnormal. The intra- abdominal large bowel is notable for \nscattered diverticula. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal \nadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. \nCT PELVIS: There are extensive diverticula in the sigmoid colon. \nThe rectum, bladder, and distal ureters are normal. There is no \nfree fluid, inguinal or pelvic adenopathy. BONE WINDOWS: The \nmajority of the bone findings have been described in the CT \nchest portion of the study due to soft tissue metastases. There \nis also facet joint arthropathy in the lumbosacral spine. There \nis osteophyte formation in the thoracic and lumbar spine. \nIMPRESSION: 1. Extensive metastatic disease. Innumerable \npulmonary nodules and a pulmonary mass. 2. Bilateral adrenal \nmetastases. 3.

This slightly indents the thecal sac but does not \ncompromise the spinal cord. There are minor degenerative changes \nin the cervical spine with no evidence of cord compression. \nThere is narrowing of the neural foramina at multiple levels due \nto uncovertebral osteophyte formation. There is a soft tissue \nmass largely replacing the T3 spinous process.  However, this \ndoes not encroach upon the spinal canal. There is extensive \nhyperintensity of the marrow of the entire spinal column on the \nshort TR images, suggesting prior radiation. There is a soft \ntissue mass apparently arising from the right T9 rib, with \nerosion of the adjacent vertebral body, pedicle, and transverse \nprocess. This does not involve the spinal canal. There is an \napparent left renal cyst. This may be better evaluated with \nultrasound or CT. There are mild changes of degenerative disc \ndisease in the lumbar spine without compromise the spinal canal \nor neural foramina. CONCLUSION: Vertebral body signal intensity \nchanges suggesting prior radiation. Lesions in the right C5 \nbody, pedicle, and lamina, T3 spinous process, and \nright T9 rib compatible with the history of metastatic disease. \nNo evidence of neoplastic encroachment on the spinal cord. \n\n【13】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ with recent progression of RCC with mets to the spinal \ncolumn and brain who presents with intractable pain and \nworsening neurologic status.

Heart is not particularly enlarged, \nmaking it\ndifficult to diagnose congestive heart failure, but there is \npulmonary\nvascular congestion. Additionally, left lower lobe consolidation \nand\ninterstitial abnormality have worsened. Unfortunately, the \nconstellations of\nfindings is complicated and that I cannot say for certain \nwhether the patient\nis likely to have concurrent CHF and widespread pulmonary \ninfection. On\ntoday's study, the stomach is newly distended with air and \nfluid.\nEKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead voltage. Compared to \nthe previous tracing\nof ___ the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim \nchange.\n___\n___\n.\nCXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent \nof the right\npleural effusion has minimally increased. Also increased are the \npre-existing\nopacities in the right lung that cause a diffuse increase in \nradiodensity of\nthe right hemithorax and, in addition, blunting of the right \ncardiac border.\nOn the other hand, the pre-existing opacities on the left \n(including the small\nleft pleural effusion) have slightly decreased. The size of the \ncardiac silhouette is unchanged. The position of the left PICC \nline is also constant.\nAspergillus Antigen testing: negative.\n\n【15】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HIV, Kaposi's Sarcoma, \nand Primary Effusion Lymphoma who presented for the next cycle \nof chemotherapy for Kaposi's Sarcoma with Taxol given the \nshortage of Doxil. While in house, the patient began to worsen \nwith more anasarca of the lower extremities, scrotum, and lower \nabdominal wall. A decision was made by the primary oncology team \nto pursue a different chemotherapy route using EPOCH. This \nregimen lasted ___. Results were promising as the KS \nrash began to dissipate, but the swelling continued to worsen or \nat least stay the same. Lasix was pushed IV to attempt to clear \nsome of the excess fluid which the chemo brought on, this worked \nminimally. The patient was continued on his HAART regimen the \nentire hospital course as well as Azithromycin, Bactrim, \nFluconazole, and Gancyclovir for prophylaxis with changes in \ndose and frequency daily based on weight and renal function. The \nlargest problem for the patient this admission was pain control. \nMostly caused by the edema, the patient was finally stabilized \non a PO Oxycontin and PO Dilaudid regimen for long-acting and \nshort-acting breakthrough pain control respectively. Towards the \nlast few before discharge, ___ wanted to leave more and more. \nDespite warnings against leaving while his white count was \n___ decided it was time for him to leave. He was \nprofoundly neutropenic, developing a sore throat, productive \ncough, worsening right-sided pleural edema, and shortness of \nbreath the day he left. We educated him on neutropenic \nprecautions, gave him Neupogen for home and orders to come back \nif he can't find it, and the appropriate PPX and treatment \nmedications. He had follow-up the week following with multiple \ndepartments.\n\n【16】Medications on Admission:\n1. azithromycin 1 gram Packet Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  PO ___.  \n2. emtricitabine-tenofovir 200-300 mg Tablet Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Tablet \n\n【17】PO DAILY (Daily).  \n3. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 \nhours) as needed for anxiety.  \n4. metoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Tablet PO QID (4 \ntimes a day) as needed for nausea.  \n5. nicotine 14 mg/24 hr Patch 24 hr Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Patch 24 hr \nTransdermal DAILY (Daily): TAKE FOR SMOKING CESSATION.\nDisp:*30 Patch 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. ondansetron 8 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Tablet, \nRapid Dissolve PO every eight 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> hours as needed for nausea.  \n7. oxycodone 20 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> \nTablet Extended Release 12 hr PO QAM (once a day (in the \nmorning)): Do not drive, drink alcohol or operate heavy \nmachinery while taking.  \n8. oxycodone 10 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr Sig: Three 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> \nTablet Extended Release 12 hr PO QPM (once a day (in the \nevening)): Do not drive, drink alcohol or operate heavy \nmachinery while taking.  \n9. raltegravir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Tablet PO BID (2 times \n\n【18】a day).  \n10. oxycodone 10 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO q3hrs as needed \nfor pain: Take for breakthrough pain.

You \nwere admitted due to your increased pain and swelling from your \nKaposi's sarcoma. With Lasix, the water pill, and steroids the \nswelling improved over the course of your stay. We also worked \nwith pain management to find a pain regimen that worked for you.\nWhen you arrived you received one dose of Taxol for your \ndisease. However since your disease was still progressing, a \ndecision was made to start you on aggressive chemotherapy called \nEPOCH. This therapy dropped your blood counts tremendously. You \nare now neutropenic, meaning that your white blood cells are \nbelow the level at which they protect you from normal everyday \ninfections. You must take precautions to keep yourself safe from \ninfection until your counts rise. A medication called Neupogen \nwill be delivered to your house today. If you do not get this \npackage, YOU MUST COME BACK TOMORROW ___ at NOON) TO THE \n___, ___ FLOOR. You will need to take this medication \ndaily. \n.\nTowards the last 3 days of your stay here, you developed a sore \nthroat, cough, some shortness of breath, and signs on chest \nx-ray suspicious for an organizing pneumonia. We started you on \nan antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin in addition to the \nprophylactic antibiotics you already take. If these symptoms \nworsen, please do not hesitate to call your doctor or come back \nto the hospital. If you start to have a fever, you should return \nto the hospital right away.\nYour current medication regimen is listed in the chart that was \nexplained to you on discharge. Please take/use only the \nmedications listed on this new printout. This should help to \nstreamline your medication regimen. You will no longer receive \nIV medication, but the PICC will remain until you pass the oral \ntrial of the valgancyclovir. \n.\nIt is vital to your health that you attend all of the \nappointments listed below. When attending these appointments, \nplease wear the masks that we are sending you home with in order \nto protect you from the germs in the ___ environment.\nIf you have any questions about what is safe for you to do on a \ndaily basis, please call the doctor's office and/or refer to the \nsheet on neutropenic precautions given to you at discharge.\nWe wish you the best of luck in your recovery. Take care of \nyourself. \n\n【28】Followup Instructions:\n___", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mimic_iv_discharge", "batch_name": "20240402", "version": "version1"}

Diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis. \n\n【21】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ year old female with a PMHx significant \nfor hepatitis C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant in ___, \nrecurrent cirrhosis and portal hypertension s/p TIPS in ___, \nand s/p Hep C treatment and sustained viralogic response who \npresented to the ER ___ with left sided chest pressure and pain \nthat radiated to the arm as well as diffuse abdominal pain. \n\n【22】These symptoms had been present without remission for a few \ndays. She also described chills, diffuse fatigue, depression, \nanhedonia, and low energy. She denied trauma to the chest wall. \nIn the ER she had CT abdomen-pelvis that showed no cause of her \nsymptoms. A CXR was normal. EKG and troponins x2 were not \nindicative of acute coronary syndrome. She was admitted for \ninpatient stress testing. \n\n【23】Given the nature of her exam, which included tenderness over the \nentire chest wall and entire abdomen, and her historical \ndescription of chest pain that had been present for days without \nchange, we felt that this was highly unlikely to be anginal. She \nrequested oxycodone repeatedly and we thought that she did not \nhave a clear indication. Her pain may have been due to \nmusculoskeletal strain of the intercostal muscles, but this \nwould not explain her diffuse abdominal pain without imaging \ncorrelate. She has a history of recent discontinuation of her \nbuprenorphine opiate abstinence therapy due to high insurance \ncopay. \n\n【24】Overall, we felt that angina was unlikely and that she could \nhave an outpatient stress test safely. We also recommended to \nher that she seek psychiatric therapy for depression treatment, \nwhich appeared to be a major background complaint. She would \nalso benefit from alternative opiate abstinence therapy if there \nare more cost effective options, such as naltrexone.\n\n【25】PROBLEM LIST:\n#Atypical Chest pain\n#Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C\n#History of liver transplant\n#History of opiate addiction\n#Abdominal pain\n#Hypertension\n#Depression\n#Chronic opiate addiction, in remission\n\n【26】MEDICATION CHANGES: none\n\n【27】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[]behavioral health follow up for titration of antidepressants\n[]reinitiation of opiate abstinence therapy\n[]follow up with PCP and liver clinic in ___ weeks\n[]consideration of outpatient stress testing\n\n【28】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

No atrial septal defect is seen \nby 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nnormal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending \naorta to 45 cm distal to the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets \n通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and \nno aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. \nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is moderately dilated. \nIMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Moderately dilated \nascending aorta. Preserved biventricular systolic function\n\n【26】Brief Hospital Course:\nIn brief, this is a ___ year-old man with history of \nhypertension, repaired thoracic aortic dissection with residual \nabdominal aortic dissection, prior atrial fibrillation and \nflutter, and obesity who presents with dyspnea and palpitations.\n\n【27】# Shortness of breath: The most likely etiology for his symptoms \nwas the recurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter. \nInitially, his dyspnea was very concerning for pulmonary emboli, \nin setting of recent immobility and elevated D-dimer. He \nunderwent iodinated-contrast pretreatment prednisone and \nBenadryl, and a CTA chest was negative for pulmonary embolus. \nBilateral LENIs were negative for DVT. With these in mind, VTE \nwas excluded. Alternative but unlikely etiologies were pulmonary \ninfection (has cough but not productive and no fever or \nleukocytosis), acute coronary syndrome (lesss likely in the \nabsence of chest pain, and biomarkers remained negative) or \naortic dissection/aneurysm (back pain, but aorta radiologically \nstable on CTA).\n\n【28】# Atrial arrhythmia: In the past, his atrial arrhythmias were \nprecipitated by his cardiac surgery. On this occasion, it is \nunclear what was the precipitant. His TSH was within normal \nlimits. Per patient, he had been in normal sinus since flutter \nablation in ___. ECGs in our system did not contradict this.  \nHe underwent repeat atrial flutter ablation after a \ntransesophageal echocardiogram showed no atrial clot and \nremained in NSR subsequently. We discussed with vascular surgery \nregarding the risks of anticoagulation, and the decision was \nmade to start him on warfarin with heparin/enoxoparin bridge. We \nrecommend long term anticoagulation given a CHADS score of 3, \nunless otherwise indicated given his abdominal vascular disease. \nHis dual beta-blocker regimen was simplified to metoprolol \nsuccinate only.\n\n【29】# Anomalous coronary arteries: His coronary CTA from ___ \nwas reviewed and his case discussed amongst the cardiac surgeons \nand interventional cardiologists. The patient reported no \nlimitations to physical activity, exercising ___ times weekly \nfor 50 minutes on a treadmill at ___ mph with estimated heart \nrate 115-123 bpm, all without chest pain or dyspnea. He did \nreport profound diaphoresis after hiking for 30 minutes, \nespecially with inclines. Although autopsy studies have \nsuggested an increase prevalence of interarterial coronary \nartery anomalies (where a major vessel runs between the \npulmonary artery and aorta) amongst individuals who die \nsuddenly, the exact increase in risk cannot be quantitated as \nthe denominator at risk is unknown. As Mr. ___ has survived \nwith his coronary artery anomaly (only the LAD proper runs \nbetween the PA and aorta; the anomalous circumflex runs \nposteriorly, and the LMCA 通用删除8(英):<u>[not seen on coronary angiography]</u> \nsupplies a diagonal and a ramus branch), the risks of \nprophylactic surgical revascularization (with increased risk of \ngraft attrition absent any high-grade flow-limiting stenoses) \nwere not felt to outweigh the theoretical benefits. Mr. \n___ abnormal coronary artery anatomy was reviewed with \nhim and the above risk-benefit analysis discussed. It was \nsuggested that he not exercise or hike alone. An outpatient \nnuclear perfusion exercise stress test was ordered to assess for \nobjective evidence of ischemia. He was continued on ASA for \nsecondary prevention, and his statin was changed from lovastatin \n40 mg daily to atorvastatin 40 mg daily for formulary reasons \nand to achieve a lower LDL to minimize progression of CAD given \nhis aberrant anatomy and perhaps higher sheer stress on the LAD.\n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\nB-12 INJECTION monthly\nFOLIC ACID 2.5 mg dailyi\nLABETALOL 100 mg BID\nLISINOPRIL 20 mg daily\nLOVASTATIN 40 mg daily\nTOPROL XL 100 mg daily\nASPIRIN 325 mg daily\n\n【31】Discharge Medications:\n1.

On \n___ he underwent UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB which confirmed \ngastric outlet obstruction with only a small amount of contrast \npassing into the duodenum. Preop testing was performed on ___ \nand he was taken to the operating room on ___ for gastrectomy \nand revision .\n\n【18】Postoperative course:\n\n【19】Neuro: His mental status remained unchanged throughout his \nhospitalization. The Acute Pain Service was consulted for \n___ pain management and a thoracic epidural was placed. The \nepidural was titrated to effect and discontinued on postop day \n#1 and removed on ___ day #2. IV analgesics were also \nadministered prn. The patient was started on PCA on ___ day \n#1 prior to removal of the epidural until, which he reported to \nprovide adequate pain control. He remained on PCA until ___ \nday #11, when it was discontinued and he was administered IV \nanalgesics as needed thereafter, which were eventually changed \nto liquid oxycodone given via the dobhoff. By the day of \ndischarge on ___, he denied any pain and was not requiring \nany narcotic pain medication.\n\n【20】Card: His vital signs were monitored routinely postoperatively. \nOn postop day#1 he was triggered for hypotension with a systolic \nBP in the 70's and his epidural was stopped. During this episode \nthere were no signs if inadequate blood flow, and his blood \npressure quickly recovered to within normal limits after \nstopping the epidural and with the administration of a liter \nfluid bolus. Aside from this one episode of hypotension, he \nremained hemodynamically stable in his postoperative course.\n\n【21】Pulm: Pulmonary toileting and incentive spirometry were \nencouraged. His oxygen saturation was checked with vitals and \nremained within normal limits.\n\n【22】GI: During the operation, Dobbhoff feeding tube was passed \nthrough the stomach and placed through the Roux limb to below \nthe jejunojejunostomy. Initially postoperatively Mr. ___ \nremained NPO with IV fluids for hydration. On ___ day #3 he \nwas started on tube feeds via the dobbhoff. On ___ day #5, \nhe was started on clear liquids and his tube feeds were advanced \nto goal. However, on postop day #6, he became nauseated and \nvomited, and his tube feeds were slowed down. A KUB was \nconcerning for an ileus, and he was started on reglan in an \nattempt to speed up gastric emptying.  On postop day #7, a CT \nABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST was obtained because the patient was \ncontinually nauseated with hiccups and continuing leukocytosis, \nwhich also indicated ileus/possible obstruction, but no \nintra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscess was detected. He was \nstarted on erythromycin in addition to reglan in an attempt to \nspeed up his gastric emptying. On postop day #8, an NG tube was \nplaced to suction and tubefeedings were discontinued. The next \nday on postop day #9, a PICC was placed in his left arm and he \nwas started on TPN. On postop day #11 he was started on \nthorazine for hiccups, which discontinued the following day on \npostop day #12 do the poor tolerance/sedative side effects. On \npostop day #12 a small bowel study with gastrografin was \nperformed which showed no evidence of stricture or obstruction \nwithin the bowel surrounding the jejunojejunal anastomosis. \nTubefeeds were restarted via the dobbhoff at this time. However, \nthat evening the dobbhoff tube accidentally fell out while the \npatient was getting up to the commode. The next day on postop \nday #13, the patient was restarted on sips of clear liquids and \nthe dobbhoff was replaced at bedside and advanced in \ninterventional radiology past the gastrojejunal anastamosis. \nAgain tubefeeds were restarted and slowly advanced to goal by \npostop day #14 and he was started on a clear liquid diet, which \nhe tolerated with no further emesis, and therefore, TPN was \ndiscontinued at this time. On postop day #15 he was advanced to \na full liquid diet. However, he repeatedly became nauseated with \nmultiple episodes of emesis on this diet.  On ___ an abdominal \nCT showed a complete resolution of small bowel dilation and \nfecalization seen on ___ exam. His tube feeds were \ncontinued at goal. At the time of discharge on ___, he was \ntolerating tube feeds at goal at 50 cc/h via the dobhoff and \nremained NPO, with his most recent KUB on ___ showing no \nevidence of obstruction. He was discharged with a scheduled \nupper GI barium swallow study on ___, and further follow up \nin ___ clinic on ___.\n\n【23】GU: A foley catheter was placed during the operation, which \nremained in place for urine output monitoring until postop day \n#4, when it was removed. He voided for the remained of the \nhospitalization without need for any further catheterization. On \npostop day #7, his WBC continued to increase and a u/a and \nculture were sent which came back positive with a the culture \nshowing KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML. For this he \nwas started on a 7 day course of IV ciprofloxacin which was \ncompleted on ___.\n\n【24】Musk: A physical therapy consult was obtained postoperatively to \nevaluate his mobility. He was encouraged to mobilize out of bed \nand ambulate as tolerated throughout his postoperative course. \nBy discharge he was ambulating independently without assistance.\n\n【25】Heme/ID: See GU section for UTI. His electrolytes were monitored \nand repleted as needed throughout his hospitalization. His WBC \ncount was trended to monitor for signs of infection. This \nleukocytosis at 14.9 on postop day #7 and was down to within \nnormal limits at 10.7 on postop day #14. At this time he \nremained afebrile and without any further signs of infection. \nHowever on ___, his WBC count again climbed to 17.4. He \nremained afebrile without any signs of infection at this time. A \nCT scan of his abd/pelvis was performed at this time which \nshowed no evidence of intra-abdominal abscess formation. Blood \nand urine cultures were also obtained at this time. Urine \nculture grew out ENTEROCOCCUS SP 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML, \nhowever, his urine was clear, he remained afebrile, and the \npatient denied any urinary symptoms. His blood cultures are \nstill pending to this date. However, his leukocytosis quickly \nresolved without intervention, with his most recent WBC count at \n7.8 on ___. At the time of discharge on ___, he remains \nafebrile and without any signs of infection. \n\n【26】Prophylaxis: He was started on SC heparin postoperatively for \nDVT prophylaxis. He was also on IV protonix for ulcer \nprophylaxis which was changed to lantoprazole tablets prior to \ndischarge.\n\n【27】On ___ he remained afebrile without any signs of infection, \nwas tolerating tubefeeds at goal, was hemodynamically stable and \nexpressed the desire to return home.

The neuromuscular junction \ntesting was limited by the patient's \nsedation and intubation; however, the limited studies performed \nwere normal. \n\n【48】+CT Torso w/ and w/o contrast\nNo evidence of maligancy\n\n【49】CSF:\n====\nCytology: negative for malignant cells \n\n【50】TUBE 4: \n0 WBC 2 RBC 0 POLY 93 LYMPH\nPROTEIN 17 GLUCOSE ___ year old female with a history of breast cancer, asthma and \nprogressive muscle weakness previously diagnosed as motor \npredominant CIDP who presented with worsening shortness of \nbreath in the setting of a recent flu-like illness for one week: \n\n【51】#respiratory failure likely secondary to neuromuscular weakness\n#progressive weakness\n#presumed motor neuron disease\nShe reported a flu-like illness for one week and then one day of \nshortness of breath. She was intubated on admission due to \nrespiratory distress. Given the acuity of her respiratory \nfailure and history of progressive muscle weakness, there was a \nre-evaluation of her prior diagnosis of motor predominant CIDP. \nEMG was performed, showing ongoing denervation and \nre-innervation of her muscles, possibly consistent with motor \nneuron disease such as ALS. However, her exam was notable for \nLMN signs (fasciculations, no increased tone, generalized \natrophy, absent reflexes in the lower extremities) but no UMN \nsigns. Given this, her prior diagnosis of CIDP was called into \nquestion. Family meeting was held to discuss the new diagnosis \nand the family and patient decided to move towards a trach/peg \nwhich were done on ___.\n\n【52】Given that her exam findings of symmetric and distal>proximal \nweakness with other lower motor neuron findings and long \nprogressive course of her weakness in conjuction with EMG \nfindings suggests a possible motor neuron disease (with PMA \nbeing more likely rather than ALS given LMN; or potentially a \nlater onset SMA) vs. myopathy (however, would expect a more \nproximal weakness) such as inclusion body myositis (which can be \ndistal and proximal weakness; however, fasciculations being \npresent would argue against this as well as normal CK) or a \nmuscular dystrophy variant (however, normal CK) vs. motor \nneuropathy such as hereditary motor neuropathy or immune \nmediated motor neuropathy. \n\n【53】Notably, she does have possible family history of progressive \nweakness in her mother and one of her maternal aunts; however, \nthey lived into their ___ but seemed to have weakness (one aunt \nalways was sitting and her mother seemed to \"furniture walk\" and \nhad trouble with stairs). However, there was no formal diagnosis \nof a neurologic/muscular disease process. She also has family \nhistory of cancer (breast cancer in patient, overian cancer in \nsister, lung cancer in brother).\n\n【54】For additional work-up of her progressive weakness, CT torso was \ndone which did not show evidence of underlying maligancy. LP was \nattempted to see if inflammatory cells were present in CSF which \nwould be more consistent with CIDP; however, given her anatomy, \nthis was not possible at the bedside. LP was performed by ___ \nwhich showed 0 WBC, 2 RBCs, 17 protein. Serum/CSF paraneoplastic \npanel as well as GM1 (immune mediated motor neuropathy) pending \nat the time of discharge. Cytosolic 5' nucleotidase (sporadic \ninclusion body myositis) was normal. Given a prior history of \nMGUS, SPEP pending at the time of discharge. UPEP was negative. \n\n【55】She will need follow-up with nueormuscular as outpatient for \ngenetic testing for ___ Tooth, SMA, ___ and \nlikely deltoid muscle biopsy/sural nerve biopsy. She did report \na history of prior biopsy of the quadriceps and sural nerve at \n___ in ___. These records were \nrequested but never received. Additionally, depending on \netiology, there will be consideration of riluzole therapy as \noutpatient. \n\n【56】#Moraxella VAP\nShe developed fever, leukocytosis, infiltrate on CXR. Sputum \nwith thick brown secretions. Bronchoscopy performed. BAL grew \nMoraxella catarrhalis, started on Bactrim DS and completed 7 day \ncourse with symptomatic improvement.\n\n【57】#Shingles \nRash noted on buttock consisted with Shingles. Started on \nvalcyclovir 1000 mg Q8H 7 days course (started ___. Continue \nthrough ___.\n\n【58】#Elevated PTT - PTT was noted to be elevated due to SQH ppx at \n5000 units, so it was decreased to 2500 units, with no further \nelevated PTT's noted. Continue to administer subq heparin if \ncontinues to be with limited mobility. \n\n【59】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n====================\n[] Per neuromuscular team: follow-up with nueormuscular as \noutpatient for genetic testing for ___ Tooth, SMA, \n___ and likely deltoid muscle biopsy/sural nerve biopsy.\n[] Follow-up records from ___ \non prior muscle and nerve biopsy. ___ need to request these \nagain. \n[] Follow-up serum/CSF paraneoplastic panel as well as GM1 \n(immune mediated motor neuropathy) and SPEP which were pending \nat time of discharge.\n[] Started on valcyclovir 1000 mg Q8H 7 days course (started \n___ for Shingles.

Normal filling of the gallbladder with normal \ntransit to the GI tract.  2. Mild persistent blood pool is \nsuggestive of hepatic dysfunction, and compatible with abnormal \nLFTs. \n\n【21】CT abd ___.  Free intraperitoneal air likely represents perforation from \na duodenal ulcer; recommend endoscopy.  \n2. Evidence of diffuse hepatosteatosis with apparent areas of a \nnodular \nhepatic contour and early recanalization of the paraumbilical \nvein. Overall findings are suspicious for cirrhosis and early \nportal hypertension. Recommend correlation with liver function \ntests and nonemergent liver biopsy. Gallbladder wall edema may \nbe secondary to hepatic dysfunction. \n3. Subtle, peripheral wedge-shaped areas of hypodensity within \nboth kidneys raise the possibility of small \nischemic/inflammatory abnormalities which may be seen in the \nsetting of certain medications, vasculitis or disseminated \ninfection.  \n4. Gallbladder abnormality seen on US is not seen on CT and \ntherefore very unlikely to be a mass. \n5.  Compression deformity of L1 vertebral body is of \nindeterminate chronicity. \n\n【22】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ with hx alcoholism, untreated HTN admitted for alcohol \nwithdrawal, duodenal perforation, and new diagnosis cirrhosis.\n\n【23】# Alcohol- admitted for withdrawal, initially to ICU.  Managed \non IV ativan. Psychiatry consulted. Recommended Ativan taper \nwhich patient finished uneventfully on ___.\nHe appears motivated to achieve sobriety immediately.  He met \nwith social work. The patient is afraid that more alcohol will \ncause serious illness again. He is scared of temptation, and of \nhaving lack of structure in his day.  He plans to attend AA \nmeetings, and states his girlfriend has already removed all \nalcohol from his residence.\n\n【24】# Duodenal perforation- seen on CT abdomen with evidence of free \nair. Probably from a perforated ulcer in setting of alcohol and \nNSAID use. H pylori serology negative. Surgery was consulted, \npatient did not require any operative intervention. Endoscopy \nalso not done given danger of further worsening things. Was \ntreated with antibiotics. Recommend continuing cipro/flagyl for \ntotal 10 days, started ___, end date ___. He was also \nplaced on IV PPI drip transitioned to oral twice daily PPI. He \nshould continue this and have an EGD in ~8 wks to document \nhealing.\n\n【25】# Liver disease- transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia along with \nthrombocytopenia. Possibly component of alcoholi hepatitis. \nImaging was negative for acute cholecystitis (equivocal US but \nnegative HIDA). His LFTs downtrended on their own; however, CT \nabdomen indicated cirrhosis which is a new diagnosis for the \npatient. Most likely due to alcohol. An MRCP was considered to \nlook for other causes, but it was then decided this is not an \nurgent study and the LFTs were more attributable to \ncirrhosis/alcohol. He will follow up with liver clinic for \nongoing management. The EGD recommended above should also assess \nfor presence of varices.\n\n【26】# Macrocytosis- probably due to alcohol and/or cirrhosis. B12 \nand folate normal.\n\n【27】# HTN- reported hx of untreated elevated BP. Was elevated here \nintermittently but not to point of starting inpatient \nmanagement.

On admission he was \nhypotensive, likely due to peripheral vasodilation in the \ncontext of sepsis and capillary leak.  The patient was bolused \nand developed massive lower extremity edema and crackles over \nboth lung fields with pulmonary edema seen on chest radiograph.  \nHe was diuresed successfully in the MICU and later on the floor. \n He was initially treated with oral lasix and later with lasix \ngtt, which he tolerated well. However he remains fluid \noverloaded on exam with pitting edema up to his sacrum. He was \nalready on 12mg of lasix and we added Melolazone 2.5mg to his \ncurrent regimen. He has responded well and has remained \nhemodynamically stable. His BP at baseline in the ___ \nwhich is thought to be due to his critical AS. Of note, the \npatient is not on beta blocker or ACEi due to low blood \npressure.\n- cont on lasix drip at 12mg/hour (please titrate to UO \n>100cc/hour) as BP tolerates\n- Monitor electrolytes and creatine BID while pt is on lasix \ndrip (last checked this ___. He was given 20mEq of Kcl PO). \nPlease keep K> 4 and Mg >2\n- I would switch back to oral Lasix 40 mg BID (or higher \ndepending on how pt responds) once sacral and thigh edema has \nimproved\n- Cont on Metolazone 2.5mg BID as pt tolerates\n- He has appointment with cardiologist in early ___, but trying \nto schedule earlier appointment within ___ weeks\n\n【21】2) Sepsis:  On presentation patient noted to be hypotensive with \nSBP in the ___ and febrile in the ED with rigors and marked \nleukocytosis.  Pt had positive UA and urine culture positive for \npansensitive E.coli.  Patient received vancomycin and \npiperacillin/tazobactam in the ED for presumed infection with \npulmonary source (given marked hypoxia).  On final read of \ninitial chest radiograph and MICU review pulmonary infection was \nfelt less likely. He was then treated for an UTI and antibiotic \nwas switched to Cipro which he had the last dose this evening. \nPt's BP improved to low 100s after three liters of IV fluid.  \nSeptic physiology improved thereafter and patient remained \nafebrile and with falling WBC count.  Further minor hypotension \n(SBP's in ___ which is his baseline). He is currently \nhemodynamically stable. \n\n【22】.\n3) COPD: The patient has a history of COPD diagnosed in the \n___.  However, his PFT in ___ showed FEV1/FVC at 121%.  \nDuring much of his hospitalization, crackles and signs of volume \noverload predominated suggesting pulmonary edema, NOT COPD \nexacerbation was the primary driver of his hypoxemia.  He was \ntreated with duoneb prn.\n4) ARF: Patient baseline creatinine is 0.9-1.0. This was \nelevated at 1.3 on admission but quickly improved and stabilized \nnear 1.2.  \n.\n5) Pneumonia: On presentation radiographs with no clear \ninfiltrate and patient had no signs or symptoms of pneumonia so \nthis was not thought a causative factor of his illness.  Pt had \nrespiratory distress multiple times in the setting of volume \noverload.  Pneumonia was on the differential several times, and \npt was empirically covered with levofloxacin and vanco/zosyn at \ntimes.  However, his response to diuresis is consistent with \npulmonary edema.  Pt remained afebrile and no leukocytosis and \nnot on treatment for pneumonia at the time of discharge.\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n# H/o CAD/HTN/HLD: On admission patient had elevated trop EKG \nwithout significant changes felt to be reflective of demand \nischemia. Troponin was noted to trend downward.  He was \ncontinued on his home paravastatin and aspirin.  \n.\n# Anticoagulation: Patient was on warfarin at presentation.  The \nindication was somewhat unclear.  Per record, coumadin was \nstarted during his hip surgery in ___.  He had remote \nhistory of DVT/PE in the setting of hip surgery. After patient \nleft MICU attending hospitalist discussed this with attending \nphysician at ___ who was also unable to declare \nexact reason, simply reporting patient was on this medicine at \ntransition to long term care.  By ___ records patient appears \nto have been started on recent period of anticoagulation in \n___ of this year for prophylaxis after he sustained a hip \nfracture.  Given patient remains largely immobile and has a \nhistory of venous thromboembolism with no history of bleeding \ncomplications it seems reasonable to continue anticoagulation \nfor now with a low threshold to stop for problems. His current \nINR is 1.3 (he was supratherapeutic on ___ and coumadin was \nheld. He was also given one dose of Vit K in the ICU last week). \nContinue to monitor INR and titrate as needed \n.\n# T2DM- He was continued on insulin sliding scale while \nadmitted. \n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter/HCP)\n# Communication: Patient, daughter ___ ___ home, \n___ cell\n# MEDICATION CHANGES\n   - START lasix gtt \n   - START metalozone 2.5 mg bid \n   - START aspirin 325\n   - START aggressive bowel regimen given critical aortic \nstenosis (Colace 100 mg bid, Senna qd prn, MOM q6 prn, bisacodyl \npo/pr prn)\n# FOLLOW UP PLAN\n   - Recommend lasix gtt as pt has sacral and ___ pitting edema, \nlikely ___ liter positive.

Hypoxia:  \nPatient admitted with reported home oxygen saturation of \nmid-80s. Home measurement could have been accurate; however, \npatient's oxygen saturation at presentation to ED was at his \nbaseline of 94%. Denies any chest pain, dyspnea, fever, chills. \nPatient had a cough for 4 days that was non-productive and was \nresolved at time of admission. This led us to believe that his \npresentation of hypoxia and dyspnea could have been attributed \nto a post-URI bronchitis. He had a leukocytosis of 11.1 upon \narrival, but no bands and this appears to be his baseline white \ncount through the past year. Patient was asymptomatic and had \nhis baseline oxygen sat of 94% in ED and upon arrival to the \nfloor. Levofloxacin started in ED, but not indicated in this \npatient. We discontinued his levofloxacin immediately after \narrival to the floor. Overnight the night of admission, the \npatient had an oxygen saturation in the low ___. He required \nsupplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. He then experienced some dyspnea \nthe morning of discharge; however, this resolved with albuterol \nnebulizer. He was ambulated following combivent administration \nand was able to maintain his oxygen saturation at his baseline \nof 94%. For this reason, patient was discharged on Advair and \ncombivent.
