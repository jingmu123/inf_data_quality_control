There is no definite evidence of an aneurysm, although  删除换行1 given the artifact described above, sensitivity is decreased.\n2. Mucosal sinus disease of the sphenoid sinuses.\n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\n1. Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis: \nThe patient's symptoms of epigastric pain radiating to the back,  删除换行1 nausea/vomitting, and steatorrhea are consistent with an acute  删除换行1 episode of pancreatitis.  Although his lipase was not elevated \n通用删除7(英):<u>(19)</u>, his lipase was not elevated during prior attacks of  删除换行1 pancreatitis. Per the patient has had 4 hospitalizations for  删除换行1 pancreatitis this year.  He also reports that the presumed  删除换行1 etiology of his pancreatitis is due to hypertriglyceridemia.  On  删除换行1 presentation his triglyceride level was 4860.  He denied EtOH  删除换行4 use and avoids fat in his diet. Patient stated that he was  删除换行1 supposed to have MRCP (w secretin stimulation) two weeks PTA,  删除换行1 but they were unable to get IV access, so study was not done. \nThe patient's Ransons criteria score was 0, which placed him at  删除换行1 a <5% mortality risk.  Initially, his pain and nausea was  删除换行1 severe.  His pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid initially,  删除换行1 then he was transitioned to PO Dilaudid with IV for  删除换行1 breakthrough.  His nausea was well controlled with Zofran and  删除换行4 Phenergan.  Additionally, he was given IVF until he was able to  删除换行1 tolerate taking in food by mouth.  He received an abdominal  删除换行1 ultrasound to rule out any potential post-pancreatitis  删除换行1 pseudocysts.  The study was limited due to body habitus, the  删除换行1 head and neck of the pancreas appeared normal. To lower his  删除换行1 triglycerides, the patient's fish oil was doubled.  At  删除换行1 discharge, the patient was tolerated a regular diet without pain  删除换行1 and his triglyderides were 1073.  He was discharged with 10 days  删除换行1 of PO Dilaudid and instructions to follow-up with his PCP for  删除换行1 further pain management. Recommend outpatient attempt at  删除换行1 secretin stimulation MRCP to evaluated pancreas function and  删除换行1 potential duct obstruction.\n\n【18】2. Malignant Hypertension: \nThe patient was hypertensive (BP:212/118) on admission due to  删除换行1 missed morning medications and pain, and then systolic blood  删除换行1 pressure remained in the 160's-170's.  He later had an episode  删除换行1 of hypertensive emergency with BP of 204/106, headache and  删除换行1 blurred vision that began in the RIGHT eye then affected the  删除换行4 LEFT eye.  This was most likely due to difficulty controlling  删除换行1 his pain with the IV Dilaudid.  The patient was given IV  删除换行4 hydralazine and two doses of IV labetalol with subsequent  删除换行1 decrease in SBP to the 170's.  He also had a stat head CT which  删除换行1 showed no acute intercranial changes, and a subsequent head MRI  删除换行4 that was limited due to movement but showed no evidence of an  删除换行1 aneurysm or any acute intracranial process.  \n\n【19】Following the hypertensive emergency, the patient complained of  删除换行1 persistent R eye blurriness and R sided clumsiness.  The patient  删除换行1 was evaluated by ophthalmology and no evidence of papilledema or  删除换行1 hemorrhages were found on fundoscopic exam; he was found to have  删除换行1 constricted RIGHT eye visual field, and RIGHT eye visual acuity  删除换行1 to counting fingers.  And he recommended to follow-up with  删除换行1 ophthalmology as an outpatient.  Additionally, he was evaluated  删除换行1 by neurology who found similar constricted visual field and  删除换行1 blurriness in the RIGHT eye and giveway weakness on the R side  删除换行1 with inability to complete tandem gait.  However, there were no  删除换行1 localizing deficits on exam.  They agreed with the MRI and  删除换行1 recommended patient follow-up with ophthalmology.  In order to  删除换行1 obtain better medical management of his blood pressure his  删除换行1 valsartan was increased to 160mg BID and lasix 20mg BID.  His  删除换行1 systolic blood pressures remained in the 150s for the remainder  删除换行1 of his hospitalization.  Recommend close follow-up with his PCP  删除换行4 to obtain better blood pressure control and follow-up with  删除换行1 ophthalmology for his persistent RIGHT eye blurriness.\n\n【20】3. Proteinuria: \nA urinalysis was performed to determined if there was damage to  删除换行1 his kidney during the hypertensive emergency.  His UA was  删除换行1 notable for a protein/creatinine of 9.5, which was within the  删除换行1 nephrotic range.  Upon inspection of his urine sediment, fatty  删除换行1 casts and oval fat bodies were found, also consistent with  删除换行1 nephrotic syndrome.  Nephrology was consulted and reported that  删除换行1 his proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome was most likely secondary to  删除换行1 focal segmental glomerulonephropathy secondary to his  删除换行1 obesity/hypertension or diabetic nephropathy.  Their  删除换行1 differential included membranous glomerulonephropathy and also  删除换行1 adrenal disease.  Nephrology recommended good diabetes control,  删除换行1 possibly starting metformin in addition to his insulin regimen,  删除换行1 controlling blood pressure by starting Lasix 20mg BID, and  删除换行1 follow-up with Nephrology following discharge.  It was also  删除换行1 discovered that the patient has been taking ___ tablets of  删除换行4 NSAIDs daily, which could also be contributing to his  删除换行1 proteinuria.  He was counseled on the importance of stopping his  删除换行4 NSAID use. Recommend follow-up with Dr. ___,  删除换行5 Nephrology, following discharge to further manage his  删除换行1 proteinuria and following up with his endocrinologist at ___.\n\n【21】4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, uncontrolled and with  删除换行1 complications: \nThe patient is very insulin resistant and required high doses of  删除换行4 NPH twice daily and QAC Humalog and sliding scale Humalog.  He  删除换行1 was placed on half of his home dose NPH and a sliding scale  删除换行1 while he was NPO.  His blood sugars were initially low in the  删除换行1 90's to low 100's and he received a liter of ___.  At  删除换行1 discharge his blood glucose was in the mid ___. Recommend close  删除换行1 follow-up with ___ and possibly add Metformin to his regimen.\n\n【22】5. Hydradenitis suppuritiva: \nThe patient has chronic foul-smelling, erythematous, draining  删除换行1 nodules with fistulas in his RLQ beneath his pannus.  He was  删除换行1 recently treated with a course of Augmentin without effect.  \nAdditionally, prior antibiotic regimens have been minimally  删除换行1 effective in alleviated his symptoms.  It is likely that the  删除换行1 best treatment would be surgical excision of the affected area.  \nThe patient was treated with topical Hibiclens 4% BID per his  删除换行1 home regimen.\n\n【23】6. Hypertriglyceridemia: \nPatient presented with triglyceride in the 4000s and it was  删除换行1 difficult to discern if this was the cause or result of his  删除换行1 pancreatitis.  He was continued on his home regimen of statin,  删除换行1 niacin, and fibrate. His omega-3 fatty acids dose was doubled.  \nAlthough we considered increasing his niacin, there was concern  删除换行1 that this would worsen his nausea.  His triglycerides  删除换行1 downtrended to the 1000's by the time of discharge.\n\n【24】7. Diarrhea: \nThe patient reports chronic foul-smelling, fatty diarrhea with  删除换行8 ___ bowel movements per day.  However, he reported that his  删除换行1 bowel movements worsened during this episode of pancreatitis.  \nAlso, given that he was recently treated with Augmentin, the  删除换行1 patient was tested for C. difficile which returned negative.  It  删除换行1 was concerning that his diarrhea persisted despite being NPO,  删除换行1 which indicated that pancreatic insufficiency was not the sole  删除换行1 cause of his diarrhea.  Therefore, recommend close follow-up  删除换行1 with PCP and ___ as an outpatient.\n\n【25】8. Fatty infiltration of Liver: \nThe patient underwent an ultrasound to evaluate his pancreas  删除换行1 which showed fatty infiltration of the liver.  In patient with  删除换行1 hypertriglyceridemia there is concern for non-alcoholic hepatic  删除换行1 steatosis.  Recommend outpatient ___ of liver abnormality  删除换行1 with a liver MRI.\n\n【26】Medications on Admission:\n1. Amlodipine 10 mg daily\n2. Cyanocobalamin 100 mcg daily\n3.

Postsurgical changes involving the right lung again noted  删除换行1 with extensive scarring appearing grossly stable from prior. \nHowever, on the left, there is subtle increase in overall  删除换行1 bronchovascular opacity which could represent an atypical  删除换行1 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. A tiny left effusion  删除换行1 is likely new in the interval. No pneumothorax. Overall  删除换行1 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.\nIMPRESSION: \nStable postop changes in the right chest. Subtle increase in  删除换行1 left bronchovascular markings which could in the correct  删除换行1 clinical setting reflecting an atypical pneumonia.\n\n【18】CT chest ___:\n  The most significant change since ___ has been the  删除换行1 marked progression of what was previously minimal and scattered  删除换行1 ground-glass opacification, now involving most of the left lung,  删除换行1 and large areas of the right lower lobe. Also new is  删除换行1 consolidation at the posterior periphery of the left lower lobe  删除换行1 from the superior segment to the lung base. The wide  删除换行1 distribution of this abnormality in the setting of hemoptysis  删除换行1 suggests a bleeding diathesis, such as chemo toxicity, excessive  删除换行1 anti coagulation, or thrombocytopenia. Concurrent pneumonia is  删除换行1 not excluded, but is less likely.\n  There has been a slight the increase in the ___ of the  删除换行1 conglomerate of treated tumor and atelectatic lung in the right  删除换行1 paramediastinal lung, more likely due to greater atelectasis,  删除换行1 but making it it impossible to exclude local recurrence at both  删除换行1 the upper and lower poles of the right hilus.\n  Thickened pleura at the right apex is stable and there is no  删除换行1 bone destruction to suggest local tumor recurrence in this  删除换行1 location. Moderate volume of right pleural fluid in the lower  删除换行1 hemi thorax is stable, pleural calcification suggesting prior  删除换行1 pleurodesis.\n  Adenopathy throughout the right paratracheal region is stable. \nThere is no new adenopathy centrally. Deformity and narrowing of  删除换行1 the superior segmental bronchus of the right lower lobe is  删除换行1 stable.

Severe cardiomegaly, predominantly biatrial, is chronic. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta and  删除换行1 pulmonary arteries are normal caliber. There are no bone lesions  删除换行1 in the chest cage suspicious for malignancy.\nIMPRESSION: \n  Generalized alveolar opacification, sparing on the right upper  删除换行1 lung, is either entirely new or significant progression since ___ most likely diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. \nDifferential diagnosis discussed above.\n  Possible local tumor recurrence, juxta hilar right lung,  删除换行1 difficult to excavatum distinguish from worsening atelectasis  删除换行1 following T more radiation. \n  Increased small left pleural effusion.

Color-flow  删除换行1 imaging of the interatrial septum (clips 57,58) raises the  删除换行1 suspicion of a secundum atrial septal defect, but this could not  删除换行1 be confirmed on the basis of this study. There is mild symmetric  删除换行1 left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and  删除换行1 regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left  删除换行1 ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the  删除换行1 severity of mitral regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index  删除换行1 is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is  删除换行1 moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. \n[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more  删除换行1 depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There  删除换行1 is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with  删除换行1 right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)  删除换行1 are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild  删除换行1 (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve  删除换行1 prosthesis is present. The leaflets may be thickened, but no  删除换行1 discrete vegetation is seen. The gradients are higher than  删除换行1 expected for this type of prosthesis. Moderate to severe (3+)  删除换行1 mitral regurgitation is seen (clips ___. The tricuspid valve  删除换行1 leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid  删除换行1 regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery  删除换行1 systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to  删除换行1 severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery  删除换行1 systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right  删除换行1 atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Well seated mitral bioprosthesis with increased  删除换行1 gradient and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Right  删除换行1 ventricular cavity dilation with preserved free wall motion. \nNormal left ventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic  删除换行1 function. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,  删除换行1 the gradient across the mitral valve and the severity of mitral  删除换行1 regurgitation are increased. The right ventricular cavity is  删除换行1 more dilated and the estimated PA systolic pressure is higher. \n\n【20】CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___ 8:58 AM 删除换行15 The right PICC terminates in the mid to lower SVC.

She was transferred to the ___ ICU for  删除换行1 hypoxemia on the floor with oyxgen desaturation to the low ___  删除换行8 and increasing O2 requirement and then transferred to the  删除换行1 cardiology service for further management of her acute on  删除换行1 chronic left ventricular diastolic heart failure.\nAcute Issues:\n# Hypoxemia/respiratory distress, secondary to acute on chronic  删除换行1 diastolic CHF: CXR was initially suggestive of ? pneumonia,  删除换行1 especially in the clinical setting of worsening cough and  删除换行1 shaking chills; blood and urine cultures were obtained, and  删除换行1 vancomycin and cefepime were started for presumed HCAP. Due to  删除换行1 acute desaturation on the floor as above, the patient was  删除换行1 transferred to the F-ICU on ___. The patient's exam was notable  删除换行1 for temperatures in the ___ and coarse crackles in lower lung  删除换行1 fields. CXR demonstrated interval increase in patchy  删除换行1 interstitial infiltrates; NT-pro-BNP was 4531, but 2 negative  删除换行1 troponin-T values. The patient was given furosemide 40 mg IV  删除换行4 with brisk diuresis and improvement in symptoms, and the  删除换行1 antibiotics were discontinued. Echocardiogram showed interval  删除换行1 worsening of her pulmonary hypertension, moderate to severe  删除换行1 mitral regurgitation, and increased pressure gradient across the  删除换行1 mitral valve suggesting prosthetic mitral stenosis as well,  删除换行1 leading to concern for decompensated diastolic CHF as a cause of  删除换行1 her pulmonary edema and resulting dyspnea with increased O2  删除换行1 requirements. Her O2 saturation improved with the diuresis,  删除换行1 however she was unable to be weaned off the oxygen without  删除换行1 associated symptoms of dyspnea and general malaise, nor without  删除换行1 inducing increased occurrence of ectopic beats on telemetry . Patient was eventually  删除换行1 weaned off of oxygen and was transferred out of the ICU to  删除换行1 cardiology for CHF management. Patient was continued on IV  删除换行4 diuresis (furosemide 40 mg IV) for 1.5 days and then  删除换行1 transitioned to furosemide 40 mg PO daily (home dose 20 mg po  删除换行1 daily). Patient was easily weaned to RA on transfer and looked  删除换行1 clinically well. She was put on lisinopril for afterload  删除换行1 reduction in the ICU and this was continued on transfer to  删除换行1 cardiology.\n\n【23】# Arrhythmias: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, atrial  删除换行1 fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation,  删除换行1 with rate and rhythm control at home with amiodarone and  删除换行1 metoprolol, with dabigatran for anticoagulation, which was held  删除换行1 in the setting of CT chest concerning for alveolar hemorrhage. \nShe had no evidence of frank hemoptysis, and per patient at  删除换行1 baseline she has intermittent productive cough with blood tinged  删除换行1 sputum, likely a result of airway friability and irritation from  删除换行1 her radiation therapy. Her cardiac myonecrosis biomarkers were  删除换行1 negative. Her EKG wide complex rhythms concerning for SVT with  删除换行1 aberrancy vs. runs of ventricular tachycardia and multiple runs  删除换行1 of ectopic beats thought to be of atrial origin, but unclear  删除换行1 exact trigger, though appears to be exacerbated by O2  删除换行1 saturations less than 95%. Cardiology was consulted to help  删除换行1 optimize her cardiac function. and she was ultimately  删除换行1 transferred to the cardiology service for further management. \nHer metoprolol was stopped due to low SBPs and the arrhythmia  删除换行1 was thought by the cardiology attending to be more likely runs  删除换行1 of ventricular tachycardia rather than SVT with abberancy. Her  删除换行1 home dose of amiodarone 200 mg daily was increased to amiodarone  删除换行1 200 mg BID for total of 1 wk. Her arrhythmias improved and HR  删除换行4 remained in the ___ - 80s on this regimen. She was discharged on  删除换行1 the standing dose of Magnesium and amiodarone 200 mg PO BID x 1  删除换行1 week (___), then instructed to resume her home dose of  删除换行1 amiodarone 200 mg daily thereafter.\n\n【24】# Hyponatremia: Initially [Na] downtrended during her hospital  删除换行1 stay to 125, with later improvement to the 130s. Most likely  删除换行1 hypervolemic hyponatremia from her decompensated diastolic heart  删除换行1 failure, as her hyponatremia resolved with diuresis.\n\n【25】Chronic Issues:\n# Normocytic Anemia: Her hematocrit remained stably low during  删除换行1 her admission. Likely a mixed etiology, with increased RDW and  删除换行1 reticulocyte count greater than 2% suggesting appropriate bone  删除换行1 marrow reaction. Likely anemia of chronic disease given advanced  删除换行1 cancer and iron studies supporting this etiology, likely with  删除换行1 initially elevated serum iron from her recent blood transfusion  删除换行1 early in her admission\n\n【26】# Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: She is on palliative pemetrexed. \nShe has already had radiation to the right lung.

No  删除换行1 biliary duct dilation. \n\n【19】EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG  删除换行4 monitoring study because of abundant multifocal independent  删除换行1 epileptiform discharges (right frontal, vertex/central, and  删除换行1 bilateral posterior quadrants) that also occur in a generalized  删除换行1 or bifrontal distribution indicative of multifocal independent  删除换行1 potentially epileptogenic foci throughout both hemispheres. \nThese may occasionally become periodic at ___ Hz but do not  删除换行1 evolve into electrographic seizures. There are frequent bursts  删除换行1 of semi-rhythmic focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant  删除换行1 indicative of moderate-severe focal subcortical dysfunction in  删除换行1 this region. There is disorganization and diffuse background  删除换行1 slowing indicative of a moderate-severe encephalopathy which is  删除换行1 non-specific in etiology. There are frequent bursts of  删除换行1 generalized intermittent rhythmic delta activity (GIRDA) and 14  删除换行4 Hz positive spikes which can be suggestive of a toxic or  删除换行1 metabolic encephalopathy, particularly hepatic encephalopathy. \nThe frequent bursts of generalized theta activity may be related  删除换行1 to sedative medications, such as benzodiazepines. \n\n【20】MRI head w/wo contrast ___: \n1.

Few foci of T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the  删除换行1 periventricular white matter with small additional foci of  删除换行1 hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter of the  删除换行1 frontal lobes.  While this is nonspecific, it could represent  删除换行1 early small vessel chronic ischemic disease. \n3.  Numerous small bilateral foci of susceptibility, suggestive  删除换行1 of chronic micro hemorrhagic changes. \n\n【21】EEG ___:\nThis is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because  删除换行1 of very rare epileptiform discharges in the right frontocentral  删除换行1 region, indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this  删除换行1 region. There is mild disorganization and diffuse slowing of the  删除换行1 background with frequent bursts of generalized intermittent  删除换行1 rhythmic delta activity (GIRDA), consistent with a mild diffuse  删除换行1 encephalopathy, which is nonspecific in etiology. Compared to  删除换行1 the previous day, these findings are consistent with an  删除换行1 improving toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. There are no  删除换行1 electrographic seizures. \n\n【22】CXR (portable) ___:\nStatus post extubation and removal of enteric tube. \nRight para cardiac and left retrocardiac opacities compatible  删除换行1 with atelectasis and/or developing pneumonia. \n\n【23】EEG ___: \nThis is an abnormal routine EEG, predominantly recorded in the  删除换行1 drowsy state, due to the presence of occasional focal slowing in  删除换行1 the right posterior quadrant and mild diffuse background  删除换行1 slowing. These findings indicate focal subcortical dysfunction  删除换行1 in the right posterior quadrant and a mild diffuse  删除换行1 encephalopathy which implies widespread cerebral dysfunction but  删除换行1 is non-specific as to etiology. There are no epileptiform  删除换行1 discharges or electrographic seizures.\n\n【24】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ yo F PMHx Depression, Chronic Pain, and multiple abdominal  删除换行1 surgeries presents after being found down status-post  删除换行1 polysubstance overdose requiring intubation for altered mental  删除换行1 status. \n\n【25】# POLYSUBSTANCE OVERDOSE/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient has  删除换行1 medication list significant for respiratory depressants,  删除换行1 sedatives, serotonergic agents, anticholinergic agents, and  删除换行1 anti-alpha2 medications.

Toxicology screen positive for  删除换行1 benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, and opioids. Toxicology screen  删除换行1 negative for APAP, EtOH, and salicylates but unclear history. \nAfter several days pt became more alert and her altered mental  删除换行1 status improved. Pt was closely followed and at the time of  删除换行1 admission to the floor pt had recovered most of her mentation  删除换行1 with symmetric residual weakness in her distal ___. EEG's were  删除换行1 negative for seizure activity. Psychiatry was consulted who felt  删除换行1 that this was an unintentional overdose. On the floor the  删除换行1 patient's mental status continued to improve despite some waxing  删除换行1 and waning. She underwent an additional infectious work up which  删除换行1 was negative. She was also started on  删除换行1 thiamine/folate/B12/multivitamins given concern for nutritional  删除换行1 deficincies as she is s/p roux-en-y gastric bypass.

She was  删除换行1 maintained on venlafaxine while hospitalized once she was able  删除换行1 to take PO's.  Her diazepam was discontinued given concerns over  删除换行1 sedating effects.  This was communicated to her outpatient  删除换行1 psychiatrist Dr. ___.  \n\n【30】# ABNORMAL LFTS: Patient presented with elevated transaminases  删除换行4 ALT ___ and AST 4153 and INR 2.4; likely reflective of  删除换行1 multiorgan failure with negative APAP.  Pt was treated  删除换行1 presumptively with N-acetylcysteine, and both toxicology and  删除换行1 hepatology were consulted. Over the course of her ICU stay her  删除换行4 LFT's downtrended, and normalized prior to discharge.  \n\n【31】# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Likely prerenal in setting of volume  删除换行1 depletion versus rhabdo/prerenal-induced ATN, which resolved  删除换行1 over the course of her stay with IVF without need for dialysis. \nPeak Cr 2.2, normalized to 0.5 prior to discharge.\n\n【32】# TYPE II NSTEMI: Patient presented obtunded with elevated  删除换行1 troponin with normal Mb fraction (elevated CK from  删除换行1 rhabdomyolysis) and no ischemic EKG changes or reports of chest  删除换行1 pain or signs of hypervolemia or tachyarrhythmia.

Over course of hospital stay  patient noted to  删除换行1 have subacute decline in respiratory state with tachypnea to the ___ this morning despite diuresis with 20 mg IV Lasix as well as  删除换行1 worsening mental state (per daughter intermittently somnolent  删除换行1 since arrival to ___. ___ but with dysarthria on night of ___  删除换行2 and with decreased ability to follow commands as well as  删除换行1 possible bilateral ___ weakness). MRI brain with and without  删除换行1 contrast was obtained at 8pm on ___ and patient sent to the  删除换行4 MICU AM of ___ for further management. \n\n【24】#Goals of care: Goals of care meeting held on ___ with wife  删除换行1 and daughter. Patient initially unsure how much treatment he  删除换行1 would like to pursue. Plan was to re-evaluate thrombocytopenia,  删除换行1 anemia as markers of disease state and re-discuss goals pending  删除换行1 better understanding of prognosis. Another goals of care  删除换行1 discussion was had on ___ with his outpatient Atrius  删除换行1 oncologist, Dr. ___. It was determined that he  删除换行1 would want to be made comfortable with the remaining time he had  删除换行1 left and he was subsequently made CMO with hospice support on  删除换行8 ___. He died ___ at 1814.\n\n【25】# Altered mental status. There was also concern for CNS lymphoma  删除换行1 or an infectious process based on MRI findings. Per primary  删除换行1 inpatient oncology team, patient had become progressively less  删除换行1 interactive and somnolent over the past 24 hours and had  删除换行1 developed dysarthria in the past 12. During initial evaluation  删除换行1 in the ICU, the team was called by radiology with a wet read of  删除换行4 MRI brain showing evidence of bilateral late acute posterior  删除换行1 circulation emboli as well as diffuse pachymeningeal  删除换行1 enhancement,ventriculits and ?leptomeningeal disease.   A code  删除换行1 stroke was called.  Due to his platelet count of 25, he had  删除换行1 absolute contraindications to tPA or systemic anticoagulation. \nExtensive work-up for the cause of his stroke was completed,  删除换行1 which was non-revealing. Due to his history of atrial  删除换行1 fibrillation, TTE with bubble study was completed which did not  删除换行1 show atrial thrombi. In addition, due to his hypoxia there was  删除换行1 concern for PE and possible paradoxical emboli. causing stroke. However, TTE w/ bubble was also negative for PFO.  Work-up for  删除换行1 risk of atherosclerotic disease was relatively un-revealing (A1c  删除换行2 6.2%, trigs 123, cholesterol 65, HDL 7, LDL 33). Neurology was  删除换行1 consulted who felt he was at high risk for infection or CNS  删除换行4 lymphoma also contributing to his encephalopathy. However, due  删除换行1 to his severe thrombocytopenia requiring multiple platelet  删除换行1 transfusions, LP was deferred. Due to concern for infectious  删除换行1 process of a biliary source causing sepsis and encephalopathy,  删除换行1 he was empirically treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, and  删除换行1 doxycycline.\n\n【26】# CLL with likely Richter transformation. Chemotherapy with  删除换行4 Bretuximab was initially, given rapid decline in multiple organ  删除换行1 systems in this patient with likely Richter transformation to  删除换行4 CD30+ Hodgkin Lymphoma. He was closely monitored for tumor lysis  删除换行1 syndrome. Patient was started on allopurinol prophylactially. \n\n【27】#Febrile neutropenia. Source was unclear but differential  删除换行1 included bacterial vs viral meningitis vs biliary source. Less  删除换行1 likely aortitis vs pulmonary source. Also considered anaplasma  删除换行1 given transamanitis on presentation and positive anaplasma PCR \n(though negative OSH DFA). Patient was treated with vancomycin,  删除换行5 Zosyn, and doxycycline. Blood and urine cultures showed no  删除换行1 growth during hospitalization. Antibiotics were discontinued  删除换行1 once patient was made CMO.  \n\n【28】# Thrombocytopenia: Likely ___ to bone marrow infiltration. \nConcern also for ITP and DIC. Patient was treated with  删除换行1 prednisone which did not improve his platelet count. DIC labs  删除换行1 were not concerning. He was given multiple transfusions of  删除换行1 platelets for platelet counts <10. He had no evidence of active  删除换行1 bleed on exam. \n\n【29】# Anemia:  Likely ___ to bone marrow infiltration. Patient was  删除换行1 transfused for Hgb <7. During a transfusion on ___, he  删除换行1 developed rigors and spiked a fever. The transfusion was stopped  删除换行1 and Coombs test was sent, which later came back negative. Blood  删除换行1 cultures were drawn and Tylenol was given. Patient was given the  删除换行1 rest of the blood transfusion without an event. \n\n【30】# Coagulopathy with INR persistently in 2s, likely a component  删除换行1 of malnutrition given albumin of 2 and no evidence cirrhosis on  删除换行1 recent imaging and LFT abnormality has resolved. DIC was ruled  删除换行1 out with labs. Coags were monitored but not reversed. \n\n【31】# Atrial fibrillation. Patient was continued on metoprolol 12.5  删除换行1 q6 in setting of sepsis. TSH was sent which did not reveal  删除换行1 hyperthyroidism. \n\n【32】# Diabetes mellitus. Patient was well-controlled on SSI.

Additionally, patient is  删除换行1 immunosuppressed given SLE tx. Initially on Vanc/Cefepime for  删除换行1 broad coverage, but stopped on ___ as pt was clinically  删除换行1 stable, no focal infection had revealed itself and blood and  删除换行1 urine cultures had remained negative. Cefepime restarted  删除换行1 overnight on ___ for clinical suspicion of sepsis (despite the  删除换行1 negative cultures) with rising lactate and  hypotension in the  删除换行1 setting of altered mental status. Vanc re-started ___ after  删除换行4 HD, and cefepime was changed to ceftazidime for dosing with HD. \nPt subsequently remained afebrile and HDS on vanc/ceftaz,  删除换行1 lactate normalized, BCx with no growth. Last day of abx was ___  删除换行8 with dialysis. \n# NSTEMI: Patient with significant CAD s/p PCI to LAD and D1 in  删除换行8 ___. Initially on DAPT as an outpatient but this was stopped  删除换行1 given patient's requiring multiple blood transfusions in setting  删除换行1 of multiple GI bleeds. Per OMR, patient preferred the risk of  删除换行1 having an MI to needing such frequent transfusions. Pt had  删除换行1 elevated troponin on presentation, likely demand in setting of  删除换行1 infxn and GIB. She then developed CP at rest similar her to  删除换行1 chronic angina accompanied by ST depressions in inferior and  删除换行1 lateral leads (II, III, and V4-V6) which resolved with 3 doses  删除换行1 of SL nitro. Argatroban drip was started, but then stopped given  删除换行4 GIB . Pt had several episodes of recurrent CP with  删除换行1 worsening of existing ST depression in V4-V5, in the context of  删除换行1 rising troponins and MB. She was given SL nitro and IV dilaudid  删除换行4 PRN with moderate resolution, but ability to give nitrates was  删除换行1 limited by hypotension. Cardiology was consulted and assisted  删除换行1 with management of her cardiac issues. They contacted pt's  删除换行1 outpatient cardiologist and decided to avoid taking her to cath  删除换行1 lab as she is high risk given GIB. With her first episode of  删除换行1 chest pain, the pt was started on an argatroban gtt, but this  删除换行1 was subsequently stopped because the pt developed a GI bleed  删除换行1 . After she was treated for the GIB, the chest pain  删除换行1 recurred, and the argatroban drip was restarted on ___, and  删除换行1 kept on for 48 hours without incident. Her Metoprolol was  删除换行1 changed from 12.5mg Q6H to 6.25 q6 on ___ given hypotension. \nContinued on ASA 81mg daily. Pt was monitored on telemetry. Her  删除换行4 Troponin T peaked at 2.83 on ___, and her MB peaked at 24 on  删除换行8 ___. \n\n【29】#Sustained monomorphic VT: \nAsymptomatic run of sustained, stable VT at a rate of around  删除换行1 140-150/minute on the evening of ___. This was likely related  删除换行1 to her ongoing myocardial ischemia. Pt was on her home PO dose  删除换行1 of amiodarone, but she got an IV amiodarone load overnight  删除换行8 ___, (150 mg push, 1.0 mg/min x 6 hours, 0.5 mg/min). \nShe converted to sinus rhythm overnight, and then had two  删除换行1 shorter runs of VT (also asymptomatic) the following morning. \nAmiodarone (both IV and PO) was subsequently discontinued per  删除换行1 cardiology recommendation because of QTc prolongation. The  删除换行1 patient did not require lidocaine or cardioversion, and had no  删除换行1 further episodes of VT on telemetry.\n\n【30】#Prolonged QTc: QTc was prolonged throughout hospitalization,  删除换行1 >500. Amiodarone was held after initial loading dose, and sodium  删除换行1 thiosulfate was not given at HD ___ or thereafter because of  删除换行1 prolonged QTc. Other QTc-prolonging medications were avoided.\n\n【31】#GIB: Pt has known gastric polyps that are a cause of chronic  删除换行1 upper GI bleeding. These have proven incurable despite multiple  删除换行1 intervention on serial EGD; her bleeding has previously been  删除换行1 severe enough that she was needing a unit of blood QOD and has  删除换行1 required discontinuation of her Plavix earlier in the year. On  删除换行1 this admission, her hemoglobin dropped 2 points overnight after  删除换行1 starting argatroban on ___ with guiac pos stool. She had an  删除换行4 EGD on ___ with epinephrine injection for polyp in antrum. \nAfter her initial bleed, the argatroban drip was stopped. \nHowever, given her ongoing NSTEMI, the argatroban was restarted  删除换行1 on ___ and kept on for 48 hours without further bleeding or  删除换行1 acute hemoglobin drop. She received 1 U PRBC on ___ with  删除换行1 appropriate response. Attempted to transfuse 1 U PRBC on ___  删除换行8 but stopped prematurely because of concern for transfusion  删除换行1 reaction (Temp of 99, hypotension). She was transfused on 1 U PRBC on ___ and ___ at dialysis with no issues (in total  删除换行1 received 4 U PRBC on admission). After her EGD, her hemoglobin  删除换行1 remained stable and her ostomy output did not appear bloody. She  删除换行1 was transfused for a hemoglobin goal of 8 given her ongoing  删除换行1 cardiac ischemia.\n\n【32】#AMS: On ___, pt developed confusion and asterixis, although  删除换行1 she remained AAOx3. This improved after dialysis x 2. \nDifferential included uremia given rising BUN and fact that pt  删除换行1 missed dialysis on ___, acidosis, and infection. Head CT was  删除换行1 wnl. No focal infectious source was identified. Antibiotics were  删除换行1 stopped on ___, and given that the patient's AMS (as well as  删除换行1 hypotension) developed subsequent to stopping antibiotics, they  删除换行1 were restarted on ___ and kept on until ___. On discharge, pt  删除换行1 was at her baseline mental status, AAOx3 with no clinical signs  删除换行1 of uremia.\n\n【33】# Calciphylaxis: Patient with severe pain on two hyperpigmented  删除换行1 lesions on bilateral inner thighs. Per patient, outpatient Derm  删除换行1 was trying to get prior auth for sodium thiosulfate, so at the  删除换行1 time of admission she still had not received any treatments as  删除换行1 an outpatient. For her pain, the patient was initially treated  删除换行1 with PO and IV dilaudid, but both the primary team and the  删除换行1 patient felt that this was contributing to her confusion so it  删除换行1 was discontinued. Tylenol and PRN oxycodone were started with  删除换行1 minimal relief. Morphine was deferred because of renal function. \nPt was started on a fentanyl patch and tramadol on ___, also  删除换行1 with minimal relief. Dermatology was consulted, and recommended  删除换行1 santyl and gauze for skin lesions, as well as discontinuing iron  删除换行1 and Vit D (calciphylaxis risk factors). They also recommended  删除换行1 avoiding warfarin for anticoagulation going forward. IV sodium  删除换行1 thiosulfate was given twice after dialysis, but given pt's  删除换行1 prolonged QTc and episodes of VT, she received no further doses  删除换行1 with dialysis. The patient initially refused intralesional STS  删除换行4 because of her pain, but later agreed to it and received  删除换行1 injections in her thighs on ___. She will follow up with  删除换行1 dermatology as an outpatient. For pain control on discharge, she  删除换行1 was sent to rehab with prescriptions for a fentanyl patch and PO  删除换行4 dilaudid.\n\n【34】# Brisk bleeding from fistula: This was an issue as an  删除换行1 outpatient, and on several different occasions the patient was  删除换行1 scheduled for a fistulogram while in-house to assess for brisk  删除换行1 flow. However, the fistulogram was ultimately deferred given the  删除换行1 patient's other medical issues. On discharge it was scheduled as  删除换行1 an outpatient procedure for ___.\n\n【35】CHRONIC ISSUES:    \n=============== \n# H/o L knee and left shoulder Septic Arthritis: Pt completed a  删除换行1 7 week  删除换行1 course of IV cefazolin as of ___ for the staph lugdunensis  删除换行1 septic arthritis involving LT shoulder and Lt knee.

He was encouraged  删除换行1 to follow up both with ophthamlology as well as a neprhologist  删除换行1 given his proteinuria and renal insufficieny.\n\n【22】# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: His baseline renal  删除换行1 insufficiency appears to be 1.2-1.3 in our system.

This was discussed with his  删除换行1 primary care provider, and ___ consultation as an  删除换行1 outpatient may be considered.

He had a remote  删除换行1 history of metastatic renal cancer to the brain S/P left  删除换行1 nephrectomy, localized resection (craniotomy) and brain  删除换行1 radiation. During his most recent hospitalization at  删除换行8 ___, his serum sodium was 126 on admission, seen by  删除换行1 renal, thought initially to be hypovolemic, then SIADH, rose to  删除换行1 132 and was 129 on discharge. He was noted to have a bladder  删除换行1 wall thickening concerning for tumor, Enterococcus UTI, BPH and  删除换行1 urinary retention s/p foley, and was discharged with antibiotics  删除换行1 (ciprofloxacin), indwelling catheter, and urology follow up for  删除换行1 cystoscopy (___). He was readmitted shortly after this  删除换行1 discharge for lethargy and found to have Na of 125. Once again,  删除换行1 studies consistent with SIADH. We started him on high protein  删除换行1 diet, 1L fluid restriction (esp water), and salt tabs 2g BID per  删除换行1 renal recs. His Na improved to 132 on day of discharge. \nLikewise, his MS was much improved once Na was >127 and remained  删除换行1 stable/improved throughout the rest of hospital stay (>5days  删除换行1 before d/c). although he looks a bit dry on exam, renal DID NOT  删除换行4 want to give fluids as can worsen. They just wanted to increase  删除换行4 Na tabs as above to increase initravasc volume. \nAs for the cause of his SIADH, this was unclear. He onset of  删除换行1 hypoNa did not correlate with spine surgery and infact his pain  删除换行1 was a lot more in ___ whereas the onset was ___ so cannot  删除换行1 be related only to pain. Also cipro (another culprit) was  删除换行1 started after the pt presented to OSH with hypoNa. There was no  删除换行1 nausea. there was no infection/pneumonia.  TSH and cortisol were  删除换行1 okay. He was taken off most of his meds, Taken off narcotics as  删除换行1 well since can worsen SIADH. Got good pain control with tylenol  删除换行1 and lidoderm. In the end, there was concern that this may be  删除换行1 related to a malignancy, recurrent RCC or new, or a  删除换行1 paraneoplastic syndrome. He was noted to have a new elevation of  删除换行1 the Alkaline Phosphatase, which can be seen in 21% percent of  删除换行1 patients with RCC as a paraneoplastic elevation.  The patient  删除换行1 underwent an MRI head which was limited ___ artifact but no  删除换行1 evidence of lesions (showed diffuse volume loss and  删除换行1 encephelomalacia at previous XRT site). Also underwent CT c/a/p  删除换行1 which did not show any change and no recurrence or metatstic  删除换行1 disease. There was some concern of bladder thickening at  删除换行8 ___, but CT scan did not show this and urology felt that he  删除换行1 can f/u as outpt for elective cystoscopy (also the issue of  删除换行1 urinary retention/decath trial-has f/u with Dr. ___.

They aggreed on dilantin taper over next  删除换行1 month. \nHis atenolol and zocor were held and not resumed. We were trying  删除换行1 to minimize medications that may contribute to SIADH (though  删除换行1 very very rare). These can be reintroduced as outpt. \nHe missed his NSG follow up here but has rescheduled for ___ 删除换行8 He was found to have apneic episodes when sleeping, can refer to  删除换行1 oupt sleep study. 删除1：<u>.</u>\nBelow is daily progress note from day of discharge for further  删除换行1 details according to problem list: \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n___ year old male with remote h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy with brain  删除换行1 mets s/p resection and XRT, COPD, thalassemia, BPH c LUTS and  删除换行1 indwelling foley, Lumbar fusion ___ and recently diagnosed  删除换行4 SIADH of unclear etiology who is admitted with AMS, thought to  删除换行1 be symptomatic hypoNa, which has now improved. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\nHyponatremia ___ SIADH. no clear etiology. appears to be  删除换行1 symptomatic at levels less than 126. ___ be ___ recent  删除换行1 illness/pain, etc however onset is since ___ after illnesses  删除换行1 and pt's pain is much less now than before.

She had  删除换行1 a BiV ICD placed and was started on dofetilide prior to  删除换行1 discharge, without complication. \n\n【12】ISSUES: \n#. AFib with RVR: Patient had successful AC cardioversion on  删除换行8 ___ from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.  The patient  删除换行1 then went back into atrial fibrillation, and dofetilide was  删除换行1 started, with conversion to sinus rhythm on ___.  She then  删除换行1 had sinus bradycardia (likely from left atrial focus, not  删除换行1 actually sinus) with QT >500ms and offset pauses >3 seconds.  \nShe had a BiV ICD placed on ___, with future consideration  删除换行1 for AVJ ablation if Afib persists and is difficult to control.  \nThe patient did have LUQ/flank discomfort post-procedurally  删除换行1 which may have been secondary to intermittent phrenic nerve  删除换行1 pacing, and the LV lead output was adjusted. The patient was  删除换行1 restarted on dofetilide 125mcg BID, and QTc remained stable on  删除换行1 serial ECGs. The patient was also discharged on po Carvedilol  删除换行14 12.5mg BID and warfarin 5 mg M/Th and 2.5mg all other days.  INR  删除换行4 on day of discharge 2.0. Goal INR for home is 2.5-3.5. \n\n【13】#. Chronic systolic CHF: Recent TTE showed EF ___ with TR and  删除换行1 mod PHTN. The patient's ACE-inhibitor was stopped, as was very  删除换行1 likely to be contributing to renal issues. The patient received  删除换行4 PRN diuresis with lasix in addition to home torsemide when  删除换行1 appeared volume up. The patient was discharged to home on  删除换行1 torsemide 20mg qd and carvedilol 12.5mg bid. \n\n【14】#. CKD: Cr 1.5 on day of discharge, much better than baseline. Has left sided renal artery stenosis on renal ultrasound. While  删除换行1 in the hospital, avoided nephrotoxins, renally dose meds (e.g.  删除换行2 Allopurinol). We discontinued ACE-inhibitor and renal function  删除换行1 substantially improved, making us believe that the lisinopril  删除换行1 was likely contributing to renal dysfunction. \n\n【15】#. h/o rheumatic fever s/p mechanical AVR and MVR: stable. \nValves well seated on last TTE. INR therapeutic at admission. \nWarfarin was held, and heparin drip started in anticipation of  删除换行4 ICD implantation and continued while INR<2.5.  Warfarin  删除换行1 restarted after implantation, and INR increased to 2.0 by day of  删除换行1 discharge. She was discharged on warfarin 5 mg M/Th and 2.5mg  删除换行1 all other days at home, which is usual home dose, without  删除换行1 lovenox bridge. INR goal of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical mitral valve. \n\n【16】#. Interstitial lung disease: stable. At home she uses ___ NC  删除换行4 for interstitial lung disease thought to be from amiodarone  删除换行1 toxicity.  We continued supplemental home O2 in the hospital,  删除换行1 and continued steroids. Discharged home on prednisone 15mg qd,  删除换行1 with continued slow taper to be directed by outpatient  删除换行1 practitioners. \n\n【17】#. Diabetes: stable. Steroids likely the cause of high blood  删除换行1 sugars, not DM-2. the patient was maintained on a diabetic diet. \nhyperglycemia was treated with Humalog sliding scale while in  删除换行1 the hospital. \n\n【18】#. Gout: stable. continued Allopurinol (renally dosed)\n\n【19】#. Hypothyroidism: stable. continued Levothyroxine\n\n【20】TRANSITIONS OF CARE:\n- Ace-inhibitor likely contributing contributing to renal  删除换行1 failure.

Left-sided mass is presumed. \n\n【26】ECHO (___): \nThe left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left  删除换行1 ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is  删除换行1 unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal  删除换行1 wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left  删除换行1 ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue  删除换行4 Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling  删除换行1 pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).

However, this could relate  删除换行1 to a  删除换行1 redistribution of pleural fluid in the supine position, when  删除换行1 compared to the upright PA view in the comparison study. \nNevertheless, there certainly does not appear to be any  删除换行1 substantial reduction in the degree of pleural fluid. No  删除换行1 pneumothorax is seen. \n\n【29】CXR (___): \nRight basal atelectasis has nearly cleared and small right  删除换行1 pleural effusion is stable. Because of rightward patient  删除换行1 rotation, it is hard to say whether there has been interval  删除换行1 rightward mediastinal shift, but I believe there has been,  删除换行1 suggesting an increase in the volume of the already large left  删除换行1 pleural effusion that nearly completely collapses the left lung,  删除换行1 and obscures extensive intrathoracic malignancy as seen on the  删除换行1 torso CT earlier today.

IMPRESSION:  Opacities suggesting pneumonia,  删除换行1 particularly within the left lower lobe including retrocardiac  删除换行1 opacification.  Within eight weeks, following treatment,  删除换行1 follow-up radiographs are suggested to show resolution. \n\n【16】HEAD CT \nFINDINGS:  There is no evidence for intra- or extra-axial  删除换行1 hemorrhage.  The  删除换行1 ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable without  删除换行1 effacement.  There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of  删除换行1 the normally midline structures. The gray-white matter  删除换行1 differentiation appears preserved.  A calcification along the  删除换行1 lateral margin of the left ventricle may be a prominent choroid  删除换行1 plexus calcification, versus a parenchymal calcification, which  删除换行1 if confirmed might suggest prior exposure to cysticercosis.  The  删除换行1 visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear. \n There is no evidence of fracture. IMPRESSION:  No evidence of  删除换行1 acute process.  Calcification along the margin of the left  删除换行1 ventricle, possibly parenchymal, which if correct might suggest  删除换行1 prior exposure to cysticercosis.   \n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ yo M with history of chronic back and leg pain, prescription  删除换行1 drug abuse, and depression presenting with confusion.  \n#) Medication overdose: Mr. ___ was recently  删除换行1 discharged from an inpatient narcotic detoxification program  删除换行1 with a prescription for lorazepam. He was also taking multiple  删除换行1 other medications (without knowing what they were, or their  删除换行1 dose) throughout the day. His family members reported that he  删除换行1 asked for diazepam for his anxiety a great deal. They also  删除换行1 reported that he took 30 oxycodone in ten days prior to entering  删除换行1 drug detoxification and had multiple prescriptions for it. It  删除换行1 seems that his presentation with confusion is likely secondary  删除换行1 to polypharmacy vs medication overdose (he filled prescriptions  删除换行1 for benzo and narcotics on ___. The patient endorses  删除换行1 taking too many medications.  CT head was negative and he became  删除换行1 more alert and oriented throughout his stay and returned to  删除换行1 baseline. He denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, and his  删除换行1 family reports that he has been stable for many years. We  删除换行1 discharged him without of benzo or oxycodone. His pain was  删除换行1 treated with tylenol. The patient still noted mild to moderate  删除换行1 pain but appeared comfortable and had a normal gait. SW was  删除换行1 consulted and the patient was given the number for a day  删除换行1 treatment center in ___, for which he plans to enroll. 删除换行2 #) Pneumonia: Though there was question of a LLL infiltrate on  删除换行1 his initial CXR, and he endorsed mild cough several days prior  删除换行1 to presentation. However, his physical exam was unimpressive,  删除换行1 and he was without symptoms and afebrile throughout his hospital  删除换行1 course. He did receive one dose of levofloxacin in the emergency  删除换行1 department.\n\n【18】#) Sinus tachycardia: Initially tachycardic in the ER, but this  删除换行1 improved w/ fluid administration and did not re-occur throughout  删除换行1 his hospital course.\n\n【19】#) Back pain & foot pain: Pain was chronic in nature, and was  删除换行1 controlled in the hospital with acetaminophen. He should be  删除换行1 treated with non-narcotics given this admission for medication  删除换行1 overdose.\n\n【20】#) Narcotic abuse: Mr. ___ has a history of narcotic  删除换行1 use for back pain, and sees a pain management doctor for this. \nHe was discharged from a drug detoxification program 4 days  删除换行1 prior to presentation. After a family meeting with social work,  删除换行1 he agreed to attend an adult ___ Intensive outpatient program  删除换行1 at ___ upon discharge.\n\n【21】#) Depression: The patient seemed depressed during his stay. At  删除换行1 times he would cry when recalling prior events of possible  删除换行1 abuse. He did not have SI or HI. No medications were started for  删除换行1 this but a psychiatry follow up would be beneficial.\n\n【22】Transitional issues:\n- PCP to consider connecting with outpatient psychiatry (we  删除换行1 would recommend this)\n- PCP follow up for further evaluation and management of pain  删除换行1 and addiction treatment\n\n【23】Medications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Pharmacy patient med bottles.\n1.

Hospital course was complicated by pneumonia (s/p  删除换行1 azithromycin course), cystitis (s/p Ceftriaxone course), acute  删除换行1 on chronic anemia (requiring intermittent transfusions), left  删除换行1 atrial thrombus and atrial fibrillation (Coumadin with heparin  删除换行1 gtt bridge), iliacus hematoma (stable on discharge), and acute  删除换行1 on chronic kidney disease (likely ___ cardiorenal, stable on  删除换行1 discharge). \n\n【33】# CORONARIES: 3VD s/p CABG\n# PUMP:  EF 65%\n# RHYTHM:  atrial fibrillation \n\n【34】#) SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS s/p TAVR: \nPt has a history of severe aortic stenosis ___ 0.5cm2, peak  删除换行1 58mmHG, mean 34mmHg).  He was felt to be too high risk for  删除换行1 surgical aortic valve replacement, so he was admitted for  删除换行1 elective TAVR.  He underwent uncomplicated TAVR on ___ with  删除换行1 placement ___ 3 aortic valve bioprosthesis.  \nIntra-operative TEE showed LVEF 55%, with ___ aortic  删除换行1 valve bioprosthesis present with normal transaortic gradient and  删除换行1 mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.  Repeat TTE ___ was notable  删除换行1 for LVEF >55%, ___ valve in place with probable  删除换行1 paravavalvular aortic valve leak, mild (1+) aortic  删除换行1 regurgitation, and severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation.

Pt was diuresed with Lasix  删除换行1 80mg IV (once to two times daily), and later transitioned to \nTorsemide 40mg daily.  Discharge weight was 72.2kg. This weight  删除换行1 was relatively stable on torsemide 40 but needs to be watched  删除换行1 closely. BP runs low on account of RV failure, but even with  删除换行1 this he still has some ascites and ___ edema (L>R)\n\n【36】#) SPONTANEOUS ILIACUS HEMATOMA \nPt developed left sided hip and upper leg pain and was noted to  删除换行1 have decline in hemoglobin.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed  删除换行1 left iliacus muscle collection suspicious for an intramuscular  删除换行1 hematoma measuring approximately 3.6 by 5.7 by 9.6cm.  Pt was  删除换行1 seen by Interventional Radiology, who felt that there was no  删除换行1 role for endovascular intervention.  Repeat imaging several days  删除换行1 later showed no interval change in size of the hematoma.  Pt  删除换行1 required intermittent transfusions but remained hemodynamically  删除换行1 stable.  For pain management, he received Tylenol, Oxycodone and \nGabapentin.\n\n【37】#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC ANEMIA:\nPt has a history of chronic anemia.  He developed worsening  删除换行1 anemia likely secondary to blood loss in setting of iliacus  删除换行1 hematoma.  He required 3U PRBCs total during hospitalization.  \nPt needs close monitoring of CBC for monitoring of anemia, as  删除换行1 patient required intermittent transfusions during  删除换行1 hospitalization.  \n\n【38】#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE 删除换行15 Creatinine on admission was 1.4 (unclear baseline).  Creatinine  删除换行1 increased to a peak of 2, likely secondary to cardiorenal.  \nCreatinine stable on discharge.

Underwent diagnostic  删除换行1 paracentesis with SAAG>1.1 and Ascites TP<2.5 consistent  删除换行1 non-cardiac cause of portal hypertension. However, there is  删除换行1 suspicion that his cardiac pathologies (namely his severe TR and  删除换行2 RHF) is still likely the driver of his ascites and cirrhosis.  \nPt scheduled for outpatient follow up with Hepatology and will  删除换行1 likely need an endoscopy for determination of variceal status.\n\n【40】#) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: \nPt has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is managed  删除换行1 on Coumadin.  During hospitalization, he was managed on Coumadin  删除换行1 with a heparin gtt bridge. Patient's home Metoprolol Xl dose was  删除换行1 decreased from 25mg to 12.5mg daily due to hypotension.  Pt was  删除换行1 discharged on Coumadin 7.5mg daily.  Discharge INR 2.8. Pt will  删除换行1 need repeat INR check on ___. The 7.5 is down from 10 and 11  删除换行1 as his last two doses. His INR was very slow to rise now rapidly  删除换行1 accelerating so with ascites we pulled back. \n\n【41】#) LEFT ATRIAL THROMBUS\nPt noted to have left atrial thrombus on prior imaging from CT \nTorso.  During hospitalization, he was managed with Coumadin and  删除换行1 heparin gtt bridge (as above).\n\n【42】#) COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA:\nDuring hospitalization, pt developed productive cough of  删除换行1 blood-tinged sputum and CT chest showed peribronchial wall  删除换行1 thickening in the right lower lobe and scattered ground-glass  删除换行1 opacities.  Pt completed a course of Azithromycin.  Pt should  删除换行1 have repeat CT chest in 1 month.\n\n【43】#) COMPLICATED CYSTITIS: \nDuring hospitalization, pt found to have E.coli UTI.  Pt  删除换行1 completed a 7-day course of IV Ceftriaxone.  \n\n【44】CHRONIC ISSUES\n# CAD: 3VD s/p CABG: continued home statin and aspirin. \nDecreased home Metoprolol dose (as above). \n# Glaucoma: continued home timolol eye drops as needed.  Held  删除换行1 home Bimatoprost drops (non-formularly), and managed with  删除换行1 latanoprost drops instead.\n# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine\n\n【45】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n======================================================\n1. Pt's Coumadin was difficult to titrate to therapeutic levels. \nHe was therapeutic at 2.8 INR on discharge, but Coumadin had  删除换行1 recently been increased. Per pharmacy recommendation, should  删除换行1 start on 7.5 mg ___. Please repeat INR and adjust Coumadin  删除换行1 accordingly.  Goal INR 2 to 3 for afib and left atrial thrombus.\n2. Pt discharged on Torsemide 40mg PO daily.   \n3. Pt needs close monitoring of kidney function. Creatinine on  删除换行1 discharge 1.7.  \n4. Pt needs close monitoring of CBC for monitoring of anemia, as  删除换行1 patient required intermittent transfusions during  删除换行1 hospitalization.  \n5. Pt developed spontaneous iliacus hematoma during  删除换行1 hospitalization, which was stable on discharge.  Pt should be  删除换行1 monitored for worsening lower extremity pain or weakness.\n6.

PCP aware of high morbidity  删除换行1 and need to further address quality of life.\n7. Pt noted on imaging to have abnormal oseeous heterogeneity  删除换行1 concerning for metastatic disease.  Pt can be scheduled for  删除换行1 follow up with outpatient PCP and ___ (Dr. ___  删除换行13 ___ for further evaluation.  \n8. Pt noted on CT chest to have peribronchial wall thickening in  删除换行1 the right lower lobe and scattered ground-glass opacities.  Pt  删除换行1 received a course of Azithromycin.  pt should have repeat CT  删除换行4 chest in 1 month.\n9. Pt will need to continue taking aspirin 81mg daily lifelong\n10. Patient's home Metoprolol Xl dose was decreased from 25mg to  删除换行14 12.5mg daily due to hypotension.\n11. For patient's leg pain, he was started on Gabapentin 100mg  删除换行4 QHS, which can be slowly increased as tolerated. Pain was also  删除换行1 managed with Oxycodone as needed.\n12. Pt has a questionable history of a liver infection for which  删除换行1 he is chronically on Amoxicillin.  The indication remained  删除换行1 unclear during hospitalization so amoxicillin was held  删除换行1 (particularly while he was taking other antibiotics).  He will  删除换行1 need to follow up with his primary care physician to determine  删除换行1 if amoxicillin needs to be resumed.13. Pt had marked constipation during hospitalization, for which  删除换行1 he was started on senna and miralax (in addition to his home  删除换行2 Docusate). \n14. Would recommend hepatitis B vaccination as an outpatient.\n15. Pt found to have newly diagnosed cirrhosis during  删除换行1 hospitalization.

She was never hypoxic and her symptoms seemed chiefly  删除换行1 related to cough, supporting more of an allergic/reactive  删除换行1 airways etiology.

She had no evidence of end organ dysfunction or  删除换行1 infection.  Her lactic acidosis was most likely an effect of  删除换行1 albuterol overuse.  \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated during  删除换行1 the course of her hospitalization, but this was in the setting  删除换行1 of respiratory distress.

She states this mass had 删除换行1 been growing for approximately ___ year's time, and she did not 删除换行1 have the mass worked up because of the many social issues and 删除换行4 GI problems she had been having at home.  We saw her in the 删除换行1 multidisciplinary ___, and at that time she was 删除换行1 operable and the decision was made to move forward with a 删除换行1 mastectomy due to the size of the mass and her breast size.\nHer axilla had contained 1 enlarged lymph node.  This has 删除换行1 been biopsied, but came back as fibroadipose tissue.  It was 删除换行1 considered non-concordant.  Due to the nature of this lymph 删除换行1 node and the size of her cancer, we decided to move forward 删除换行1 with an axillary dissection.\n\n【29】DETAILS OF THE SURGERY:  Surgery and consent were reviewed 删除换行1 with ___ in the preop holding area.  She agreed to proceed.\nThe 24-hour update was completed.  Her breast was marked.\nShe was brought back to the OR, placed supine.  All pressure 删除换行1 points padded.  She was secured to the table.  Perioperative 删除换行4 Ancef was infused without reaction.  SCDs were placed and 删除换行1 functioning.  General anesthetic was induced without 删除换行1 complication.  Her left breast, chest wall, and axilla were 删除换行1 prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Betadine was 删除换行1 used as the prep.  A final time-out was performed.\n\n【30】A wide elliptical incision was performed, including the 删除换行1 nipple and areolar complex.  We deepened this using 删除换行1 electrocautery and raised mastectomy flaps in the subdermal 删除换行1 plane in all 4 directions, superior to the clavicle, medial 删除换行1 to the sternum, inferior to the inframammary fold and lateral 删除换行1 to the latissimus dorsi muscle.  The breast was then removed 删除换行1 from the chest wall, including the pectoralis fascia, and all 删除换行1 breast tissue anterior to the clavipectoral fascia was 删除换行1 removed.  This was marked short stitch superior, long stitch 删除换行1 lateral.  We palpated the breast.  The mass was clearly felt, 删除换行1 but was not close to the deep margin.  We passed this off the 删除换行1 field.  It was weighed at 252 g.  Then was passed 删除换行1 to Pathology for permanent sectioning.  We irrigated and 删除换行1 gained hemostasis within the flap.\n\n【31】We then started the axillary dissection.  I carefully 删除换行1 mobilized the axillary tissue off the chest wall.  The long 删除换行1 thoracic nerve was easily identified and not damaged 删除换行1 throughout its duration.  After mobilizing off the medial 删除换行1 wall, we then came across the superior aspect of the axilla 删除换行1 just 1 cm inferior to the axillary vein.  Following this, we 删除换行1 came down laterally to mobilize off the latissimus dorsi 删除换行1 muscle.  In coming across from the superior direction, we 删除换行1 encountered an anterior vein coming off the axillary vein, 删除换行1 which we had ligated using a ___ silk.  We then followed this 删除换行1 further deep into the axilla, located thoracodorsal 删除换行1 neurovascular bundle, followed this in its entirety to ensure 删除换行1 it was not damaged.  The axillary tissue was then removed as 删除换行1 a whole and labeled left axillary contents.  There was 1 very 删除换行1 enlarged palpable lymph node within this, and multiple 删除换行1 smaller lymph nodes that did not seem pathologic.  I felt up 删除换行1 into level 2.  There was 1 further lymph node that I removed 删除换行1 carefully, sitting just beneath the median pectoral 删除换行1 neurovascular bundle.  Once we had removed all of the 删除换行1 axillary contents, we palpated levels 2 and 3.  There were no 删除换行1 further nodes to be removed and we irrigated copiously and 删除换行1 gained hemostasis throughout.  I then placed a pectoral block 删除换行1 infusing 10 mL of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine in between 删除换行1 the pectoralis major and minor muscles.  We looked for 删除换行1 hemostasis one last time.  We then placed a ___ ___ 删除换行8 drain and secured this with a nylon suture.\nWe then started our closure.  We reapproximated the deep 删除换行1 dermis using many interrupted ___ Vicryl suture, and the skin 删除换行1 using a running ___ Monocryl stitch.  The breast was cleaned, 删除换行1 dried, and dressed using Dermabond, and the drain site was 删除换行1 dressed using gauze and multiple Tegaderms.  ___ awoke from 删除换行1 anesthetic without complication, was transferred to the PACU 删除换行4 in stable condition.\n\n【32】ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  30 mL.\n\n【33】IV FLUIDS:  1100 mL LR.\n\n【34】COMPLICATIONS:  None.\n\n【35】COUNTS:  Correct at the end of the case.\n\n【36】SPECIMENS:\n1. Left breast short stitch superior, long stitch lateral.\n2. Left axillary contents.\n\n【37】Brief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ was brought to the Operating Room by Dr. ___  删除换行13 ___ on ___ and underwent left modified radical mastectomy  删除换行1 for her invasive mucinous carcinoma of the left breast with  删除换行1 axillary lymph node involvement, which was well tolerated and  删除换行1 without immediate complications (for further details regarding  删除换行1 the procedure, please refer to the operative report). \nPostoperatively, the patient was successfully extubated and  删除换行1 transferred to the PACU and then to the floor in stable  删除换行1 condition. She was initially maintained on IV fluids which were  删除换行1 stopped once she was taking in adequate PO. Her pain was well  删除换行1 controlled without the use of narcotics and serial exams  删除换行1 demonstrated stable appearance of her incision and slow thinning  删除换行1 of her L axillary JP drain output.\n\n【38】On the afternoon of POD1, the patient was tolerating a regular  删除换行1 diet, voiding and ambulating without difficulty, her pain was  删除换行1 well controlled with PO pain medications, her incision was  删除换行1 clean, dry and intact, her JP drain output stayed low and  删除换行1 serosanguinous appearing and she remained afebrile and  删除换行1 hemodynamically stable. She was thus deemed ready for discharge  删除换行1 home with ___ services for assistance with drain care and has  删除换行1 been scheduled to be seen in clinic at the end of the month.\n\n【39】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

This is caused her a great deal of 删除换行1 stress and other social difficulties.  Since that time she has 删除换行1 been having several episodes per day, which are of a new 删除换行1 semiology for her.  She describes these as follows: A feeling of 删除换行1 swelling and numbness of the tongue, which is accompanied by 删除换行1 difficulty forming words.  She feels that she is able to think  删除换行1 of 删除换行1 the words she wants to say but is unable to get her mouth to 删除换行1 produce them.

Her 删除换行1 typical semiology consists of a visual aura of flashing lights, 删除换行1 followed by a head deviation to the right lasting a minute or  删除换行1 so.\nThis is been followed by a postictal cry as well as difficulty 删除换行1 speaking for several minutes.  Apparently, there also sometimes 删除换行1 strange behaviors such as starting to make a pot of coffee.  She 删除换行1 has never had a generalized seizure.  Prior medications include 删除换行4 Dilantin, which was stopped for unclear reasons.  She is 删除换行1 currently on a regimen of levetiracetam, phenobarbital, and 删除换行1 lamotrigine which she reports she tolerates well.

As the pt did not meet the ___  删除换行8 criteria for deceased donor transplant, TACE was planned for the  删除换行1 2 Lesions in Segment VIII, followed possibly with Y90. It was  删除换行1 planned to treat the other 2 small lesions with subsequent RFAs. During the TACE procedure on ___, cannulation of the right and  删除换行1 left hepatic arteries did not result in blushing of the target  删除换行1 lesions. The middle hepatic artery was tortuous and his TACE  删除换行4 procedure was complicated by right hepatic artery dissection. \nThe procedure was aborted and the patient did not receive any  删除换行1 chemotherapy. Post-op, he was transiently hypotensive to the ___  删除换行8 systolic, which resolved after 2L NS. He emergently had a CT abd/pelvis, which showed a large amount of high-density fluid  删除换行1 within the abdomen and pelvis consistent with hemoperitoneum. He  删除换行1 had extravasated contrast in the porta hepatis, which pointed  删除换行1 toward perihepatic hemorrhage. He was subsequently given 2 L NS  删除换行4 and 1 unit pRBCs and was taken back to the angiography suite  删除换行1 where ___ performed common hepatic artery gelfoam embolization  删除换行1 and reconstituted flow in the right hepatic artery demonstrated  删除换行1 on CT. The patient remained hemodyanamically stable while in the  删除换行4 MICU ___ (no pressors required). On ___, he was  删除换行1 transferred back to the ___ service. Because of pain  删除换行1 from the procedure, he was on a PCA and transitioned to PO pain  删除换行1 medication. On ___, the patient had a mild HCT drop and was  删除换行1 given another 1 unit of pRBCs. CTA of the abdomen/pelvis was  删除换行1 repeated and noted no extravasation or hemoperitoneum. After a  删除换行4 Liver Tumor Conference was held, TACE was deemed to have too  删除换行1 high of a risk for a repeat attempt. Instead, he was seen by Dr.  删除换行7 ___ evaluation regarding potential cyberknife  删除换行1 treatment. Per recommendations from oncology following his  删除换行1 failed TACE, he was started on 1 month of ranitidine as well as  删除换行1 2 weeks of a pain regimen and anti-emetic. He will also require  删除换行1 an MRI liver in 4 weeks. His H/H remained stable through the  删除换行1 remainder of his admission and his pain was adequately  删除换行1 controlled. He will be followed up in oncology, hepatology, and  删除换行1 radiation oncology regarding further treatment of his HCC.\n\n【24】CHRONIC ISSUES\n==============\n\n【25】# GIB/VARICES: The patient had 2 prior upper GI bleeds, which  删除换行1 ultimately led to discovery of his HCV cirrhosis and HCC. On an  删除换行4 EGD on ___, he was noted to have Grade II varices at the  删除换行1 lower third of the esophagus and GEJ, which were banded, and  删除换行1 portal gastropathy. He was started on nadolol and pantoprazole. \nNadolol was held in the setting of his hypotension following his  删除换行1 failed TACE procedure. However, once hemodynamically stable,  删除换行1 nadolol was re-initiated and continued at discharge. He will  删除换行1 require surveillance of varices in ___ with hepatology.\n\n【26】# CIRRHOSIS: His cirrhosis is ___ treatment-naive HCV genotype  删除换行1 1B (___), and it has been complicated by grade II varcies,  删除换行1 portal gastropathy, and HCC. Because of anemia as a complication  删除换行1 from his cirrhosis, he was continued on ferrous sulfate. In the  删除换行1 setting of his HCC, he has also lost 60lbs and was seen by  删除换行1 nutrition who recommended Ensure supplementation with meals. For  删除换行1 potential treatment of his HCC, the pt did not meet the ___  删除换行8 criteria for deceased donor transplant. With an unsuccessful  删除换行1 attempt at TACE, he will be further evaluated for cyberknife by  删除换行1 radiation oncology. Further, while the pt is not aware of any  删除换行1 potential live donor, the living donor transplant option will  删除换行1 also continue to be explored in ___.\n# RIGHT SHOULDER ARTHRITIS: Oxycodone was increased from 5mg \nQ6H:PRN to ___ Q4H:PRN due to pain after his unsuccessful  删除换行4 TACE procedure.

During her ___ hospitalization,  删除换行1 hyponatremia was attributed to SIADH with concurrent  删除换行1 hypovolemia. On that admission, she had diuretics stopped,  删除换行1 verapamil decreased (240 to 140), and her Trileptal was stopped. \nShe was successfully weaned off of Klonopin.  She noted increase  删除换行1 fluid intake between admissions, which may have contributed to  删除换行1 recurrence of hyponatremia. On ___ admission, urine lytes  删除换行1 were suggestive of SIADH (increased UOsm, elevated UNa). She was  删除换行1 fluid restricted at 1.5L for 2 days and 1L for one day with  删除换行1 subsequent improvement in serum sodium to 134. TFTs were  删除换行1 consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism and she was also  删除换行1 started on low dose levothyroxine. She was also orthostatic  删除换行1 during that admission. It was thought that her hyponatremia had  删除换行1 multifactorial etiology, secondary to multiple psychiatric  删除换行1 medications contributing to SIADH, polydipsia, and  删除换行1 hypothyroidism. She was discharged on salt tabs and 1.5 liter  删除换行1 fluid restriction daily. She ran out of salt tabs ___, and  删除换行1 notes that she has probably been drinking more than 1.5L at home  删除换行1 due to thirst.\n\n【10】She felt well upon leaving the hospital but a few days prior to  删除换行1 admission began to feel worse, with increasing dizziness and  删除换行1 unsteadiness, headache, and nausea. She notes her dizziness is  删除换行1 often worse when standing up. She has not fallen but notes that  删除换行1 she \"blacks out\" when standing up. She reports that she tends to  删除换行1 feel worse when her sodium is low. She has not had any numbness,  删除换行1 tingling, cloudy thinking, or changes in speech.\n\n【11】She has a long history of migraines, which she controls with  删除换行1 toradol, tramadol, and sometimes excedrin migraine. She has  删除换行1 gotten botox injections for migraine, which have not happened  删除换行1 since ___ years ago. Her migraines are often accompanied by  删除换行1 nausea. She has had occasional NBNB emesis over the last month,  删除换行1 which occurs even in the absence of migraine. She has been  删除换行1 mildly constipated, without diarrhea, BRBPR, melena,  删除换行1 hematemesis. She has not had any fevers, chills, abdominal pain,  删除换行1 dysura, CP or palpitations, or SOB.\n\n【12】In the ED, initial vitals: 98.6 74 136/71 18 98% RA \n- Exam notable for: Slightly dry mucous membranes\n- Labs notable for: Na 122, K 4.2, Cl 86, Cr 0.8; nl CBC; UA w/  删除换行1 mod leuk, neg nit, few bact\n- Imaging notable for:\n- Pt given: 30 mg toradol IV, 4 mg Zofran IV\n- Vitals prior to transfer: 98 83 1342/84 17 99 RA 删除换行15 On arrival to the floor, she reports ___ headache pain and mild  删除换行1 nausea.

During  删除换行1 her most recent hospitalization, hyponatremia was thought to be  删除换行1 related to SIADH from psychiatric medications, polydipsia, and  删除换行1 subclinical hypothyroidism. She had been on low-dose  删除换行1 levothyroxine, salt tabs, and fluid restriction since discharge,  删除换行1 possibly with excess fluid intake at home. She continues to be  删除换行1 on multiple psychiatric medications associated with SIADH. She  删除换行1 had been weaned off of or stopped other medications associated  删除换行1 with SIADH on prior admissions, including trileptal,  删除换行1 chlorthalidone, and klonopin.\n   She was noted to have orthostatic hypotension during her  删除换行1 admission . Adrenal insufficiency was also on the  删除换行1 differential given hypotension. MRI brain/pituitary showed no  删除换行1 evidence of intracranial mass. Endocrinology was consulted  删除换行1 regarding possible adrenal insufficiency and felt her  删除换行1 presentation was consistent with SIADH due to side effects of  删除换行1 psychiatric medications, with polydipsia at home. She later had  删除换行1 a cortisol stimulation test with normal AM cortisol and  删除换行1 appropriate increase after cosyntropin administration. \nEndocrinology recommended stopping levothyroxine given normal  删除换行4 TFTs a short time after starting low-dose levothyroxine. \nPsychiatry was also consulted, and recommended against any  删除换行1 changes to her regimen given her prior volatile psychiatric  删除换行1 history and current stability.\n   Her sodium increased to 132 over 48 hours and her symptoms  删除换行1 abated with resolution of hyponatremia. She continued to be  删除换行1 orthostatic and was given IVF with subsequent increased serum Na  删除换行1 and improved symptoms. This suggested her hyponatremia was  删除换行1 likely multifactorial, due in part to SIADH from psychiatric  删除换行1 medication, and in part to hypovolemia. Her sodium stabilized at  删除换行1 normal levels 通用删除7(英):<u>(139)</u> and she was discharged on 2 salt tabs BID \nand a plan to titrate her fluid restriction as needed based on  删除换行1 orthostatic symptoms and blood pressure at home, as well as  删除换行1 close follow-up with her PCP.\n\n【28】#Orthostatic hypotension: She has a history of lightheadedness  删除换行1 accompanying hyponatremia.  She was also orthostatic here, with  删除换行4 SBPs as low as ___ and lightheadedness with standing. Her  删除换行1 verapimil (taken for migraine prophylaxis) and atenolol were  删除换行1 discontinued, which improved her orthostasis. She later appeared  删除换行1 hypovolemic on exam and was given IVF with subsequent increased  删除换行1 serum Na and improved symptoms. She was discharged with a  删除换行1 prescription for a blood pressure cuff, and was instructed to  删除换行1 take her blood pressure daily at home nad liberalize her fluid  删除换行1 restriction as needed for orthostasis or SBP<90.\n\n【29】#Headache: Patient has a long history of migraines. However, her  删除换行1 headaches improved with correction of hyponatremia, making HA  删除换行4 related to electrolyte abnormality more likely. Her home tylenol  删除换行4 PRN, tramadol PRN were continued with rare requirement of  删除换行1 toradol IV. Her verapamil was discontinued given orthostasis.\n\n【30】#Nausea/vomiting: Her nausea and vomiting improved with  删除换行1 correction of hyponatremia. Likely multifactorial, related to  删除换行1 hyponatremia as well as known history of migraines.\n\n【31】#Long QTc: Patient has a history of prolonged QTc, likely  删除换行1 related to psychiatric meds (chloropromazine, trazoone). ED EKG \nwith QTc 498 ___. Repleted K>4 and Mg>2.\n\n【32】CHRONIC ISSUES: \n======================\n#Bipolar Disorder: Continued home chlorpromazine, lamotrigine,  删除换行1 benztropine, trazodone.

We continued to  删除换行1 hold her chlorthalidone for low-normal BPs and hyponatremia.\n- Levothyroxine was discontinued based on normal TFTs here a  删除换行1 short time after starting low-dose levothyroxine, per  删除换行4 Endocrinology recommendations. TFTs should be re-checked 6 weeks  删除换行1 after discharge.\n- She was discharged on 2g salt tabs BID (from 1 tab BID).\n- She was given a prescription for a blood pressure cuff. She  删除换行1 was instructed to continue a 1.5L fluid restriction at home. She  删除换行1 should take her blood pressure daily in the morning. If she  删除换行1 feels dizzy or has SBP<90, she should drink 0.5-1L of  删除换行1 electrolyte-containing fluids to minimize orthostasis.\n- She should follow-up with her PCP and have frequent testing of  删除换行4 Na levels to monitor for recurrence of hyponatremia. If her  删除换行1 sodium begins to drop, her volume status should be carefully  删除换行1 assessed. She may require reinforcement of fluid restriction if  删除换行1 euvolemic vs. increased PO fluid if hypovolemic and orthostatic. \n\n【38】- The patient would like to resume Botox injections for migraine  删除换行1 control, and has been in touch with the ___ headache clinic to  删除换行1 arrange this.\n\n【39】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

We continued you  删除换行1 on salt tabs and resumed your fluid restriction, which improved  删除换行1 your sodium levels and your symptoms. Further testing did not  删除换行1 show evidence of any problems with your adrenal glands and you  删除换行1 had a normal brain MRI. Psychiatry came to see you and  删除换行1 recommended that we not alter your psychiatric medication  删除换行1 regimen. Endocrinology also saw you and felt your low sodium was  删除换行1 likely due to side effects of your psychiatric medications,  删除换行1 called SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone),  删除换行1 which leads to low sodium. They felt you did not need to keep  删除换行1 taking levothyroxine - your thyroid function can be rechecked by  删除换行1 your PCP ___ 6 weeks.\n\n【46】You should continue salt tabs and 1.5L fluid restriction at home  删除换行1 to keep your sodium levels up. However, we also noticed that you  删除换行1 were lightheaded with decreased blood pressure while standing. \nTo address this, we stopped your verapamil and atenolol, and  删除换行1 gave you IV fluids. This lessened your symptoms and further  删除换行1 improved your sodium levels.\n\n【47】At home, you should take 2 salt tabs twice a day (4g total). You  删除换行1 should continue a 1.5L fluid restriction. Take your blood  删除换行1 pressure every day in the morning; if you feel dizzy or your  删除换行1 systolic blood pressure (the higher number) is less than 90, you  删除换行1 should drink extra fluid that day (extra ~500 ml to 1 L). Try  删除换行1 drinking fluid with electrolytes, like Ensure, Pedialyte, or \nGatorade.\n\n【48】Please follow-up closely with your PCP to check your sodium  删除换行1 levels. You should have these monitored closely for the first  删除换行8 ___ weeks after discharge. Based on your symptoms and your  删除换行1 sodium levels, you can then have your sodium levels checked less  删除换行1 frequently.\n\n【49】Please keep your follow-up appointments as listed below.\n\n【50】Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your care!

OT  删除换行4 recommended home with no acute occupational therapy needs. \nHence, order for OT was removed.\n\n【15】On the evening of POD1, a cranial nerve exam was performed and  删除换行1 it was noted that the patient had an irregular smile with  删除换行1 inferior left facial droop and mild ptosis on the left side,  删除换行1 both on same side of her surgery. That same evening a code  删除换行1 stroke was activated given the new onset of neurologic symptoms  删除换行1 on exam and her surgery near Left carotid artery. Neurology  删除换行1 immediately came to assess her and code stroke was activated. At  删除换行1 time of arrival patients SBP 115, BG 124 and NIHSS 2 for partial  删除换行1 left 删除换行1 facial droop with NLFF.

Her facial drooping  删除换行1 partially resolved throughout the course of her hospitalization  删除换行1 and neuro exam remained otherwise intact throughout.\n\n【16】On POD2 the patient was still complaining of her difficulty with  删除换行1 swallowing. The speech and swallow team was consulted and it was  删除换行1 clarified to them that the patient only needed swallowing  删除换行1 exercises and we were not concerned of a risk for aspiration. \nSwallow team evaluated the patient and recommended thin liquid  删除换行1 and regular solid diet, self-selecting softer foods as needed  删除换行1 secondary to pain. They suggested the patient to consider a left  删除换行1 head turn, as if there is swelling in the L pharynx, this would  删除换行1 divert the bolus to the unaffected right side.\n\n【17】On POD3 neurology assessed the patient and signed off  删除换行1 afterwards. The patient started having gum pain. Gabapentin was  删除换行1 given 300mg TID which partially controlled her pain. Her drain  删除换行1 output was serosanguinous with decreased output compared to  删除换行1 previous day.\n\n【18】On POD4 the patient continued to complain of pain in her gums,  删除换行1 thus, it was decided to keep her one more day in the hospital  删除换行1 for pain control before discharge.\n\n【19】On POD5,she was doing well with well controlled pain. Her  删除换行1 swallowing had improved although with residual discomfort  删除换行1 however said she was instructed to continue following the  删除换行1 recommendations from the swallow team. She was able to tolerate  删除换行1 a regular diet, get out of bed and ambulate without assistance,  删除换行1 void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications  删除换行1 alone. She was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the  删除换行1 appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions.\n\n【20】Medications on Admission:\nLosartin-HCTZ 50-12.5', amlodipine 5mg', Plavix 75mg',  删除换行1 simvastatin 10mg' (clarify), levothyroxine 25mcg', melatonin prn \n\n【21】Discharge Medications:\n1.

No hemorrhage. \n\n【30】CXR ___\nComparison to ___.  Stable low lung volumes.  Stable  删除换行1 moderate  删除换行1 pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.  The presence of a  删除换行1 minimal left pleural effusion is likely.  No pneumothorax. \n\n【31】TTE ___\nLarge mobile left ventricular mass attached to the lateral left  删除换行1 ventricular wall that is contracting normally. Given the absence  删除换行1 of underlying myocardial infarction concern for tumor is  删除换行1 increased versus atypical thrombus formation. Small pericardial  删除换行1 effusion increases suspicion for malignancy. With known  删除换行1 underlying metastatic bladder cancer this is most likley a  删除换行1 secondary cardiac malignancy (metastasis from bladder cancer),  删除换行1 but primary cardiac tumor cannot be exlcuded, nor thrombus. \nMitral and tricuspid valve respiratory inflow variation is  删除换行1 exaggerated suggesting increased pericardial pressure, but no  删除换行1 frank tamponade. The mass could be further characterized with  删除换行4 Cardiac MRI. A left pleural effusion is present. \n\n【32】 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___  删除换行8 the findings are similar. \nCT C/A/P ___\n1. Ill-defined consolidations in right upper and left lower  删除换行1 lobes likely  删除换行1 represent multifocal pneumonia. \n2. Multiple intramuscular and one right pleural rim enhancing  删除换行1 centrally  删除换行1 hypodense collections, the largest of which measures up to 2.1 x  删除换行6 2.0 cm in the left pectoralis major muscle, are new as compared  删除换行1 to CT chest ___ and likely represent worsening  删除换行1 metastatic disease in the context of patient's  删除换行1 history of intramuscular metastasis. \n3. Scattered ground-glass opacities are new as compared to ___ and are nonspecific in etiology and could be  删除换行1 secondary to drug toxicity versus less likely infection or  删除换行1 pulmonary edema. \n4. Multiple lung nodules measuring up to 1.3 cm in the right  删除换行1 upper lobe are decreased in size from ___. \n\n【33】DISCHARGE LABS\n============================\nNA\n\n【34】Brief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of metastatic  删除换行1 variant-histology bladder cancer (with sarcomatoid,  删除换行1 plasmacytoid, and other differentiation) refractory to  删除换行1 gemcitabine/cisplatin and pembrolizumab, now on  删除换行1 ipilimumab/nivolumab and palliative RT to intramuscular  删除换行1 metastases who presented with several days of worsening lethargy  删除换行1 and significant hematuria for 1 day, found to have large LV mass  删除换行1 concerning for metastatic disease and was admitted to ICU for  删除换行1 shock and respiratory failure. Ultimately, in the setting of his  删除换行1 metastatic bladder cancer as well as problems listed below  删除换行1 (notably continued hypoxemia and new diagnosis of stroke), the  删除换行1 patient's HCP/partner decided to make the patient  删除换行1 comfort-measures-only on ___. Patient was transferred to the  删除换行1 floor on ___, and died at 11:30 pm that evening.\n\n【35】# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient had significant hypoxemia  删除换行1 requiring HFNC and was noted to have multifocal opacities on CXR  删除换行4 concerning for pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema vs. grade ___  删除换行8 immunotherapy-related pneumonitis. He was empirically treated  删除换行1 with cefepime for pneumonia, with IV methylprednisolone for  删除换行1 pneumonitis, as well as intermittent Lasix boluses. However, he  删除换行1 failed to improve significantly. Given his multiple  删除换行1 comorbidities including the problems described below, he was  删除换行1 made CMO and thus the above interventions were discontinued. \n# R MCA Infarct: On ___, the patient had new onset of left  删除换行1 sided weakness and was found to have R MCA infarct as well as  删除换行1 prior small strokes. This is likely related to LV mass throwing  删除换行1 clots to the cerebral vasculature. He was placed on Keppra for  删除换行1 seizure ppx.\n\n【36】# Shock: Mr. ___ presented with MAPs in the ___ with elevated  删除换行1 lactate to 5.8, thought secondary to septic (multifocal  删除换行1 pneumonia) vs. cardiogenic (in setting of LV mass with new  删除换行1 heart-failure) vs. hemorrhagic (with known GU bleeding). \nOriginally, there was also concern for tamponade given effusions  删除换行1 noted on multiple bedside ultrasounds, but repeat pulsus was  删除换行1 unremarkable. He was ultimately treated with empiric antibiotics  删除换行1 as well as well as transfusions as needed. He was quickly weaned  删除换行1 off of pressors and did not require any on the preceding days  删除换行1 prior to transfer.\n\n【37】# STEMI: On ___, patient was noted to have new ST elevations  删除换行1 in anterior leads. Cardiology consulted but since the patient is  删除换行1 not a suitable candidate for intervention, no further action was  删除换行1 taken.\n\n【38】# Hematuria: Patient had persistent hematuria in setting of  删除换行1 known bladder cancer and was maintained on CBI and hand  删除换行1 irrigation as needed for clots. There was consideration of  删除换行1 palliative radiation of bladder to treat but given the patient's  删除换行1 persistent hypoxemia requiring HFNC, this was deferred.\n\n【39】# LV mass: A large mobile left ventricular mass attached to the  删除换行1 lateral left ventricular wall was noted on TTE and had also been  删除换行1 seen on CT 1 week prior to admission. Cardiology felt that this  删除换行1 was most likely metastatic cancer vs. myxoma rather than  删除换行1 thrombus. He was initially on hep gtt but then discontinued due  删除换行1 to hematuria and lower suspicion for thrombus. No further  删除换行1 intervention was done.\n# ___: Patient presented with elevated Cr 1.2 (from baseline  删除换行2 0.6) which was thought related to shock. However, patient also  删除换行1 had wedge-shaped hypodensity of kidney on CT from last  删除换行1 admission, now also with LV mass c/f thrombus, so there weas  删除换行1 concern for renal artery embolism. His Cr improved with  删除换行1 re-perfusion.\n\n【40】# Hx of Papillary Thyroid Cancer, complicated by hypothyroidism 删除换行4 Patient was maintained on IV Levothyroxine Sodium 37 mcg (home  删除换行1 po levothyroxine 75 mcg) prior to being made CMO.\n\n【41】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Multiple possible etiologies including  删除换行1 hypercalcemia vs opioid induced sedation vs constipation. \nImproving mental status after BMs and decreasing calcium levels. \nNearing baseline per family. She was treated with a gentle bowel  删除换行1 regimen after her constipation resolved. \n\n【31】#HYPERCALCEMIA - resolved\nCorrected Ca2+ 16.22 on presentation to the ED. Normalized with  删除换行1 fluid and calcitonin as well as Zoledronic acid injection x1 on  删除换行8 ___. Mechanism thought to be ___ poor PO intake, underlying  删除换行1 malignancy (with PTHrp release possibly, but it was not markedly  删除换行1 increased), and recent chemotherapy. No need to repeat  删除换行1 calcitonin unless increasing. Endocrine was consulted and  删除换行1 recommended daily calcium, phos, and albumin as she had the  删除换行1 potential to nadir on her calcium levels. She will likely  删除换行1 require on going treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy by  删除换行1 her oncologist. She received such volume resuscitation she had  删除换行1 anasarca. She was treated with doses of Lasix up to 40 mg daily  删除换行1 to aid in volume removal. \n\n【32】#ANASARCA\nShe developed anasarca in the context of fluid resuscitation. By  删除换行1 the time of transfer to the floor, she was 20 lbs over her dry  删除换行1 weight. She was initially diuresed with IV furosemide, with  删除换行1 little improvement, even with albumin infusion, and then  删除换行1 transitioned just to oral furosemide, for comfort, given goals  删除换行1 of care. She was prescribed furosemide 40 mg daily. \n\n【33】#STAGE IV PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA\nGoals of care: \nNewly diagnosed in ___ with multiple large mets to liver. Per  删除换行4 DFCI notes, 6mo survival w/o tx, and can be improved by ___ mo  删除换行1 with palliative tx. Has been taking oxycodone 5mg BID at home  删除换行1 for pain. She was initially given just Tylenol in the setting of  删除换行1 her AMS. Palliative care established a relationship with the  删除换行1 patient and her family. She had a lidocaine patch for her  删除换行1 shoulder pain and received Zofran PRN for nausea. Oxycodone was  删除换行1 uptitrated after her mental status improved and she will be  删除换行1 discharged on this as needed. \n\n【34】Multiple family meetings were conducted with her family and with  删除换行4 Ms. ___.  Initially, the plan was for rehab with goal of  删除换行1 eventual further chemotherapy.  However, given her worsening  删除换行1 liver disease, with significant anasarca, the ultimate decision  删除换行1 was for hospice care at home, with travel if possible to ___  删除换行8 for an audience with the ___ if possible.  \n#HYPOTENSION: \n#ELEVATED LACTATE:\n#LEUKOCYTOSIS:\nLeukocytosis, with intermittent hypotension and elevated  删除换行1 lactate, responsive to fluids. Initially felt to be secondary to  删除换行1 sepsis, although CT A/P without obvious infectious process, C  删除换行4 diff negative, CXR clear, UA negative. 1 of 2 anaerobic  blood  删除换行1 culture bottles speciated to coag neg staph, likely  删除换行1 contamination. Was being covered broadly with vanc/zosyn, but  删除换行1 given lack of clear infectious source, discontinued antibiotics. \nUltimately, her leukocytosis and elevated lactate were thought  删除换行1 to be related to her underlying malignancy with necrotic  删除换行1 pancreatic mass and liver mets identified on CT A/P. TTE on ___  删除换行8 showing normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities. \n#THROMBOCYTOPENIA: \nPlatelets decreased to 50 on ___ from 130 on ___. Further  删除换行1 decremented to a nadir of 31. Suspect secondary to the  删除换行1 gemcitabine she received on ___. Could also be other  删除换行1 medication-related such as vancomycin, discontinued ___.  4T  删除换行4 score is 4 (intermediate probability), although PF4 was  删除换行1 negative, arguing against HIT. Could also be platelet  删除换行1 dysfunction from malignancy/critical illness. SQH was  held  删除换行1 while platelets were < 50. \n\n【35】#TRANSAMINITIS\n#POSITIVE HEPATITIS B\nPatient with mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern of LFT  删除换行4 elevation. Does have known liver mets, but also found to have  删除换行1 high HBV viral load. Hepatology was consulted and recommended  删除换行1 starting Tenofovir in the setting of her recent gemcitabine  删除换行1 administration. This was started, but stopped prior to  删除换行1 discharge. Her pattern of LFT elevation was more consistent with  删除换行1 her underlying malignancy or a drug reaction and not her  删除换行1 hepatitis (ALT would be more elevated with acute hepatitis).  \nShe was also worked up for biliary obstruction, with MRCP on  删除换行8 ___, but this showed just significant burden of liver disease.  \n\n【36】#CONSTIPATION: resolved\nPatient initially with severe constipation, likely related to  删除换行1 opioids and/or severe hypercalcemia. KUB showing significant  删除换行1 stool burden. Resolved and resulted in transient diarrhea. C. \ndiff negative. De-escalated bowel regimen to mirilax daily and  删除换行4 PRN bisacodyl, with other agents as needed.\n\n【37】#URINARY RETENTION - resolved\nDifferential includes opioid induced vs UTI vs ___ constipation. \nBladder scan with 1L urine, foley placed, with output of 1L  删除换行4 urine. No clear infection. Successful voiding trial,  删除换行1 subsequently incontinent of urine. \n\n【38】#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR \nPatient went into A fib with RVR to 120s on ___. Thought to be  删除换行1 in the setting of malignancy vs pain. Initially started on low  删除换行1 dose metoprolol tartrate, but this was stopped in the setting of  删除换行1 intermittent hypotension and HR stably in the ___.\n\n【39】# ___:\n- Continued home carbidopa-levodopa\n- Continued home pramipexole \n\n【40】# Diabetes:  Dx ___. Was likely initial sign of cancer. \n- Held home metformin on admission, resumed on discharge. \n\n【41】#Goals of Care\nHer goal is mainly to be without pain, see friends and family,  删除换行1 and to travel if possible to ___.  As such, given her  删除换行1 progressive disease, and the liver disease which would preclude  删除换行1 further chemotherapy, her family opted for hospice at home.\n\n【42】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n====================\nDischarging with hospice - ___ to be contact.\n\n【43】Given plan for hospice, tenofovir was stopped at discharge.  If  删除换行1 she recovers more than expected, it could be restarted.\n\n【44】# Communication: HCP: ___ (daughter)\n                 Phone number: ___ \n# Code: DNR/DNI per family discussion \n\n【45】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

He states that it was identical in 删除换行1 quality to episodes of pain associated with his previous 删除换行1 pneumothoracies. Initially he did not seek medical attention as 删除换行1 the discomfort was relatively minor and he had no other 删除换行1 associated complaints. However the pain progressively increased 删除换行1 over the next several hours and he eventually presented to the \nED\nfor further evaluation.\n\n【10】In the Emergency Department the patient was hemodynamically 删除换行1 stable and saturating 100% on room air. Chest X-ray was obtained 删除换行1 and demonstrated a small apical left pneumothorax.\n\n【11】Given his extensive history of pneumothoracies, it was  删除换行1 determined 删除换行1 most appropriate to admit the patient to the Thoracic Surgery 删除换行1 service for further management\n\n【12】Past Medical History:\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. spontaneous Right pneumothorax ___ s/p anterior chest tube\n2. spontaneous Left pneumothorax ___ ago, no hospital 删除换行1 admission, resolved without treatment 删除换行4 PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\nVATS right upper lobe blebectomy with mechanical and chemical 删除换行1 pleurodesis performed ___\n\n【13】Social History: ___\nFamily History:\nNon-contributory\n\n【14】Physical Exam:\nVITAL SIGNS:\nTemp: 97.2     HR: 87     BP: 110/74     RR: 18     SaO2: 98% on  删除换行1 room air\nGENERAL: NAD; alert and fully oriented\nHEENT: Mucous membranes moist and pink; no scleral icterus; no  删除换行1 ocular or nasal discharge\nCARDIAC: RRR; normal S1 S2; no murmur\nCHEST: Incisions c/d/i; dermabond over incisions; no surrounding  删除换行1 erythema or induration\nPULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended; no palpable masses\nEXTREMITIES: Warm and well-perfused; no swelling or edema  删除换行1 bilaterally\n\n【15】Pertinent Results:\nRADIOLOGY:\nChest X-ray ___: Admission CXR\nThere is a small left-sided apical  删除换行1 pneumothorax. The right side shows no evidence of pneumothorax. \nThe left lung is clear. The right lung has persistent opacity at  删除换行1 the right lung base along the pleura consistent with the  删除换行1 patient's history of pleurodesis. No rib fractures are seen. The  删除换行1 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The hilar contours  删除换行1 are unremarkable. No signs of tension are seen. \nIMPRESSION: Small left apical pneumothorax with no signs of  删除换行1 tension  删除换行4 Chest X-ray ___ 删除换行8 Moderate left pneumothorax is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal  删除换行1 contours are  删除换行1 unchanged and midline. Surgical chain sutures are present in the  删除换行1 right apex. Blunting of the cardiophrenic angles on the right could be due  删除换行1 to small  删除换行1 pleural effusion, pleural thickening, or findings post  删除换行1 pleurodesis. Right  删除换行1 lower opacity secondary to pleurodesis, is also unchanged. There  删除换行1 are no new lung abnormalities  删除换行4 Chest X-ray ___: Post-op CXR 删除换行15 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has  删除换行1 undergone a  删除换行1 left blebectomy. Two left-sided chest tubes after VATS are  删除换行1 visible. The  删除换行1 presence of a minimal millimetric pneumothorax cannot be  删除换行1 excluded, but the  删除换行1 pneumothorax is smaller than before the intervention, as  删除换行1 documented on the  删除换行1 previous image from ___. \n\n【16】No evidence of tension. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. Normal  删除换行1 right lung  删除换行4 Chest X-ray ___:\nTwo left-sided chest tubes remain in place, one of which  删除换行1 terminates in the  删除换行1 apex and the other of which extends over the apex and down the  删除换行1 medial border into the left costophrenic angle. There is some  删除换行1 soft tissue containing loculated air at the left apex, but this  删除换行1 appearance is unchanged from ___ and may reflect a  删除换行1 combination of postoperative changes and/or a loculated  删除换行1 pneumothorax. Continued followup imaging would be advised. A  删除换行4 small amount of residual subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the  删除换行1 lower lateral left chest wall. No focal airspace consolidation  删除换行1 or pleural effusions are seen.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal  删除换行1 contours are stable. Interval decrease in the amount of gas  删除换行1 within the stomach. Surgical chain sutures are again seen at  删除换行1 both apices. Right lateral pleural thickening is stable and may  删除换行1 be result of talc pleurodesis, pleural thickening, less likely  删除换行1 effusion. \n\n【17】Brief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted for further monitoring of his  删除换行1 spontaneous left pneumothorax. Follow-up chest X-rays performed  删除换行1 on the next day demonstrated stability in the size of his  删除换行1 pneumothorax, and he was pre-op'ed and consented for a VATS left  删除换行1 sided blebectomy with mechanical and chemical pleurodesis which  删除换行1 was performed on ___.\n\n【18】The procedure was uncomplicated and 2 chest tubes were placed. \nPost-operatively the patient did well and was transferred to the  删除换行1 floors in good condition. His chest tubes were placed on suction  删除换行1 x48 hours and he was saturating well on room air. \n\n【19】By post-operative day 2 the patient was ambulating with chest  删除换行1 tubes on temporary water seal.\n\n【20】On post-operative day 3 the patient's chest tubes were placed on  删除换行1 water seal for 4 hours with repeat chest X-ray demonstrating no  删除换行1 significant change as compared to prior.\n\n【21】The chest tubes were removed and a post-pull film demonstrated a  删除换行1 tiny residual left pneumothorax which remained stable on  删除换行1 follow-up X-ray repeated 4 hours later. At that time it was  删除换行1 determined surgically appropriate to discharge the patient home  删除换行1 without need of services. At the time of discharge the patient's  删除换行1 pain was well controlled on oral pain medications, he was  删除换行1 tolerating a regular diet, was ambulating well independently,  删除换行1 saturating well on room air with no respiratory complaints, and  删除换行1 had remained afebrile through-out the entirety of his hospital  删除换行1 course.

Focal partially  删除换行1 thrombosed aneurysmal dilatation of a of the left internal iliac  删除换行1 artery measuring up to 1.7 cm.

Please correlate with appropriate clinical context  删除换行1 and urinalysis as needed. \n5. Calcified pleural plaques within the left lung base. \n6. Spondylolysis of L5 on S1, unchanged. \n\n【35】Brief Hospital Course:\n# Abdominal pain / diarrhea: \nThe patient presented with two weeks of abdominal pain and  删除换行1 diarrhea, initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia. However  删除换行1 normal lactate and guaiac negative stool reported in the ED were  删除换行1 reassuring. The patient was evaluated by surgery who thought the  删除换行1 patient had a benign abdominal exam  without need for surgical  删除换行1 intervention. Though the patient had a minimally elevated  删除换行1 lipase, this was thought unlikely to represent acute  删除换行1 pancreatitis. The patient had a non contrast CT scan in the ED  删除换行12 (given ___ on CKD) with evidence of stranding in the mid right  删除换行1 abdomen surrounding the branches of the SMA and SMV, and given  删除换行1 lack of IV contrast the differential included vasculitis and  删除换行1 thrombus. Given concern for vascular process the patient had pre  删除换行1 and post hydration and underwent a CTA of her abdomen pelvic for  删除换行1 further evaluation. This revealed persistent stranding around  删除换行1 the mesenteric vessels, though there was no thrombus appreciated  删除换行1 in the SMA or SMV and the vessel wall was unremarkable. This  删除换行1 could be seen in a site of prior lymphoma treatment. The patient  删除换行1 was also found to have an ectatic infrarenal abdominal aorta to \n3.2 cm and ectatic bilateral iliac arteries, and aneurysmal  删除换行1 dilatation of the left internal artery and splenic artery  删除换行1 aneurysm.  The rheumatology team was consulted due to concern  删除换行1 for possible vasculitis, who did not think that the patient's  删除换行1 clinical picture was consistent with a vasculitis, and no  删除换行1 intervention was required. An infectious workup was also  删除换行1 pursued. A C dif was sent and was negative, and stool cultures  删除换行1 and O+P were also negative. The patient's symptoms improved  删除换行1 without intervention during her hospital course. She was  删除换行1 tolerating PO very well by discharge. \n\n【36】___ on CKD: \nThe patient presented with a Cr of 1.9 on admission from  删除换行1 baseline of 1.5 in ___. This was likely pre renal secondary to  删除换行1 volume depletion from diarrhea. This improved with IV fluids. \nThe patient received IV fluids pre and post contrast load with  删除换行4 CTA as above. Her creatinine on discharge was 1.3\n\n【37】# Normocytic Anemia: \nThe patient had a new hgb drop from 9.8-8.8 on the day of  删除换行1 discharge. There was no evidence of acute bleeding, and the  删除换行1 patient remained without any hypotension and with stable vital  删除换行1 signs. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic  删除换行1 disease. There was no evidence of hemolysis. There was possibly  删除换行1 a dilutional component given IV fluids and increased PO intake. \nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable and will follow up  删除换行1 as an outpatient. \n\n【38】# Hypercalcemia/Hypocalcemia:\nPatient presented with hypercalcemia likely secondary to  删除换行1 dehydration given concomitant ___. This normalized with IV  删除换行4 fluids. On the day of discharge the patient was found to have  删除换行1 hypocalcemia  to 7.1, with a significant elevation in PTH to  删除换行1 326. The differential included Vitamin D deficiency/resistance,  删除换行5 CKD, PTH resistance, extravascular deposition. The patient  删除换行1 vitamin D levels were pending on discharge, and she will need  删除换行1 endocrinology follow up for further evaluation as an outpatient. \n\n【39】# Hypomagnesemia: \nThe patient was markedly hypomagnesemic (1.2) in the ED, likely  删除换行1 secondary to GI losses. This responded to magnesium repletion.\n\n【40】CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:\n=======================\n# DM2:\nThe patient' s home glipizide was held and the patient was kept  删除换行1 on sliding scale insulin while inpatient.

Throughout admission, fevers  删除换行1 were low grade (<100 degrees Fahrenheit).  On his previous  删除换行1 admission approximately on week prior, the patient also  删除换行1 experienced low-grade fevers thought to be likely related to a  删除换行1 systemic inflammatory response from pancreatitis; also the  删除换行1 patient reported a history of low-grade fevers over the past  删除换行1 year since being diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene and reported  删除换行1 at baseline he intermittently runs a low-grade fever.

He tolerated the procedure well and was  删除换行1 extubated in the OR. However, he had to be reintubated in the OR  删除换行4 due to respiratory distress and was put on a neo drip for  删除换行1 hypotension. He was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. \nPOD #1 he was extubated and maintained on bipap. He continued to  删除换行1 require the neo drip for hypotension. His chest tube was put to  删除换行1 waterseal. On POD #2, he started his epidural for pain control,  删除换行1 and started on a clear liquid diet, which he tolerated well. On  删除换行4 POD #3 (___), he was weaned off the neo drip and on POD #4  删除换行1 he was transferred to the floor. His foley was removed and he  删除换行1 voided successfully. On POD #5 he underwent a clamp trial, which  删除换行1 showed no increased pneumothorax on chest xray. However, later  删除换行1 that day, he desaturated on the floor, was tachycardic to the  删除换行1 130s, had increasing anxiety and pain, and was transferred to  删除换行1 the ICU for concern for PE and increased confusion. A CTA was  删除换行1 obtained which showed no evidence of a PE. On POD #6, he  删除换行1 continued to have some residual agitation and confusion in the  删除换行1 morning, which resolved by the afternoon. Due to concern for  删除换行1 fluid overload and pulmonary edema, he was given lasix 20 IV  删除换行4 twice. On POD #7, his chest tube was removed with minimal change  删除换行1 in the size of his pneumothorax. He had some shortness of breath  删除换行1 in the afternoon requiring CPAP. He received another dose of  删除换行1 lasix 20 IV. On POD #8, his respiratory status continued to  删除换行1 improve and he was maintained on 3L of O2 and given two more  删除换行1 doses of lasix 20 IV. On POD #9, he was transferred to the  删除换行1 floor. He continued to have an oxygen requirement at ___ and  删除换行1 congestion on chest xray. We continued to diurese him with PO  删除换行4 lasix.  His blood sugars were well-controlled during this time  删除换行1 on metformin and sliding scale insulin. His pre op Verapamil was  删除换行1 resumed at his home dose of 180 mg daily but over the last 48  删除换行1 hours his blood pressure has ranged from 92/60 to 118/70.  He is  删除换行1 asymptomatic but his daily dose will be decreased to 120 mg  删除换行1 daily to start ___.

Some of them were 删除换行1 associated with positive sparkling phenomenon in that eye, 删除换行1 followed by headache, and he was initially diagnosed with ocular 删除换行1 migraine. He eventually was evaluated by a neurologist who 删除换行1 ordered MRI/MRA, which on ___ demonstrated a subacute right 删除换行1 temporal/occipital lobe infarct, as well as complete right ICU 删除换行4 occlusion and a fetal right PCA with possible occlusion. He was 删除换行1 admitted directly to Stroke service and underwent further  删除换行1 workup.\nHe was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81mg  删除换行1 and 删除换行1 plavix 75mg, as well as atorvastatin 40mg, and was discharged 删除换行1 home. Exam was notable only for an upper left quadrantanopsia.\n\n【10】Since discharge, he has been well and had no recurrence of 删除换行1 symptoms, until this morning. Between ___, while at work 删除换行1 walking to his desk, he had 3 separate episodes of \"graying\" of 删除换行1 the vision of his right eye, involving the entire field. He was 删除换行1 still able to discern most images but as if there was a \"cloud\"\ncovering his eye. There was no pain involved. Each episode was  删除换行1 <1 删除换行1 minute, and all started and resolved acutely and spontaneously, 删除换行1 without any triggers. Of note, he has also experienced  删除换行1 occasional 删除换行1 right arm numbness described as a \"cool\" sensation over his 删除换行1 forearm, as though recovering from anesthesia. He saw Dr. ___ last week for follow up of his admission, who had planned 删除换行1 on repeating head MRI to evaluate these symptoms.\n\n【11】He called his PCP and was told to come to clinic; subsequently  删除换行1 he 删除换行1 was transferred to ___ for evaluation. Head CT was 删除换行1 obtained which was read with concern for infarct, however 删除换行1 compared to head CT obtained during last admission, appears 删除换行1 stable. He was subsequently transferred to ___ ___.\n\n【12】At current time of interview pt states he is completely back to 删除换行1 baseline and has no deficits at this time.

There is a small linear region of minimally  删除换行1 increased DWI  删除换行4 intermediate ADC values in the right temporal lobe within the  删除换行1 known infarct,  删除换行1 felt to most likely represent differential aging of infarct. \n2.

Additional findings as described above. \n\n【26】Non-Contrast CT of Head (OSH, my read):\nHypodensity in the right medial temporal and occipital lobes, 删除换行1 stable since last exam ___. No additional acute abnormalities.\n\n【27】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ year old man with recent diagnosis of right carotid occlusion  删除换行1 and Right posterior cerebral artery infarct, who presents with  删除换行1 episodes of visual loss. The concern is that his visual  删除换行1 disturbances could be due to hypoperfusion of central retinal  删除换行1 artery versus emboli from the occluded right carotid artery. His  删除换行1 examination is at baseline now, demonstrating only superior left  删除换行1 quadrantanopsia, with no evidence of acute occlusion or  删除换行1 hemorrhage on fundoscopic exam of the right eye.\n\n【28】His symptoms are most likely attributable to hypoperfusion of  删除换行1 the right central retinal artery, given clinical description,  删除换行1 known complete occlusion and slightly lower BP than usual on  删除换行1 presentation. The other, less likely possibility is emboli from  删除换行1 the chronically occluded distal right ICA. Given the  删除换行1 reconstitution of the right ICA flow at the level of the  删除换行1 ophthalmic artery and cavernous ICA, there is likely  删除换行1 bidirectional flow along the ophthalmic artery. If his blood  删除换行1 pressure drops, he may be at risk for right eye retinal artery  删除换行1 ischemia. MRI brain does not show a new infarct but does show  删除换行1 the chronic right occipital infarct. \n\n【29】Moving forward, optimal management would be maintaining adequate  删除换行1 perfusion via increasing blood pressure, and optimizing medical  删除换行1 therapy with full dose statin and continuing dual antiplatelet  删除换行1 therapy.\n\n【30】TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-Start midodrine 5mg daily. In the long term, this may be able  删除换行1 to weaned off long term assuming enough collaterals develop. \n-Check blood pressures at least daily, goal systolic 110-140,  删除换行1 goal diastolic ___\n-Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg \n-Check labs as outpatient (antiphospholipid, CRP) which can  删除换行1 assess for risk factor for stroke \n\n【31】Medications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Fortunately your symptoms improved. After  删除换行1 further evaluation, we believe your symptoms are most likely due  删除换行1 to diminished blood flow to your retina, a part of your eye  删除换行1 involved in vision. To treat your symptoms, we will start  删除换行4 Midodrine, a medication to increase blood pressure and blood  删除换行1 flow to this area. It will be important to keep your blood  删除换行1 pressure at least 110 to 140 systolic over 70 to 90 diastolic. \nIt will be important for you to check your blood pressures at  删除换行1 home.  We will also increase your atorvastatin to treat your  删除换行1 high cholesterol and reduce risk of further events. We will also  删除换行1 check some labs that may increase your risk of developing  删除换行1 further events. \n\n【37】We assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your  删除换行1 risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we  删除换行1 plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are:  prior  删除换行1 stroke, high cholesterol. \n\n【38】 We are changing your medications as follows:  \n-Increased atorvastatin to 80mg daily\n-Started midodrine 5mg daily \n\n【39】 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  \n Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician. \n\n【40】 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek  删除换行1 emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical  删除换行4 Services (dialing 911).

The following issues were  删除换行1 addressed at this admission.\n\n【21】# Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP ___ UEs  删除换行1 and 100s-120s ___ but BP on arrival to floor was found to be  删除换行1 60/D in LUE and ___. In retrospect, this may have been a  删除换行1 false measurement as pt was mentating at baseline throughout and \n___ BPs on arrival to the MICU measured back at baseline. His  删除换行1 hypotension was felt to be multifactorial, related to his  删除换行1 underlying renal disease, blood loss from his fistula, chronic  删除换行1 diarrhea, and bacteremia (cultures from admission ultimately  删除换行1 grew two species of enterococcus). He had a normal cortisol  删除换行1 level of 22 from his prior admission in early ___, so this was  删除换行1 not repeated. Elevated lactate to > 5 supported a role for  删除换行1 sepsis/bacteremia. He was treated with 1 L of IVF initially,  删除换行1 placed on midodrine, and treated with antibiotics for presumed  删除换行1 sepsis. He received daptomycin as initial cultures grew gram  删除换行1 positive cocci (ultimately enterococcus) and the patient was  删除换行1 known to be swab-positive for VRE in the past. Surveillence  删除换行1 cultures from ___ forward were negative at the time of  删除换行1 death. Blood pressures initially returned to baseline at  删除换行8 ___ in lower extremities.  However, he was no longer able  删除换行1 to tolerate dialysis, as any attempt at dialysis was complicated  删除换行1 by severe hypotension and altered mental status, even with  删除换行1 midodrine and albumin.  When he again became hypotensive at  删除换行1 dialysis ___, cefepime was added to his antibiotics and he  删除换行1 was transferred back to the ICU where he was again given small  删除换行1 boluses of fluid.  When he was transferred back to the floor  删除换行1 with stable pressures, but now with SBPs in the ___, it was  删除换行1 decided that he would be DNR/DNI and we would not re-attempt  删除换行1 dialysis unless it was absolutely indicated.  Over the next  删除换行1 week, the team met repeatedly with the patient's partner, Mr.  删除换行7 ___, his family and palliative care.  The decision was made  删除换行1 to make the patient comfort measures only on ___.  He passed  删除换行1 away peacefully the next morning.\n\n【22】# Sepsis/bacteremia: Blood cultures from the day of admission  删除换行1 were positive for E. faecalis and E. faecium as above. Both  删除换行1 organisms grew from only one bottle, raising the possibility  删除换行1 that this may have been a contaminant; however, patient was  删除换行1 treated based on overall clinical picture. Patient received  删除换行1 daptomycin given history of +VRE colonization, and E. faecium  删除换行1 indeed speciated as vanco-resistant.

An initial X-ray did not show evidence of  删除换行1 fracture; however further imaging by MRA and MRI revealed a  删除换行1 stress fracture of the right femoral neck, which has been  删除换行1 evaluated by Orthopedics and managed conservatively without  删除换行1 surgery for the time being until she could be optimized in terms  删除换行1 of her nutritional status.  During her hospitalization, patient  删除换行1 developed pancreatitis which resolved with intravenous fluids,  删除换行5 TPN, and NPO status.  She also developed episodes of  删除换行1 hypoglycemia managed with D50 boluses and D5 infusion, one  删除换行1 episode of hypotension that responded to fluids, and pulmonary  删除换行1 edema which was managed with diuretics.  At discharge hospital  删除换行1 level ___ needed for the patient includes the following: IV  删除换行15 TPN, IV Reglan and IV Zofran prior to meals, IV Lasix diuresis  删除换行1 with holding parameters, currently checking BID lytes and daily  删除换行1 triglycerides, cardiopulmonary monitoring in setting of known  删除换行1 pulmonary edema.  \n\n【35】The full course of her hospital admission by problem is detailed  删除换行1 below:\n\n【36】Anorexia nervosa / malnutrition:  Patient presented with severe  删除换行1 malnourishment and anasarca which she has been dealing with for  删除换行1 decades and followed closely by Dr. ___ in psychiatry.  She  删除换行1 reported eating only fruits and vegetables at home, and purging  删除换行1 most of the time following meals.  Her ideal dry weight is  删除换行1 estimated at 42.3kg; however, weight alone is a suboptimal  删除换行1 standard for nutritional status given her extensive anasarca.  On admission, she was on the eating disorder protocol with a  删除换行1 liquid tray when she developed pancreatitis on ___.  She  删除换行1 was kept NPO for the pancreatitis, started on clears about 4  删除换行1 days later and reinitiated a modified eating disorder protocol  删除换行1 as well as TPN on ___.  Instead of moving to three liquid  删除换行1 trays when she was unable to complete 100% of a solid meal, she  删除换行1 was allowed to complete as little as 90% of a solid meal, given  删除换行1 her medical co-morbidities such as anasarca, pulmonary edema,  删除换行1 and status post pancreatitis.  She occasionally completed less,  删除换行1 citing issues such as shortness of breath, severe bloating,  删除换行1 difficulty swallowing and difficulty chewing or swallowing hard  删除换行1 foods as hindrances.  A speech and swallow test was negative for  删除换行1 aspiration.  Each time she failed to complete >90% of a meal,  删除换行1 she was told, with a ___ interpreter, that a liquid tray  删除换行1 would be next if she did not complete the next meal.  Following  删除换行1 this, she has thus far completed >90% of the next meal each  删除换行1 time.  The patient has not failed to meet the standards of our  删除换行1 modified eating disorder protocol (please see Eating Disorder  删除换行2 Protocol Addendum/Modifications attached) and has not required  删除换行1 any transition to liquid diet during her time at ___ during  删除换行1 that last 3 weeks of her hospital stay. She also was never found  删除换行1 to be purging or in non-compliance with any of the other  删除换行1 behavioural standards per the protocol.  In addition, she was  删除换行1 given standing IV Reglan and standing IV Zofran with each meal  删除换行1 to improve gastric motility and decrease nausea.  On this  删除换行1 modified protocol, she has been taking good nutrition by mouth,  删除换行1 usually completing 90-100% of her meals.  Her TPN was gradually  删除换行1 decreased, and at discharge, she receives it cycled for 12h on  删除换行1 and 12h off. Can work with psychiatry/nutrition to wean down TPN  删除换行4 as patient's PO nutritional status improves. On discharge,  删除换行1 please continue patient on eating disorder protocol with  删除换行1 modifications per the addendum. She should be followed by  删除换行1 psychiatry for this and nutritionists as available. Please check  删除换行1 electrolytes, triglycerides, obtain daily weights, and calculate  删除换行1 meal calories with adjustments per protocol. ___ also consider  删除换行1 checking pre-albumin Qweekly to monitor nutritional progress.\n\n【37】Right hip fracture: The patient has most difficulty with flexion  删除换行1 and abduction at the hip and an MRI revealed stress fracture of  删除换行1 right femoral neck extending to the greater tuberosity.  Surgery  删除换行1 was offered to the patient without any acute indication, and  删除换行1 patient, family and medical team declined at the time in light  删除换行1 of other medical issues such as pancreatitis and severe  删除换行1 malnourishment.  She has been maintained on touch down weight  删除换行1 bearing status, and receiving ___ week during  删除换行1 her hospital course.  Per orthopedics consult in the hospital,  删除换行1 she should be touchdown weightbearing only on her right side for  删除换行1 6 weeks post injury (___). She should continue aggressive  删除换行1 physical therapy at the rehabilitation facility. The patient has  删除换行1 been enthusiastic and compliant with working with ___. Patient  删除换行1 scheduled with outpatient follow-up with Orthopedics to assess  删除换行1 her weight-bearing status and further consider surgical versus  删除换行1 non-surgical options.\n\n【38】Pancreatitis:  Patient had belly pain, nausea and one episode of  删除换行1 vomiting on ___. Lipase was noted at 1177, and hematocrit  删除换行1 was elevated at 14, consistent with acute pancreatitis and  删除换行1 associated hemoconcentration.  She was managed with intravenous  删除换行1 hydration, pain medications, and NPO status, and her lipase  删除换行1 resolved to 73 on by ___.  Her pancreatitis is of  删除换行1 unclear etiology and may relate to her severe nutritional  删除换行1 deficiency.  Her lipase remained mildly elevated for some time  删除换行1 and was last measured at 157 on ___.  She has had  删除换行1 persistent, diffuse belly pain, and bloating that may have been  删除换行1 exacerbated by residual pancreatic inflammation, but likely have  删除换行1 other underlying etiologies, as per below. She has been able to  删除换行1 eat according to her eating disorder protocol despite minor  删除换行1 symptoms of continued bloating, abdominal pain. No need to  删除换行1 reassess for acute pancreatitis unless marked flare in symptoms  删除换行1 per clinical providers.\n\n【39】Anasarca: Patient was noted to have anasarca on admission, and  删除换行1 continued to gain weight due to third spacing of her PO and  删除换行1 intravenous fluid intake; this is thought to be secondary to  删除换行1 severe malnutrition.  Her albumin reached a nadir at 1.6 on  删除换行8 ___ and was last measure dat 1.8 on ___.  Her  删除换行1 prealbumin was last measured at 16 on ___, up from 12 on  删除换行8 ___.  DVT was ruled out as a cause of lower extremity  删除换行1 swelling as MRV negative for pelvic thrombus, and an ECHO showed  删除换行1 mild Ebstein's anomaly.  In addition to leg swelling patient  删除换行1 experienced persistent bloating, especially during and after  删除换行1 meals, and found breathing difficult at these times; these  删除换行1 symptoms were thought to be attributable to her ascites which  删除换行1 appeared on abdominal CT as well.  She responded well to Lasix  删除换行1 as detailed below under management for Pulmonary edema.  Weekly  删除换行1 prealbumin checks recommended to measure nutritional progress.  \n\n【40】Pulmonary edema:  On ___, patient was noted to be hypoxic  删除换行1 while straining for a bowel movement; her oxygen saturation was  删除换行1 86% on room air and bumped to 93% on 3L oxygen by NC.  A CXR \nshowed pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion, in keeping  删除换行1 with her physiology of third-spacing in the setting of  删除换行1 hypoalbuminemia.  She responded well to 20 Lasix IV, with over  删除换行1 1L diuresis overnight and no more oxygen requirement, but her  删除换行1 blood pressure dropped from 130s to ___ systolic in response to  删除换行1 the Lasix.  Over the following days, she had intermittent  删除换行1 shortness of breath with intermittent crackles on lung exam, but  删除换行1 maintained good oxygen saturation.  She was treated gently with  删除换行4 Lasix 20mg IV BID as tolerated for 1 week, in the setting of  删除换行1 anasarca, with holding parameters for blood pressure systolic  删除换行1 >110 and BUN>55.  Her Lasix was reduced to 20mg IV daily  删除换行1 starting on ___.  At discharge, she has had no symptoms of  删除换行1 pulmonary edema for over 5 days but she continues to have  删除换行1 extremity edema.  She is being discharged on standing order for  删除换行1 20mg IV lasix daily with holding parameters of SBP<110 or  删除换行4 BUN>35. She should have strict I/Os measured, daily weights, and  删除换行1 can adjust lasix for goal >1L out as tolerated by kidney  删除换行1 function and blood pressure. While on IV lasix diuresis, she  删除换行1 should have BID lytes for repletion and following BUN. On  删除换行1 discharge, her exam is significant for 3+ pitting edema of the  删除换行1 upper and lower extremities with some old, nonweeping blisters.  \nShe is maintaining 96-100% O2 sats on RA. Her discharge weight  删除换行1 is 45.2kg, BUN is 36 and Cr is 0.6.  \n\n【41】Abdominal pain:  Patient reported a diffuse, persistent  删除换行1 abdominal pain throughout her hospitalization, even after her  删除换行1 lipase levels had normalized following pancreatitis.  There was  删除换行1 an element of nausea, bloating and of tenderness to palpation  删除换行1 over the chest as well, but a rib X-ray was negative for  删除换行1 fracture and an abdominal CT was negative for necrotizing  删除换行1 pancreatitis or abscess.  Her pain may be due to residual  删除换行1 pancreatic inflammation, refeeding in the setting of severe  删除换行1 malnutrition, stress/anxiety surrounding food, or reduced gut  删除换行1 motility.  She was treated with standing Zofran and Reglan with  删除换行1 some improvement in her symptoms and ability to tolerate food  删除换行1 and these medications should be continued after discharge.\n\n【42】Hypoglycemia:  Patient had one episode of hypoglycemia on ___, with a glucose level of 35; this responded well to a bolus of  删除换行4 D50.  Her episode of hypoglycemia was likely related to  删除换行1 pancreatitis in the setting of very poor PO intake and only  删除换行1 being given boluses of D50 as needed.  Her LFTs and INR were  删除换行1 normal, arguing against liver dysfunction as a primary cause.  \nEndocrine consulted.  TSH and T4 were WNL and T3 was depressed  删除换行1 at 51.  Since ___, patient agreed to D5 infusion and her  删除换行1 glucose levels have been stable above 60 since ___. On  删除换行1 week prior to discharge, patient has been off any IVF completely  删除换行1 and has had no issues with hypoglycemia. Her sugars are now  删除换行1 running in the ___ at discharge. \n\n【43】Status post 1 episode of hypotension:  On ___, patient  删除换行1 had a drop in her blood puressure to 78/50s.  Her heart rate was  删除换行1 normal and she was afebrile and asymptomatic.  This episode of  删除换行1 hypotension was likely due to fluid loss in the setting of  删除换行1 pancreatitis.  Her blood pressure responded well to a fluid  删除换行1 bolus and she has had no further episodes of hypotension.\n\n【44】Cough and difficulty with speech:  Patient has reported  删除换行1 difficulty speaking and a dry cough, which may be related to  删除换行4 GERD, severe malnutrition, and/or a component of pulmonary  删除换行1 edema.  Speech and swallow eval was negative for aspiration.  \nShe was treated with PPI, Maalox and guaifenisin cough  删除换行1 suppressant, but still reports intermittent nonproductive cough  删除换行1 with no evidence of infection. No need for workup unless becomes  删除换行1 productive.\n\n【45】Urinary Tract Infection:  On ___, patient complained of  删除换行1 pain with urination (had Foley in place).  A UA was positive for  删除换行1 infection and patient was treated with a 10-day course of  删除换行1 ciprofloxacin (___).  Symptoms resolved.  The patient had  删除换行1 her foley removed prior to discharge. \n\n【46】Headaches and double vision.  Patient reports headaches and  删除换行1 double vision every morning over the psat ~6 days (since ___. \n On testing, sees a single finger when focused on it (from any  删除换行1 distance), but reports seeing the items on her wall in double. \nLikely in relation to her known myopia. Symptoms sometimes  删除换行1 resolve by noon but sometime return in the evening.  Reports  删除换行1 relief with Tylenol.  Electrolytes have been within normal  删除换行1 limits. \n\n【47】Anemia: Hematocrit has been low but variable throughouut  删除换行1 hospitalization (ranging about ___, with 1 level at 44  删除换行1 secondary to hemoconcentration from pancreatitis), representing  删除换行1 a macrocytic anemia with an MCV around 110. B12 and folate were  删除换行1 normal during last admission; the anemia is likely secondary to  删除换行1 overall malnutrition.  Patient was transfused 2 units of packed  删除换行1 red blood cells on ___ for a hematocrit of 20.2, with a  删除换行1 brisk response to 32.0 the next morning.  Daily fluctuations may  删除换行1 be attributable to rapid fluid shifts. No need to check Hct on a  删除换行1 regular basis. \n\n【48】Reactive Thrombocytosis:  Patient's platelet count climbed  删除换行1 gradually: it was elevated at 543 on ___, peaked at 732 on  删除换行8 ___, and was 632 at discharge.  The differential diagnoses  删除换行1 included drug reaction vs. infection vs. reactive  删除换行1 thrombocytosis.  Her only new medications were ciprofloxacin  删除换行1 (which usually causes bone marrow suppression), TPN, and Reglan,  删除换行1 not thought to be associated with thrombocytosis.  She has been  删除换行1 afebrile, with a resolving UTI and no evidence of other  删除换行1 infection. \n\n【49】Osteoporosis vs. osteomalacia:  Patient has longstanding low  删除换行1 bone density due to malnutrition which is likely etiology of her  删除换行1 multiple hip fractures.  She has been treated with calcium and  删除换行1 vitamin D supplementation.  She will need to follow up with  删除换行4 Endocrinology for a repeat bone mineral density to determine a  删除换行1 baseline.  She should then repeat the study in ___ months, and  删除换行1 may be considered for a trial of bisphosphonates or PTH if her  删除换行1 bone density does not improve.  If this fails, should consider  删除换行4 Forteo. She was discharged with a followup appointment with  删除换行1 endocrinology. \n\n【50】Hypothyroidism:  TSH was WNL; home levothyroxine was continued.  \n\n【51】Insomnia: Patient has had some difficulty with sleeping; was  删除换行1 given trazodone PRN.  On the day prior to discharge, Psychiatry  删除换行1 recommended Remeron 7.5mg qHS to help with both sleep and  删除换行1 appetite, but patient has declined at this time.  Can revisit  删除换行1 this option with psychiatry later.  \n\n【52】Communication: Patient's sister, ___, very involved with ___. \n___  \n\n【53】Medications on Admission:\nLevothyroxine 125 mcg daily  \nOmeprazole 20mg PO daily  \nCalcium Vitamin D3 (600mg/400 Units) PO BID  \n\n【54】Discharge Medications:\n1.

We performed an echocardiogram  删除换行1 that did not show any relevant abnormality.

During  删除换行1 hospitalization we watched for any new neurologic deficits,  删除换行1 however, after seeing none and determining through past records  删除换行1 that the gait abnormality is chronic, the patient was discharged  删除换行1 to rehab. Further workup that was undertaken included checking  删除换行4 B12 levels (found to be elevated, not low), and a TSH which was  删除换行1 found to be low. Levothyroxine dose was lowered to 125mcg from  删除换行1 150mcg. TSH should be rechecked in 6 weeks.\n\n【35】#Pneumothorax\nA possible small apical pneumothorax was seen on initial CXR. \nPrior to discharge this xray was repeated which showed  删除换行1 resolution of this pneumothorax.\n\n【36】#Tracheal Deviation\nA chest xray showed likely tracheal deviation. This may indicate  删除换行1 a goiter, though none seen on CT. \n\n【37】#Low TSH\nFound to likely be receiving too high a dose of synthroid. \nLevothyroxine dose was adjusted to 125mcg from 150mcg.

Although asymptomatic,  删除换行1 given the ___ recent hx of fall, reasonable to treat as  删除换行1 this could contribute to gait instability/hypotension. A repeat  删除换行1 urine culture prior to discharge on ___ was negative after  删除换行1 treatment with antibiotics.\n\n【39】#HTN: \nHCTZ, labetolol, and candesartan were discontinued.

Initially worked  删除换行1 up for infectious causes, work-up largely negative other than  删除换行1 findings of colitis on imaging, for which she was empirically  删除换行1 tarted with 7 days of CTX/Flagyl.

Severity of diarrhea is reported to be worst in the days  删除换行1 immediately following chemotherapy, with slight improvement  删除换行1 between doses. Would also strongly consider secretory diarrhea  删除换行1 from her underlying etiology. Malabsorption from pancreatic  删除换行1 enzyme deficiency is also a possible cause, but would not expect  删除换行1 it to result in imaging findings seen on CT. C.diff negative. Completed 7-day course of CTX/Flagyl for empiric treatment of  删除换行1 colitis on ___. To address any contribution from malabsorption  删除换行1 from pancreatic enzyme deficiency, Creon was up titrated per  删除换行1 nutrition recommendations. Over course of hospitalization,  删除换行1 required significant IVF resuscitation due to dehydration and  删除换行1 intravascular depletion from her extensive GI losses. Infectious  删除换行1 stool studies negative, and celiac testing was also negative. GI  删除换行4 and palliative care were both consulted, and recommended  删除换行1 strating an aggressive anti-diarrheal regimen, including  删除换行1 standing loperamide, lamotil, cholestyramine, and rifaxamin \n(empiric SIBO treatment - ___1 = ___. Opium  删除换行1 tinctures were trialed but discontinued due to confusion. \nColonoscopy was considered but ultimately deferred when patient  删除换行1 diarrhea finally began to improve on ___. \n\n【19】 # Pancytopenia \nPatient had worsening leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia  删除换行1 on admission. Most likely due to chemotherapy, as patient is  删除换行4 C3D16 of mFOLFOX. Would also consider acute suppression iso  删除换行1 infection, vs marrow suppression iso ___ toxicity. ANC 200 on  删除换行8 ___, improved to 2300 as of ___ after neupogen dose. For  删除换行1 anemia, also considered consumptive process given coagulopathy  删除换行1 as below. Haptoglobin normal, retic count suggests  删除换行1 hypoproliferative process.

Highest  删除换行1 suspicion is for nutritional deficiency, but also considered DIC  删除换行4 in setting of her known malignancy. Reassuringly, platelet count  删除换行1 has been relatively stable, and fibrinogen low-normal on ___. \nINR greatly improved to 1.5 after vitamin K challenge, and ___  删除换行8 and PTT also near normal at discharge \n # Hyponatremia \nSodium of 127 on ___, after being stable in 131 range  删除换行1 for several days. Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given  删除换行1 ongoing need for IVF resuscitation, with component of poor  删除换行1 solute intake as well. Urine lytes strongly suggestive of  删除换行1 dehydration/intrasvascular depletion, and Na improved to 135 on  删除换行8 ___ after IV albumin resuscitation. \n\n【21】 # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis \nBicarb dropping to 14 as of ___, likely due to loss in stool. \nRequired 100 mEq of sodium bicarbonate on ___, with  删除换行1 appropriate increase to 19. Diarrhea was managed as above, and  删除换行1 bicarb ultimately stabilized and near-normalized with  删除换行1 improvement in diarrhea. \n\n【22】 # Somnolence \n # Altered Mental Status (resolved) \nPatient very somnolent overnight on ___, likely due to  删除换行1 side effects of lorazepam, in conjunction with multiple  删除换行1 anti-diarrheals that could have sedation effects: loperamide,  删除换行1 lamotil, and tincture of opium. Had worsening of mental status  删除换行1 on ___ in the evening, resolved after discontinuing  删除换行1 medications. \n\n【23】 # ___ \nCr rose to 1.3 as of ___, from baseline 0.6-0.8. Most likely  删除换行1 pre-renal, improved to baseline after volume resuscitation with  删除换行4 IV albumin. \n\n【24】 # Nausea/Vomiting\n # Regurgitation \n # GERD Patient noted to be \"regurgitating\" food after eating,  删除换行1 initially attributed to nausea, but patient feels may be related  删除换行1 to heartburn. She denies any nausea at this time, but seems to  删除换行1 vomit regularly when taking PO medications. She was started on  删除换行1 40mg omeprazole daily and standing BID Zofran, to good effect. \n\n【25】 # Tachycardia \nLikely secondary to hypovolemia from frequent diarrhea. Remains  删除换行1 in sinus on EKG. Ultimately improved after IVF resuscitation. \n\n【26】 # Lower Extremeity Edema \n # Weight Gain \nPatient gained ___ 30 lbs over course of hospitalization,  删除换行1 likely reflecting iatrogenic fluid overload from her aggressive  删除换行1 fluid resuscitation, which was needed to maintain intravascular  删除换行1 volumes in light of her ongoing severe diarrhea. However, given  删除换行1 her chronic malnutrition and low albumin levels, she had severe  删除换行1 third-spacing. Improved when fluid was transitioned from LR to  删除换行1 5% albumin. Intermittently diuresed with 20 IV Lasix boluses. \nWas still volume up on exam by discharge, felt that she would  删除换行1 auto-diurese on her own and would improve with compression  删除换行1 stockings  删除换行4  CHRONIC ISSUES: \n============= \n# Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer \n# Chronic Neoplasm Associated Pain  删除换行1 (on mFOLFOX C3D1 ___ Follows with Dr. ___.

In 删除换行8 ___ she noticed color changes to her bilateral toes she was 删除换行1 seen by her PCP and was given nifedipine however developed 删除换行1 bilateral lower extremity edema and therefore nifedipine was 删除换行1 stopped and was then initiated on amitriptyline.  Given these 删除换行1 ongoing progression of her neuropathy she was referred to 删除换行1 rheumatology for a complete workup at which time she did have 删除换行1 labs to show an M spike 1 of 0.5 and  M spike 2  of 1.2 both of 删除换行1 which were found to be IgG kappa.

In 删除换行1 consultation with rheumatology and after EMG they did feel that 删除换行1 her neuropathy was most consistent with a vasculitic neuropathy 删除换行1 and therefore she was started on cyclophosphamide 150mg daily  删除换行1 and 删除换行1 prednisone 80mg daily x 2 weeks and now 70mg daily. However  删除换行1 given 删除换行1 her monoclonal protein she was refereed to Dr ___ to have  删除换行1 a 删除换行1 complete workup for monoclonal gammopathy in ___.  This 删除换行1 workup included a skeletal survey and bone marrow biopsy.  She  删除换行1 at 删除换行1 that point had already started on Cytoxan and prednisone for  删除换行1 what 删除换行1 was thought to be this vasculitic neuropathy.

There is  删除换行1 exuberant 删除换行1 ventral and dorsal osteophyte formation with mild effacement of  删除换行1 the ventral 删除换行1 thecal sac and a small osteophyte fragment at the C6 to C7 level  删除换行1 without 删除换行1 evidence of overt canal stenosis. Also noted is multilevel facet  删除换行1 and 删除换行1 uncovertebral joint hypertrophy. There is heterotopic  删除换行1 ossification noted 删除换行1 within the dorsal soft tissues of the neck. The prevertebral  删除换行1 soft tissues are 删除换行1 normal. The airway is patent. There is a partially visualized  删除换行1 large right 删除换行1 pleural effusion and bilateral interstitial prominence at the  删除换行1 apices in 删除换行1 addition to emphysematous changes. There are prominent vascular  删除换行1 calcifications 删除换行1 identified.\n\n【16】IMPRESSION:\n\n【17】Marked multilevel degenerative change of the cervical spine  删除换行1 without evidence 删除换行1 of acute fracture. Dorsal osteophyte fragment at the C6-C7 level  删除换行1 with mild 删除换行1 effacement of the ventral subarachnoid space. If there is  删除换行1 clinical concern for 删除换行1 central cord injury an MRI may be obtained for further  删除换行1 evaluation.\n\n【18】Large right pleural effusion and bilateral emphysemetous changes  删除换行1 and 删除换行1 interstitial prominence at the lung apices.\n\n【19】CXR A and P ___: There are bibasal effusions present with  删除换行1 atelectasis in the right lower lobe.\nThe heart is enlarged. There is prominence of the pulmonary  删除换行1 vasculature 删除换行1 suggestive of CHF. There is increased density in the right upper  删除换行1 lobe which 删除换行1 may represent asymmetric CHF versus infection.\n\n【20】CONCLUSION:\n\n【21】Bibasal effusions with prominence of pulmonary vasculature and  删除换行1 enlarged heart 删除换行1 are consistent with CHF. Superimposed infection in the left  删除换行1 lower lobe cannot 删除换行1 be entirely excluded.\n\n【22】Portable CXR ___: REFERENCE EXAM: ___. \n\n【23】The moderate right pleural effusion is again seen. The small  删除换行1 left effusion is  删除换行1 larger than on the prior study. Again noted is bilateral hazy  删除换行1 vasculature  删除换行1 suggestive of fluid overload although a diffuse infectious  删除换行1 process could have  删除换行1 a similar appearance. \n\n【24】CXR ___: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___: \n\n【25】Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. No  删除换行1 pneumothorax.  \nHeart size top normal. The ground-glass and interstitial  删除换行1 pulmonary  删除换行1 abnormality present on ___ has improved in the left  删除换行1 lung, not at the  删除换行1 right base. Heart size top normal. No pneumothorax. \n\n【26】TTE ___: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric  删除换行1 left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is  删除换行1 mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate global left  删除换行1 ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). [Intrinsic left  删除换行1 ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the  删除换行1 severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular  删除换行1 cavity is dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The  删除换行1 aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a  删除换行1 minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic  删除换行1 valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral  删除换行1 valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)  删除换行1 mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  删除换行1 mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic  删除换行1 hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\n【27】There is a left to right shunt across the interatrial septum  删除换行1 consistent with an atrial septal defect (or stretched patent  删除换行1 foramen ovale). \n\n【28】Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___,  删除换行5 ___ regurgitation is now more prominent and left ventricular  删除换行1 systolic function appears similar.  \n\n【29】Brief Hospital Course:\n___ YO M w vocal cord mass, hoarseness, dysphagia and FTT.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Failure to thrive/weight loss - Upon initial impression,  删除换行1 significant concern for etiology being neck/vocal cord mass  删除换行1 impinging on airway. \n*** Vocal cord lesion component --- ENT was consulted and CT was  删除换行1 reviewed revealing that the vocal cords do indeed display  删除换行1 abnormalities which may be consistent with a malignancy and do  删除换行1 explain the patient's hoarseness but do not account for his  删除换行1 failure to thrive and are not impinging on his airway. He was  删除换行1 seen by speech and swallow who agreed that his airway is patent  删除换行1 and that he is at relatively low risk for aspiration. The vocal  删除换行1 cord lesions should be biopsied although his operative risk was  删除换行1 felt to be too high during this hospitalization. It was  删除换行1 suggested that he return to the hospital for a biopsy at a later  删除换行1 date. \n*** Psych component --- In terms of other etiologies of his FTT,  删除换行1 the patient appeared to be very depressed and displayed passive  删除换行1 suicidal idealtion. His celexa dose was increased to 30mg daily. \nPsychiatry was consulted and recommended adding mirtazapine  删除换行14 7.5mg qhs with prn zydis 2.5mg for severe anxiety. Psych also  删除换行1 recommended that the patient be followed at his residence by a  删除换行1 psychiatrist for medication titration and potential therapy. \n*** CHF/AFIB/pulm component --- It was also thought that  删除换行1 amiodarone, a new medication in the past several months, could  删除换行1 be contributing to his overall poor health as well as to  删除换行1 potential lung complications. Amiodarone was therefore stopped. \nThe patient, while subjectively short of breath, also displayed  删除换行1 episodes of desaturating to the low to mid ___ on ___ L NC. \nNebulizer treatments were given much more frequently (q4  删除换行1 standing, q2 prn) and the patient was diuresed with IV lasix for  删除换行1 acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF. His lisinopril was  删除换行1 increased from 5mg to 10mg in order to help reduce afterload in  删除换行1 the setting of echo showing worsening mitral regurg. He was also  删除换行1 started on ASA 325mg.\n*** Myelodysplastic/Anemia component --- Worsening heart failure  删除换行1 and anemia in the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome were also  删除换行1 felt to be contributing to his failure to thrive. \n*** Nutrition component --- As a result of all of the above, the  删除换行1 patient was taking very poor po which worsened throughout his  删除换行1 hospitalization. Speech and swallow as well as nutrition  删除换行1 consultants recommended that the patient take as much PO as  删除换行1 possible including ensure supplements with all meals and work  删除换行1 with physical therapy frequently to maintain his strength. It  删除换行1 was recommended that he adhere to a soft diet but family felt he  删除换行1 did better with a pureed diet with thin liquids. The patient was  删除换行1 given a pureed diet with thin liquids but continued to take  删除换行1 almost no PO. He and his family declined tube feeds or IV  删除换行4 nutrition.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Anemia in setting of Myelodysplastic Syndrome - Hematocrit was  删除换行1 monitored for stability. The patient did not require transfusion  删除换行1 during this hospitalization.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# AFIB - As above, heart rates in the high ___ to low ___. \nContinued beta blockade with metoprolol. Stopped amiodarone. \nOutpatient cardiologist was made aware. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n#. CKI - Initially slightly worse that baseline with peak 2.0  删除换行1 but improved with diursesis, again supporting his likely  删除换行1 worsening heart failure. \n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Anxiety - As above, celexa dosing was increased. Patient was  删除换行1 initially offered ativan at his family's request but, as the  删除换行1 patient reported and was noted to be confused after receiving  删除换行1 ativan, he was started on zydis 2.5mg BID PRN. Geriatrics was  删除换行1 consulted and felt the patient would greatly benefit from an  删除换行1 outpatient geriatrics consultation.\n删除1：<u>.</u>\n# Pain - Palliative care was consulted for assistance in care  删除换行1 decision making discusssions and pain management. \nRecommendations included standing tylenol ___ as well as  删除换行1 either oxycodone 2.5mg PO q4 prn or morphine oral solution ___  删除换行8 PO q4 prn for both pain and shortness of breath.删除1：<u>.</u>\nOn ___, a family meeting occured which involved internal  删除换行1 medicine, palliative care, the patient, 4 of his children,  删除换行1 social work, nursing, and case management. Goals of care were  删除换行1 discussed at this meeting and resulted in the patient and his  删除换行1 family agreeing that the patient does not want any further  删除换行1 evaluation for diagnostic purposes but rather wants to proceed  删除换行1 on a course surrounding treatment of his symptoms and comfort. \nThe family did express the desire to continue transfusions if  删除换行1 this would make the patient feel improved and if this could be  删除换行1 done in the context of hospice-like care. On ___ the patient  删除换行1 was in fair condition with stable and normal vital signs at  删除换行1 rest. He was therefore discharged to ___ with a plan for  删除换行1 hospice evaluation and likely initiation. \n\n【30】Medications on Admission:\nPer residential home records.\ntylenol 删除换行1 omeprazole 40mg daily 删除换行1 folic acid 删除换行1 metoprolol 25mg daily 删除换行1 lisinopril 5mg daily 删除换行1 amiodarone 200mg daily 删除换行1 furosemide 80mg PO qam, 40mg PO qpm 删除换行1 lipitor 40mg 删除换行1 isosorbide MN 15 mg qhs 删除换行1 docusate 删除换行1 senna 删除换行1 albuterol nebs QID 删除换行4 mucinex-syrup QID 删除换行4 regular insulin sliding scale\n\n【31】Discharge Medications:\n1.
