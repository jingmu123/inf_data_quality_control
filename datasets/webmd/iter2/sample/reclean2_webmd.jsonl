But you have the power to help yourself manage your RA every day. Here are some ways to do it.\n\n【2】Take Care of Yourself\n---------------------\n\n【3】Taking care of yourself and staying on top of the disease is a big part of RA treatment. Take your medicine as directed. Try not to skip a dose. Tell your doctor about any side effects. Talk to them or your pharmacist if you have questions.\n\n【4】Even when your pain and stiffness is less of a problem, keep up with your medical appointments. Check in with your doctor two to four times a year.\n\n【5】If you don't already see a rheumatologist, consider asking for a referral. This is a doctor who specializes in arthritis. They can review your treatment plan and see if it needs any tweaks. Studies show that people with RA who see a rheumatologist several times a year do better.\n\n【6】Exercise\n--------\n\n【7】When you have joint pain and stiffness, you may not want to move around. But you should try to stay as active as possible. It actually helps ease your symptoms and prevent long-term problems.\n\n【8】Exercise for rheumatoid arthritis usually includes:\n\n【9】*   **Stretching****.** Stretch when you get started to warm up. Stretch when you’re done to cool down.\n*   **Low-impact aerobic exercise.** These are exercises that keep your heart strong without hurting your joints. Walking, riding a bike, and swimming are good choices for people with RA. You may also try a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill.\n*   **Strengthening.** These exercises help keep your muscles strong. You might use resistance bands that gently strengthen your muscles. You can also use light weights.\n\n【10】Slow, gentle, flowing exercises like Pilates, tai chi, and yoga help boost your balance and flexibility. They may even ease your pain.\n\n【11】Research by the Arthritis Foundation shows that yoga poses, breathing, and relaxation lower joint tenderness and swelling for some people with RA. Studies show that tai chi reduces long-term pain. Pilates makes the core of your body stronger, taking pressure off your joints.\n\n【12】All of these exercises are good for your mind and your body. They can bust stress while they build strength.\n\n【13】If you have a lot of pain when you exercise, stop. Talk with your doctor or therapist before you start again.\n\n【14】See a Physical or Occupational Therapist\n----------------------------------------\n\n【15】They can help you become stronger and more flexible. Your doctor can give you a referral.\n\n【16】Therapists can show you the safest ways to move your body for everyday tasks, like lifting a box, to help protect your joints. They can also teach you exercises to do at home safely. You want to build strength, but you don't want to overdo it and trigger a flare.\n\n【17】An occupational therapist shows you ways to do specific tasks at home or at work. A physical therapist helps keep you moving. No matter which type you choose, it's best to see someone who has experience working with people who have arthritis.\n\n【18】Diet\n----\n\n【19】Although there have been many studies about diet and rheumatoid arthritis, there’s no strong proof that a special diet helps.\n\n【20】But it’s always smart to eat a balanced, healthy diet. It helps fight inflammation. Fish like salmon, trout, tuna, and sardines are full of omega-3 fatty acids that curb chemicals called cytokines, which ramp up inflammation. Studies show that omega-3s may ease joint pain and shorten the time you have stiffness in the morning.\n\n【21】You also need colorful fruits and veggies, which have antioxidants that fight damaging free-radical molecules in your body. And go for whole grains like oatmeal, brown rice, and barley. People who eat whole grains tend to have lower levels of C-reactive protein, a sign of inflammation.\n\n【22】Avoid saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugars.\n\n【23】Your doctor may also recommend:\n\n【24】*   **Vitamins** **or** **minerals****.** You may need the extra nutrients.\n*   **No alcohol.** Drinking alcohol may be a problem with some medicines for RA.\n\n【25】If you need help with your diet, your doctor may suggest that you see a nutritionist or dietitian.\n\n【26】Keep a Healthy Weight\n---------------------\n\n【27】Nearly two-thirds of people who have RA are overweight or obese. Getting to a healthier weight can lead to fewer complications and a better chance of remission.\n\n【28】Fat cells release cytokines. More fat cells means more cytokines, and more cytokines means more inflammation. That makes RA symptoms worse and causes more damage to your body.\n\n【29】Extra weight can even make some medications that treat RA less effective. Studies show that biologics and biosimilars work for only about half of people who are overweight, compared with 75% of people at a healthy weight. Some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) also don’t work as well when you’re overweight.\n\n【30】And whether you have RA or not, adding pounds to your frame puts pressure on your joints. The ones that bear weight feel the most strain, like your:\n\n【31】*   Ankles\n*   Knees\n*   Hips\n*   Low back\n*   Spine\n*   Feet\n\n【32】Combined with a disease that wears down your joints, that means double trouble.\n\n【33】Lower Stress\n------------\n\n【34】Dealing with RA can be stressful, but there are many ways to lower your stress level:\n\n【35】*   **Talk with your doctor or nurse.** They may suggest counseling or have other ideas you haven’t thought of.\n*   **Take time to rest during the day.** Balancing activity and rest is an important part of self-care for RA.\n*   **Try to relax.** Simple deep breathing can make you feel better.\n*   **Learn special techniques** like yoga and meditation. They may help you relax.\n*   **Reach out for support** from friends, family, and co-workers.\n*   **Join a class or support group.** There may be arthritis programs in your area. You can connect with others who have RA online or on social media.\n\n【36】Be Smart About Daily Tasks\n--------------------------\n\n【37】Rheumatoid arthritis doesn't have to change your daily to-do list. Some simple fixes can make it easier to get things done.\n\n【38】**Streamline your approach**\n\n【39】**Have a plan.** When you have RA, you may have less energy. So it helps to be organized. If you want to get things done tomorrow, plan how you'll do it now. Keep your goals realistic, and don't forget to schedule breaks.\n\n【40】**Save your energy.** What slows you down? Putting on your shoes? Getting ready in the morning? Once you know the things that get you stuck, you can come up with ways to make them easier.\n\n【41】**Divide up the day.** Spend 30 minutes on a task, and then do something else. Focusing too much on one thing could leave you feeling achy and fatigued. If you switch things up, you'll get more done.\n\n【42】**Pace yourself, especially on good days.** Even if you wake up feeling like you can do anything, squeezing in too much can backfire. If you overdo it -- going on a hike or gardening all afternoon -- your fatigue the next day could set you back. Tackle a high-energy task or two in the morning, take a short nap at lunchtime, and do lighter work in the afternoon.\n\n【43】**In the kitchen**\n\n【44】**Use a stool.** Don't stand while you cook. Sit and rest. You can wash dishes from a stool too.\n\n【45】**Cook simpler meals.** Stick with easy recipes, especially after work. Use shortcuts like pre-cut vegetables. Save dishes with lots of steps for weekends or nights when a family member can help. Or split up the cooking over 2 days.\n\n【46】**Put a ring on it.** Wear a plain, inexpensive ring on your thumb and use it like a bottle opener for containers of yogurt, sour cream, or other things. Position it under the lid's edge, and lift up with your hand to pop off the top.\n\n【47】**Roll large loads.** Do you need to move a heavy pot of water from the sink to the stove? Try a plant stand with wheels. Use a measuring cup to fill the pot, then push the plant stand to the stove and slide the pot onto the burner.\n\n【48】**Push a button to dice.** Use a food processor to slice, shred, or chop.\n\n【49】**Repurpose simple kitchen tools.** Get creative. For instance, when you make egg salad or deviled eggs, a handheld square butter-cutter can easily trim a peeled hard-boiled egg to the perfect size for salad. An egg slicer can perfectly cut mushrooms. Use an apple corer to slice or chop potatoes, squash, cucumbers, or pears.\n\n【50】**Plan ahead.** Do some prep work when you feel good. For example, measure out fresh herbs in tablespoons or teaspoons, and then place them in ice cube trays. Fill the trays with water, milk, or cream, and freeze. Put your \"herbsicles\" in clearly marked bags. Later, you won't need to clean and cut herbs, just grab what you need for your recipe.\n\n【51】**Go electric.** If it's tough to stir, reach for a tool that will do it for you. Use a small handheld electric blender instead of a spoon. Look for one that also has a whisk.\n\n【52】**Bathing and dressing**\n\n【53】**Go gadget shopping.** Think about what's hard or painful in the bathroom, and pick up a few aids. Is it hard to squeeze out toothpaste? Look for an automatic dispenser. Do you have hip pain? A raised toilet seat can be much more comfortable. Wide-handled toothbrushes and hairbrushes, grab bars, and soap in pump bottles can make things easier. An occupational therapist can help you with the tasks of daily life.\n\n【54】**Use a shower chair.** Even if you think you don't really need one, it may help you relax while you bathe without putting more stress on your joints. A showerhead that you can adjust or hold can help too.\n\n【55】**Change your wardrobe.** Make getting dressed smoother by choosing clothes that are easier to put on, or adapt the clothes you have. Bigger buttons, Velcro fasteners, elastic shoelaces, and rings for zipper pulls can make it faster to dress. So can tools like a long-handled shoehorn.\n\n【56】**Around the house**\n\n【57】**Lift carefully.** Use both hands when you pick up a gallon of milk or a jug of laundry detergent. Slide a heavy object instead of lifting it, when possible. Get laundry baskets with wheels.\n\n【58】**Don't lug cleaning supplies up and down the stairs.** Keep a supply closet on each floor. Instead of carrying your vacuum, think about a lightweight rechargeable vacuum for each floor.\n\n【59】**Garden without pain.** Instead of crouching or kneeling, sit on a low stool while you're working outside. Some benches have wheels that make them easier to move. Try working on raised beds instead of on the ground. Look for ergonomic garden tools that are easier to use.\n\n【60】**Shop online.** It’s easier and faster than trekking to the mall. Save your energy for the things you enjoy doing. If using a keyboard hurts, consider getting voice recognition software to do your online buying.\n\n【61】Make Your Office Work for You\n-----------------------------\n\n【62】Whether you’re on your feet all day or sit in front of a computer, use these tips to feel better.\n\n【63】**Pay attention to posture.** Good posture is extra important with RA. If yours is off, even if you’re sitting, it will stress your joints and can boost fatigue. Instead, imagine a string running from the ceiling to the top of your head. Lift your head, neck, and shoulders along that string. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your pelvis upright; don’t let it tilt forward or backward. And don’t lock your knees.\n\n【64】**Mix up positions and tasks.** If you work at a desk, make a point of getting up and moving around throughout the day. Stretch in your chair, go for a walk at lunchtime, and take the long way to the copier or restroom. If you can, switch between standing and sitting. If your job involves repetitive movement, such as turning bolts on machinery or typing, break it up with other duties if possible. Switch back and forth between light and heavy tasks.\n\n【65】**Tweak your stance.** If you stand for most of the day, put one foot on a step, a low stool, or a book so that it’s a little higher than the other. This helps keep your pelvis in alignment. Switch feet every now and then. Wear shoes with good cushioning and support, and keep heels an inch high or less. Special inserts (orthotics) may also help. Organize your work area so that you don't have to lift, reach, or carry too much. If you work in different areas, consider an apron or tool belt to carry the items you need.\n\n【66】**Rethink your chair.** Make sure it has lower back support. Ask for an ergonomic chair that supports your lower spine, reclines, and rotates or swivels so you can move easily from one task to another. If your chair doesn't have back support, put a pillow or rolled-up towel between your lower back and the chair. Sit straight, with your back and shoulders against the back of the chair. You may also need to adjust the height of your desk and chair. You should be able to sit with your feet flat on the floor and your knees slightly higher than your hips. Prop your feet on a stool or book, if necessary.\n\n【67】**Rethink your computer.** Try to keep your elbows at a right angle and your wrists relaxed when you type. Keyboard wrist rests add support. Tilt the keyboard down and slightly away from you to take the strain off your wrists. The computer screen should be at eye level directly in front of you, not off to the side.\n\n【68】**Troubleshoot your telephone.** Don’t cradle the receiver between your shoulder and ear. It leads to shoulder and back pain, and fatigue. If you're on the phone a lot, use a headset receiver.\n\n【69】**Lift the right way.** Use your largest and strongest joints to lift items. For instance, always use your leg muscles, bending at the knees, not the waist. Steady yourself with a heavy chair or other piece of furniture if you need to. Rely on your arms to lift rather than your hands. Use your palms or forearms; don’t grip them with your fingers. Hold your arms and the item close to your body so you don’t strain your back.\n\n【70】**Ask a pro.** Your employer may be able to set up a professional evaluation of your workspace, so ask your HR department. An occupational or physical therapist can also help you learn how to do tasks on the job with less stress to your joints.\n\n【71】**Consider assistive devices.** Gadgets like big-grip pens and long drawer handles are made for people with arthritis and other joint problems. An electric stapler or pencil sharpener may be easier to use than a manual one.\n\n【72】Get Out and About\n-----------------\n\n【73】Don’t let rheumatoid arthritis keep you from going out and doing the things you've always enjoyed. Whether you want to shop, eat out with friends, or go to a game, you can do it. You might just need to tweak your plans and do a little more to prepare.\n\n【74】**Going out for the day**\n\n【75】**Plan ahead.** If you’re going somewhere new, do some phone or online research so you know what to expect. If you have a walker or wheelchair, find out whether the building is easy to use. If walking is hard, ask how far it is from the parking lot to the door.\n\n【76】**Be clear with your friends.** Before you head out, be open about how your RA affects you. Ask your friends to be flexible. You may need to pare down the schedule a little and take time for breaks. Don’t keep mum and then overdo it, or you could risk a flare.\n\n【77】**Start later.** Mornings can be tough with RA, and it may take time for your stiff joints to loosen up. So plan outings for later in the morning when you can.\n\n【78】**Get an aisle seat.** Going to the movies? Sit by the aisle so you can stretch your legs.\n\n【79】**Shopping**\n\n【80】**Carry carefully.** Carry shopping bags over your forearm. You'll spare the weaker joints in your fingers and wrist. If you can, put your purchases in a backpack or bag with a shoulder or cross-body strap.\n\n【81】**Come equipped.** If shoulder pain makes it hard to reach high shelves, bring a reacher, a rod with a clamp at the end.\n\n【82】**Don't be shy if you need help.** Ask for some assistance if you feel stressed or worn out. Lots of stores have motorized scooters. Some have people on staff who can help you.\n\n【83】**Dining out**\n\n【84】**Bring utensils.** If RA affects your wrists and hands, it may be hard to lift heavy glasses or grip thin forks or knives. If that's a problem, bring your own fork, knife, and spoon. Ask for drinks in plastic or paper cups.\n\n【85】**Take a chair.** If RA in your hips makes it hard to sit, ask for a chair with arms. You’ll find it easier to get up and down. Stay out of booths, which could be tough to manage.\n\n【86】**Avoid having to cut food.** If your hands and wrists hurt, see if the kitchen will cut your food before it's served. You might be surprised by how many are willing to do so. Or order something that doesn't need cutting, like a stir-fry or pasta.\n\n【87】**Watch your alcohol.** It's easy to lose track of drinks when you're out with friends. But remember that you need to limit or avoid alcohol if you’re taking certain medications, like methotrexate.\n\n【88】Travel Smart\n------------\n\n【89】**Before you go**\n\n【90】**Do your homework.** Find out as much as you can about your destination and plan all the details you can, including what places you'll go, how you'll get there, and what your travel companions can do when you need a rest.\n\n【91】**Time it right.** Choose a time when you're most likely to feel your best. If you tend to get flares during the heat of the summer or the hustle and bustle of the holidays, for example, try to avoid traveling during those times.\n\n【92】**Don't rush.** Although vacations can be fun and restful, they can also be stressful. Try to have an extra day at the start of your vacation to prepare and another at the end to rest and recover before you go back to your regular schedule.\n\n【93】**Ask about** **immunizations****.** If you're leaving the country, ask your doctor about any vaccines you may need. Remind them of what medicines you take, since some immunizations aren't advised if you take medications that weaken your immune system.\n\n【94】**What to pack**\n\n【95】**Choose the right suitcase.** Buy a suitcase or bag with wheels, and push it instead of pulling. Use both hands to take it easy on your hands and shoulders.\n\n【96】**Pack light.** Lighter bags will be easier to carry. If you must lift your suitcase -- into your car trunk or the overhead bin on a plane, for example -- find someone who can help.\n\n【97】**Don't forget your health info.** Write down a brief medical history and list of medications you take. Include contact information for your primary care doctor and rheumatologist, as well as your health insurance information.\n\n【98】**Mind your medications.** Pack more medicine than you think you'll need, and divide it among your bags. If one bag is lost, you should still have enough medicine to get by. Leave a copy of your prescriptions with a friend or family member back home. If you lose your medications or are gone longer than expected, have them send you your prescription.\n\n【99】**On your way**\n\n【100】**Don't just sit there.** Sitting for hours in a car, plane, bus, or train can lead to stiff joints. When driving, stop once an hour to stretch and walk. On a plane, train, or bus, try to get an aisle seat so you can stretch and walk around.\n\n【101】**Avoid crowds.** Avoid standing in long lines and flying in crowded planes. Ask the airline or travel agent about times with the least traffic.\n\n【102】**Bring a doctor's note.** If you use medications that require needles, bring a doctor's note or prescription in case you're asked about them at airport security.\n\n【103】**Avoid stops.** When possible, choose nonstop flights. That way, you won't have to walk long distances through unfamiliar airports.\n\n【104】**Arrange for assistive devices.** If you use a wheelchair, label it with your name, address, and destination airport -- and ask that it be loaded \"last on/first off.\" If you use a cane, you can take it on board with you. You'll need to stow it at takeoff and landing, but you can use it during the flight.\n\n【105】**Where to stay**\n\n【106】**Pick your room location.** When you make hotel reservations, look for a room on or near the main level so you can skip the stairs.\n\n【107】**Request a refrigerator.** If you take medications that need to be refrigerated, an in-room refrigerator is a must. It can also come in handy if you need a quick snack to take medications or to boost your energy level after a day of sightseeing.\n\n【108】**Look for amenities.** A pool can help you stick to your exercise routine, a hot tub can ease sore joints, and an on-site restaurant or room service is helpful if you don't feel like going out to eat.\n\n【109】Don’t Skip Intimacy\n-------------------\n\n【110】Besides the joy of being intimate with your partner, there's an extra perk when you have RA: Sex is a painkiller, thanks to your body's feel-good chemicals called endorphins, and those effects can last for hours.\n\n【111】Be open about your RA and how it makes you feel. If you're nervous about talking about how your symptoms affect the way you want to be intimate, write your partner a letter. Share what feels good and what hurts. If you make the first move on good days, your partner will be more understanding on the days when you don't feel 100%.\n\n【112】Take time to enjoy foreplay. Use gentle massage to relax muscles and joints. Get creative with positions to avoid putting stress on painful joints.\n\n【113】Also, try props like pillows or cushions to support your hips, shoulders, neck, or back. Or add a vibrator for stimulation during foreplay.\n\n【114】Many women have vaginal dryness as they get older. It's also a problem if you have Sjogren's syndrome, a condition often seen with RA. Vaginal lubricants, moisturizers, or estrogen creams can help.\n\n【115】If you have concerns, talk to your doctor. You may want to get a referral to a sex therapist who has experience helping people with RA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:17:59", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:18:49", "cost": 49.694}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:03", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:18:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:17:59"}

Over the long run, your symptoms may not be the same as a friend or neighbor who also has the disease. How you'll feel depends such things as:\n\n【1】*   How advanced your RA was when you learned you had it\n*   Your age when you were diagnosed\n*   How \"active\" your disease is\n\n【2】How RA Symptoms Progress Over Time\n----------------------------------\n\n【3】Everyone is different, but there are a few common patterns in the way RA plays out over the years:\n\n【4】*   **Long remissions.** When you're in one of these periods, your pain and stiffness go away or get much better, but you aren't cured. In a few people with RA -- about 5% to 10% -- the disease starts suddenly, and then they have no symptoms for many years, even decades.\n*   **Symptoms that come and go.** This happens to about 15% of people with rheumatoid arthritis. You may have periods of few or no problems that can last months between flare-ups.\n*   **Progressive** **rheumatoid arthritis****.** Most people in this situation need a long-term treatment plan and a coordinated medical team to manage the condition and slow or stop it from getting worse.\n\n【5】Stages of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n------------------------------\n\n【6】There are four stages. Each has its own treatment options.\n\n【7】Stage 1:\n\n【8】*   In the early stages, your joint lining, or synovium, becomes inflamed. The bones aren’t damaged yet. But the tissue around them often swells, making your joint stiff and painful.\n\n【9】Stage 2:\n\n【10】*   In this moderate stage, inflammation damages your cartilage, the cushiony stuff that protects the ends of your bones.\n*   The joint will be stiff, and you won’t be able to move it as far as you used to. The doctor will say you’ve lost range of motion.\n\n【11】Stage 3:\n\n【12】*   This is the severe stage. Inflammation is wearing away cartilage and causes erosion of bones near your joints. The joints may become unstable. You might start to notice deformities as the bones move around. You’ll have pain, swelling, and loss of motion.\n\n【13】Stage 4:\n\n【14】*   In end-stage RA, inflammation stops, but the damage continues. The joint might stop working. You’ll still have pain, swelling, stiffness, and lack of motion. Your muscles may be weak, too. It could be time for joint replacement surgery.\n\n【15】How Your Treatment Changes as RA Progresses\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【16】**Early stage.** A key focus is to control the inflammation. That’s especially critical in the early phase of the disease to prevent joint damage. You may get:\n\n【17】*   A low-dose steroid\n*   A disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as methotrexate\n*   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, for pain\n\n【18】Quitting smoking and losing any extra weight also can help slow your RA.\n\n【19】**Moderate stage.** This is when you may have trouble with regular daily activities because of pain. You also may tire more easily. There are several options. Your doctor may have you try combining methotrexate with two other DMARD medications, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Another option is a stronger form of DMARDs, called biologic DMARDs, including:\n\n【20】*   Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia)\n*   Etanercept (Enbrel)\n*   Golimumab (Simponi)\n*   Adalimumab (Humira)\n*   Infliximab (Remicade)\n\n【21】Instead of a biologic, your doctor may recommend a JAK inhibitor, including:\n\n【22】*   Baricitinib (Olumiant)\n*   Tofacitinib (Xeljanz)\n*   Upadacitinib (Rinvoq)\n\n【23】If a certain joint is particularly inflamed, your doctor may give the joint steroid shots. Once your pain is under control, it’s important to exercise to keep ahead of your RA. You also may need physical therapy.\n\n【24】**Severe stage.** If a TNF inhibitor fails to improve your symptoms, your doctor may recommend you try a different TNF inhibitor or a different class of biologic. If you don’t respond to one, you may respond to another.\n\n【25】Surgery is a last-resort treatment for very severe RA. That includes when your joints are deformed and damaged and limit your mobility. The three most common surgeries for RA are:\n\n【26】*   **Joint replacement.** Surgeons replace damaged knee, hip, or other joints with man-made replacement parts.\n*   **Joint fusion.** This is when two joints are fused and realigned.\n*   **Tendon repair.** Your surgeon may realign damaged ligaments or transfer tendons to ease pain or to restore function.\n\n【27】Signs Your RA Is Progressing\n----------------------------\n\n【28】How can you tell your RA is getting worse? There's no easy way, but some general signs include:\n\n【29】*   Flares that are intense or last a long time\n*   Diagnosis at a young age, which means the disease has more time to become active in your body\n*   Rheumatoid nodules -- bumps under your skin, often around your elbows\n*   Active inflammation that shows up in tests of joint fluid or blood\n*   Damage on X-rays when you were diagnosed\n*   High levels of rheumatoid factor or citrulline antibody in blood tests\n\n【30】Is Remission Possible?\n----------------------\n\n【31】Early and more aggressive treatment raise your chances of remission. But it’s more likely if you have low or good scores on these RA assessments when you’re diagnosed:\n\n【32】*   **Disease activity score (DAS) or other measures of disease activity:** It uses joint tenderness, signs of inflammation in your blood, and pain levels to rate disease activity.\n*   **Health assessment questionnaire (HAQ):** It gauges how well you can do activities in eight daily life categories.\n*   **C-reactive protein levels:** You’ll get a blood test to look for these signs of inflammation in your blood.\n\n【33】See Your Rheumatologist\n-----------------------\n\n【34】Your RA doctor can check to see how your disease has changed.

Here are some key questions to ask yourself before you get pierced:\n\n【1】*   **Do you have your parents' permission?** Most places require you to have parental consent if you are under age 18. So be sure to check with your parents before getting pierced.\n*   **What does your school say**? Some schools don't allow students to have facial piercings.\n*   **Are you looking for a job?** Some jobs don't allow employees to have facial piercings. Make sure the piercing is appropriate for your daily life.\n*   **Are you thinking of donating blood?** Some organizations don't accept blood from people who have been pierced within the last year.\n*   **Are you up to date with your vaccines?** It's a good idea to make sure you're vaccinated for diseases such as hepatitis B and tetanus before you get a piercing.\n\n【2】Is piercing safe?\n-----------------\n\n【3】When done in a clean and professional environment, piercing is usually safe. But if piercing equipment is unclean, there is a risk of getting blood-transmitted diseases. These include:\n\n【4】*   Hepatitis B\n*   Hepatitis C\n*   Tetanus\n*   HIV\n\n【5】Even in a sterile (germ-free) environment, some common risks of piercing are:\n\n【6】*   Chronic infection\n*   Skin allergies\n*   Abscesses (pus-filled, painful areas of skin)\n*   Inflammation or nerve damage\n*   Prolonged bleeding\n\n【7】In general, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor before a piercing if you:\n\n【8】*   Have diabetes\n*   Have a heart condition\n*   Have a weakened immune system\n*   Are pregnant\n*   Take herbal supplements\n\n【9】Where should I go to get my piercing done?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【10】A sterile environment is the most important thing to consider when deciding where to go to get pierced.\n\n【11】Here are some tips for finding a safe place to get your piercing done:\n\n【12】*   Check with your doctor. Some doctors' offices will do basic ear piercings.\n*   Research piercing shops that use safe procedures or are licensed by the state.\n*   If you are going to a stand in a mall, make sure employees use a sterile, single-use piercing gun.\n\n【13】NEVER do this:\n\n【14】*   Pierce yourself or have a friend pierce you.\n*   Get pierced in a shop that looks unclean, makes you uncomfortable, or doesn't answer all your questions.\n\n【15】How do I know that my piercing shop is safe and sterile?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Many states regulate body piercing, but not all. Before getting your piercing, you should always check for these signs of a safe piercing environment:\n\n【17】*   The piercer washes their hands with germicidal soap.\n*   The piercer wears fresh disposable gloves.\n*   The shop is clean.\n*   The shop uses an autoclave (a special sterilizing machine).\n*   The equipment is sterilized or disposable.\n*   The needle is new and disposed of in a special container after use.\n\n【18】Should I get pierced with a piercing gun or a needle?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Needles are generally considered cleaner and easier to sterilize than piercing guns. Your piercer should only use a piercing gun that is for one-time use or has sterilized disposable cassettes.\n\n【20】Piercing guns should only be used on earlobe piercings. That's because they can cause more damage to the skin tissue than needles. \n\n【21】How long will it take for my piercing to heal?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Healing times can vary depending on the location of the piercing. Here are the average healing times for common piercings:\n\n【23】*   Earlobe: 6 to 8 weeks\n*   Ear cartilage: 4 months to 1 year\n*   Eyebrow: 6 to 8 weeks\n*   Nostril: 2 to 4 months\n*   Nasal septum: 6 to 8 months\n*   Tongue: 4 weeks\n*   Lip: 2 to 3 months\n*   Belly button: 4 months to 1 year\n\n【24】Remember, with mouth or lip piercing, jewelry can cause cracks in your teeth or receding gums. Lip piercings and mouth piercings can get infected more easily.\n\n【25】How can I care for my new piercing?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】Your piercer will give you specific instructions for cleaning your piercing. Here are some general dos and don'ts for new piercings:\n\n【27】**Do:**\n\n【28】*   Wash your hands before cleaning the piercing.\n*   Clean the pierced area with antibacterial soap or hypochlorous acid.\n*   Soak the piercing in salt water. This will cleanse it and loosen crusty formations.\n*   Rinse with an alcohol-free, antibacterial mouthwash or hypochlorous acid.(for tongue and lip piercings).\n*   Use a topical antibiotic.\n\n【29】**Don't:**\n\n【30】*   Pick at or touch the piercing. This can irritate it and lead to infection.\n*   Use alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean the piercing. This can dry out your skin and break down new tissue.\n*   Use public pools or hot tubs while the piercing is healing.\n*   Wear makeup during the healing process (for ear or facial piercings).\n*   Wear tight clothes (for body piercings).\n\n【31】What happens if my piercing becomes infected?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Some temporary pain or swelling is normal after a piercing. But if pain continues, it could mean an infection.\n\n【33】Be extra careful if you get an oral piercing. These are more susceptible to infection because of bacteria in the mouth. Contact with jewelry against the teeth can also cause your teeth to crack or chip.\n\n【34】Watch out for these signs of infection:\n\n【35】*   Pain that does not go away after a day or two\n*   Unusual pain or swelling\n*   Yellow, bad-smelling discharge\n*   Prolonged bleeding\n*   Excessive redness\n\n【36】If you think your piercing may be infected:\n\n【37】*   Don't take out the jewelry. This will cause the hole to close up and may trap the infection.\n*   See your doctor for treatment.\n\n【38】What if I am sensitive to metal?\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】Some people have sensitivities to certain kinds of metal jewelry. Signs you could be allergic to your new piercing include:\n\n【40】*   Redness\n*   Itching or burning when piercing is cleaned\n*   Rash surrounding the piercing\n\n【41】 To avoid an allergic reaction, use only nontoxic metals, such as:\n\n【42】*   Surgical-grade steel\n*   14- or 18-karat gold\n*   Titanium\n*   Niobium\n*   Platinum", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:13:02", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:13:48", "cost": 45.798}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:03", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:13:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:13:02"}

Cancer is a term reserved for malignant tumors.\n*   Malignant tumors can grow and spread aggressively, overpowering healthy cells by taking their space, blood, and nutrients. They can also spread to distant parts of the body. Like all cells of the body, tumor cells need blood and nutrients to survive.\n*   Tumors that don’t invade nearby tissue or spread to distant areas are called benign.\n\n【3】In general, a benign tumor is less serious than a malignant tumor. But a benign tumor can still cause problems in your brain by pressing on nearby tissue.\n\n【4】In the U.S. brain or nervous system tumors affect about 6 of every 1,000 people.\n\n【5】Primary Brain Cancers\n---------------------\n\n【6】The brain is made up of many different types of cells.\n\n【7】*   Some brain cancers happen when one type of cell changes from its normal characteristics. Once transformed, the cells grow and multiply in abnormal ways.\n*   As these abnormal cells grow, they become a mass, or tumor.\n*   The brain tumors that result are called primary brain tumors because they start in your brain.\n*   The most common primary brain tumors are gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas). The term glioma includes glioblastomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas.\n*   Most of these are named after the part of the brain or the type of brain cell from which they arise.\n\n【8】Metastatic Brain Cancer\n-----------------------\n\n【9】Metastatic brain tumors are made of cancerous cells from a tumor elsewhere in the body. The cells spread to your brain from another tumor in a process called metastasis. This is the most common type of brain tumor.\n\n【10】Causes of Brain Cancer\n----------------------\n\n【11】The exact cause of most brain cancer is unknown. Genetic factors, various environmental toxins, radiation to the head, HIV, and cigarette smoking have all been linked to cancers of the brain. In most cases, no clear cause can be shown.\n\n【12】Diagnosing Brain Cancer\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Your doctor will start by asking questions and giving you a physical exam to see if you have a problem with your brain or brain stem.\n\n【14】They might do a CT scan of your brain. This test is like an X-ray but shows more detail in three dimensions. Usually, the doctor will inject a dye into your bloodstream to highlight problems on the scan.\n\n【15】If the doctor thinks you have a tumor, they’ll follow up with an MRI scan. You might also get routine lab tests to check for other medical problems. These include analysis of blood, electrolytes, and liver function tests. If your mental status has been a problem, they might do blood or urine tests to make sure drugs aren’t a problem.\n\n【16】If your scans show that you have brain cancer, the doctor will refer you to a cancer specialist called an oncologist. If there’s one in your area, you should see a specialist in brain tumors called a neuro-oncologist.\n\n【17】The next step is to confirm that you have cancer. Doctors usually do this by taking and testing a sample of the tumor. This is called a biopsy:\n\n【18】*   They’ll find the exact location of the tumor with a CT or MRI scan.\n*   Most of the time the doctor will have to open your skull to get to the tumor. They’ll try to remove the whole tumor if they can. They’ll take a sample from the tumor for the biopsy.\n*   If they can’t get the entire tumor, they’ll remove a small piece.\n*   If they can get to the tumor without surgery, they’ll make a small hole in your skull and guide a needle through the hole to the tumor. They’ll collect the biopsy sample with the needle. This technique is called stereotaxis or stereotactic biopsy.\n\n【19】A doctor called a pathologist will examine the biopsy under a microscope. They specialize in diagnosing diseases by looking at cells and tissues.\n\n【20】Brain Cancer Scans\n------------------\n\n【21】MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Side view section through the brain of a young girl. The white arrow shows a brain tumor that involves the brainstem.  \n\n【22】MRI Brain Cancer Picture: Cross-section (image taken from the top of the head down) of a brain tumor in a young girl. The white arrow shows the tumor.  \n\n【23】Can You Travel If You Have Brain Cancer?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【24】While brain cancer can limit where, when, and how you travel, getting away may be good for you. A trip -- whether for work, pleasure, or to go to a clinical trial -- may help you know that you can still do things that you want to do.\n\n【25】But before you book your trip, you’ll want to check on these things.\n\n【26】**Driving.** The doctor will let you know if it’s OK based on the location of your cancer and symptoms like vision trouble or seizures.\n\n【27】**Flying.** You should be able to fly about 3 months after you finish brain cancer treatment. But check with your doctor first. Changes in pressure could cause headaches or brain swelling.\n\n【28】**Treatments.** If the trip might make you miss a cancer treatment, talk to your doctor about rescheduling. And get a letter from your doctor explaining your condition and treatments, especially if you have a port or medical implant and plan to go through airport security. If you’re going somewhere that English isn’t widely spoken, make a copy of the letter in that language. You may also want to wear a special medical alert bracelet if you could have seizures.\n\n【29】**Arrange medical care ahead of time.** Make a list of resources in the area that you’ll visit. Include a doctor, hospital that treats brain cancer, and urgent care center. If you need lab work while you’re away, your doctor can help you figure out where and when to have this done.\n\n【30】**During your trip**\n\n【31】To stay well and curb stress levels while you travel:\n\n【32】**Keep your medicine with you.** Checked luggage can get lost. Pack prescription meds in your carry-on bag for flights. Keep them in their original packages, which show what they are. You may also want to bring extra in case your trip home gets delayed.\n\n【33】**Avoid germs.** Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer often.\n\n【34】**Protect your** **skin****.** Use sunscreen. Many cancer treatments can make you more likely to get a sunburn.\n\n【35】**Keep up your energy.** Drink plenty of water during the day and carry snacks with you.

Although it’s the top cause of death in the U.S. there is a lot you can do to prevent or treat it.\n\n【1】The trouble starts when a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. It can take decades to block the blood flow, but it can eventually cause a heart attack or failure.\n\n【2】What Causes CAD?\n----------------\n\n【3】Starting as early as childhood, plaque -- a combination of cholesterol, fat, and other substances -- starts to stick to the walls lining your blood vessels.\n\n【4】It builds up over time. That makes arteries become harder and narrower, which doctors call “atherosclerosis.“\n\n【5】In some cases, plaque can break or rupture. As a result, blood cells called platelets will try to repair the artery, forming a blood clot.\n\n【6】Like gunk in a clogged drainpipe, this buildup prevents a free flow of blood through the arteries. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart. If you don’t get enough, it can lead to shortness of breath and chest pain (angina).\n\n【7】Without enough oxygen, the heart can become weaker. This can lead to an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). It can also cause heart failure, which means the heart can’t pump enough blood throughout the body to meet the body's needs.\n\n【8】If a plaque grows so large that it stops blood flow to the heart muscle, you could have a heart attack.  Most of the time, however, heart attacks happen from the smaller plaques that rupture.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【10】In the early stages, you may not have any symptoms. But as the plaque continues to build up and curbs blood flow to the heart muscle, you may notice that you’re short of breath or fatigued, especially during exercise.\n\n【11】The most common symptom of CAD is angina, or chest pain. Some people mistake it for heartburn or indigestion.\n\n【12】With angina, your chest feels uncomfortable. You may also experience the feeling in the shoulders, arms, back, or jaw. You may feel:\n\n【13】*   Tightness\n*   Discomfort\n*   Pressure\n*   Heaviness\n*   Squeezing\n*   Burning\n*   Aching\n*   Numbness\n*   Fullness\n\n【14】If you have any of the following symptoms, **call 911 immediately**:\n\n【15】*   **Chest pain**, especially in the center or left side of the chest, which lasts for a few minutes, or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Some people mistake it for indigestion or heartburn.\n*   **Discomfort in any part of your upper body.** It could be in one or both arms, the shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.\n*   **Shortness of breath** with or without chest discomfort\n*   **Nausea or vomiting with lightheadedness, dizziness, or cold sweat**\n\n【16】Women often have different heart attack symptoms than men. While the most common red flag is still chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.\n\n【17】What Puts Me at Risk?\n---------------------\n\n【18】Coronary artery disease (CAD) becomes more likely as you get older or if it runs in your family. But you can manage many other risk factors, including:\n\n【19】*   High cholesterol and triglycerides\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Smoking\n*   Metabolic syndrome\n*   Diabetes\n*   Obesity and overweight\n*   Lack of exercise\n*   Stress, depression, and anger\n*   Unhealthy diet\n*   Too much alcohol\n*   Sleep apnea\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【21】Your doctor will give you a checkup and talk with you about your symptoms, risks, and family history. You may also get tests such as:\n\n【22】*   Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which measures the heart’s electrical activity and can assess heart damage\n*   Stress test -- Usually, this involves walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike in a doctor’s office while your EKG, heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored. \n*   Chest X-ray\n*   Blood tests to check on your levels of blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood)\n*   Cardiac catheterization in which a doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. The doctor injects dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】Depending on your case, your plan may include:\n\n【25】**Lifestyle changes:** These time-tested methods sound familiar for a reason -- they work!\n\n【26】*   Favor foods that are low in trans fats, saturated fats, simple sugars, and sodium.\n*   If you smoke, quit.\n*   Be active every day, ideally for 30 minutes or more a day (first, ask your doctor if there are any limits on what you can do).\n*   Work to stick to a healthy weight. \n*   Learn effective ways to manage your stress.\n\n【27】**Medications:** If these lifestyle changes aren’t enough, you may also need to take medicines to help your heart be healthier. They can include blood thinners (anticoagulants), aspirin and other anti-clotting medicines, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, certain immunosuppressants, statins, or PCSK9s. \n\n【28】**Angioplasty:** This procedure can open blocked or narrowed arteries without opening up your chest. In angioplasty, a doctor threads a thin, flexible tube with a balloon through your blood vessels until it reaches the blocked artery. The doctor then inflates the balloon, which stretches the artery open so more blood can flow. In many cases, a tiny tube called a stent is also inserted to keep the blood vessel open. You’ll typically be in and out of the hospital in a day.  \n\n【29】**Coronary artery bypass grafting** is a type of surgery in which doctors use blood vessels from other parts of your body to make a detour around blockages in your coronary arteries. It’s a major operation and you’ll probably need to be in the hospital for at least 5 days.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Fortunately, there are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of getting CAD.\n\n【32】**Get wise to your risk.** Speak to your doctor about getting your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar checked. If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, it’s important to manage those conditions.\n\n【33】**Aim for a healthy weight**. If you’re not sure what your target weight should be, ask your doctor. And if you have a lot of weight to lose, remember that even a modest amount of weight loss helps.\n\n【34】**Avoid cigarette smoke.** If you smoke, quit. Steer clear of secondhand smoke.\n\n【35】**Limit your alcohol.** One or two drinks may have some heart benefits, but too much is risky. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks and women should have no more than one per day. \n\n【36】**Eat smart.** Eat whole foods and avoid trans fats, which can be found in many baked goods and deep-fried and processed foods. Get plenty of fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and veggies, whole grains, and beans. Limit salt and aim to have two servings of fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, or mackerel, a week. They’re high in heart-healthy omega-3 fats.\n\n【37】**Exercise regularly.** You’ll want to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like hiking or going for a bike ride that makes your heart beat faster but not race) on 5 or more days a week. Speak with your doctor before you begin a new exercise routine.\n\n【38】**Manage your stress level.** Use strategies such as exercise, meditation, and other healthy activities that relax you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:39:11", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:39:25", "cost": 13.738}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:03", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:39:25", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:39:11"}

This product should not be used on the face or on moles, birthmarks , warts with hair growing from them, or genital/anal warts.Salicylic acid is a keratolytic. It belongs to the same class of drugs as aspirin ( salicylates ). It works by increasing the amount of moisture in the skin and dissolving the substance that causes the skin cells to stick together. This makes it easier to shed the skin cells. Warts are caused by a virus. Salicylic acid does not affect the virus.\n\n【2】### How to use Duofilm topical\n\n【3】Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist .\n\n【4】This medication is for use on the skin only.

It’s a warning that something’s wrong. As you heal, the pain gets better, and in time it goes away.\n\n【1】But if you have fibromyalgia, you hurt all over even when you’re not sick or injured. And the pain doesn’t go away. Some doctors think they know why: a glitch in the way your brain and spinal cord handle pain signals.\n\n【2】When you have fibromyalgia, you may have more cells that carry pain signals than normal. And you may have fewer cells that slow pain signals down. This means your pain volume is always turned up, like music blasting on a radio. The result is that minor bumps and bruises hurt more than they should. And you may feel pain from things that shouldn’t hurt at all.\n\n【3】Doctors aren’t sure why some people get fibromyalgia. Many things could cause the body’s pain signals to go awry. Plus, different people report different things that seemed to trigger their condition. You can even have more than one cause. They can include:\n\n【4】*   **Genes.** Fibromyalgia seems to run in families. Your parents may pass on genes that make you more sensitive to pain. Other genes can also make you more likely to feel anxious or depressed, which makes pain worse.\n*   **Other diseases.** A painful disease like arthritis or an infection raises your chances of getting fibromyalgia.\n*   **Emotional or physical abuse.** Children who are abused are more likely to have the condition when they grow up. This may happen because abuse changes the way the brain handles pain and stress.\n*   **Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).** Some people have this mental health problem after a terrible event, like war, a car crash, or rape. These events are also linked to fibromyalgia in some people.\n*   **Gender.** The condition is much more common in women than men. Doctors think this could be related to differences in the way men and women feel and react to pain, as well as how society expects them to respond to pain.\n*   **Anxiety and depression.** These and other mood disorders seem linked to fibromyalgia, though there’s no proof that they actually cause the condition.\n*   **Not moving enough.** The condition is much more common in people who aren’t physically active.

Tens of millions of people have lung disease in the U.S. alone. Smoking, infections, and genes cause most lung diseases.\n\n【1】Your lungs are part of a complex system, expanding and relaxing thousands of times each day to bring in oxygen and send out carbon dioxide. Lung disease can happen when there are problems in any part of this system.\n\n【2】Lung Diseases Affecting the Airways\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Your windpipe (trachea) branches into tubes called bronchi, which in turn become smaller tubes throughout your lungs. Diseases that can affect these airways include:\n\n【4】*   **Asthma.** Your airways are constantly inflamed and may spasm, causing wheezing and shortness of breath. Allergies, infections, or pollution can trigger asthma symptoms.\n*   **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease** **(****COPD****).** With this lung condition, you can’t exhale the way you usually would, which causes trouble breathing.\n*   **Chronic bronchitis.** This form of COPD brings a long-term wet cough.\n*   **Emphysema.** Lung damage allows air to be trapped in your lungs in this form of COPD. Trouble blowing air out is its hallmark.\n*   **Acute** **bronchitis.** This sudden infection of your airways is usually caused by a virus.\n*   **Cystic fibrosis.** With this condition, you have trouble clearing mucus out of your bronchi. This leads to repeated lung infections.\n\n【5】Lung Diseases Affecting the Air Sacs (Alveoli)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Your airways branch into tiny tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of air sacs called alveoli. These air sacs make up most of your lung tissue. Lung diseases affecting your alveoli include:\n\n【7】*   **Pneumonia.** An infection of your alveoli, usually by bacteria or viruses, including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n*   **Tuberculosis** Pneumonia that slowly gets worse, caused by the bacteria _Mycobacterium tuberculosis__._\n*   **Emphysema.** This happens when the fragile links between alveoli are damaged. Smoking is the usual cause. (Emphysema also limits airflow, affecting your airways.)\n*   **Pulmonary edema.** Fluid leaks out of the small blood vessels of your lung into the air sacs and the area around them. One form is caused by heart failure and back pressure in your lungs' blood vessels. In another form, injury to your lung causes the leak of fluid.\n*   **Lung cancer.** It has many forms and may start in any part of your lungs. It most often happens in the main part of your lung, in or near the air sacs.\n*   **Acute respiratory distress syndrome** **(ARDS).** This is a severe, sudden injury to the lungs from a serious illness. COVID-19 is one example. Many people who have ARDS need help breathing from a machine called a ventilator until their lungs recover.\n*   **Pneumoconiosis.** This is a category of conditions caused by inhaling something that injures your lungs. Examples include black lung disease from coal dust and asbestosis from asbestos dust.\n\n【8】Lung Diseases Affecting the Interstitium\n----------------------------------------\n\n【9】The interstitium is the thin, delicate lining between your alveoli. Tiny blood vessels run through the interstitium and let gas transfer between the alveoli and your blood. Various lung diseases affect the interstitium:\n\n【10】*   **Interstitial lung disease** **(ILD).** This is a group of lung conditions that includes sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and autoimmune disease.\n*   **Pneumonia** and **pulmonary edema** can also affect your interstitium.\n\n【11】Lung Diseases Affecting Blood Vessels\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】The right side of your heart gets low-oxygen blood from your veins. It pumps blood into your lungs through the pulmonary arteries. These blood vessels can have diseases, as well.\n\n【13】*   **Pulmonary embolism****(PE).** A blood clot (usually in a deep leg vein, called deep vein thrombosis) breaks off, travels to your heart, and gets pumped into your lungs. The clot sticks in a pulmonary artery, often causing shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.\n*   **Pulmonary hypertension.** Many conditions can cause high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. This can lead to shortness of breath and chest pain. If your doctor can’t find a cause, they’ll call it idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【14】Lung Diseases Affecting the Pleura\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】The pleura is the thin lining that surrounds your lung and lines the inside of your chest wall. A tiny layer of fluid lets the pleura on your lung's surface slide along the chest wall with each breath. Lung diseases of the pleura include:\n\n【16】*   **Pleural effusion.** Fluid collects in the space between your lung and the chest wall. Pneumonia or heart failure usually causes this. Large pleural effusions can make it hard to breathe and may need to be drained.\n*   **Pneumothorax.** Air may get into the space between your chest wall and the lung, collapsing the lung.\n*   **Mesothelioma.** This is a rare form of cancer that forms on the pleura. Mesothelioma tends to happen several decades after you come into contact with asbestos.\n\n【17】Lung Diseases Affecting the Chest Wall\n--------------------------------------\n\n【18】Your chest wall also plays an important role in breathing. Muscles connect your ribs to each other, helping your chest expand. Your diaphragm descends with each breath, also causing chest expansion. Diseases that affect your chest wall include:\n\n【19】*   **Obesity** **hypoventilation syndrome.** Extra weight on your chest and belly can make it hard for your chest to expand. This may cause serious breathing problems.\n*   **Neuromuscular disorders.** You might have trouble breathing when the nerves that control your respiratory muscles don’t work the way they should. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and myasthenia gravis are examples of neuromuscular lung disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:00:21", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:03:27", "cost": 186.471}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:03:24", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:00:17"}

AFib doesn’t so much have types as it has durations. Doctors classify it by how long it lasts, or what causes it. Yours could change over time. Your treatment will depend on which you have.\n\n【1】Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation\n------------------------------\n\n【2】This is an episode of atrial fibrillation that lasts less than a week. You might feel it happening for a few minutes or for several days. You may not need treatment with this type of AFib, but you should see a doctor.\n\n【3】You could hear it nicknamed “holiday heart syndrome.” This refers to AFib that follows a bout of heavy drinking. If your heart isn’t used to all this different activity, it may go into AFib. It also happens sometimes when you’re under extreme stress.\n\n【4】Persistent Atrial Fibrillation\n------------------------------\n\n【5】Usually, this lasts longer than a week. It could stop on its own, or you may need medicine or treatment to stop it. Persistent AFib usually starts as short-term AFib (paroxysmal AFib)\n\n【6】You’re more likely to get persistent AFib if you’re:\n\n【7】*   Older\n*   Have high blood pressure, heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), or heart valve disease\n*   A former smoker\n\n【8】Doctors can use medicine to treat this type of AFib. If that doesn’t work, they might use a low-voltage current to reset your heart’s rhythm to normal. It’s called electrical cardioversion. Doctors usually do this procedure in a hospital while you’re sedated, so you won’t feel anything. You can go home after it’s done, but someone else will have to drive you.\n\n【9】Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【10】This means your AFib has lasted for more than a year and doesn’t go away. Medicine and treatment like electrical cardioversion may not stop the AFib. Doctors can use another kind of treatment, such as ablation (which burns certain areas of your heart’s electrical system) to restore your normal heart rhythm.\n\n【11】Permanent (Chronic) Atrial Fibrillation\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】If you have this type, you and your doctor will decide if you need long-term medication to control your heart rate and lower your odds of having a stroke.\n\n【13】Valvular and Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Both valvular and nonvalvular AFib can cause blood to pool in your heart, which raises your risk of complications like blood clots and strokes. Your doctor will prescribe a type of medicine to help lower your odds of stroke.\n\n【15】Valvular Atrial Fibrillation\n----------------------------\n\n【16】A heart valve problem brings this on. It could be an artificial heart valve, valvular stenosis (when one of your heart valves stiffens), or regurgitation (a valve isn’t closing properly, which lets some blood flow the wrong way).Your chance of getting valvular AFib rises if you have mitral valve disease or artificial heart valves.\n\n【17】Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】This is atrial fibrillation that isn’t caused by a problem with a heart valve. It’s caused by other things, such as high blood pressure or an overactive thyroid gland. Doctors don’t always know what the cause is.\n\n【19】You're more likely to get nonvalvular AFib if you:\n\n【20】*   Are older\n*   Have had high blood pressure for many years\n*   Have heart disease\n*   Drink large amounts of alcohol\n*   Have a family member with AFib\n*   Have sleep apnea\n\n【21】Acute Onset Atrial Fibrillation\n-------------------------------\n\n【22】This rapid, chaotic heartbeat comes on quickly and goes away quickly. It usually resolves itself in 24 to 48 hours. Causes include age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol abuse, diabetes, and lung disease.\n\n【23】Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】This is the most frequent complication of cardiovascular surgery. It boosts your odds of heart failure and cerebral infarction, a brain injury that results from a blood clot blocking blood flow in your brain.\n\n【25】Doctors have many ways to treat atrial fibrillation, no matter which type you have. If you have symptoms, see your doctor to discuss what will be best for you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:01", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:06", "cost": 5.326}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:06", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:01"}

They often pop up in the joints -- the places where two bones meet.\n\n【2】Bone spurs can form on many parts of your body, including your:\n\n【3】*   Hands\n*   Shoulders\n*   Neck\n*   Spine\n*   Hips\n*   Knees\n*   Feet (heels)\n\n【4】Most bone spurs don't cause problems. But if they rub against other bones or press on nerves, you might experience pain and stiffness.\n\n【5】Causes of Bone Spurs\n--------------------\n\n【6】The most common cause of bone spurs is joint damage from osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. The cushioning between your joints and the bones of your spine can wear down with age. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and gout can also damage your joints.\n\n【7】Bone spurs also often form after an injury to a joint or tendon. When your body thinks your bone is damaged, it tries to fix it by adding bone to the injured area.\n\n【8】Other causes of bone spurs include:\n\n【9】*   Overuse – for example, if you run or dance a lot over a long period of time\n*   Genes\n*   Diet\n*   Obesity\n*   Bone problems that you were born with\n*   Narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis)\n\n【10】Symptoms of Bone Spurs\n----------------------\n\n【11】You might not realize you have a bone spur until you get an X-ray to look for another condition. They only cause problems when they press on nerves, tendons, or other structures in your body. Then, you might feel any of the following:\n\n【12】*   Pain in the affected joint\n*   Pain or stiffness when you try to bend or move the affected joint\n*   Weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs if the bone spur presses on nerves in your spine\n*   Muscle spasms, cramps, or weakness\n*   Bumps under your skin, seen mainly in the hands and fingers\n*   Trouble controlling your bladder or bowels if the bone spur presses on certain nerves in your spine (a symptom that's seen very rarely)\n\n【13】Your symptoms might get worse when you exercise or try to move the affected joint.\n\n【14】A bone spur can break off and get stuck in the lining of the joint. This is called a \"loose body.\" It can lock up the joint and make it hard to move.\n\n【15】Bone Spur Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【16】Often, bone spurs are first evaluated by your regular doctor who will likely refer you to a specialist. You’ll probably need to see a rheumatologist or orthopedic doctor. Rheumatologists specialize in joint problems. Orthopedic doctors focus on the musculoskeletal system. Your doctor will feel the joint to check for a bump. They may also order an X-ray to help them to see the bone spur better.\n\n【17】Other tests your doctor can use to diagnose bone spurs include:\n\n【18】*   **CT scan.** It's a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body.\n*   **MRI.** This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body.\n*   **Electroconductive tests.** These tests measure how fast your nerves send electrical signals. They can show the damage bone spurs have caused to nerves in your spinal canal.\n\n【19】Bone Spur Treatments and Home Care\n----------------------------------\n\n【20】To relieve pain and bring down swelling, you can try one of these over-the-counter pain relievers:\n\n【21】*   Acetaminophen (Tylenol)\n*   Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)\n*   Naproxen sodium (Aleve)\n\n【22】These can cause side effects, especially if you take them in large doses or for a long time. If you've taken them for more than a month, ask your doctor if you can try a different treatment.\n\n【23】Other therapies for bone spurs include:\n\n【24】*   Rest\n*   Steroid shots to bring down swelling and reduce pain in the joints\n*   Physical therapy to improve joint strength and increase movement\n\n【25】If these treatments don't work or the bone spur affects your movement, you might need surgery to remove the extra bone.\n\n【26】Bone Spur Prevention\n--------------------\n\n【27】Bone spurs usually can’t be prevented if they’re the result of the natural wear and tear of arthritis. But you can take these steps to avoid bone spurs caused by other things:\n\n【28】*   Wear shoes with a wide toe box, good arch support, and enough cushion to pad each step. Get your shoes fitted by a professional so they don't rub against your feet when you walk. Wear thick socks to prevent your shoes from rubbing.\n*   Eat a well-rounded diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D to protect your bones.\n*   Do regular weight-bearing exercises like walking or stair climbing to keep your bones strong.\n*   Try to keep the extra pounds off.\n\n【29】See your doctor if you have any signs of joint trouble, like pain, swelling, or stiffness. If you catch and treat arthritis early, you may be able to prevent the damage that leads to bone spurs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:06:00", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:06:11", "cost": 11.332}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:06:11", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:06:00"}

The right plan can help with all three of the major components of ADHD: inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity control. The goal of treatment is to help your child follow rules, concentrate, and have good relationships with parents, teachers, and peers.\n\n【1】These treatment options have been evaluated for safety, but no two children are alike, and what works for some kids may not work as well for yours.\n\n【2】Together with the doctor, you’ll develop a plan that meets your child’s specific needs. It may take time to figure out what works best. The plan may include medications, behavioral therapy, or both.\n\n【3】Medications\n-----------\n\n【4】The main medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants and nonstimulants. Sometimes antidepressants are also used.\n\n【5】**Stimulants** are the most common treatment in children and teens. This is usually the type of medication a doctor may try first. Stimulants have been used for a long time and are well-tested. They help the brain control impulses and control behavior and attention.\n\n【6】Kids with certain medical conditions shouldn’t take stimulants. Make sure the doctor knows your child’s medical history before they prescribe any medication.\n\n【7】Stimulants include:\n\n【8】*   Amphetamine (Adzenys XR-ODT)\n*   Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Adderall XR)\n*   Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin, Focalin XR)\n*   Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine)\n*   Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)\n*   Methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Metadate, Methylin, Ritalin, Quillivant XR)\n*   Serdexmethylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate (Azstarys)\n\n【9】If the first medicine the doctor prescribes doesn’t seem to help, they may raise the dosage, suggest a different medication, or suggest your child take another medicine along with the stimulant.\n\n【10】**Nonstimulants** aren’t as well tested. They work in different ways than stimulants, but they can help with concentration and impulse control. For some kids, they may be a better option than stimulants, but they’re often used along with stimulants.\n\n【11】These non-stimulants are FDA-approved for ADHD in children and teens:\n\n【12】*   Atomoxetine (Strattera)\n*   Clonidine ER (Kapvay)\n*   Guanfacine ER (Intuniv)\n*   Viloxazine (Qelbree)\n\n【13】**Antidepressants** aren’t approved to treat ADHD, but they can help with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. They’re an option for children who haven’t done well on a stimulant alone. Taking an antidepressant along with a stimulant seems to work well for children who have ADHD along with a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety.\n\n【14】There are several types of antidepressants.\n\n【15】**Tricyclic antidepressants.** These affect chemicals in the brain.\n\n【16】Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include:\n\n【17】*   Desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane)\n*   Imipramine (Tofranil)\n*   Nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor)\n\n【18】**Bupropion** **(****Wellbutrin****).** The doctor may prescribe this if your child doesn’t benefit from stimulants.\n\n【19】**Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).** These are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants for people with depression. These have been tried for ADHD:\n\n【20】*   Escitalopram (Lexapro)\n*   Sertraline (Zoloft)\n\n【21】**Venlafaxine** **(****Effexor****).** This drug also affects chemicals in the brain. It helps improve mood and concentration in children and teens.\n\n【22】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【23】All these medicines can cause side effects. They usually happen when a child first starts taking them. They’re usually mild and go away fairly soon. Before your child starts any new medication, talk to their doctor about what to expect.\n\n【24】If you become concerned about side effects while your child is on a medication, call the doctor. Don’t make changes in the treatment without talking to them.\n\n【25】Meds Not for Everyone\n---------------------\n\n【26】Medications don't always work for kids with ADHD. In fact, they don’t seem to work at all in 20% to 30% of cases. In others, the improvement is only slight or the side effects are too serious. Your health care team can help you put together a combination of medication and behavioral therapy or therapy alone that works best for your child.  \n\n【27】To know what’s working, it can help to first talk to your doctor about the goals of treatment. Another idea is to monitor and keep track of the timing and intensity of your child’s symptoms in an ADHD symptom log. Then you and your health care team can look back at the log to identify patterns that might help shape more effective treatment. \n\n【28】Behavioral Therapy\n------------------\n\n【29】This type of therapy uses positive reinforcement for good behavior and negative reinforcement for unwanted behaviors. A mental health professional -- a psychologist, social worker, or family therapist -- works with you and your child's teachers to set up a program to improve your child’s behaviors.\n\n【30】Behavioral therapy is often used along with ADHD medications, but it can also be used alone.\n\n【31】Other Treatments\n----------------\n\n【32】The FDA has two technology based therapies as nondrug treatment for children.\n\n【33】The first is a device called the Monarch eTNS System and is approved for children 7 to 12. It is about the size of a cell phone and works by delivering mild stimulation to electrodes attached to the forehead. Those mild electrical pulses interact with the part of the brain believed to be responsible for ADHD.\n\n【34】Also approved is game-based digital therapeutic device called EndeavorRx for pediatric ADHD patients ages 8 to 12 years old. Using a video game-based approach, the device used both sensory stimuli and motor skill challenges to target areas of the brain and help improve focus and cognitive function.\n\n【35】In addition, some studies have shown that omega-3 supplements may help some children with ADHD.\n\n【36】Some kids with ADHD may benefit from changes in diet, such as going gluten-free or avoiding certain food dyes and additives. Talk to your child’s doctor about the best options for them.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:22:05", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:26:03", "cost": 238.163}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:26:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:21:49"}

Also called breath-holding attacks, these spells are somewhat common and can happen in healthy children. They can look like seizures, but they’re not. The spells don’t hurt the children, and many outgrow them by age 6 or 7. They are most common in 2-year-olds.\n\n【2】Breath-holding spells come in two types. With cyanotic spells, a child’s face turns blue. With pallid spells, they become pale. Cyanotic spells are more common.\n\n【3】Causes\n------\n\n【4】Often, a breath-holding attack starts with crying in reaction to pain, fear, or anger.\n\n【5】If your child has a cyanotic spell, they're probably upset or frustrated about something. May be they got into trouble or wants something they can’t have. They’ll cry, exhale very hard, but not breathe in again. Their face, especially around their lips, quickly will turn blue, and they’ll pass out.\n\n【6】With a pallid spell, they likely felt a sudden pain or scare. They may have fallen backwards and bumped their head or been spooked when someone snuck up behind them. They may shout in hurt or surprise, or they may open their mouth to shout but no sounds comes out. They’ll then stop breathing, color will drain from their face, and they’ll be out.\n\n【7】In both cases, your child will start to breathe again within a minute and come to on their own. They may be tired, but other than that, they’ll be their normal self.\n\n【8】Your child doesn’t have these spells on purpose. It’s their body’s involuntary response to a sudden event. The reflexes change your child’s breathing pattern, heart rate, and blood pressure levels, which make your child faint.\n\n【9】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【10】After your child passes out, they’ll lie limply on the floor. They may also:\n\n【11】*   Arch their back\n*   Become stiff\n*   Jerk their body a few times\n*   Turn sweaty\n*   Wet themself\n\n【12】They may or may not gasp when they start to breathe again.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【14】After your child’s first breath-holding spell, take them to their doctor to rule out any health problems.\n\n【15】There are no tests to confirm a breath-holding spell. Your pediatrician usually can diagnose it after hearing what happened. They’ll want to know what set it off, how your child looked, and how they started to breathe again.\n\n【16】Rarely, the pediatrician may refer your child to a heart doctor, called a cardiologist, or to a neurologist, who specializes in the brain and the nervous system, to check for any underlying causes.\n\n【17】Treatment\n---------\n\n【18】If your child has one breath-holding spell, they’ll likely have more. Some children have them several times a day, while others may have just one in a year.\n\n【19】There are no drugs or other treatments for these spells. Some studies suggest that anemia, or low levels of red blood cells, may be a culprit and that iron supplements may help. But more research is needed. The best thing to do is let your child lie on their side while they're out. That helps the blood flow to their brain and gives them a chance to recover more quickly.\n\n【20】In very rare cases, a child may not start breathing again after 1 minute. If this happens, call 911. If they're still not breathing after 3 minutes, start CPR.\n\n【21】Prevention\n----------\n\n【22】Your child’s doctor may teach you how to spot triggers that cause the spells, so you may prevent them. Sometimes, blowing hard on your baby’s face can interrupt a breath-holding spell. But this won’t work for every baby, and it may not work for older children.\n\n【23】If temper tantrums set off breath-holding attacks, your doctor may help you figure out a new way to set limits for your child. Take care not to give in to your child just to avoid a spell. This can lead to behavior problems that may last even after they're outgrown their breath-holding spells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:03:39", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:03:53", "cost": 13.753}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:03:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:03:35"}

And many of the symptoms of the illness -- deep tiredness, unrelieved by rest or sleep, feeling worse after physical or mental exertion, trouble concentrating, feeling worse after standing and remaining on one’s feet and other symptoms-- are also seen in other conditions, too, making the diagnosis of ME/CFS more difficult.\n\n【1】See Your Doctor\n---------------\n\n【2】If you think you might have ME/CFS, make an appointment to see your doctor. Research shows that getting treatment sooner might bring better results.\n\n【3】Your doctor will ask for a lot of information about your health. Unfortunately, there is not yet a diagnostic test that is sufficiently accurate to be useful. Your doctor will need to rule out other conditions or causes before they can diagnose ME/CFS.\n\n【4】They might order other tests like blood and urine tests and scans. They will need the names of all the prescription and over-the-counter medicine you take, in case one of them is causing your symptoms. Also, tell your doctor if you take any supplements. Even so-called “natural” or “herbal” remedies can have side effects, and they might cause problems if used with other medications you’re taking.\n\n【5】Your doctor will give you a complete physical exam and ask you questions about your emotions. This will give them a better idea of what your needs are. It’s important to make sure you don’t have another disorder, which could be serious and could get better with treatment.\n\n【6】What Else Could It Be?\n----------------------\n\n【7】Many people who have ME/CFS have other conditions, too. If you get treated for those, it might also improve your chronic fatigue.\n\n【8】 ME/CFS can look a lot like “mono” (mononucleosis), Lyme disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, sleep disorders, or depression. It affects about 2.5 million Americans, but experts believe only about 20% are diagnosed. \n\n【9】Checking the Symptoms\n---------------------\n\n【10】Your doctor will review your medical history and test results. They will check to see if you have several key symptoms, beginning with extreme tiredness, or fatigue, that doesn’t improve with bed rest for 6 months or longer.\n\n【11】Then, your doctor will check to see if you have three of these \"core\" symptoms of CFS:\n\n【12】*   Reduced ability to do usual activities for six months or more because of fatigue\n*   Worsening of symptoms (difficulty thinking, problems sleeping, sore throat, headaches, feeling dizzy, or severe tiredness). after physical or mental exertion\n*   Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, and awakening unrested\n\n【13】Along with the three symptoms, you must have one of these for a diagnosis of ME/CFS:\n\n【14】*   Problems with thinking and memory\n*   Worsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright; you might feel lightheaded, dizzy or weak, and you may have blurred vision or see spots.\n\n【15】It could take a while to get your diagnosis. It’s OK to ask how you can relieve your symptoms while you wait.

The median controls the movement and feeling of your thumb and the movement of all your fingers except your pinky.\n\n【3】Carpal Tunnel Symptoms\n----------------------\n\n【4】Symptoms of carpal tunnel include:\n\n【5】*   Burning, tingling, or itching numbness in your palm and thumb or your index and middle fingers\n*   Weakness in your hand and trouble holding things\n*   Shock-like feelings that move into your fingers\n*   Tingling that moves up into your arm\n\n【6】Repetitive motions like typing can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【7】You might first notice that your fingers \"fall asleep\" and become numb at night. It usually happens because of how you hold your hand while you sleep.\n\n【8】In the morning, you may wake up with numbness and tingling in your hands that may run all the way to your shoulder. During the day, your symptoms might flare up while you’re holding something with your wrist bent, like when you’re driving or reading a book.\n\n【9】Early on in the condition, shaking out your hands might help you feel better. But after some time, it may not make the numbness go away.\n\n【10】As carpal tunnel syndrome gets worse, you may have less grip strength because the muscles in your hand shrink. You’ll also have more pain and muscle cramping.\n\n【11】Your median nerve can’t work the way it should because of the irritation or pressure around it. This leads to:\n\n【12】*   Slower nerve impulses\n*   Less feeling in your fingers\n*   Less strength and coordination, especially the ability to use your thumb to pinch\n\n【13】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Causes\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】Often, people don't know what brought on their carpal tunnel syndrome. It can be due to repetitive motions, like typing, or any wrist movements that you do over and over. This is especially true of things you do when your hands are lower than your wrists. This is especially true of things you do when your hands are lower than your wrists.\n\n【15】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Risk Factors\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】You might have a higher risk of getting carpal tunnel syndrome if you:\n\n【17】*   Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get it. This might be because they tend to have smaller carpal tunnels.\n*   Have a family member with small carpal tunnels\n*   Have a job in which you make the same motions with your arm, hand, or wrist over and over, such as an assembly line worker, sewer or knitter, baker, cashier, hairstylist, or musician\n*   Fracture or dislocate your wrist\n\n【18】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Diagnosis and Tests\n------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Your doctor may tap the palm side of your wrist, a test called Tinel sign, or fully flex your wrist with your arms extended. They might also do tests including:\n\n【20】*   **Imaging tests.** X-rays, ultrasounds, or MRI exams can let your doctor look at your bones and tissues.\n*   **Electromyogram.** Your doctor puts a thin electrode into a muscle to measure its electrical activity.\n*   **Nerve conduction studies.** Your doctor tapes electrodes to your skin to measure the signals in the nerves of your hand and arm.\n\n【21】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Treatment\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】Your treatment will depend on your symptoms and how far your condition has progressed. You might need:\n\n【23】*   **Lifestyle changes.** If repetitive motion is causing your symptoms, take breaks more often or do a bit less of the activity that’s causing you pain.\n*   **Exercises.** Stretching or strengthening moves can make you feel better. Nerve gliding exercises can help the nerve move better within your carpal tunnel.\n*   **Immobilization.** Your doctor may tell you to wear a splint to keep your wrist from moving and to lessen pressure on your nerves. You may wear one at night to help get rid of that numbness or tingling feeling. This can help you sleep better and rest your median nerve.\n*   **Medication.** Your doctor may give you anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid shots to curb swelling.\n*   **Surgery.** If none of those treatments works, you might have an operation called carpal tunnel release that increases the size of the tunnel and eases the pressure on your nerve.\n\n【24】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Complications\n------------------------------------\n\n【25】If you have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't treat it, the symptoms can last a long time and get worse. They could also go away and then come back. When you get a diagnosis early, the condition is easier to treat. You can avoid permanent muscle damage and keep your hand working the way it should.\n\n【26】To avoid carpal tunnel syndrome, try to:\n\n【27】*   Keep your wrists straight.\n*   Use a splint or brace that helps keep your wrist in a neutral position.\n*   Avoid flexing and extending your wrists over and over again.\n*   Keep your hands warm.\n*   Take breaks whenever you can.\n*   Put your hands and wrists in the right position while you work.\n\n【28】How Do I Know if I Have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Your doctor may use a handful of tests to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome and rule out other causes of hand and wrist pain.\n\n【30】They’ll probably start with questions about your medical history. Then they’ll examine your hands, arms, shoulders, and neck to figure out if your pain results from another condition, like an injury or arthritis. They’ll also make sure your daily activities aren’t to blame.\n\n【31】The doctor may focus on your wrist to see if the area is tender, swollen, warm, or discolored. They’ll probably test each finger to see if you’ve lost any feeling. And they’ll check the strength of the muscles in your hand.\n\n【32】After that, they may do tests focusing on the median nerve, which runs through your forearm into your hand. When that nerve gets pressed or squeezed through the carpal tunnel, it causes carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【33】Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Tests\n----------------------------\n\n【34】**Tinel’s Sign**\n\n【35】The doctor will tap or press on the median nerve in your wrist with a reflex hammer. If your fingers tingle or if you feel an electric-shock-like sensation, the test is positive. You may have carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【36】**Phalen’s Maneuver**\n\n【37】This is also known as the wrist-flexion test. The doctor will tell you to press the backs of your hands and fingers together with your wrists flexed and your fingers pointed down. You’ll stay that way for a minute or two. If your fingers tingle or get numb, you have carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【38】**Two-Point Discrimination Test**\n\n【39】This means you can tell if two objects touching your skin are two distinct points instead of just one. The doctor may use a gadget called a 2-point disk-criminator, a small, flat, eight-sided tool with needle-like prongs sticking out from all sides.\n\n【40】They might do the test several times on each finger. They’ll start with two points touching your skin a few centimeters apart and move them closer together until you feel just one point of pressure.\n\n【41】The distance at which you can feel only one point will help them figure out nerve function and compression – two important components of carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【42】**Nerve Conduction Velocity Test**\n\n【43】This test provides some of the strongest evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. It measures how fast an electrical signal can travel along a nerve or from the nerve to a muscle.\n\n【44】The doctor places a small electrode on your skin near your elbow. It sends a mild electrical current down your median nerve. The more time it takes for the current to travel from your elbow to your fingers, the more damage to your median nerve.\n\n【45】**Electromyogram**\n\n【46】This works like the second part of the nerve conduction velocity test. It measures how well the muscle around your median nerve works. The doctor places a small needle electrode into muscles in your hand and arm that get impulses from the median nerve. The needle sends electric impulses into the muscle. You relax and flex your hand several times. The doctor can tell if your median nerve is damaged or being squeezed.\n\n【47】The needles might hurt a little, but it should stop once the doctor takes them out. You may feel twitches or spasms from the electrical current. You could have some bruising where the electrode went in, but that should go away within a few days.\n\n【48】**Ultrasound, X-ray, and MRI**\n\n【49】Your doctor may order one of these tests to rule out other causes of wrist and hand pain. An X-ray can show arthritis or a broken bone. An ultrasound or MRI will show a swollen or compressed median nerve. They’ll also tell the doctor why it is being squeezed, whether it’s arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or another reason.\n\n【50】They might also order lab tests, like bloodwork, to look for diseases like diabetes that can damage your nerves.\n\n【51】Other Physical Examination\n--------------------------\n\n【52】Your doctor will also ask you about any patterns with your symptoms. For example, if you have tingling or numbness in your little finger, it may not be carpal tunnel syndrome since the median nerve doesn’t provide feeling to that finger. The doctor may also ask if you have a history of symptoms:\n\n【53】*   While holding your phone or a newspaper\n*   At night\n*   In the morning\n\n【54】These are all signs of carpal tunnel.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:18", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:27", "cost": 8.552}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:17"}

Controlling high blood sugar helps prevent kidney damage, blindness, nerve problems, loss of limbs, and sexual function problems. Proper control of diabetes may also lessen your risk of a heart attack or stroke .Insulin lispro is a man-made product that is similar to human insulin. It replaces the insulin that your body would normally make. Insulin lispro starts working faster and lasts for a shorter time than regular insulin. It works by helping blood sugar ( glucose ) get into cells so your body can use it for energy. This medication is usually used with a medium- or long-acting insulin product. Insulin lispro may also be used with other oral diabetes medications (such as sulfonylureas like glyburide or glipizide ).\n\n【2】### How to use Humalog Vial\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start using this medication and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor, diabetes educator, or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Learn all preparation and usage instructions from your health care professional and the product package.\n\n【5】Before using, check this product visually for particles or discoloration. If either is present, do not use the insulin . Insulin lispro should be clear and colorless.\n\n【6】Before injecting each dose, clean the injection site with rubbing alcohol. Change where you inject each time to lessen the risk of problems or damage under the skin (for example, pits/lumps or thickened skin ). Insulin lispro may be injected in the stomach area, the thigh, the buttocks, or the back of the upper arm. Do not inject into skin that is red, swollen, itchy, or damaged. Do not inject cold insulin because this can be painful. The insulin container you are currently using can be kept at room temperature 删除6:<u>(see also Storage section)</u>.\n\n【7】Inject this medication under the skin as directed by your doctor, usually within 15 minutes before eating a meal or immediately after a meal. Do not inject into a vein or muscle because very low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) may occur. Because this insulin is fast-acting, not eating right after a dose of insulin may also lead to low blood sugar . Do not inject if you have low blood sugar . Do not rub the area after the injection.\n\n【8】Giving insulin lispro into a vein should only be done by a health care professional. Very low blood sugar may result.\n\n【9】If you are directed to inject this insulin with an infusion pump, read the instruction manual and directions that come with the infusion pump.

It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called \"pseudogynecomastia.\"\n\n【2】Although breasts don't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue.\n\n【3】Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone, which guides their sexual growth during puberty. But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls.\n\n【4】When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes.\n\n【5】Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree.\n\n【6】Gynecomastia Symptoms\n---------------------\n\n【7】Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore.\n\n【8】This might make you worry that you have breast cancer, which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer, but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out.\n\n【9】Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness.\n\n【10】See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts.\n\n【11】Gynecomastia Causes\n-------------------\n\n【12】A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known.\n\n【13】In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are:\n\n【14】*   Injury or diseases that affect the testicles, which make testosterone\n*   Thyroid problems, since hormones from that gland control growth and sexual development\n*   Some cancers, including tumors of the lungs, pituitary gland, or adrenal glands\n*   Obesity, which can result in more estrogen\n*   Illegal drugs, including anabolic steroids, marijuana, and heroin\n*   Kidney failure (when they can no longer clean and filter your blood)\n*   Liver disease\n\n【15】Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies.\n\n【16】Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as:\n\n【17】**Anti-androgens.** These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer.\n\n【18】**Anabolic steroids and androgens.** Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions.\n\n【19】**HIV drugs.** Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called \"highly active antiretroviral therapy.\"\n\n【20】**Anti-anxiety drugs.** Medicines such as diazepam (Valium) can sometimes cause gynecomastia.\n\n【21】**Heart medications.** Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes.\n\n【22】**Medicines used to empty your stomach.** For example, metoclopramide (Reglan) can have gynecomastia as a side effect.\n\n【23】**Ulcer drugs.** Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB).\n\n【24】Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments.\n\n【25】Gynecomastia Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【26】If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer.\n\n【27】They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include:\n\n【28】*   Have you had illnesses such as mumps, kidney ailments, or liver disease?\n*   What drugs have you taken -- legal or illegal?\n\n【29】You might also be given tests. They could include:\n\n【30】*   Blood tests or urine samples\n*   Mammogram\n*   Biopsy\n*   CT scans\n*   MRI scans\n*   Testicular ultrasounds\n\n【31】Gynecomastia Treatment\n----------------------\n\n【32】Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment.\n\n【33】When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist, who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body.\n\n【34】How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs.\n\n【35】If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.\n\n【36】If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition.\n\n【37】You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth.\n\n【38】In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as:\n\n【39】*   Liposuction (removal of extra breast fat)\n*   Mastectomy (removal of breast gland tissue)\n\n【40】Gynecomastia Prevention\n-----------------------\n\n【41】There are steps you can take to lower your chances of having gynecomastia. They include things such as:\n\n【42】*   Don't use illicit or recreational drugs, such as anabolic steroids, androgens, amphetamines, marijuana, or heroin.\n*   Don't drink alcohol, or drink moderately.\n*   Go over your medicine list with your doctor. If any of your medications can cause gynecomastia, ask if there are alternatives.\n\n【43】Gynecomastia Complications\n--------------------------\n\n【44】Gynecomastia can have an impact on your mental health. You might feel embarrassed, or feel anxious or depressed. There are steps you can take to manage these feelings.\n\n【45】Talk to you doctor about how gynecomastia is making you feel. They can suggest a mental health professional who can help you manage any mental health problems you may get.\n\n【46】Also talk to your family and close friends. They know you best and can give you the emotional backing you need.\n\n【47】Support groups can also help. You'll get a chance to talk to others who understand what you're going through.

It happens when plaque builds up in the walls of arteries that supply the heart. These can narrow and cause chest pain (angina) and later a full-blown heart attack. But some people feel nothing at all until late into the disease.\n\n【1】CAD, also called heart disease, or coronary heart disease, causes roughly 805,000 heart attacks and leads to 696,000 deaths each year in the U.S.  \n\n【2】Because heart disease is so common and often is silent until it strikes, it is important to recognize the factors that put you at risk.\n\n【3】What Raises Your Risk for Heart Disease?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】There are risk factors for heart disease that you have control over and others that you don’t.  Uncontrollable risk factors for heart disease include:\n\n【5】*   Being male\n*   Older age\n*   Family history of heart disease\n*   Being postmenopausal\n*   Race (African American, Native American, and Mexican American people are more likely to have heart disease)\n\n【6】Heart disease risk factors that you can control revolve around lifestyle. These include:\n\n【7】*   Smoking\n*   Unhealthy cholesterol numbers 删除6:<u>(see below)</u>\n*   Uncontrolled high blood pressure\n*   Physical inactivity\n*   Obesity (having a BMI greater than 25)\n*   Uncontrolled diabetes\n*   Uncontrolled stress, depression, and anger\n*   Poor diet\n*   Alcohol use\n\n【8】How Can You Lower Your Heart Disease Risk?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Research shows heart disease may be preventable more than half the time with simple changes in lifestyle.  Besides lowering your risk for heart attack and stroke, these changes often can improve your overall physical and mental health. Here are some ways you can change lifestyle factors to reduce your risk of heart disease:\n\n【10】**Quit smoking**. Smoking is the most preventable risk factor. Smokers have more than twice the risk of heart attack as nonsmokers and are much more likely to die from them. If you smoke, quit. Better yet, don’t start smoking in the first place. Even if you don’t smoke, constant exposure to other people’s cigarette smoke (secondhand smoke) raises your risk of heart disease. \n\n【11】**Improve** **cholesterol levels**. Your risk for heart disease increases with unhealthy cholesterol numbers. The right levels can vary somewhat depending on your age, sex, overall health, and family health history. Ask your doctor about the right levels for you. In general, though, your levels should be as follows:\n\n【12】*   Total cholesterol: less than 200 mg/dL\n*   “Good,” or HDL, cholesterol: 60 mg/dL or greater\n*   “Bad,” or LDL, cholesterol: less than 100 mg/dL\n*   Triglycerides: less than 150 mg/dL\n\n【13】A diet low in cholesterol, saturated and trans fats, and simple sugars, and high in complex carbohydrates can help lower cholesterol levels in some people. Regular exercise will also help lower \"bad\" cholesterol and raise \"good\" cholesterol in some cases.\n\n【14】If that’s not enough, your doctor may suggest a cholesterol medication, like a statin, to help lower levels. \n\n【15】**Control** **high blood pressure**. About 67 million people in the U.S. have high blood pressure, making it the most common risk factor for heart disease. Nearly 1 in 3 adults have systolic blood pressure (the upper number) over 130, and/or diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) over 80, which is the definition of high blood pressure. Your doctor will assess your blood pressure numbers in light of your overall health, lifestyle, and other risk factors. You and your doctor can come up with a plan to help control blood pressure through diet, exercise, weight management, and, if needed, medication.\n\n【16】**Control diabetes**. If not properly controlled, diabetes can lead to heart disease and heart damage, including heart attacks. Control diabetes through a healthy diet, exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and medication as prescribed by your doctor.\n\n【17】**Get active**. People who don't exercise have higher rates of heart disease compared to people who perform even moderate amounts of physical activity. A bit of light gardening or walking can lower your risk of heart disease.\n\n【18】Most people should exercise 30 minutes a day, at moderate intensity, on most days. More vigorous exercise could help even more, but talk to your doctor first.  Try to use large muscle groups and get your heart rate up. Aerobic activities that raise your heart rate include brisk walking, cycling, swimming, jumping rope, and jogging. You can also lift weights to increase strength and muscle endurance.\n\n【19】If motivation is a problem, make an exercise menu. Pick a couple of activities that sound like fun. That way, you always have some choices. Consult your doctor before starting any exercise program, especially if you have underlying health conditions or haven’t exercised in a while.\n\n【20】**Eat right**. Eat a heart-healthy diet low in sodium, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and refined sugars. Try to increase your intake of foods rich in vitamins and other nutrients, especially antioxidants, which may lower your risk for heart disease. Also eat plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables, nuts, and whole grains.\n\n【21】**Rethink your drink**. Limit alcohol. Moderate drinking may be OK, but more than that isn't good for your heart health. What's moderate drinking? Up to one glass a day for women, and up to two glasses a day for men.\n\n【22】**Maintain a healthy weight**. Obesity by itself could raise your risk for heart disease. In addition, excess weight puts strain on your heart and often raises your risk of other heart disease risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help you keep a healthy weight. Talk to your doctor if you need a safe plan for weight loss or if you want to figure out the right body weight for your heart health.\n\n【23】**Manage stress**. Poorly controlled stress and anger can worsen heart disease. Some approaches include:\n\n【24】*   Relaxation methods like meditation, tai chi, yoga, guided imagery, deep breathing, and other approaches.\n*   Talk therapy with a therapist or in a group setting for anger management, anxiety, or other issues.\n*   Time management. If you schedule your time carefully, you’ll be less stressed about getting things done.\n*   Realistic goal setting. Think carefully about what you can realistically get done. If you promise too much to yourself or others, you may create stress when you’re unable to deliver. \n\n【25】**Talk to your doctor**. Discuss your lifestyle as well as your family's medical history with your doctor. Together you’ll be able to come up with a plan best suited to your needs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:08:05", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:08:17", "cost": 11.526}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:08:16", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:08:04"}

The flu can lead to serious health complications and possibly death.\n\n【1】The best way to prevent the flu is to get vaccinated. There are a few types of flu vaccines:\n\n【2】*   Flu shot: The flu shot is typically given to people six months and older. It is an inactive vaccine, which means it is made using a dead form of the viruses the shot protects against. The dead germs cannot make you sick. Those ages 18 to 64 can opt for an intradermal flu shot. This injection uses a smaller needle and goes into the top layer of the skin instead of the muscle. The vaccines are generally safe for those with egg allergies. If you have severe allergies you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor's office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department.\n*   Fluzone high dose: This inactivated vaccine was developed for those ages 65 and older, because older people have weaker immune systems. It's preferred for this group instead of a regular flu shot when available.\n*   Egg-free vaccines: Unlike most flu vaccines, these are not grown inside eggs. They're approved for people with a severe allergy to eggs.\n*   Nasal spray: The nasal spray flu vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, or LAIV. Unlike the flu shot, it is made from live, but weakened, influenza viruses. However, you cannot get the flu from the nasal spray vaccine. Healthy, non-pregnant people ages 2 to 49 may receive the nasal spray. \n\n【3】The three or four flu strains covered by the flu vaccine differ from year to year. That’s because the flu viruses are constantly changing. Scientists develop a new flu vaccine each season based on research that predicts which strains will be most likely to make you sick. \n\n【4】When Should Adults Be Vaccinated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】Flu seasons also vary, depending on where you live. Flu season can run from October to May. You should get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes available. It takes about two weeks for the flu vaccine to start working, so you want to make sure you are fully protected as soon as possible. Generally, the seasonal flu vaccine is available from September until spring.\n\n【6】Which Adults Should Get a Flu Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】The CDC recommends that most every adult receive a flu vaccine every year, especially those who are at high risk for developing flu-related complications and those who care for or live with such people, such as health care workers.\n\n【8】You are more likely to develop serious flu-related complications and should get a flu vaccine if you have:\n\n【9】*   Asthma (even if it's mild or controlled) or other lung disease\n*   Brain, spinal cord, or other neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, intellectual disability, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury\n*   Diabetes and other endocrine disorders\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Kidney disease or damage\n*   Heart disease\n*   Liver disease or damage\n*   Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders)\n*   Morbidly obese (BMI of 40 or greater)\n*   Sickle cell disease and other blood disorders\n*   A weakened immune system due to certain diseases or medical treatments\n\n【10】Your risk of developing flu-related complications is also increased if you are:\n\n【11】*   Older than age 50 or younger than age 2\n*   Pregnant\n*   American Indian or Alaskan Native\n\n【12】You should also get a flu vaccine if you live in a nursing home or other long-term care facility.\n\n【13】Which Adults Should Not Get the Flu Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【14】You should NOT get the influenza vaccine if you:\n\n【15】*   Developed Guillain\\-Barre syndrome within six weeks of receiving the flu vaccine in the past\n*   Had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine in the past\n*   Have a severe allergy to any vaccine component\n\n【16】It's long been advised that people with allergies to eggs should not get the flu shot. However, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says the vaccine contains such a low amount of egg protein that it's unlikely to cause an allergic reaction in those with an egg allergy. If you have a severe egg allergy (anaphylaxis), talk to your doctor before getting the flu vaccine. Also, as mentioned above, flu vaccines not made with eggs are available.\n\n【17】The nasal spray flu vaccine can only be used in healthy, younger adults who are not pregnant. In addition to the previously listed adults who should not receive the flu shot, adults should NOT get the nasal spray influenza vaccine if they:\n\n【18】*   Are pregnant\n*   Are ages 50 or older \n*   Have a weakened immune system due to disease or certain medical treatments\n*   Have a long-term health condition, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or heart or lung disease, including asthma\n*   Have a muscle or nerve condition that can cause problems with breathing or swallowing (such as epilepsy or cerebral palsy)\n*   Have a weakened immune system\n*   Have a nasal condition that could make breathing difficult\n\n【19】You should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine if you are in contact with people who have a severely weakened immune system.\n\n【20】If you are moderately to severely ill, your doctor may recommend waiting to get the shot until after you recover. The CDC says you can still get the vaccine if you have a mild illness such as a cold or low-grade fever.\n\n【21】If you have a stuffy nose, your doctor may recommend that you wait to get the nasal spray flu vaccine, or get the flu shot instead.\n\n【22】Side Effects and Risks for Adult Flu Vaccines\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Like all medications, vaccines can have side effects. But the risk of harm or death from the influenza vaccine is rare.\n\n【24】The flu shot and nasal spray can cause different types of side effects.\n\n【25】Flu shot side effects may include:\n\n【26】*   Low fever\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\n\n【27】The nasal spray flu vaccine for adults may cause:\n\n【28】*   Cough\n*   Headache, muscle aches\n*   Runny nose, nasal congestion\n*   Sore throat\n\n【29】Although it's rare, someone may have a severe allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine. Most of the time, such reactions occur within a few minutes to a few hours of receiving the vaccine. The following can be signs of a severe allergic reaction:\n\n【30】*   Breathing difficulty, including wheezing\n*   Dizziness\n*   Hoarse voice\n*   High fever\n*   Hives\n*   Pale skin\n*   Rapid heart beat\n*   Confusion\n*   Weakness\n\n【31】Seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these signs after receiving the influenza vaccine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:00:32", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:00:45", "cost": 13.089}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:00:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:00:32"}

This is called hypertension\n\n【3】A blood pressure between 120 and 129 and less than 80 is considered elevated. This means that you do not have hypertension, but you may develop it in the future unless you adopt lifestyle changes to keep your blood pressure under control.\n\n【4】How Can I Prevent High Blood Pressure?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】You can prevent high blood pressure by:\n\n【6】*   Maintaining a healthy weight; lose weight if you are overweight.\n*   Exercising more\n*   Eating foods low in salt\n*   Eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables\n*   Drinking alcoholic beverages in moderation, if you drink at all\n\n【7】These changes are also recommended for treating high blood pressure, although medicine is often added as part of the treatment.\n\n【8】How Is Blood Pressure Related to Weight?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【9】As your body weight increases, your blood pressure can rise. In fact, being overweight can make you more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. About 70% of adults in the United States are overweight. You can reduce your risk of high blood pressure by losing weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure.\n\n【10】How Can I Lose Weight?\n----------------------\n\n【11】To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn. But don't go on a crash diet to see how quickly you can lose those pounds. The healthiest and longest-lasting weight loss happens when you do it slowly, losing 1/2 to 1 pound a week. By cutting back by 500 calories/day, by eating less and being more physically active, you can lose about one pound in a week.\n\n【12】Here are some tips to help you lose weight and get on the road to healthy eating:\n\n【13】*   **Choose foods high in fiber.** Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, dry peas, and beans, as well as whole-grain (as opposed to highly processed) cereals, pasta, rice, and breads. They are low-calorie and are good sources of vitamins and minerals.\n*   **Choose whole-wheat vs. processed starches**. Not all starches are equal. In general, you should choose whole-grain instead of processed starches. One guideline is to avoid starchy foods that are predominantly white in color - for example, white bread, potatoes, pasta, or rice. Whole-grain foods have higher nutritional value and generally leave you feeling fuller, which will also help prevent you from overeating.\n*   **Limit serving size.** To lose weight, it's not just the type of foods you eat that's important, but also the amount. To take in fewer calories, you need to limit your portion sizes. Try especially to take smaller helpings of high-calorie foods like higher-fat meats and cheeses. And try not to go back for seconds.\n*   **Keep a food diary.** Write down what you eat, when you eat and why. Note whether you snack on high-fat foods in front of the television, or if you skip breakfast and then eat a large lunch. Once you see your habits, you can set goals for yourself.\n*   **Exercise****.** Another important ingredient to losing weight is increasing physical activity. Cutting down on calories and getting regular physical activity can help you lose more weight and keep it off longer than only eating less or only exercising. Exercise can also lower blood pressure. People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure than people who are not active. You don't have to be a marathon runner to benefit from physical activity. Even light activities, if done daily, can help lower your risk of heart disease. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park farther away from the entrance so that you have to walk farther.\n\n【14】How Can I Reduce My Intake of Salt?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】Americans eat more salt and other forms of sodium than they need. Often, when people with high blood pressure cut back on salt, their blood pressure falls. Cutting back on salt also prevents blood pressure from rising. Some people, like African-Americans and the elderly, may be more affected by sodium than others. Since there's really no practical way to predict exactly who will be affected by sodium, it makes sense for everyone to limit intake of salt to help prevent high blood pressure.\n\n【16】All Americans, especially people with high blood pressure, should eat less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily. That's about 1 teaspoon of table salt. But remember to keep track of ALL salt eaten -- including that in processed foods and salt added during cooking or at the table.\n\n【17】You can teach your taste buds to enjoy less salty foods. Here are a few tips:\n\n【18】*   **Check food labels** for the amount of salt in foods. Choose those lower in sodium most of the time. Look for products that say \"sodium free,\" \"very low sodium,\" \"low sodium,\" \"light in sodium,\" \"reduced or less sodium\" or \"unsalted,\" especially on cans, boxes, bottles, and bags.\n*   **Buy foods that are fresh, plain frozen, or canned with \"no salt added.**\" Use fresh poultry, fish and lean meat, rather than canned or processed types.\n*   **Use herbs, spices, and salt-free seasoning blends** in cooking instead of salt.\n*   **Cook rice, pasta and hot cereals without salt.** Cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, because they usually have added salt.\n*   **Rinse canned foods** like tuna to remove some sodium.\n\n【19】A research study called the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) showed that you can reduce your blood pressure by eating foods rich in grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.\n\n【20】How Much Alcohol Can I Drink if I Have High Blood Pressure?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It may also lead to the development of high blood pressure. So to help prevent high blood pressure, if you drink alcohol, limit how much you drink to no more than two drinks a day if you are male. The \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\" recommend that for overall health, women and lighter weight persons should limit their alcohol to no more than one drink a day.\n\n【22】This is what counts as a drink:\n\n【23】*   1 1/2 ounces of 80-proof or 1 ounce of 100-proof whiskey\n*   5 ounces of wine\n*   12 ounces of beer (regular or light)\n\n【24】You may have heard that some alcohol is good for your heart. Some studies suggest that people who consume a drink or two a day have lower blood pressure and live longer than those who consume excessive amounts of alcohol or no alcohol at all. Others note that wine raises the \"good\" (HDL) blood cholesterol that prevents the build-up of fats in the arteries.\n\n【25】While these studies may be correct, they don't tell the whole story. Too much alcohol contributes to a host of other health problems, such as motor vehicle accidents, diseases of the liver and pancreas, damage to the brain and heart, an increased risk of many cancers, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol is also high in calories. So you should limit how much you drink.\n\n【26】Can Caffeine Affect my Blood Pressure?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【27】The caffeine in drinks like coffee, tea, and sodas may cause blood pressure to go up, but only temporarily. In a short time your blood pressure will go back down. Unless you are sensitive to caffeine and your blood pressure does not go down, you do not have to limit caffeine to avoid developing high blood pressure.\n\n【28】Can Stress Affect Blood Pressure?\n---------------------------------\n\n【29】Yes. Stress can make blood pressure go up for a while and over time may contribute to the cause of high blood pressure. There are many steps you can take to reduce your stress. The article on easing stress will get you started.\n\n【30】What About High Blood Pressure Drugs?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【31】If you have high blood pressure, the lifestyle changes mentioned above may not be enough to lower your pressure. Your doctor may recommend adding medication.\n\n【32】Many people with hypertension need more than one drug to lower their blood pressure. The types of high blood pressure drugs include:\n\n【33】*   **Diuretics**: They include  amiloride (Midamor), bumetanide (Bumex), eplerenone (Inspra), furosimide (Lasix), chlorothiazide (Diuril, Thalitone), hydrochlorothiazide (Esidrix, Microzide), indaparmide (Lozol), methyclothiazide (Enduron),  metolazone (Zaroxolyn), spironolactone (Aldactone), torsemide (Demadex), triamterene (Dyrenium)\n*   **Beta-blockers**: They include  acebutolol (Sectral), atelinol (Tenormin, Toprol),  bisoprolol (Zebeta), betaxolol (Kerlone), carvedilol (Coreg),  labetalol (Trandate),  nadolol (Corgard), metoprolol (Lopressor), penbutalol (Levatol), pindolol (Visken), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), timolol (Betimol), \n*   **ACE inhibitors**: They include benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexioril (Univasc), perinopril (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), trandolapril (Mavik)\n*   **Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers**: They include candesartan (Atacand),  epresartan (Teveten), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar), olmesartan (Benicar), valsartan (Diovan), telmisartan (Micardis)\n*   **Calcium Channel Blockers**: They include: amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac), felodipine ( Plendil), isradipine (Dynacirc), nicardine (Cardene), nifedipine (Adalat CC, Procardia), nisoldipine (Sular), verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin,Verelan),\n*   Alpha blockers: They include clonidine (Catapres), doxazosin (Cardura),  guanfacine (Tenex), prazosin (Minipress), terazosin (Hytrin)\n*   **Vasodilators**: They include Hydralazine, Minoxidil.\n\n【34】Many of these medicines are also available as combination pills that utilize 2 different drugs in one pill.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:32:32", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:33:08", "cost": 35.588}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:33:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:32:32"}

It can feel like a heart attack, with pressure or squeezing in your chest. It’s sometimes called angina pectoris or ischemic chest pain.\n\n【2】It's a symptom of heart disease, and it happens when something blocks your arteries or there's not enough blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n\n【3】Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a sign of a life-threatening heart problem. It's important to find out what's going on and what you can do to avoid a heart attack.\n\n【4】Usually, medicine and lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need what’s called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.\n\n【5】There are different types of angina:\n\n【6】**Stable angina.** This is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\n\n【7】**Unstable angina.** You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.\n\n【8】**Microvascular angina.** With this type, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren’t working the way they should, so your heart doesn’t get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women.\n\n【9】**Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina).** This type is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.\n\n【10】Angina Symptoms\n---------------\n\n【11】Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may have:\n\n【12】*   Aching\n*   Burning\n*   Discomfort\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Feeling of fullness in your chest\n*   Feeling of heaviness or pressure\n*   Upset stomach or vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Squeezing\n*   Sweating\n\n【13】You might mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.\n\n【14】You’re likely to have pain behind your breastbone, which can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.\n\n【15】Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. It’s an emergency that needs medical help right away.\n\n【16】Angina in Women vs. Men\n-----------------------\n\n【17】Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.\n\n【18】One study found that women were more likely to use the words \"pressing\" or \"crushing\" to describe the feeling.\n\n【19】Angina Causes\n-------------\n\n【20】Angina usually happens because of heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to your heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.\n\n【21】Less common causes of chest pain include:\n\n【22】*   A blockage in a major artery of your lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n*   An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)\n*   Narrowing of a valve in the main part of your heart (aortic stenosis)\n*   Swelling of the sac around your heart (pericarditis)\n*   Tearing in the wall of your aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)\n\n【23】Angina Risk Factors\n-------------------\n\n【24】Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at higher risk of angina, including:\n\n【25】*   Older age\n*   Family history of heart disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Diabetes\n*   Obesity\n*   Stress\n*   Using tobacco\n*   Not getting enough exercise\n\n【26】Angina Diagnosis\n----------------\n\n【27】Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, risk factors, and family history. They might need to do tests including:\n\n【28】*   **EKG.** This test measures your heart’s electrical activity and rhythm.\n*   **Stress test.** This checks how your heart is working while you exercise.\n*   **Blood tests.** Your doctor will check for proteins called troponins. Lots of them are released when your heart muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack. Your doctor may also do more general tests like a metabolic panel or complete blood count (CBC).\n*   **Imaging tests.** Chest X-rays can rule out other things that might be causing your chest pain, like lung conditions. Echocardiograms and CT and MRI scans can create images of your heart to help your doctor spot problems.\n*   **Cardiac catheterization.** Your doctor inserts a long, thin tube into an artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart to check your blood flow and pressure.\n*   **Coronary angiography.** Your doctor injects dye into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye shows up on an X-ray, creating an image of your blood vessels. They may do this procedure during cardiac catheterization.\n\n【29】**Angina questions for your doctor**\n\n【30】*   Do I need any more tests?\n*   What type of angina do I have?\n*   Do I have heart damage?\n*   What treatment do you recommend?\n*   How will it make me feel?\n*   What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack?\n*   Are there activities I shouldn't do?\n*   Will changing my diet help?\n\n【31】Angina Treatment\n----------------\n\n【32】Your treatment depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help their blood flow better and control their symptoms.\n\n【33】**Medicines**\n\n【34】Your doctor might prescribe medicines including:\n\n【35】*   Nitrates or calcium channel blockers to relax and widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to your heart\n*   Beta-blockers to slow your heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard\n*   Blood thinners or antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots\n*   Statins to lower your cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque\n\n【36】**Cardiac procedures**\n\n【37】If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:\n\n【38】**Angioplasty/stenting.** The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again.\n\n【39】The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You’ll probably stay overnight at the hospital.\n\n【40】**Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery.** Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.\n\n【41】You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover.\n\n【42】**Enhanced external counterpulsation**\n\n【43】Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) may be an option to relieve your angina. Your doctor may recommend it if other treatments haven’t worked or aren’t right for you.\n\n【44】EECP uses several blood pressure cuffs on both legs to gently, but firmly, compress the blood vessels there to boost blood flow to your heart. Each wave is timed to your heartbeat. So more blood goes there when it’s relaxing.\n\n【45】When your heart pumps again, pressure is released right away. This lets blood be pumped more easily. It can help your blood vessels make a natural bypass around narrowed or blocked arteries that cause your chest pain. It may help some small blood vessels in your heart open. They may give more blood flow to your heart muscle to help ease your chest pain.\n\n【46】You might have EECP if you:\n\n【47】*   Have chronic stable chest pain\n*   Aren’t helped by nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers\n*   Invasive procedures like bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stenting aren’t right for you.\n\n【48】EECP isn’t invasive. If you’re accepted for EECP treatment, you’ll have 35 hours of therapy. It’s given 1 to 2 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. Studies have shown its benefits include less need for anti-anginal medicine, fewer symptoms, and the ability to be more active without symptoms\n\n【49】**Lifestyle changes**\n\n【50】You can still be active, but it's important to listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you’re doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. If you still feel pain, talk to your doctor about having more tests or changing your medications. Because angina can be a sign of something dangerous, it’s important to get checked out.\n\n【51】These lifestyle tips may help protect your heart:\n\n【52】**If you smoke, stop.** It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.\n\n【53】**Eat a heart-healthy diet** to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar.\n\n【54】**Use stress-relieving measures** like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax.\n\n【55】**Exercise** most days of the week.\n\n【56】**See your doctor regularly.**\n\n【57】If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage.\n\n【58】Angina Outlook\n--------------\n\n【59】Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But it’s treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make healthy choices.\n\n【60】Talk with others who have it. That may help you learn how to feel better.\n\n【61】Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina. They'll want to know what they can do to help.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:45:38", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:46:20", "cost": 42.099}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:02", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:46:17", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:45:34"}

But doctors now understand that other mental illnesses and some conditions that throw off your body’s metabolism also can make you catatonic. About 1 person in 10 who has a severe mental illness will have catatonia at some point.\n\n【2】Catatonia can be treated, but if it’s not, it can lead to life-threatening problems.\n\n【3】Symptoms and Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【4】Doctors can diagnose someone as catatonic if they have any three of these signs:\n\n【5】*   Not responding to other people or their environment\n*   Not speaking\n*   Holding their body in an unusual position\n*   Resisting people who try to adjust their body\n*   Agitation\n*   Repetitive, seemingly meaningless movement\n*   Mimicking someone else’s speech\n*   Mimicking someone else’s movements\n\n【6】Types\n-----\n\n【7】There are three types of catatonia:\n\n【8】*   **Akinetic catatonia**. This is the most common. Someone with akinetic catatonia often stares blankly and won’t respond when you speak to them. If they do respond, it may only be to repeat what you said. Sometimes they sit or lie in an unusual position and won’t move.\n*   **Excited catatonia**. With this type, the person may move around, but their movement seems pointless and impulsive. They may seem agitated, combative, or delirious, or they may mimic the movements of someone who’s trying to help them.\n*   **Malignant catatonia**. This type happens when the symptoms lead to other health problems, like dangerous changes in blood pressure, body temperature, or breathing or heart rate. Someone who’s catatonic for a long time may be more likely to have problems like dehydration, blood clots, or kidney failure as a result of the symptoms.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Doctors aren’t sure exactly what makes someone become catatonic. It happens most often with people who have mood disorders or psychotic disorders, like depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. About a third of people who are catatonic also have bipolar disorder.\n\n【11】Several physical conditions can lead to catatonia in people who don’t have a mental illness. These include:\n\n【12】*   Conditions that affect your body chemistry, like kidney problems, diabetes, and thyroid conditions\n*   Parkinson’s disease, which attacks your body’s nervous system\n*   Encephalitis, an infection that affects your brain\n\n【13】Treatment\n---------\n\n【14】Doctors usually treat catatonia with a kind of sedative called a benzodiazepine that’s often used to ease anxiety.\n\n【15】Another treatment option is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It sends electrical impulses to the person’s brain through electrodes placed on their head. (They’re given medicine to sleep through the procedure.) It might be recommended if:\n\n【16】*   Sedatives don’t work.\n*   The catatonia is severe.\n*   The person has had catatonia before.\n*   Quick action is needed to save someone’s life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:30:56", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:31:10", "cost": 13.747}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:31:10", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:30:56"}

When it does, it affects their shape and how they work. Amyloidosis is a serious health problem that can lead to life-threatening organ failure.\n\n【1】Causes and Types of Amyloidosis\n-------------------------------\n\n【2】Many different proteins can lead to amyloid deposits, but only a few have been linked to major health problems. The type of protein and where it collects tells the type of amyloidosis you have. Amyloid deposits may collect throughout your body or in just one area.\n\n【3】The different types of amyloidosis include:\n\n【4】**AL amyloidosis (immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis).** This is the most common type and used to be called primary amyloidosis. AL stands for “amyloid light chains,” which is the type of protein responsible for the condition. There’s no known cause, but it happens when your bone marrow makes abnormal antibodies that can’t be broken down. It’s linked with a blood cancer called multiple myeloma. It can affect your kidneys, heart, liver, intestines, and nerves.\n\n【5】**AA amyloidosis.** Previously known as secondary amyloidosis, this condition is the result of another chronic infectious or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis. It mostly affects your kidneys, but it can also affect your digestive tract, liver, and heart. AA means the amyloid type A protein causes this type.\n\n【6】**Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA).** This is more common in older adults and people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. This form of amyloidosis is caused by deposits of beta-2 microglobulin that build up in the blood. Deposits can build up in many different tissues, but it most commonly affects bones, joints, and tendons.\n\n【7】**Familial, or hereditary, amyloidosis.** This is a rare form passed down through families. It often affects the liver, nerves, heart, and kidneys. Many genetic defects are linked to a higher chance of amyloid disease. For example, an abnormal protein like transthyretin (TTR) is usually the cause.\n\n【8】**Age-related (senile)** **systemic amyloidosis.** This is caused by deposits of normal TTR in the heart and other tissues. It happens most commonly in older men.\n\n【9】**Organ-specific amyloidosis.** This causes deposits of amyloid protein in single organs, including the skin (cutaneous amyloidosis).\n\n【10】Though some types of amyloid deposits have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, the brain is rarely affected by amyloidosis that happens throughout your body.\n\n【11】Risk Factors for Amyloidosis\n----------------------------\n\n【12】Men get amyloidosis more often than women. Your risk for amyloidosis goes up as you grow older. Amyloidosis affects 15% of patients with a form of cancer called multiple myeloma.\n\n【13】Amyloidosis may also happen in people with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis for a long time 删除6:<u>(see \"Dialysis-related amyloidosis\" above)</u>.\n\n【14】Symptoms of Amyloidosis\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Symptoms of amyloidosis are often subtle. They can also vary greatly depending on where the amyloid protein is collecting in the body. It is important to note that the symptoms described below may be due to a variety of health problems. Only your doctor can make a diagnosis of amyloidosis.\n\n【16】General symptoms of amyloidosis may include:\n\n【17】*   Changes in skin color\n*   Severe fatigue\n*   Feeling of fullness\n*   Joint pain\n*   Low red blood cell count (anemia)\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Swelling of the tongue\n*   Tingling and numbness in legs and feet\n*   Weak hand grip\n*   Severe weakness\n*   Sudden weight loss\n\n【18】Cardiac Amyloidosis (Stiff Heart Syndrome)\n------------------------------------------\n\n【19】This condition can cause less blood to flow to your heart muscle. Eventually, your heart will no longer be able to pump normally.\n\n【20】Some doctors also call cardiac amyloidosis “stiff heart syndrome.” Others say a stiff heart is actually a symptom of cardiac amyloidosis.\n\n【21】Either way, amyloid deposits in your heart can make the muscular walls of your heart stiff. They can also make your heart muscle weaker and affect the electrical rhythm of the heart. Stiff heart syndrome can be serious. It may lead to congestive heart failure if it's not successfully treated.\n\n【22】**Who’s at risk?** Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. It’s also more likely to affect older people. People under 40 rarely get the condition.\n\n【23】You can inherit stiff heart syndrome. Other things that raise your chances of getting it are:\n\n【24】*   Having untreated high blood pressure\n*   Being obese\n*   Being over 60\n*   Having gone through menopause\n\n【25】**What are the symptoms?** If amyloidosis affects your heart, some symptoms you might notice are:\n\n【26】*   Shortness of breath when you're doing light activity or lying down\n*   An irregular heartbeat\n*   Signs of heart failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles, weakness, fatigue, and nausea, among others\n\n【27】These can be signs of other health conditions, too. So see your doctor to figure out what’s going on.\n\n【28】**How is it diagnosed?** Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether anyone in your family has cardiac amyloidosis or other heart conditions. They’ll give you a physical exam, too.\n\n【29】The doctor may do several tests to diagnose or rule out cardiac amyloidosis, like:\n\n【30】*   Blood and urine tests\n*   Imaging tests to see inside your body, like ultrasound, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, MRI, or CT scan\n*   Biopsy\n*   Genetic testing, if cardiac amyloidosis runs in your family\n\n【31】**What are the treatments?** There’s more than one type of cardiac amyloidosis. Your treatment will depend on the type you have.\n\n【32】Among the options your doctor might recommend are:\n\n【33】*   Medications, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy\n*   A pacemaker\n*   A stem cell transplant\n\n【34】While some of these treatments, like chemo and immunotherapy, are also used to treat cancer, cardiac amyloidosis isn't cancer. It's a disease that affects the heart muscle.\n\n【35】There's no cure, but there are treatments for most types of cardiac amyloidosis. Getting an early diagnosis is important since treatment can prevent permanent damage.\n\n【36】Renal (Kidney) Amyloidosis\n--------------------------\n\n【37】Your kidneys filter waste and toxins from your blood. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys make it hard for them to do this job. When your kidneys do not work properly, water and dangerous toxins build up in your body. If amyloidosis affects the kidneys, you may have:\n\n【38】*   Signs of kidney failure, including swelling of the feet and ankles and puffiness around the eyes\n*   High levels of protein in your urine\n\n【39】Gastrointestinal Amyloidosis\n----------------------------\n\n【40】Amyloid deposits along your gastrointestinal (GI) tract slow down the movement of food through your intestines. This interferes with digestion. If amyloidosis affects your GI tract, you may have:\n\n【41】*   Less appetite\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Nausea\n*   Stomach pain\n*   Weight loss\n\n【42】If your liver is affected, that can cause liver enlargement and fluid buildup in the body.\n\n【43】Amyloid Neuropathy\n------------------\n\n【44】Amyloid deposits can damage the nerves outside your brain and spinal cord, called the peripheral nerves. The peripheral nerves carry information between your brain and spinal cord and the rest of your body. For example, they make your brain perceive pain if you burn your hand or stub your toes. If amyloidosis affects your nerves, you may have:\n\n【45】*   Balance problems\n*   Problems controlling your bladder and bowel\n*   Sweating problems\n*   Tingling and weakness\n*   Lightheadedness when standing due to a problem with your body's ability to control blood pressure\n\n【46】Diagnosing Amyloidosis\n----------------------\n\n【47】A thorough physical exam and a detailed and accurate account of your medical history are crucial in helping your doctor diagnose amyloidosis.\n\n【48】Blood and urine tests can spot abnormal proteins. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also check your thyroid and liver.\n\n【49】Your doctor will do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of amyloidosis and know the specific type of protein you have. The tissue sample for the biopsy may be taken from your belly fat (the abdominal fat pad), bone marrow, or sometimes your mouth, rectum, or other organs. It's not always necessary to biopsy the part of the body damaged by the amyloid deposits.\n\n【50】Imaging tests can also help. They show the amount of damage to organs like your heart, liver, or spleen.\n\n【51】Your doctor will do a genetic test if they think you have a type that is passed down through families. Treatment for hereditary amyloidosis is different from treatment for other types of the disease.\n\n【52】Once you’re diagnosed, your doctor might check your heart with an echocardiogram or your liver and spleen with imaging tests.\n\n【53】Amyloidosis Treatment\n---------------------\n\n【54】There is no cure for amyloidosis. Your doctor will prescribe treatments to slow the development of the amyloid protein and manage your symptoms. If amyloidosis is related to another condition, then treatment will include targeting that underlying condition.\n\n【55】Specific treatment depends on what type of amyloidosis you have and how many organs are affected.\n\n【56】*   High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant can help remove the substance that leads to amyloid formation in some people with primary AL amyloidosis. Chemotherapy medicines alone may be used to treat other patients with primary AL amyloidosis.\n*   Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is treated by controlling the underlying disorder and with powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids, which fight inflammation.\n*   A liver transplant may treat the disease if you have certain types of hereditary amyloidosis.\n*   New therapies can slow the production of the abnormal protein TTR.\n*   Your doctor might also recommend a kidney transplant.\n\n【57】Other treatments to help with symptoms include:\n\n【58】*   Diuretic medicine to remove extra water from your body\n*   Thickeners to add to fluids to prevent choking if you have trouble swallowing\n*   Compression stockings to relieve swelling in your legs or feet\n*   Changes to what you eat, especially if you have gastrointestinal amyloidosis\n\n【59】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【60】Amyloidosis can be deadly, especially if it affects your heart or kidneys. Early diagnosis and treatment are important and can help improve survival. \n\n【61】Researchers continue to question why some types of amyloid make people sick and how the formation of amyloid can be stopped. Studies to find new treatments are ongoing. If you have amyloidosis, consider asking your doctor if there are any clinical trials you can join, or search for one by visiting www.clinicaltrials.gov and typing in the search term \"amyloidosis.\"", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:29:43", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:30:20", "cost": 36.978}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:30:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:29:43"}

It often spreads quickly.\n\n【7】Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK.\n\n【8】*   ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy.\n*   ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited.\n\n【11】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【12】Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body.\n\n【13】You may also have symptoms like:\n\n【14】*   Fatigue\n*   Fever\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Night sweats\n*   Weight loss\n\n【15】With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch.\n\n【16】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【17】When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know:\n\n【18】*   When did you first notice changes?\n*   Are there any swollen glands?\n*   Is there pain? Where?\n*   What about appetite? Any weight loss?\n*   More tired than usual?\n*   Any skin bumps? Do they itch?\n\n【19】To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope.\n\n【20】Other tests may be needed, such as:\n\n【21】*   Blood tests\n*   Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells.\n*   Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest.\n*   CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body.\n*   MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures.\n*   PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer.\n\n【22】These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment.\n\n【23】*   Stage I. Cancer is found in one place as a tumor or in the lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin.\n*   Stage II. Cancer can also be found in a single tumor and its nearby lymph nodes of only one part of the body. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach.\n*   Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and is outside the lymphatic system.\n*   Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs.\n\n【24】Questions to Ask Your Doctor\n----------------------------\n\n【25】*   What stage is the cancer?\n*   Where exactly have you found cancer?\n*   Is it ALK-positive?\n*   Have you treated someone with ALCL before?\n*   What treatment do you recommend?\n*   What are the side effects?\n*   How and when will we know if it works?\n*   What if it doesn't work?\n*   Could I be in a clinical trial?\n*   How do I connect with other families facing ALCL?\n\n【26】Treatment\n---------\n\n【27】No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful tthere will be new and better options in the future.\n\n【28】Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body.\n\n【29】Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body.\n\n【30】A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone.\n\n【31】If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses.\n\n【32】If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris).\n\n【33】A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor.\n\n【34】For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include:\n\n【35】*   Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells\n*   Surgery to remove the tumors\n\n【36】If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs.\n\n【37】Taking Care of Yourself\n-----------------------\n\n【38】Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life.\n\n【39】While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach\n\n【40】To help you feel better:\n\n【41】*   Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones.\n*   Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment.\n*   Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL.\n*   Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you.\n*   Try to get good rest.\n*   Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick.\n\n【42】Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed.\n\n【43】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【44】Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body.\n\n【45】The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better.\n\n【46】A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it.\n\n【47】Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial.\n\n【48】Getting Support\n---------------\n\n【49】You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation. It has links to help you find the support of people and families who have ALCL, and to information about clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:49:53", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:54:38", "cost": 285.034}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:54:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:49:53"}

It is not a cure. Most types of prostate cancer need the hormone testosterone to grow and spread. Histrelin works by reducing the amount of testosterone that the body makes. This helps slow or stop the growth of cancer cells and helps relieve symptoms such as painful/difficult urination. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treatment.Histrelin is also used by children to treat early puberty ( central precocious puberty ). It helps to slow abnormally fast bone development so that height and growth rate are near normal and to stop or reverse signs of early puberty (such as breast /pubic hair growth in girls, pubic hair growth in boys). Histrelin works by reducing the amount of testosterone and estrogen . This medication is used until the doctor decides it is time for puberty to resume.\n\n【2】### How to use Vantas Kit\n\n【3】Read the Medication Guide and, if available, the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with the histrelin implant. If you have any questions, ask your doctor.\n\n【4】Your doctor will surgically place the medicated implant under the skin of your upper arm. The implant releases histrelin into your blood slowly and continuously over 12 months. After 12 months, your doctor will remove the implant and replace it with a new one. Consult your doctor for details.\n\n【5】It is very important to keep the bandage in place for several days until the surgical incision heals. Keep the incision clean and dry. Avoid bathing and swimming for 24 hours after the procedure. Also avoid any heavy lifting, bumping of the incision site, or physical activity for 7 days after the procedure.\n\n【6】When you first start this medication, new or worsening symptoms may occur. This is a normal response by your body to this drug. Such symptoms should get better after the first month of treatment. Girls being treated for early puberty may notice vaginal bleeding or an increase in breast size or pubic hair . Boys being treated for early puberty may notice an increase in pubic hair . Tell the doctor if the symptoms last or get worse after 1 month.\n\n【7】New or worsening symptoms may also occur at the beginning of treatment for prostate cancer . Tell your doctor right away if you experience any of the following serious side effects: bone pain, numbness/tingling/ weakness of the arms/legs, blood in the urine , painful/difficult urination, unusual weakness, inability to move. If you have prostate cancer that has spread to the spine or caused problems urinating due to blockage, you may require closer monitoring by your doctor, especially when you first start treatment.\n\n【8】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【9】Irritation at the implant site (such as bruising, pain, redness), mood swings, or headache may occur. In men using this medication for prostate cancer , hot flashes (flushing), increased sweating , night sweats , tiredness, swelling of the ankles /feet, or constipation may occur. In girls using this medication for early puberty , breast tenderness or abnormal vaginal bleeding may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【10】Rarely, breast tenderness/swelling may occur in men and boys as a result of lowered testosterone levels. Shrinking of the testicles and reduced sexual interest/ability may also occur in men. Talk to your doctor if these effects occur.\n\n【11】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【12】If you are a man using this medication for prostate cancer , tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: new/worsening bone pain, easily broken bones, increased thirst/urination, mental/mood changes (such as depression ).\n\n【13】Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: chest/jaw/left arm pain, fast/irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness , fainting , weakness on one side of the body, trouble speaking, seizures .\n\n【14】Children using histrelin may be at risk for increased pressure around the brain (intracranial hypertension). Get medical help right away if your child has any of these very serious side effects: nausea / vomiting that doesn't stop, headache that is severe or doesn't go away, eye pain , vision changes (such as blurred/ double vision , decreased vision), ringing in the ears .\n\n【15】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing .\n\n【16】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【17】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【18】Before using histrelin , tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or to similar drugs (such as leuprolide ); or if you have any other allergies . This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\n【19】Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: diabetes , heart disease (such as heart attack ), stroke , high cholesterol , seizures , mental/mood problems (such as depression ).\n\n【20】If you are a man using this medication for prostate cancer , histrelin may weaken your bones and increase your risk for bone loss ( osteoporosis ) if used for a long time. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have osteoporosis or if you have any of the following risk factors for osteoporosis: long-term alcohol use, smoking , family history of osteoporosis and broken bones, use of certain medications (including corticosteroids such as prednisone , certain anti- seizure drugs such as phenytoin).\n\n【21】Histrelin may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). QT prolongation can rarely cause serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness , fainting ) that need medical attention right away.\n\n【22】The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using histrelin, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: certain heart problems ( heart failure , slow heartbeat, QT prolongation in the EKG ), family history of certain heart problems (QT prolongation in the EKG , sudden cardiac death).\n\n【23】Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics /\" water pills \") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating , diarrhea , or vomiting . Talk to your doctor about using histrelin safely.\n\n【24】Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this drug, especially QT prolongation 删除6:<u>(see above)</u>.\n\n【25】This medication must not be used during pregnancy. It may harm an unborn baby. Discuss the use of reliable forms of birth control (such as condoms , birth control pills ) with your doctor. If you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor right away.\n\n【26】It is unknown if this medication passes into breast milk. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.\n\n【27】Interactions\n------------\n\n【28】Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects.

The disease is usually caused by one of several viral infections, so it's sometimes referred to as viral encephalitis.\n\n【4】Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. The most appropriate treatment and the patient's chance of recovery depend on the virus involved and the severity of the inflammation.\n\n【5】In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects the brain cells. In para-infectious encephalitis, the brain and spinal cord become inflamed within one to two weeks of contracting a viral or bacterial infection.\n\n【6】What Causes Encephalitis?\n-------------------------\n\n【7】Viral encephalitis may develop during or after infection with any of several viral illnesses including influenza, herpes simplex, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, chickenpox, and arbovirus infection including West Nile virus.\n\n【8】Herpes simplex type 1 virus is one of the more common and serious causes of viral encephalitis. Herpes-related encephalitis can erupt rapidly, and may cause seizures or mental changes and even lead to coma or death. It occurs when the herpes simplex type 1 virus travels to the brain rather than moving through the body to the surface of the skin and producing its more common symptom, a cold sore. Early recognition and treatment of herpes encephalitis can be life-saving. You are not more likely to get encephalitis if you have cold sores.\n\n【9】Arbovirus encephalitis is another form of viral encephalitis. It is caused by various viruses that are carried by insects (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Unlike herpes, arboviral infections are seasonal, occurring primarily in summer and early fall, and are clustered in specific regions, such as in the case of St. Louis encephalitis.\n\n【10】In rare instances, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or rickettsial infections cause encephalitis. Cancer or even exposure to certain drugs or toxins may also cause encephalitis.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Encephalitis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】The symptoms of encephalitis are usually sudden and severe.\n\n【13】They include:\n\n【14】*   Fever\n*   Drowsiness, lethargy, and possibly coma\n*   Headaches\n*   Personality changes, irritability, or emotional outbursts\n*   Confusion\n*   Weakness in one or more areas of the body\n*   Seizures\n*   Bulging soft spots in infants\n\n【15】Seek medical attention right away if you or someone else has any of these symptoms.\n\n【16】How Is Encephalitis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【17】Many clues as to the cause of encephalitis come from an exposure history. Because a person with encephalitis is usually disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It is important to know if the person may have come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks, infected animals, or sick people.\n\n【18】Your doctor may also order an MRI scan, spinal tap, or electroencephalogram (EEG).\n\n【19】Blood tests to check for bacteria or viruses and the immune cells produced in response to them can also be helpful.\n\n【20】Rarely, an analysis of a brain tissue sample (biopsy) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis in cases where symptoms are getting worse and treatments aren't working. It can be very important to identify the type of encephalitis in order to give the right treatment.\n\n【21】What Are the Treatments for Encephalitis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【22】Because complications from encephalitis can be serious, the condition requires hospitalization. Treatment will depend largely on your age and condition, as well as the form and cause of the disease.\n\n【23】If encephalitis is caused by a bacterial infection, it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. Treatment for herpes\\-related encephalitis includes supportive care, as well as intravenous antiviral therapy with a drug such as acyclovir. Other treatments may be used to lower fever, provide hydration, treat seizures if they develop, and reduce any pressure in the skull.\n\n【24】With proper care, most people recover from encephalitis. Infants and elderly people are at greater risk of permanent brain damage.\n\n【25】How Can I Prevent Encephalitis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】The elimination of smallpox and the use of vaccines against mumps, measles, and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis, especially in children.\n\n【27】Vaccines have been developed for people who travel to high-risk areas as well.\n\n【28】Other ways to prevent it are to avoid viruses that can lead to the disease (like herpes) and to protect yourself against mosquito and tick bites.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:33:51", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:33:57", "cost": 5.882}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:33:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:33:50"}

These tumors start in cells that make certain chemicals, and they release more of those chemicals into your bloodstream.\n\n【2】The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions like menopause or asthma. For example, there may be times when your skin suddenly gets red and warm, you have trouble breathing, or you have a rapid heartbeat.\n\n【3】Carcinoid tumors usually grow in your stomach and intestines, but you can also get them in your lungs, pancreas, testicles, or ovaries. If you have carcinoid syndrome, it usually means the cancer has spread, most often to your lungs or liver.\n\n【4】If your doctor finds a tumor early, they might be able to remove it. But other times, there’s no cure for carcinoid tumors. Treatments can help you live longer and better. You can also take steps to relieve the symptoms and feel more comfortable.\n\n【5】Carcinoid Syndrome Causes\n-------------------------\n\n【6】Carcinoid syndrome happens because the tumors can make chemicals like hormones. When the cancer has spread to your liver, these chemicals can get into your blood. There, they can travel around your body and cause symptoms. The chemicals can go directly into your bloodstream if you have tumors in your lungs, testes, or ovaries.\n\n【7】Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms\n---------------------------\n\n【8】People with carcinoid syndrome may have:\n\n【9】*   Skin that turns pink, red, or purple\n*   Small, widened blood vessels on their face\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Shortness of breath or wheezing\n*   Rapid heart rate\n*   Sudden drops in blood pressure\n\n【10】Carcinoid Syndrome Complications\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】Carcinoid syndrome can lead to other problems, including:\n\n【12】*   **Carcinoid heart disease.** This can make your heart valves get thick and leak. Medicine can help, and in some cases, you may need surgery.\n*   **Bowel blockage.** A tumor in the lymph nodes next to your small intestine can block your digestion. This causes severe belly pain and vomiting. You might need surgery.\n*   **Carcinoid crisis.** Rarely, you might have a severe episode of blushing, trouble breathing, and confusion. This is an emergency that could be life-threatening, so get medical help right away.\n\n【13】Carcinoid Syndrome Diagnosis\n----------------------------\n\n【14】If your doctor thinks you have carcinoid syndrome, they’ll do a physical exam and may ask you questions like:\n\n【15】*   Have there been times when your skin suddenly got red and felt warm or burning?\n*   Do you often have diarrhea?\n*   Have you been short of breath?\n*   Do you sometimes wheeze?\n\n【16】You may also need tests to look for a carcinoid tumor.\n\n【17】**Urine test.** You collect your pee in containers over a 24-hour period. A lab will check it for high levels of hormones or what's left when your body breaks them down.\n\n【18】**Blood test.** This could also show chemicals that the tumors release.\n\n【19】**Imaging tests.** A CT scan is a series of X-rays that gives detailed views of the inside of your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make pictures of your organs. For radionuclide scanning, your doctor will inject you with a small amount of radioactive material, and your organs will absorb it. A special camera can spot the material and make pictures that help your doctor find a tumor.\n\n【20】Questions for Your Doctor\n-------------------------\n\n【21】*   Where are the tumors that are causing my carcinoid syndrome?\n*   What kinds of tests will I need?\n*   What treatment do you recommend?\n*   Are there any foods I should avoid?\n*   What can I do to control my skin flushing?\n*   What other symptoms should I watch out for?\n\n【22】Carcinoid Syndrome Treatment\n----------------------------\n\n【23】To treat carcinoid syndrome, your doctor will need to treat your tumors. You could have just one treatment or a combination of them.\n\n【24】**Surgery.** Doctors may take out an entire organ that has tumors, such as your appendix, or remove only part of an affected area, such as a section of your bowel.\n\n【25】Depending on where the tumor is, your doctor may also use an electric current to burn it off or cryosurgery to freeze it. Another option could be radiofrequency ablation. It uses a tool that sends electrical energy into the tumor to kill cancer cells.\n\n【26】**Chemotherapy****.** Strong medicines can often kill your cancer cells or slow their growth. You can take some of these drugs by mouth and get others through injections into a vein.\n\n【27】**Radiation****.** This treatment can destroy cancer cells or keep them from multiplying. The radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or your doctor may place a small amount of radioactive material inside your body, in or near the tumor.\n\n【28】**Liver directed therapy.** This treatment kills cancer cells in your liver by blocking their blood supply. Your doctor threads a tube called a catheter into one of the arteries that carries blood to your liver. Then, they inject particles that block the blood flow to liver tumors.\n\n【29】**Biologic drugs.** This type of treatment, which is also called immunotherapy, strengthens your body's defenses. Doctors inject drugs that help your immune system kill cancer cells.\n\n【30】**Drug therapy.** Injected drugs such as lanreotide (Somatuline) and octreotide (Sandostatin) can help with skin flushing. They may also have a small effect on tumor growth. Telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) along with lanreotide or octreotide can help ease diarrhea.\n\n【31】Lanreotide and octreotide attach to carcinoid cells and cut down on the amount of chemicals they make. Their side effects can include nausea, gallstones, and pain or bruising where you inject it.\n\n【32】In some cases, doctors give octreotide with a medicine called interferon alfa to boost your body's response.\n\n【33】Lifestyle Changes\n-----------------\n\n【34】You can make smaller changes to curb the effects of carcinoid syndrome. For instance, avoid certain foods and drinks that can trigger symptoms:\n\n【35】*   Alcohol\n*   Nuts\n*   Cheese\n*   Chili peppers\n*   Hot liquids\n\n【36】It might take some trial and error to learn which are triggers for you.\n\n【37】Your intestines could have trouble absorbing nutrients, which can lead to weight loss, weakness, and other problems. Try to eat a healthy diet, and ask your doctor whether you need to take vitamins or supplements.\n\n【38】Carcinoid Syndrome Outlook\n--------------------------\n\n【39】Treatment might make the tumors go away. But the cancer may not be gone completely, or it could return. You may need regular therapy to keep it in check for as long as possible.\n\n【40】If your treatment stops working, you can focus on making sure you're as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care.\n\n【41】Getting Support\n---------------\n\n【42】You don't have to face things alone. Consider joining a support group where you can you share your feelings with others who understand what it's like.\n\n【43】Learn more about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors on the website of the Carcinoid Cancer Foundation. It also has information about how to join support groups in your area.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:09", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:28", "cost": 18.651}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:28", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:09"}

You tend to get them at the same time each year, such as in the spring or fall. Because of this, people often mistake cluster headaches for symptoms of allergies or work stress.\n\n【1】Experts don't know what causes them, but a nerve in your face is involved, creating intense pain around one of your eyes. It's so bad that most people can't sit still and will often pace during an attack. Cluster headaches can be more severe than a migraine, but they usually don't last as long.\n\n【2】These are the least common type of headaches, affecting fewer than one in 1,000 people. Men get them more than women do. You usually start getting them before age 30. Cluster headaches may go away completely (this is called going into remission) for months or years, but they can come back without any warning.\n\n【3】What Happens\n------------\n\n【4】You get a cluster headache when a nerve pathway in the base of your brain is triggered. That signal seems to come from a deeper part of the brain called the hypothalamus, home of the \"internal biological clock\" that controls your sleep and wake cycles.\n\n【5】The nerve that's affected, the trigeminal nerve, is responsible for sensations such as heat or pain in your face. It's near your eye, and it branches up to your forehead, across your cheek, down your jaw, and above your ear on the same side.\n\n【6】A brain condition, such as a tumor or aneurysm, won't cause these headaches.\n\n【7】Characteristics of Cluster Headaches\n------------------------------------\n\n【8】There are a few things that set this type of headache apart. They include:\n\n【9】*   **Speed.** Cluster headaches generally reach their full force quickly, within 5 or 10 minutes.\n*   **Pain.** It’s almost always on one side of your head, and it stays on the same side during a period, the time when you're getting daily attacks. (When a new headache period starts, it might switch to the opposite side, but that's rare.) It's often described as a burning or piercing. It may be throbbing or constant. You'll feel it behind or around one eye. It may spread to your forehead, temple, nose, cheek, or upper gum on that side. Your scalp may be tender. You can often feel your blood pulsing.\n*   **Short duration.** Cluster headaches usually last only 30 to 90 minutes. They can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 3 hours, but then they disappear. You'll probably get one to three of these headaches a day. Some people have as few as one every other day, while others get them up to eight times a day.\n*   **Predictable.** Attacks seem to be linked to the circadian rhythm, your body's 24-hour clock. They happen so regularly, generally at the same time each day, that they've been called \"alarm clock headaches.\" They might even wake you up an hour or two after you go to bed. Nighttime attacks can be more severe than daytime ones.\n*   **Frequent.** Most people will get daily headaches for 2 weeks to 3 months; in between these periods, they'll be pain-free for at least 2 weeks.\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】The pain usually starts suddenly, often around or behind the eye. You may notice:\n\n【12】*   Discomfort or a mild burning feeling \n*   A swollen or drooping eye\n*   A smaller pupil in the eye\n*   Eye redness or watering\n*   Runny or congested nose\n*   Red, warm face\n*   Sweating\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Restlessness or agitation, pacing\n\n【13】Cluster headaches are more common in people who smoke or who are heavy drinkers. During a cluster period, you'll be more sensitive to alcohol and nicotine. Just a bit of alcohol can trigger a headache. But drinking won't trigger one during headache-free periods.\n\n【14】Triggers\n--------\n\n【15】When you’re in a cluster period, any of these can bring on a headache:\n\n【16】*   Cigarette smoke\n*   Alcohol\n*   Strong smells\n*   Change to a high altitude\n*   Bright light\n*   Exercise or exertion\n*   Heat\n*   Foods that contain nitrates, such as bacon or lunch meat\n*   Cocaine\n\n【17】Migraine vs. Cluster Headache\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】Both types of headaches cause intense pain. But the way they hurt and where you feel them are different.\n\n【19】Migraine headaches begin slowly and can last a few hours to a few days. You might get some warning signs up to a day before the pain starts, like cravings for certain foods or changes in your mood. You might also see auras just before the migraine hits.\n\n【20】Migraine gives you a throbbing pain. A cluster headache usually hurts on just one side of your head, but you might feel a migraine on both sides, on one side only, or along your forehead. It will probably get worse when you move your head. You may also have:\n\n【21】*   Nausea and vomiting\n*   Sensitivity to light, sound, and smells\n*   Colored spots, lines, flashing lights, or sparkles in your vision, called auras\n*   Numbness or tingling\n*   Weakness\n*   Trouble speaking or hearing\n\n【22】After a migraine ends, you can have a sort of \"hangover,\" where you feel tired or confused. You may hear your doctor call this a postdrome period.\n\n【23】Many things can trigger a migraine, such as:\n\n【24】*   Changes in the weather\n*   Too much or too little sleep\n*   Strong smells\n*   Stress\n*   Loud noises\n*   Too little food\n*   Anxiety or depression\n*   Certain medicines\n*   Hormone changes\n*   Caffeine, certain foods, and food additives\n\n【25】Treatment\n---------\n\n【26】You have several options when it comes to treating cluster headaches:\n\n【27】**Medications**\n\n【28】**Acute attack treatments** help when the headache hits:\n\n【29】*   **Triptans.** These drugs are among the best ways to treat the pain. You might get:\n    *   Sumatriptan (Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Sumavel, Zecuity, Zembrace SymTouch), which works both as a shot or inhaled\n    *   Zolmitriptan (Zomig)\n*   **Dihydroergotamine (DHE 45).** This prescription medicine is based on the ergot fungus.\n*   **Octreotide.** This is a lab-made form of somatostatin, a growth hormone. You take it through an IV in your vein.\n*   **Lidocaine.** This is a pain reliever, in the form of a nasal spray.\n*   **Oxygen.** Your doctor might call it inhaled oxygen. You’ll breathe it in through a face mask for 15 minutes.\n\n【30】**Preventive medicine** can often stop a headache before it starts. Your doctor can prescribe medication to make a cluster shorter and make attacks less severe, including:\n\n【31】*   Corticosteroids like prednisone\n*   Divalproex sodium (Depakote)\n*   Galcanezumab (Emgality)\n*   Ergotamine tartrate (Cafergot, Ergomar)\n*   Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin)\n*   Lithium carbonate\n*   Topiramate (Qudexy XR, Topamax, Trokendi XR)\n*   Verapamil (Calan, Verelan)\n\n【32】**Occipital nerve block** (your doctor may also call it occipital nerve injection). The doctor will inject a mix of anesthetic and steroid into these nerves. They’re at the base of your skull, and they’re often the starting point for headaches. This is a temporary treatment until a preventive can start to work.\n\n【33】**Nerve stimulation.** If medication doesn’t work, some people have success with:\n\n【34】*   **Occipital nerve stimulation.** Your doctor surgically implants a device that sends electrical impulses to this group of nerves at the base of your skull.\n*   **Neuromodulation.** These FDA-approved noninvasive devices include:\n    *   Cefaly. You put electrodes on your forehead and connect them to a headband-like controller that sends signals to your supraorbital nerve.\n    *   GammaCore. This gadget, also known as a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator (nVNS), uses electrodes to send signals to this nerve.\n\n【35】**Surgery**\n\n【36】If nothing else works, surgery may be an option for people who don't get a break from cluster headaches.\n\n【37】Deep brain stimulation, which involves placing an electrode deep into the brain, is losing favor to less invasive options.\n\n【38】Most procedures involve blocking the trigeminal nerve, a main pathway for pain. It controls the area around your eye, but a misstep can lead to weakness in your jaw and loss of sensation in your face and head.\n\n【39】**Lifestyle changes**\n\n【40】These moves can help you avoid cluster headaches:\n\n【41】*   Keep a regular sleep schedule. A change to your routine can kick off a headache.\n*   Skip alcohol. Any type, even beer and wine, can trigger a bout of headaches when you’re in a cluster series.\n\n【42】**Alternative treatments**\n\n【43】Talk to your doctor about:\n\n【44】*   Capsaicin. A nasal spray of this pain reliever might help.\n*   Melatonin. This medication, known for easing sleep problems like jet lag, might lower the number of headaches.\n\n【45】**Breathing** **exercises**\n\n【46】Breathing exercises have real effects on your body that help keep you calm and control your stress. And for people who get tension headaches or migraine, they can be a key part of treatment.\n\n【47】But are they any match for the intense pain of a cluster headache? While there haven't been studies to show it, some doctors think they're worth trying. After all, there's no harm, and it won't cost you anything.\n\n【48】Breathing exercises can lower anxiety. So if you worry about your next attack, they're a good tool to help you stay even and relaxed.\n\n【49】You can try different types of breathing. No matter which one you use, it helps to:\n\n【50】*   Find a quiet space where you won't be bothered.\n*   Sit down and get comfy.\n*   Let go of your worries for a few minutes.\n\n【51】It's also best to set aside time for it each day. This regular practice will train your body to fall into the breathing more easily when you need it. If you do it only when you're in pain, it'll be much harder to really sink into it.\n\n【52】And keep in mind that these exercises can’t replace medicine. They're something to use along with your normal treatment.\n\n【53】**Deep breathing.** When you're stressed and anxious, you tend to take shorter breaths than usual. This exercise helps you reset. The aim is slow, deep, and steady breaths:\n\n【54】*   Put your focus on your bellybutton. You might want to put a hand there to help.\n*   As you breathe in through your nose, pull the air into your belly. Feel it expand as you fill up your lungs.\n*   Breathe out through your nose with a long, slow breath. Pull your belly in as you empty out your lungs. You can even think to yourself, \"Relax.\"\n\n【55】With each full, deep breath, your nervous system takes it down a notch.\n\n【56】**Rhythmic breathing.** If your breathing style is usually short and fast, this exercise will help you slow it down a bit:\n\n【57】*   Breathe in slowly through your nose as you count to five.\n*   Breathe out slowly through your nose as you count to five.\n*   Repeat and see if you can feel yourself relax with each breath.\n\n【58】As you notice yourself getting calmer, you give your body feedback that helps you relax even further.\n\n【59】**Visualized breathing.** For this one, you combine breathing with pictures in your mind:\n\n【60】*   Get comfortable, close your eyes, and breathe normally.\n*   As you breathe in through your nose, picture calming air that fills up your lungs and expands your chest and belly. Imagine you're breathing in more and more relaxation.\n*   As you breathe out, picture pushing the tension out right along with your breath.\n*   Repeat, breathing in calm and out tension.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:40:52", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:41:10", "cost": 17.755}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:41:10", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:40:52"}

It affects about 1 million people in the United States, or 30% of people who have psoriasis. Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes a red, scaly rash, most often on your elbows, knees, ankles, feet, and hands.\n\n【2】Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition. It happens when your body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue by mistake. PsA most often affects your skin and your joints, which can become swollen, stiff, and painful. Over time, if you don’t treat it, the inflammation can damage joints and tissues.\n\n【3】Psoriatic Arthritis Symptoms\n----------------------------\n\n【4】The symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include:\n\n【5】*   Swollen fingers and toes\n*   Foot pain\n*   Lower back pain\n*   Fatigue\n*   Swelling and pain around tendons\n*   Stiffness and tiredness in the morning\n*   Less range of motion\n*   Nail changes\n*   Eye redness and pain\n*   Scaly skin, especially on your knees, elbows, and scalp\n\n【6】Psoriatic arthritis shares some symptoms with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). But RA usually affects joints on both sides of your body. It can also cause bumps under your skin. Other skin and nail changes are more likely with psoriatic arthritis.\n\n【7】**Where can psoriatic arthritis affect your body?**\n\n【8】This condition can involve different body parts.\n\n【9】*   **Spondylitis** affects your spine and may cause inflammation and stiffness in your neck, lower back, spinal vertebrae, or sacroiliac region (pelvic area), which can make it hard to move. Spondylitis also can attack connective tissue, like ligaments, or cause arthritis in the joints of your arms, hips, legs, or feet.\n*   **Enthesitis** is inflammation of entheses, the place where ligaments or tendons insert into your bones. You’re likely to get it on the bottoms of your feet, your Achilles tendons, and the places where ligaments attach to your ribs, spine, and pelvis. It affects only people with PsA, not other types of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Over time, enthesitis can make tissues in the affected area ropey (your doctor will call this fibrosis) or solid (the doctor might refer to this as ossification or calcification).\n*   **Dactylitis,** or “sausage digits,” is inflammation that affects an entire finger or toe. It happens when small joints and entheses of the surrounding tendons get inflamed. Dactylitis is another hallmark of psoriatic arthritis. It usually involves a few fingers or toes, but not in a symmetrical pattern. Unlike other types of arthritis, PsA can affect different toes and fingers on different sides of your body.\n\n【10】Types of Psoriatic Arthritis\n----------------------------\n\n【11】Like other types of arthritis, psoriatic arthritis can be more or less severe. PsA may be:\n\n【12】*   **Oligoarticular.** Usually a milder type that affects four or fewer joints\n*   **Polyarticular.** A more severe type that affects four or more joints\n\n【13】Psoriatic Arthritis Causes\n--------------------------\n\n【14】Doctors aren’t sure what causes psoriatic arthritis, but these things may play a role:\n\n【15】*   **Genes.** Having a parent with psoriasis triples your chance of getting psoriasis and makes you more likely to have psoriatic arthritis.\n*   **Infection.** An infection that sets off your immune system could be to blame. Psoriasis, for example, is often triggered by strep throat.\n\n【16】Psoriatic Arthritis Risk Factors\n--------------------------------\n\n【17】*   **Psoriasis.** Up to 30% of people with psoriasis get psoriatic arthritis. It affects men and women equally.\n*   **Age.** You can get PsA at any age, but it usually affects people between 30 and 50.\n*   **Family history****.** As many as 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of skin or joint disease.\n\n【18】Psoriatic Arthritis Diagnosis\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and whether any of your relatives have psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or another autoimmune disease. They’ll also check how well your joints move and whether you have pain, tenderness, swelling, or warmth. You may have tests including:\n\n【20】*   Imaging tests such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds\n*   Blood tests to rule out other kinds of arthritis and look for signs of inflammation\n*   Tests of the fluid from your joints or tiny samples of skin\n\n【21】Psoriatic Arthritis Treatment\n-----------------------------\n\n【22】Medical treatments for psoriatic arthritis include:\n\n【23】*   **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (****NSAIDs****).** These are over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and naproxen.\n*   **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).** These can slow or stop pain, swelling, and joint and tissue damage. If NSAIDs don’t work, your doctor will try DMARDs. They may take longer to work.\n*   **Immunosuppressants.** If you can’t take a DMARD, you might get a type of drug called an immunosuppressant. These drugs curb your immune system, which is what’s causing the problem in an autoimmune condition like PsA. But they can also make it more likely that you’ll get an infection.\n*   **UV light.** Therapy with UVA light can ease skin symptoms in people who have severe psoriasis. But it may also raise your chances of skin cancer.\n*   **Biologics.** If immune suppression doesn't work, your doctor may prescribe a biologic. These are a newer type of DMARD. Rather than weaken your entire immune system, these medications block a protein that causes inflammation.\n*   **Enzyme inhibitor.** This works by blocking a certain enzyme, a kind of protein, called PDE-4. That helps slow other reactions that lead to inflammation.\n*   **Steroids****.** These can help control inflammation, but doctors don’t use them often for PsA because they can make your skin rash worse. Doctors prescribe steroids only when you really need them. If you use them for a long time, you could have serious side effects such as brittle bones, weight gain, hypertension, and diabetes.\n*   **Surgery.** A severely damaged joint can be replaced with a new one made from metal and plastic.\n\n【24】**Lifestyle changes and home remedies**\n\n【25】Some things you do on your own can ease psoriatic arthritis symptoms:\n\n【26】*   **Keep a healthy weight.** Carrying extra pounds puts more stress on your joints. It may also affect how well your medications work.\n*   **Stop smoking.** This is one of the best things you can do for your overall health.\n*   **Limit alcohol.** It can also affect how your treatments work.\n*   **Exercise.** It’s a great way to protect your joints and keep your weight in check. Stronger muscles can also support your joints. Low-impact exercises like swimming or walking are easier on them. Ask your doctor about an exercise plan.\n*   **Try physical or occupational therapy.** Your doctor might recommend that you see a specialist who can help you learn to manage your symptoms. This can involve exercises, body adjustments, hot and cold therapy, and tips for changing the way you do certain things. A physical or occupational therapist can also help you pick assistive devices like braces or splints to support your joints.\n*   **Use acupuncture or massage therapy.** These treatments are natural ways to ease pain and stiffness.\n\n【27】Psoriatic Arthritis Complications\n---------------------------------\n\n【28】PsA can make you more likely to have:\n\n【29】*   A form of arthritis called gout\n*   Fatigue\n*   Obesity\n*   Metabolic syndrome, which may include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar\n*   Fibromyalgia\n*   Depression and anxiety\n\n【30】Psoriatic Arthritis Flare Triggers\n----------------------------------\n\n【31】Certain things could trigger psoriatic arthritis, including:\n\n【32】*   Not taking your medication\n*   A skin injury, like a scrape or sunburn\n*   Infection\n*   Lack of sleep\n*   Stress\n*   Extra weight\n\n【33】Psoriatic Arthritis Outlook\n---------------------------\n\n【34】There’s no cure for psoriatic arthritis. But treatment can ease your symptoms and may make them go away completely, known as remission.

This leads to swelling in the joints, which causes pain and makes it harder to move. Abatacept works by weakening your immune system. This effect helps to slow down joint damage and reduce joint pain and swelling so you can move better. This medication is also used to treat other types of arthritis (such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis , psoriatic arthritis ).\n\n【2】### How to use Orencia Syringe\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet and Instructions for Use provided by your pharmacist before you start receiving abatacept and each time you get a treatment. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】This drug is given by injection under the skin of your thigh, abdomen , or upper arm as directed by your doctor, usually once a week. Your doctor may direct you to first receive abatacept by injection into a vein (loading dose) before starting treatment with this form of the medication . If you are switching from regularly scheduled injections into a vein, carefully follow your doctor's directions for when to start using this medication (usually instead of the next scheduled dose).\n\n【5】The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. In children, the dosage is also based on weight .\n\n【6】Remove this medication from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes before injecting.

Their risk of getting COVID-19 is about the same as that of adults. The risk can be drastically reduced if your child receives the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【2】COVID-19 may cause more serious illness in children who have certain medical conditions and in babies younger than 12 months.\n\n【3】In some cases, children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is a serious condition that requires medical attention (more below).\n\n【4】Some very simple and effective ways to help prevent your child from catching or spreading COVID-19 are:\n\n【5】*   Have them wash their hands often.\n*   Clean your home often.\n*   Keep your child away from sick people.\n*   Know the COVID-19 level in your community, a statistic that is constantly updated by the CDC.\n*   Follow CDC recommendations as far as precautions such as masking.\n*   Have them vaccinated\n\n【6】You’ll also want to reassure your child if they’re anxious about any changes in their routines, like staying home from school or not seeing friends face-to-face. Watch for unusual worry or sadness, trouble eating or sleeping, and attention problems.\n\n【7】Talk to them about what’s happening, and reassure them that most cases of COVID-19 are mild. Your children will pick up cues from you, so it’s important that you stay calm, too.\n\n【8】Are COVID-19 Symptoms Different in Children and Adults?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】When children and teens get sick with COVID-19, their symptoms appear to be similar to adults. There have been fewer hospitalizations among people in the U.S. under the age of 19. Research shows that over 90% of children who get sick have very mild to moderate cold-like symptoms that include:\n\n【10】*   Fever\n*   Runny nose\n*   Cough\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\n【11】Some children and teens have been hospitalized with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Doctors are still learning about it, but they think it’s linked to COVID-19. Symptoms include fever, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, and confusion. They’re similar to those of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, which causes inflamed blood vessels in children.\n\n【12】Serious problems are rare. Get medical help right away if your child shows any of these symptoms:\n\n【13】*   Trouble breathing\n*   Can't keep liquids down\n*   Changes in skin color, including blue lips or face\n*   Confusion or trouble waking up\n\n【14】Coronavirus in Children With Medical Conditions\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Some children may be at higher risk for more severe disease if they have other medical conditions such as:\n\n【16】*   Asthma\n*   Diabetes\n*   Blood disorders\n*   Heart or liver disease\n*   Kidney disease that needs dialysis\n*   A weakened immune system\n\n【17】How Can I Protect My Children From the Coronavirus?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The CDC has recommended that everyone 6 months and older should get the COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the coronavirus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are approved for ages 6-months and older. The CDC also recommends a booster with the bilvalent vaccine 2 months after their most recent vaccination to cover the more current variants of coronavirus.\n\n【19】But getting the vaccine does not ensure that your child will not get infected. It’s important to do everything you can to protect your child and the rest of your family from disease. Here are ways to cut their risk of illness:\n\n【20】**Wear masks indoors in public.** People can spread the coronavirus even when they don’t have symptoms or before symptoms start. To slow the spread, the CDC says everyone over the age of 2 should wear a mask indoors when they’re in a public place if they have not been fully vaccinated or if the level of COVID-19 spreading in your community is high. The CDC has a tool to help you track the COVID-19 community level where you live.\n\n【21】Fit is important, so buy masks that are sized for small faces. Try on masks at home so children have time to get used to them. Make sure your child doesn’t touch the mask while wearing it.\n\n【22】**Wash hands often.** All kids should wash their hands:\n\n【23】*   After they go to the bathroom\n*   After they sneeze, cough, or blow their nose\n*   Before they eat\n*   As soon as they enter the house\n\n【24】Soap and water are best. Make sure they lather the backs of their hands, between their fingers, and under their nails for at least 20 seconds (the same amount of time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” two times). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\n【25】**Stay home, and no playdates in person.**When levels of coronavirus are high in your area, it’s important to limit close contact with others to reduce the spread of the disease. Stay home as much as possible, and avoid public places like shopping malls and movie theaters. Don’t have playdates or sleepovers. Your child may not seem sick, but they may still have the virus and can pass it to others.\n\n【26】**Keep your kids away from others who are ill.** And if your child has cold-like symptoms, keep them home. Teach them to cough and sneeze into a tissue that they toss after each use, or into their arm or elbow instead of their hands.\n\n【27】**Clean your home regularly.** Disinfect high-touch surfaces like toilets, sinks, doorknobs, light switches, handles, smartphones, tablets, and TV remotes every day. You can use most regular household cleaners, or make your own by mixing a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. If your child has a favorite stuffed animal or plush item, wash it frequently at the highest possible temperature.\n\n【28】**Take care if you get sick.** A new mom who tests positive for COVID-19 or thinks she could have it might choose to temporarily stay away from her baby in order to lower the chances of spreading the virus.\n\n【29】Talk about the pros and cons with your medical team. If you go this route and still want to breastfeed, you can pump breast milk and have a healthy caregiver feed your child. If you might be sick but don’t want to separate from your baby, take extra steps to avoid spreading the virus. Wash your hands often, and wear a face mask when you’re 6 feet away or closer, including when nursing.\n\n【30】Variants and Children\n---------------------\n\n【31】The number of children with COVID-19 has dramatically spiked with the Omicron variant. To ensure their safety, it’s important to have your kids fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To keep your young ones safe:\n\n【32】*   Have your child wear a mask in crowded areas, even if they’re vaccinated.\n*   If possible, allow children to social distance.\n*   Try to avoid crowded indoor activities. Take your children to outdoor events.\n*   Keep windows open, if the weather allows, to create more ventilation.\n*   Be cautious around older people and those with underlying conditions.\n*   If your child is too young to get the vaccine, ensure that all others in your household get vaccinated.\n\n【33】What’s the Treatment for Young Children With COVID-19?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】There’s one FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment for certain kids under 12 years old. It’s a shot called remdesivir (Veklury). It’s for children 28 days of age and older who weigh about 7 pounds at least, and are either:\n\n【35】*   In the hospital due to COVID-19\n*   Not hospitalized but have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for the disease becoming severe\n\n【36】Remdesivir can cause side effects. There’s a chance it could raise a child’s levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury. It could also trigger an allergic reaction, which may include signs like:\n\n【37】*   Changes in blood pressure and heart rate\n*   Low blood oxygen level\n*   Fever\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing\n*   Swelling of the lips, around the eyes, under the skin, or other body parts\n*   Rashes\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Shivering\n\n【38】Get medical help right away if you think your child is having side effects. Dial 911 if they’re having trouble breathing.\n\n【39】Paxlovid is used to treat adults and children 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of the disease becoming severe. Paxlovid should be taken as soon as possible after you’re diagnosed and within 5 days of your symptoms starting.\n\n【40】Remdesivir and Paxlovid are not substitutes for the COVID-19 vaccine in children who are eligible. Your child should still get the COVID vaccine if they are 6-months or older.\n\n【41】What to Do if Your Child Gets Sick With COVID-19\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】If your child has symptoms that you think might be COVID-19, call a doctor. They can tell you what to do and whether the doctor needs to see your child in person. Don’t just show up at the doctor’s office -- call first.\n\n【43】In the event that your child has COVID-19, they’ll likely stay at home to recover. Your child should rest and drink plenty of fluids. Never use aspirin in children younger than 19. It increases their risk of a serious condition called Reye’s syndrome. You may want to try giving your child an over-the-counter pain reliever that’s a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen.  Acetaminophen may be a safer option. To make sure the rest of the family doesn’t get sick:\n\n【44】**Separate them.** Your child should stay away from the other people in your home -- ideally, in a specific room and bathroom. They shouldn’t snuggle or kiss family pets, either. If your child has COVID-19, they should wear a face mask when they’re around other people.

Over half of adults in the U.S. have it in their body by age 40. CMV spreads easily through an infected person’s saliva or other body fluids. It’s related to the herpes virus, which gives you cold sores.\n\n【2】If you have a healthy immune system that can easily control the virus, it usually doesn't cause problems. But it can make people who have weakened immune systems sick.\n\n【3】In people who have advanced HIV, CMV can cause an eye infection called retinitis that may lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is what’s known as an AIDS-defining condition. The virus could also affect your intestines, esophagus, lungs, brain, or nerves.\n\n【4】There are different types of cytomegalovirus infection.\n\n【5】*   **Congenital.** This is when a baby gets CMV from its mother before birth.\n*   **Primary.** This is the first time someone gets CMV. It usually doesn’t cause symptoms, but some people may have signs that look like mononucleosis.\n*   **Reactivation.** An infection that has been dormant can become active again when your immune system is weakened. It can happen if you have advanced HIV, are in treatment for cancer, or have an organ transplant.\n\n【6】Cytomegalovirus Symptoms\n------------------------\n\n【7】**General symptoms of primary CMV**\n\n【8】Most healthy people who get CMV don't know it. If you have symptoms of primary CMV, they're mild and include:\n\n【9】*   Fatigue\n*   Swollen glands\n*   Fever\n*   Sore throat\n*   Muscle aches\n\n【10】**Less common symptoms of primary CMV**\n\n【11】In rare cases, CMV can also cause:\n\n【12】*   Changes to your personality\n*   Headaches\n*   Trouble concentrating\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Dry cough\n\n【13】**Symptoms of congenital CMV**\n\n【14】Babies born with CMV might have:\n\n【15】*   Premature delivery\n*   Small size or low birth weight\n*   Bruise-like rashes\n*   Yellow skin or eyes (jaundice)\n*   Swollen liver and spleen\n*   Small head (microcephaly)\n*   Seizures\n*   Hearing loss\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Liver inflammation (hepatitis)\n\n【16】**Symptoms of CMV with HIV**\n\n【17】If you also have advanced HIV, CMV can affect different parts of your body. You could have:\n\n【18】*   Blind spots or moving black spots (floaters) in your eyesight\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Blindness\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Belly pain\n*   Trouble swallowing or painful swallowing because of ulcers in your mouth or esophagus\n*   Confusion\n*   Lower back pain\n*   Weight loss\n*   Fatigue\n*   Weakness in your legs\n\n【19】If you have HIV, you probably won’t get sick with CMV unless your CD4 count, a type of white blood cell, is below 100.\n\n【20】Cytomegalovirus Causes and Transmission\n---------------------------------------\n\n【21】You probably won't catch CMV from casual contact. But you can get it by touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after having contact with an infected person's:\n\n【22】*   Saliva\n*   Semen\n*   Vaginal fluids\n*   Blood\n*   Urine\n*   Breast milk\n\n【23】You can also get cytomegalovirus through:\n\n【24】*   Sexual contact\n*   Blood transfusions\n*   Organ transplants\n\n【25】CMV spreads easily in places with lots of young children, like day-care centers, so anyone who spends time there is at higher risk of getting it. You’re also more likely to get the virus if your immune system is weakened because of a medication or another health condition.\n\n【26】Cytomegalovirus Tests and Diagnosis\n-----------------------------------\n\n【27】Your doctor will order tests such as:\n\n【28】*   **Blood and urine tests.** These include CMV antigen (a part of the virus), a virus culture, or PCR (a molecular test). Serologic tests look for things your immune system makes to fight CMV, called IgM and IgG antibodies, although most healthy people also have them.\n*   **A biopsy.** Your doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your intestines, your esophagus, or your lung and look at it under a microscope.\n*   **Eye tests** to check for inflammation in your retina.\n*   **Imaging tests**, like a CT scan, to look for changes in your lungs or brain.\n\n【29】Cytomegalovirus Treatment\n-------------------------\n\n【30】When you have retinitis because of CMV, your doctor may give you strong medications intravenously (through a vein) for a couple of weeks, a process called induction therapy. After a while, they may switch you to pills.\n\n【31】You might have medication injected into your eye if your vision is in danger.\n\n【32】Your doctor might prescribe drugs including:\n\n【33】*   Cidofovir (Vistide)\n*   Foscarnet (Foscavir)\n*   Ganciclovir (Cytovene)\n*   Maribavir (Livtencity)\n*   Valganciclovir (Valcyte)\n\n【34】These drugs generally can't cure the disease if you have advanced HIV, but they can control it while you get antiretroviral therapy (ART) for your HIV infection.\n\n【35】Depending on the medicine, you could have side effects including:\n\n【36】*   Low white blood cell count (neutropenia), which raises your chance for other infections\n*   Feeling tired from low red blood cell count (anemia)\n*   Upset stomach or throwing up\n*   Rash\n*   Kidney problems\n\n【37】Most important, if you take ART early in an HIV infection, the drugs will keep it from getting worse and will keep you from getting CMV in the first place.\n\n【38】Cytomegalovirus Complications\n-----------------------------\n\n【39】It’s rare, but CMV can cause complications including:\n\n【40】*   Mononucleosis\n*   Guillain\\-Barre syndrome\n*   Brain inflammation (encephalitis)\n*   Heart inflammation (myocarditis)\n\n【41】In people with HIV, complications include:\n\n【42】*   Retinitis\n*   Pneumonia\n*   Skin rashes and lesions\n*   Problems in the nerves, esophagus, lungs, colon, or mucous membranes\n*   Brain swelling\n\n【43】Complications in babies born with CMV include:\n\n【44】*   Learning problems\n*   Cerebral palsy or trouble with muscle tone and coordination\n*   Seizures\n\n【45】Cytomegalovirus Outlook\n-----------------------\n\n【46】There’s no cure for CMV. The virus stays inactive in your body and can cause more problems later. This reactivation is most common in people who’ve had stem cell and organ transplants.\n\n【47】Your outlook depends on your overall health. In people who have strong immune systems, CMV symptoms almost always go away on their own.\n\n【48】Congenital CMV can have lifelong effects. The risks are highest when the mother has their first CMV infection during a pregnancy.\n\n【49】If you have a weakened immune system, you might need treatment for the rest of your life to prevent complications.\n\n【50】Cytomegalovirus Prevention\n--------------------------\n\n【51】CMV was once the most common viral opportunistic infection -- illnesses that are worse or happen more often in people with weakened immune systems -- tied to HIV. Now, ART can help keep your CD4 count up and your immune system strong. It can also help stop retinitis from coming back.\n\n【52】If you have advanced HIV, your doctor might also give you medicine to prevent CMV, in addition to your ART. But it's expensive, sometimes causes severe side effects, and may not work well. The most important thing is to take your ART medications daily as prescribed.\n\n【53】Talk to your doctor about your chance of getting CMV if you're having a blood transfusion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:13:50", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:13:59", "cost": 8.751}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:13:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:13:49"}

It happens when the body matures sooner -- perhaps years earlier -- than expected.\n\n【1】Puberty usually starts around age 8 in girls and around age 9 in boys. For some children, such as those who are African-American or Hispanic, normal puberty may happen as early as age 6 in girls and age 8 in boys. But with CPP, signs of puberty, such as budding breasts and body hair, show up much sooner. It's more common for girls.\n\n【2】When it happens in boys, there’s often another, potentially serious medical condition causing it. This is usually not the case for girls.\n\n【3】Puberty is a big change, even when it happens on schedule. Early puberty can also cause problems with bone growth. Talk with your child's doctor about what's happening. If it's too soon, you can slow or even reverse the changes in their body.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】The brain releases a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Your doctor may call it GnRH. It tells the pituitary gland to release hormones called gonadotropins. They tell the sex organs to make other hormones that start sexual development.\n\n【6】In central precocious puberty, the brain releases GnRH at a younger-than-normal age and starts the process. Most of the time, doctors can't pinpoint an exact cause for girls, but researchers have linked childhood obesity to early periods.\n\n【7】Boys are more likely to have a specific trigger.\n\n【8】Other causes include:\n\n【9】*   A family history of CPP\n*   A rare gene problem\n*   A noncancerous tumor in the brain or pituitary gland\n*   A brain injury\n*   An infection in the brain, like meningitis\n*   Radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】The signs of CPP are the changes you'd expect to see in a maturing preteen or teen.\n\n【12】*   Hair in underarms and on genitals, and, for boys, on the face\n*   Acne\n*   Adult body odor\n*   Sexual development like breast buds or testicle growth\n*   Emotional changes\n*   Mood swings\n\n【13】Sometimes, kids can have hair appear on their genitals and under the arm, but it doesn’t mean they are in true puberty.\n\n【14】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【15】Your child's doctor will likely ask you questions before doing an exam or tests.\n\n【16】*   What physical changes have you seen in your child?\n*   Has their behavior changed recently?\n*   When did you first notice this? How long has this change been there?\n*   Is there a history of early puberty in your family?\n\n【17】If the symptoms aren't severe, it can be hard to tell if it's CPP. Your doctor may want your child to see a specialist who focuses on children's hormones and growth, called a pediatric endocrinologist. They’ll look for signs of puberty, but they may also check:\n\n【18】*   Hormone levels\n*   Bone age\n\n【19】**Blood tests** check levels of hormones.\n\n【20】**X-rays** help find out if your child's bones are maturing too early.\n\n【21】**MRI or CT scans** can rule out a tumor.\n\n【22】Questions for Your Doctor\n-------------------------\n\n【23】*   What caused my child's symptoms?\n*   Is there a way to slow down their development?\n*   Do we need to treat this?\n*   Could treating it cause other problems?\n*   What happens after treatment stops?\n*   What happens if we don't do anything?\n*   What's the best way to explain CPP to my child?\n*   Will my child be OK?\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】If your doctor can find a cause, they’ll treat that.\n\n【26】In some cases, doctors can use a drug to block sex hormones and prevent further development. A man-made version of GnRH stops the pituitary gland from sending out gonadotropins.\n\n【27】The doctor can give your child a shot once a month or every 3 months, or they can put a small implant under the skin of your child's upper arm that works for a year. The part of the body where they get the shot or implant may hurt a bit, or their skin might get irritated around that spot, but there don’t seem to be any long-term side effects.\n\n【28】You'll probably want to keep up the treatment until your child gets old enough to let puberty continue. Talk with your doctor about when that would be.\n\n【29】Most doctors treat a child younger than 7 years old. When you're thinking about whether to treat CPP in an older child, you'll want to think about:\n\n【30】*   Your child's age\n*   How slow or fast they're developing\n*   How your child has been reacting\n*   The chance of early menstruation\n*   Concerns about their height as an adult\n\n【31】Talk these things over with your child's doctor before you make any decisions.\n\n【32】Taking Care of Your Child\n-------------------------\n\n【33】Most kids want to fit in with their peers. Developing early could make your child feel self-conscious. Other people may expect more maturity because they think your kid is older than they are.\n\n【34】These challenges plus the emotional changes from extra hormones can be a lot for them to deal with. Check in with the teachers and counselors at school, and keep an eye on your child's grades. Pay attention to their interest in things and being around friends and classmates.\n\n【35】How can you help? Explain what's happening in simple terms. Keep the lines of communication open.\n\n【36】*   Encourage your child to talk freely about their feelings.\n*   Treat your kid appropriately for their age.\n*   Watch out for teasing.\n*   Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on grades or activities rather than appearance.\n\n【37】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【38】An early growth spurt can make your child taller than their friends at first, but their bones may stop growing earlier, too. Without treatment, your child may end up shorter than they could have been.\n\n【39】With treatment, they're more likely to reach their full adult height. Within a year, their growth should slow to a normal rate. Their sexual development will stall and may even reverse. For example, a girl's breasts and a boy's penis and testicles could get smaller. Your child should start acting like other kids their age, too.\n\n【40】Studies show children who are treated with GnRH have normal bone density. The treatment shouldn't affect them having kids of their own later, either.\n\n【41】Getting Support\n---------------\n\n【42】You can connect with other families whose kids are dealing with CPP.

When your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight.\n\n【1】If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis. Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease.\n\n【2】Causes\n------\n\n【3】Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes.\n\n【4】Could You Get It?\n-----------------\n\n【5】You may be more likely to get autoimmune thyroiditis if you:\n\n【6】*   Are a woman\n*   Are middle-aged\n*   Have another autoimmune disorder like lupus, type 1 diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Are related to someone who has autoimmune thyroiditis\n*   Have been exposed to environmental radiation\n\n【7】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【8】You may not have any in the beginning.\n\n【9】As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. The thyroid may or may not be tender to the touch. \n\n【10】A damaged thyroid can’t do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones. Symptoms can include:\n\n【11】*   Tiredness\n*   Sensitivity to cold\n*   Puffy face\n*   Trouble pooping\n*   Enlarged tongue\n*   Pale, dry skin and brittle nails\n*   Hair loss\n*   Weight gain\n*   Muscle aches and joint pain\n*   Depression\n*   Memory lapse\n*   Heavy menstrual bleeding\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【13】Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies.\n\n【14】You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems.\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes.\n\n【17】Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You’ll need to take medicine for the rest of your life.\n\n【18】Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine. You should also let your doctor know if you take:\n\n【19】*   Iron supplements\n*   A cholesterol medicine called cholestyramine (Locholest, Prevalite, Questran)\n*   Antacids that have aluminum hydroxide\n*   An ulcer medicine called sucralfate (Carafate)\n*   Calcium supplements", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:04:42", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:25:16", "cost": 1233.894}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:01", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:25:16", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:04:42"}

A variant usually doesn't affect how the virus works. But sometimes they make it act in different ways.\n\n【2】Scientists around the world are tracking changes in the virus that causes COVID-19. Their research is helping experts understand whether certain COVID-19 variants spread faster than others, how they might affect your health, and how effective different vaccines might be against them.\n\n【3】How Many Coronaviruses Are There?\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】Coronaviruses didn't just pop up recently. They're a large family of viruses that have been around for a long time. Many of them can cause a variety of illnesses, from a mild cough to severe respiratory illnesses.\n\n【5】The new (or “novel”) coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of several known to infect humans. It's probably been around for some time in animals. Sometimes, a virus in animals crosses over into people. That's what scientists think happened here. So this virus isn't new to the world, but it is new to humans. When scientists found out that it was making people sick in 2019, they named it as a novel coronavirus. Experts call these strains SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【6】How Do Variants Happen?\n-----------------------\n\n【7】Coronaviruses have all their genetic material in something called RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA has some similarities to DNA, but they aren't the same.\n\n【8】When viruses infect you, they attach to your cells, get inside them, and make copies of their RNA, which helps them spread. If there's a copying mistake, the RNA gets changed. Scientists call those changes mutations.\n\n【9】These changes happen randomly and by accident. It's a normal part of what happens to viruses as they multiply and spread.\n\n【10】Because the changes are random, they may make little to no difference in a person's health. Other times, they may cause disease. For example, one reason you need a flu shot every year is because influenza viruses change from year to year. This year's flu virus probably isn't the exact same one that circulated last year.\n\n【11】If a virus has a random change that makes it easier to infect people and it spreads, that variant will become more common.\n\n【12】The bottom line is that all viruses, including coronaviruses, can change over time, and there have been several variants already that have contributed to the pandemic. As of May 2022, the CDC only lists one as a Variant of Concern (VOC) and that is the Omicron variant.\n\n【13】What Is the Omicron Variant?\n----------------------------\n\n【14】The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first detected in specimens collected on Nov. 11, 2021, in Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021. They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly began to go up.\n\n【15】The WHO grouped Omicron as a VOC. This category means the variant might have higher transmissibility, cause more intense disease, and may be less likely to respond to vaccines or treatments. \n\n【16】The Omicron variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S.\n\n【17】Experts are keeping a close eye on how the variant spreads or develops. So, far, the Omicron variant has been found to carry a higher risk of reinfection compared to other variants and while it can still be deadly, most infections are not as serious.\n\n【18】Breakthrough infections are possible with the Omicron variant even if you’re fully vaccinated. However, COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are still effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.\n\n【19】Current PCR tests for COVID-19 can effectively find Omicron cases. Experts found that one specific PCR test doesn't identify one of the three target genes (called the S gene dropout) in people infected with Omicron. Because of this, these tests can specifically mark positive Omicron cases and, because of that, can detect this variant faster than with previous surges.\n\n【20】In the meantime, experts recommend protecting yourself by getting the vaccine or a booster if you’re eligible for it. Wear a mask and maintain social distance if the COVID-19 community level is high or if you prefer to be masked.  Also wear a mask if you or a family member are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease even if the community level is at medium.\n\n【21】If you test positive for COVID or if you’ve come in close contact with someone who has it, follow the CDC guidelines for quarantine and isolation. Call your doctor if you notice symptoms.\n\n【22】**Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2)**: Scientists call it Omicron BA.2 as opposed to the original Omicron variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away. That didn’t happen, and starting in January 2022, BA.2 appeared to be at least as easy to transmit as BA.1.\n\n【23】As of the end of February 2022, BA.2 showed signs of spreading more easily than other variants, though it didn’t seem to cause more serious symptoms. The World Health Organization has said that BA.2 is a “variant of concern.”\n\n【24】The best protection is still the coronavirus vaccine. Current vaccines and boosters seem to work well against BA.2, protecting against initial infection as well as against serious illness if you do get infected.\n\n【25】**Omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1**: As of early May 2022, it made up almost 43% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. Some early research suggests it’s spreading faster than other Omicron subvariants. The CDC is looking into how it spreads and how well available treatments and the COVID vaccine work against it.\n\n【26】**Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5.** These were first spotted in South Africa. There, they’ve “rapidly replaced” BA.2, according to early research. As of May 2022, the CDC listed BA.4 and BA.5 as variants of concern.\n\n【27】Earlier Coronavirus Variants\n----------------------------\n\n【28】**Alpha (B.1.1.7).** In late 2020, experts noted gene mutations in COVID-19 cases seen in people in southeastern England. This variant has since been reported in other countries, including the U.S. Scientists estimate that these mutations could make the virus up to 70% more transmissible, meaning it could spread more easily. Some research has linked this variant to a higher risk of death, but the evidence isn't strong.\n\n【29】The mutation on the Alpha variant is on the spike protein, which helps the virus infect its host. This is what COVID-19 vaccines target. These vaccines make antibodies against many parts of the spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single new mutation in the Alpha variant will make the vaccine less effective.\n\n【30】**Beta (B.1.351).** This variant was first found in other countries, including South Africa and Nigeria. The Beta variant appears to spread more easily than the original virus but doesn't seem to cause worse illness.\n\n【31】**Gamma (P.1).** In January 2021, experts spotted this COVID-19 variant in people from Brazil who'd traveled to Japan. By the end of that month, it was showing up in the U.S.\n\n【32】The Gamma variant appears to be more contagious than earlier strains of the virus. And it may be able to infect people who've already had COVID-19. A report from Brazil confirms that a 29-year-old woman came down with this variant after an earlier coronavirus infection a few months before.   \n\n【33】Some early research suggests that the variant's changes might help it evade antibodies (made by your immune system after an infection or a vaccine) that fight the coronavirus. A lab study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can neutralize the fast-spreading Brazil strain. But more research is needed.\n\n【34】**Delta (B.1.617.2).** This variant was spotted in India in December 2020. It caused a huge surge in cases in mid-April 2021, quickly spreading across the globe. \n\n【35】By March 2022 its presence had diminished considerably due to the prevalence of Omicron And the WHO had downgraded it from a VOC to a VBM in April. It is no longer considered a threat to public health in the U.S.\n\n【36】Research suggests that changes to the spike protein made the Delta variant up to 50% more transmissible than previous COVID-19 variants.\n\n【37】**Mu (B.1.621).** Experts first spotted this COVID-19 variant (pronounced m'yoo) in Colombia in January 2021. Since then, countries in South America and Europe have reported outbreaks of Mu.\n\n【38】In the U.S. the CDC says Mu reached a peak in June 2021, when it made up less than 5% of variants going around the country. As of early September, it had been steadily declining.  \n\n【39】**R.1.** Scientists first detected R.1 in a number of countries, including Japan. There was an outbreak at a Kentucky nursing home in March 2021, when an unvaccinated health care worker passed it to about 45 other staff and residents.\n\n【40】The WHO labeled it a “variant under monitoring” in April 2021, meaning some of its characteristics may pose a future risk to humans.\n\n【41】As of October 2021, the CDC hadn't labeled R.1 as a variant of concern or interest.\n\n【42】**Epsilon**, **Theta**, and **Zeta** were at one point listed as variants of interest and were downgraded by the WHO. They are still being monitored.\n\n【43】The First Variants\n------------------\n\n【44】Earlier in 2020, when the pandemic was new, you might have heard that there was more than one strain of the new coronavirus. Is it true? The answer appeared to be yes.\n\n【45】The theory about different variants of the new coronavirus came from a study in China. Researchers were studying changes in coronavirus RNA over time to figure out how various coronaviruses are related to each other. They looked at 103 samples of the new coronavirus collected from people, and they looked at coronaviruses from animals. It turned out that the coronaviruses found in humans weren't all the same.\n\n【46】There were two types, which the researchers called “L” and “S.” They're very similar, with slight differences in two places. It looks like the S type came first. But the scientists say the L type was more common early in the outbreak.\n\n【47】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【48】The virus that causes COVID-19 will probably keep changing. Experts may find new variants. It's impossible to predict how those virus changes might affect what happens.

But “What if I get coronavirus?” probably wasn't one of them.\n\n【1】Doctors and scientists are still learning how the virus affects everyone, including expectant mothers and their unborn babies. Here's what they know -- and don't know.\n\n【2】COVID-19 and Pregnancy\n----------------------\n\n【3】**Does pregnancy make me more likely to have a severe case if I get COVID-19?**\n\n【4】Yes. While in general, your overall risk of getting seriously ill is low, your chances of getting severely ill from COVID-19 are higher while you're pregnant. You are also at risk for about 42 days afterward giving birth. Pregnant people who have COVID-19 with symptoms are more likely than non-pregnant people who have COVID-19 to need treatment in an intensive care unit, need a ventilator to help with breathing, or to die from the disease.  \n\n【5】In addition, pregnant people with COVID-19 are also at increased risk for delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks and might be at increased risk for other poor pregnancy outcomes. \n\n【6】A few of the things that can raise your risk of getting severely ill are:\n\n【7】*   Certain health conditions, like obesity or gestational diabetes\n*   Being older\n*   Social, economic, and health inequalities\n\n【8】**What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19 or if I come into contact with someone who has the virus?**\n\n【9】If you're exposed to the virus, call your doctor and let them know what happened. They'll probably tell you to watch for signs of illness such as a fever or a cough. If you get these symptoms, call your doctor to talk about where to go for testing.\n\n【10】Protecting Your Baby\n--------------------\n\n【11】**How do I keep myself and my baby as safe as possible?**\n\n【12】You can keep safe by getting vaccinated. Experts say the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of the vaccine during pregnancy. The COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant, or may become pregnant in the future.\n\n【13】Currently, there isn’t any evidence that suggests the COVID-19 vaccine causes fertility issues in women or men.\n\n【14】It's possible to have mild side effects after you get vaccinated, especially after the second shot of a two-dose vaccine, like Pfizer and Moderna. But there haven't been reports of pregnant people getting different side effects after receiving those vaccines from those who aren't pregnant.\n\n【15】If you run a fever after getting vaccinated, take acetaminophen and call your doctor right away. A prolonged high fever is linked to worse pregnancy outcomes. Also, call the doctor if you think you're having an allergic reaction. Those are rare, and you can get treatment for them. Before you get vaccinated, let your doctor know if you've had allergic reactions to other vaccines or shots in the past.\n\n【16】If you're pregnant and you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccines, talk to your doctor. \n\n【17】If you think you have symptoms, call your doctor. They may prescribe an antiviral medication, monoclonal antibodies, or they might recommend that you take acetaminophen to keep your fever down. It's important to rest and drink lots of fluids. You probably won't need to go to the hospital. Call your doctor right away if your symptoms get worse, especially if you have trouble breathing.\n\n【18】**If I get the coronavirus before I deliver, can it hurt my baby?**\n\n【19】There's no evidence that the virus itself can lead to birth defects, miscarriage, or any other problems. But a fever in early pregnancy, from COVID-19 or any other cause, can raise the chances of birth defects. And severe lung illnesses late in your pregnancy can make you more likely to deliver your baby prematurely. Some babies born to women who had coronavirus were born preterm. But it's not clear whether the virus was to blame.\n\n【20】**If I have the coronavirus, can I pass it to my** **baby** **during pregnancy or delivery?**\n\n【21】Some newborns have tested positive for COVID-19. But that doesn't necessarily mean they picked it up from their mothers in the womb. The most common way to get COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets that a sick person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe it's more likely that infected babies picked it up through droplets after birth from their mother or a caregiver.\n\n【22】**If I have coronavirus, can I** **breastfeed** **my baby?**\n\n【23】Evidence suggests that the coronavirus is not spread through breast milk. That doesn't mean you can't pass on the virus through coughing or sneezing while nursing. The safest option may be to pump and have someone who isn't infected feed your baby. If you really want to nurse your baby yourself, wash your hands before breastfeeding, and consider wearing a face mask. Take these same precautions while bottle-feeding your baby.\n\n【24】Coronavirus Prevention While Pregnant\n-------------------------------------\n\n【25】**Should I take any extra steps to protect myself besides the ones the CDC and state and local government recommend for everyone?**\n\n【26】There's no evidence that pregnancy makes you any more likely to get coronavirus. Still, it's a serious threat to everyone. You should take all the recommended steps to avoiding getting sick. Those include washing your hands often, not touching your face, staying at least 6 feet away from other people, and avoiding groups. Wear a high end face mask when you're in public places like stores and doctor's offices.\n\n【27】**Should I travel?**\n\n【28】Crowded places like airports might raise your chances of getting infected with the coronavirus. Many doctors recommend against traveling during the pandemic. Talk with your doctor about the risks, and check guidelines from local and federal health officials.\n\n【29】**Should I reschedule my baby shower?**\n\n【30】The CDC urges everyone to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the virus when case levels are high in your community. This means limiting your contact with other people in homes and in public places like parks or restaurants. It's safest to postpone your shower or hold an online get-together instead.\n\n【31】**Should I have prenatal visits?**\n\n【32】Talk to your medical team before your appointments. They might want you to come in less often or to have checkups on the phone or online. They may recommend that you keep track of your baby's movements and get a cuff to measure your blood pressure.\n\n【33】What to Expect With Delivery\n----------------------------\n\n【34】**If I have the coronavirus, will my delivery still go as planned?**\n\n【35】There's no evidence that women with COVID-19 shouldn't deliver vaginally. But delivery might be different from what you expected.\n\n【36】One group of experts suggests that if the mother has COVID-19, it might be helpful to leave the vernix -- a white, waxy coating on newborns' skin -- on for 24 hours after birth. The coating contains antimicrobial substances that could protect against infection.\n\n【37】The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that babies born to women who have the coronavirus be isolated and monitored for symptoms.\n\n【38】Whether or not you have coronavirus, the ongoing pandemic means many hospitals are limiting the number of visitors to one or none. At home, before and after your baby arrives, you should stick to your social distancing plan and avoid visitors as much as possible.\n\n【39】**Will I get the care and attention I need during my delivery?**\n\n【40】You should expect to get usual care during your delivery. It's unlikely that hospitals would call obstetricians away from their regular duties in labor and delivery in order to provide care somewhere else. If you have questions, ask your obstetrics team.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:36:03", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:36:31", "cost": 27.542}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:36:31", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:36:03"}

Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk products. Lactase enzyme is normally produced by the body to help break down (digest) lactose. Lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces low amounts of lactase enzyme.Lactose intolerance can begin at different ages. Infants are not usually affected, but lactose intolerance can affect children as young as 2. It is very common in adults. One way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid milk products. However, this can result in a lack of important nutrients and vitamins such as calcium , vitamin D , riboflavin, and protein. Some people use lactose-free milk or milk substitutes such as soy or rice milk. Most people with low lactase enzyme levels can tolerate small amounts of milk products at one time (2-4 ounces) and get symptoms only with larger servings (6 ounces or more). Taking lactase enzyme with milk products as directed can help prevent upset stomach , abdominal bloating /cramping, gas, and diarrhea caused by these products.The FDA has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness.

It works by decreasing the body's natural defense response (immune response).\n\n【2】### How to use Uceris 9 Mg Tablet, Extended Release Glucocorticosteroids\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking budesonide and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once daily in the morning. Swallow this medication whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters) unless your doctor directs you otherwise. Do not crush or chew the tablets. Doing so can release all of the drug at once, increasing the risk of side effects.\n\n【5】The dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition and response to treatment.\n\n【6】Avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice while using this medication unless your doctor or pharmacist says you may do so safely. Grapefruit can increase the chance of side effects with this medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【7】If you are regularly taking a different corticosteroid by mouth (such as prednisone ), you should not stop taking it unless directed by your doctor. Some conditions (such as asthma , allergies ) may become worse when the drug is suddenly stopped. If you suddenly stop taking the drug, you may also have withdrawal symptoms (such as weakness , weight loss , nausea , muscle pain , headache , tiredness, dizziness ). To help prevent withdrawal, your doctor may slowly lower the dose of your old medication after you begin taking budesonide. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have withdrawal. See also Precautions section.\n\n【8】Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same time each day. Do not increase your dose or use this drug more often or for longer than prescribed. Your condition will not improve any faster, and your risk of side effects will increase.\n\n【9】Do not stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor. Some conditions may become worse when this drug is suddenly stopped. Your dose may need to be gradually decreased.\n\n【10】Tell your doctor if your condition does not get better or if it gets worse.\n\n【11】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【12】This medication usually has fewer side effects than other corticosteroids because budesonide works in the gut and only small amounts are absorbed into the body. Nausea , abdominal pain , or headache may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【13】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【14】Because this drug works by weakening the immune system , it may lower your ability to fight infections. This may make you more likely to get a serious (rarely fatal) infection or make any infection you have worse. Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection (such as sore throat that doesn't go away, fever, chills, cough ). This medication may sometimes cause oral thrush or a new yeast infection . Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth , a change in vaginal discharge , or other new symptoms.\n\n【15】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: easy bruising/bleeding, puffy face, unusual weight gain , menstrual period changes, mental/mood changes (such as depression , mood swings, agitation), muscle weakness /pain, bone pain, thinning skin , slow wound healing, increased thirst/urination, vision problems, symptoms of stomach /intestinal bleeding (such as stomach /abdominal pain, black/tarry stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds).\n\n【16】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness , trouble breathing .\n\n【17】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【18】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【19】Before taking budesonide , tell your doctor if you are allergic to it; or if you have any other allergies . This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\n【20】Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: eye problems (such as cataracts , glaucoma ), high blood pressure , liver problems , diabetes , stomach /intestinal problems (such as diverticulitis , ulcer), bone loss ( osteoporosis ), current/past infections (such as tuberculosis , herpes), bleeding problems, mental/mood problems (such as psychosis , anxiety, depression ).\n\n【21】Using corticosteroid medications for a long time can make it more difficult for your body to respond to physical stress. Before having surgery or emergency treatment, or if you get a serious illness/injury, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using this medication or have used this medication within the past 12 months. Tell your doctor right away if you develop unusual/extreme tiredness or weight loss .

Polymyalgia literally means \"many muscle pains.\" Rheumatica means \"changing\" or \"in flux.\"\n\n【1】What Are the Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain, other symptoms may include:\n\n【3】*   Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting\n*   Weakness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Generally feeling ill\n*   Mild fevers (occasionally)\n*   Weight loss\n\n【4】What Is Temporal Arteritis?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries. The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as \"giant cell arteritis.\"\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Temporal Arteritis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:\n\n【8】*   Severe headaches, the most common symptom\n*   Scalp tenderness\n*   Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing\n*   Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye\n*   Stroke (rare)\n*   Fatigue \n*   Fever\n*   Weight loss\n*   Night sweats\n*   Depression\n*   Feeling ill \n\n【9】Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect people over age 50. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups.\n\n【11】The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown.\n\n【12】How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below:\n\n【14】*   Shoulder pain on both sides\n*   Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes\n*   High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests\n*   Reported new hip pain\n*   Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【15】The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n【16】Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is typically tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms.\n\n【17】If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis.\n\n【18】Can Other Problems Mimic Polymyalgia Rheumatica?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include:\n\n【20】*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Infections\n*   Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis)\n*   Chemical and hormonal abnormalities\n*   A variety of muscle diseases\n*   Cancer\n\n【21】How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Treated?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called \"steroids\" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions.\n\n【23】Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis.\n\n【24】Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection.\n\n【25】The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.\n\n【26】You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids.\n\n【27】While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\n【28】Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough, fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor.\n\n【29】Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis (bone loss), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D, sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor.\n\n【30】Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids.\n\n【31】Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results. \n\n【32】What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids).\n\n【34】The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:08", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:15", "cost": 6.891}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:15", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:08"}

Even NASA has made note of it. So if you have this common ailment, you’re part of a long tradition.\n\n【1】There are ways to prevent or treat it to keep your travels or trip to the amusement park a pleasant one.\n\n【2】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【3】You get motion sickness when there are conflicts among your senses. Say you’re on a ride at the fair, and it’s spinning you around and upside down. Your eyes see one thing, your muscles feel another, and your inner ears sense something else.\n\n【4】Your brain can’t take in all those mixed signals. That’s why you end up feeling dizzy and sick.\n\n【5】The Role of the Ears\n--------------------\n\n【6】Your inner ears, in particular, help control your sense of balance. They are part of a network called the vestibular system.\n\n【7】This system includes three pairs of semicircular canals and two sacs, called the saccule and the utricle. They send information about what’s going on around you to the brain.\n\n【8】The semicircular canals hold a fluid that moves with the turns of your head. The saccule and utricle are sensitive to gravity. They tell the brain whether you’re standing up or lying down.\n\n【9】The Role of the Brain\n---------------------\n\n【10】Your brain takes in all this data, and it usually comes together and makes sense. But sometimes your brain gets confusing signals.\n\n【11】On a flying plane, for example, you feel like you’re moving, but your eyes tell your brain that you don’t appear to be going anywhere. The opposite is true as well. After a long sea voyage, you can stand still on dry land but still feel like you’re moving.\n\n【12】The result is the same: motion sickness.\n\n【13】Who Gets It?\n------------\n\n【14】Anybody can get motion sickness, but it’s most common in children and pregnant women. Unlike a cold, you can’t spread it to other people. It’s not contagious.\n\n【15】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【16】Motion sickness can strike quickly and make you break out in a cold sweat and feel like you need to throw up. Other common symptoms include:\n\n【17】*   Dizziness\n*   Increase in saliva production\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Pale skin\n\n【18】In addition, some people get headaches, feel very tired, or have shallow breathing.\n\n【19】Tips to Ease It\n---------------\n\n【20】For most people, symptoms usually don’t last long. They often go away once you get used to the situation, whether it’s the rocking of a boat or the movement of a train.\n\n【21】But there are some simple things you can do if the motion sickness isn’t going away on its own:\n\n【22】*   Relax.

But there are real differences.\n\n【4】General examples of overeating are:\n\n【5】*   Having more than one dessert after dinner\n*   Finishing a whole bag of popcorn while watching a movie\n\n【6】When you eat too much because of a stressful event such as a romantic breakup, it's sometimes called \"emotional eating.\"\n\n【7】Examples of binge eating are:\n\n【8】*   Sneaking a large bag of candy into your room and finishing it in secret\n*   Eating a whole cake in one sitting, and then feeling guilty\n*   Finishing three burgers, even when you’re already uncomfortably full\n\n【9】6 Reasons You Binge\n-------------------\n\n【10】Binge eating disorder can stem from many things. Some are:\n\n【11】**Genes.** Eating disorders tend to run in families. If your mother or grandmother binged, you're more likely to do it. Research shows that a number of genes that affect eating behavior may be passed down through families. Those genes can affect brain circuits that control appetite and mood.\n\n【12】A problem with your genes may increase the odds that you’ll have binge eating disorder -- but other things trigger it.\n\n【13】**Family**. Perhaps you watched your mom or dad overeat often. The habits you learned from the people around you may influence the way you eat in general. Still, eating disorder organizations say that parents and families aren't to blame.\n\n【14】**Depression**. If you’re depressed, you may be more likely to binge. About half of people with binge eating disorder have had depression. Scientists aren’t sure whether depression causes binge eating, or vice versa.\n\n【15】There are still some questions: Are people with depression more likely to binge? Or, do the guilt and shame make people depressed?\n\n【16】**Low Self-Esteem**. Often, people who binge aren't happy with the way they look. You might think badly about your body because of what others say or have said. You might compare yourself with TV and magazine photos that emphasize thinness. That might give you what's known as a negative body image. Such low self-esteem can lead to binge eating. After bingeing, a person feels guilt or shame because they ate too much. These feelings can cause more overeating.\n\n【17】**Stress and** **Anxiety**. Sometimes people binge after they've gone through a major stressful event, like a divorce or losing a job. Emotional eating can be temporary and may not be a binge eating disorder, though. That said, people with the disorder are usually more likely to overeat if they're anxious or stressed.\n\n【18】**Extreme** **Dieting**. Sometimes an attempt to lose weight can lead to bingeing. This is especially true when people follow unhealthy diets to lose weight, such as skipping meals or eating too little. If they don't reach their goal weight, they may feel so guilty and terrible about themselves that they eat even more.\n\n【19】Tips to Help Control Binges\n---------------------------\n\n【20】If you think you have binge eating disorder, work with a doctor to get well. Treatment might include counseling and, sometimes, medicine.\n\n【21】Try these tips to avoid food binges:\n\n【22】*   Keep a food diary. It will help you learn when you tend to binge. You can also see what was going on in your life that may have led you to do it.\n*   Eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day. They'll keep your blood sugar steady, so you won't feel hungry enough to binge.\n*   Portion out your food. Don't just grab a big bag of chips and head to the couch to watch TV. Measure out one serving into a small bag or onto a plate. You'll be less likely to eat too much if you have to get up for more.\n*   Think about why you're bingeing. Are you depressed or anxious?

You’ll have good days and bad days. But there are some things you can do to help your memory, plan your day, and get around.\n\n【1】How Do I Deal With Memory Problems?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【2】As it gets harder to remember things, you can use a few strategies to help your memory. You may have to try a few different ones before you find what works for you. To start:\n\n【3】*   Keep a notebook or smartphone with you to keep track of important information, phone numbers, names, ideas you have, appointments, your address, and directions to your home.\n*   Put sticky notes around the house with reminders for yourself.\n*   Label cupboards and drawers with words or pictures that describe their contents.\n*   Ask a friend or family member to call and remind you of important things you need to do during the day, like taking medication and going to appointments.\n*   Keep photos of people you see often, and label the photos with their names.\n\n【4】What's the Best Way to Plan the Day?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】*   Focus on things you enjoy and are able to do safely on your own.\n*   Take advantage of the times of the day when you feel best. It will be easier to get things done.\n*   Allow yourself the time to do what you need to do. Don't feel like you have to hurry or let other people rush you.\n*   If something gets too hard, take a break.\n*   Ask for help if you need it.\n\n【6】How Do I Avoid Getting Lost?\n----------------------------\n\n【7】You may not be able to find your way around as well as you used to, even in familiar places. Take steps to prepare, such as:\n\n【8】*   Ask someone to go with you when you go out. Take directions with you, even if you’re going somewhere you’ve been before.\n*   Ask for help if you need it. If you want to, you can explain that you have a memory problem.\n\n【9】What Will Make Communicating Easier?\n------------------------------------\n\n【10】Keep these tips in mind when you’re trying to talk with others:\n\n【11】*   Always take your time, and don't feel like you need to rush.\n*   If you need to, ask the person you're speaking with to repeat what they are saying or to speak slowly.\n*   Avoid distracting noises, and find a quiet place to talk.\n\n【12】It can also be helpful for your loved ones to adjust how they communicate with you. Here are some tips for talking with someone who has Alzheimer’s:\n\n【13】**Get their attention.** Make sure you have your loved one’s attention before you start talking. Approach them from the front, identify yourself, and call them by name.\n\n【14】**Be attentive.** Show that you’re listening and trying to understand what they are saying. Keep eye contact as you talk. Use a gentle, relaxed tone of voice and friendly facial expressions.\n\n【15】**Hands away.** Try to keep your hands away from your face when you’re talking. Also, avoid mumbling or talking with food in your mouth.\n\n【16】**Mind your words.** Speak distinctly, but don't shout. Try not to talk too fast or too slow. Use pauses to give the person time to process what you're saying. Use short, simple, and familiar words.\n\n【17】**Keep it simple.** Give one-step directions. Ask one question at a time. Call people and things by name instead of “she,” “they,” or “it.”\n\n【18】**Be positive.** Instead of saying, \"Don't do that,\" say, \"Let's try this.\"\n\n【19】**Treat them with respect.** Don't talk down to them or speak to others as if they are not there or don’t understand you.\n\n【20】**Rephrase rather than repeat.** If the listener has a hard time understanding what you're saying, find a different way to say it. If they didn't understand the words the first time, they probably won’t get them a second time.\n\n【21】**Adapt to your listener.** Try to understand the words and gestures your loved one is using to communicate. Don't force them to try to understand your way of conversing.\n\n【22】**Reduce background noise.** Noise from the TV or radio makes it harder to hear, and it competes with you for the listener's attention. Cut down on any sounds that will distract them.\n\n【23】**Be patient.** Encourage them to keep expressing their thoughts, even if they have trouble getting them across. Be careful not to interrupt. Try not to criticize, correct, or argue with them.\n\n【24】Remember that nonverbal communication is important for a person with Alzheimer’s disease. Your presence, touch, gestures, and attention can remind them of your acceptance, reassurance, and love.\n\n【25】What About Driving?\n-------------------\n\n【26】Talk to your doctor at each visit about driving. At some point, it may no longer be safe for you to drive. Until that happens, try to drive only in areas that you know well so you won’t get lost. Ask the Department of Motor Vehicles about testing your driving skills.\n\n【27】Just because you no longer drive doesn’t mean you won’t be able to get where you need to go. You can ask friends and family members to give you rides to appointments and errands. Also, you can ask someone to set up services like Uber or GoGoGrandparent on your phone. If you need more ideas, contact the Alzheimer's Association.\n\n【28】How Do I Take Care of Myself at Home?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【29】To make sure you’re safe and have what you need at home, put some of these measures in place early so they become routine:\n\n【30】*   Look into getting help with things like shopping, housekeeping, meals (including home-delivered ones), and transportation. The Area Agency on Aging or a local Alzheimer’s organization can recommend some services.\n*   Ask a neighbor you trust to keep a set of your house keys.\n*   Ask a friend or family member to help you organize your closets and drawers to make it easier to find things.\n*   Keep a list of important and emergency numbers by the phone.\n*   Have family, friends, or a community service program call or visit daily to make sure everything is OK.\n*   Ask someone to check your smoke alarm regularly.\n\n【31】How Do I Manage My Money?\n-------------------------\n\n【32】Call your bank to arrange for direct deposit of checks, such as your retirement pension or Social Security benefits.\n\n【33】Choose someone you trust to handle your finances in case you’re no longer able to. Then visit a lawyer to designate any living will or power of attorney that you may need.\n\n【34】It’s important to realize that at some point, it will be too hard or dangerous for you to live by yourself. But in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, many people do manage on their own with support and help from friends, family, and community programs. Simple changes and safety practices can make a big difference.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:31:20", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:31:29", "cost": 8.957}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:31:30", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:31:20"}

It’s a rare metabolic condition that prevents them from processing galactose (one of the sugars in breast milk and formula) and turning it into energy. The disorder can cause many problems for newborns and can be life-threatening if left untreated.\n\n【2】It’s easy to test for galactosemia. It’s also simple to treat once it’s diagnosed. And children who have it can live normal lives.\n\n【3】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【4】Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it.\n\n【5】If your baby has this condition, it means the genes that produce the enzymes to break down galactose into glucose (a sugar) are missing key parts. Without these parts, the genes can’t tell the enzymes to do their job. This causes galactose to build up in the blood, creating problems, especially for newborns.\n\n【6】There are three main types of galactosemia:\n\n【7】*   Classic (type I)\n*   Galactokinase deficiency (type II)\n*   Galactose epimerase deficiency (type III)\n\n【8】Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common.\n\n【9】As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia. If you’re a carrier, it doesn’t mean you have to avoid galactose. But it means you can pass galactosemia along to your children.\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】If your newborn has classic galactosemia, they’ll appear normal at birth. Symptoms start to show up within a few days after they begin to drink breast milk or formula with lactose -- the milk sugar that contains galactose.\n\n【12】Your baby first loses their appetite and starts vomiting. Then they get jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and the whites of their eyes. Diarrhea is common, too. The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive.\n\n【13】Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections. They may have liver damage and kidney problems. Their brain may not mature well. That can cause developmental disabilities. Some children have issues with their motor skills and muscles. For girls, it can cause their ovaries to stop working. Most with this condition can’t have children.\n\n【14】Testing and Treatment\n---------------------\n\n【15】Every baby born at a U.S. hospital is given what’s called a newborn screening. A blood sample is taken from a heel stick (a tiny cut in the baby’s foot) and it is tested for several conditions. Galactosemia is one of them.\n\n【16】If your baby shows signs of the illness, your doctor will suggest a follow-up test to confirm. This test will include both a blood and urine sample.\n\n【17】If your child has galactosemia, your doctor will work with you to plan a diet. Lactose and galactose are taken out of their diet. Instead, they’re given soy-based formula and must avoid milk or milk byproducts.\n\n【18】Though a person with galactosemia will never be able to process this type of sugar, they can live normal lives if the disease is caught early enough.\n\n【19】Along with eliminating dairy, your doctor may recommend cutting out some fruits, vegetables, and candies that contain galactose. In addition, your child may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements such as calcium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin K.\n\n【20】Some babies have a form of the condition called Duarte galactosemia (DG), which is milder than the classic form (type I). Babies with DG may have some issues processing galactose but a recent showed that changing the diet change may not be necessary and most babies do fine continuing breastfeeding or continuing formula with galactose. \n\n【21】Babies with type II or type III also will have fewer issues than babies with classic galactosemia. However, they still can develop cataracts, kidney and liver issues, and have delayed growth. Girls with galactosemia may require hormone treatment when they reach puberty.\n\n【22】It’s important that parents of a child with galactosemia work with a health care team to find ways to help them live with the condition and its effects on their daily life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:16:01", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:17:44", "cost": 102.818}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:17:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:16:00"}

Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (such as zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (such as from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin , mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin , lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin ). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer.\n\n【2】### How to use Mapo Oil\n\n【3】Use this product as directed. Some products require priming before use. Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist .\n\n【4】Some products need to be shaken before use. Check the label to see if you should shake the bottle well before using. Apply to the affected areas of the skin as needed or as directed on the label or by your doctor. How often you apply the medication will depend on the product and your skin condition. To treat dry hands, you may need to use the product every time you wash your hands , applying it throughout the day.\n\n【5】If you are using this product to help treat diaper rash , clean the diaper area well before use and allow the area to dry before applying the product.\n\n【6】If you are using this product to help treat radiation skin burns, check with radiation personnel to see if your brand can be applied before radiation therapy .\n\n【7】Follow all the directions on the label for proper use. Apply to the skin only. Avoid sensitive areas such as your eyes , inside your mouth /nose, and the vaginal/ groin area , unless the label or your doctor directs you otherwise. Check the label for directions about any areas or types of skin where you should not apply the product (such as on the face, any areas of broken/chapped/cut/irritated/scraped skin, or on a recently shaved area of the skin). Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【8】Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. Most moisturizers need water to work well. Apply the product after bathing/showering while the skin is still damp. For very dry skin , your doctor may instruct you to soak the area before using the product. Long, hot, or frequent bathing/washing can worsen dry skin .\n\n【9】If your condition lasts or gets worse, or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, get medical help right away.\n\n【10】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【11】Most emollients can be used safely and effectively with no side effects. However, burning, stinging, redness, or irritation may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【12】If your doctor has prescribed this medication , remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【13】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: unusual changes in the skin (such as turning white/soft/soggy from too much wetness), signs of skin infection .\n\n【14】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness , trouble breathing .\n\n【15】This is not a complete list of possible side effects.

It is a condition that can be hard to cope with. But you can adopt some strategies to make it easier.\n\n【1】You may go through bad phases, or relapses, followed by better ones (remission). Knowing to expect this pattern will help you understand how to manage your energy.\n\n【2】Daily Activities\n----------------\n\n【3】When you’re in a relapse, it might be hard to get through even simple morning routines, like a shower. Plan to allow extra time for tasks that are hard for you.\n\n【4】When you feel well again, you may want to try to do as much as you can while you’ve got the energy. Don’t try it. If you push yourself too hard, you may crash later. Repeating this cycle can drive you right back into a relapse.\n\n【5】You’ll need to learn to balance daily activities with rest, even when you’re in remission.\n\n【6】Exercise\n--------\n\n【7】While staying fit is an important part of your overall health, exercise can be a tricky issue for those with ME/CFS.\n\n【8】Individualized programs are needed because any exercise can and does lead to exhaustion. Work with your doctor or a physical therapist to establish your personal limits for physical and mental activity and then you can learn to pace yourself and balance your rest with your activity. Staying within this “energy envelope” can help you avoid post-exertional malaise (or PEM).\n\n【9】A physical therapist can modify your exercise plan. Do not overdo it. Pacing is important.\n\n【10】Nutrition\n---------\n\n【11】Watching what you eat can help you manage your symptoms. Avoid any foods or chemicals you are sensitive to.\n\n【12】A diet rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, avoiding saturated fats and refined carbohydrates—like the Mediterranean Diet—is reported by many people with ME/CFS to be helpful. Eat several small meals throughout the day. For example, three meals and three snacks might help keep energy levels up.\n\n【13】Smaller meals might also help control nausea, which sometimes happens with chronic fatigue syndrome. To help control energy levels, it may also be a good idea to avoid these things:\n\n【14】*   Sugar\n*   Sweeteners\n*   Alcohol\n*   Caffeine\n\n【15】Help Your Memory\n----------------\n\n【16】Some people with ME/CFS have memory loss. Use a day-planner (a paper one or a smart phone app) to keep up with your schedule and remember the things you need to do.\n\n【17】Set reminders on your smartphone when it’s time to go somewhere or do something. Keep lists. Use “sticky notes.”\n\n【18】Puzzles, word games, and card games – also available on your smartphone – can keep your mind active and might help your memory improve.\n\n【19】Work\n----\n\n【20】About half of those with ME/CFS work. If you have problems, you might qualify for coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This law requires some employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” to help people with disabilities do their jobs.\n\n【21】You might need a flexible schedule, a place to rest at work, and written job instructions for people with memory problems. The accommodations depend on your job, your symptoms, and how they affect your ability to do your job.\n\n【22】If you can’t work because of your condition, you might qualify for disability benefits from either a private insurance policy or from Social Security.\n\n【23】Relationships\n-------------\n\n【24】It can be hard for co-workers, friends, family, and loved ones to understand ME/CFS. They might not realize how much it affects your daily life. Or they might not believe that it’s real. Friends and co-workers of people with ME/CFS need to get educated about the condition.\n\n【25】Chronic fatigue can take a toll on your personal relationships, too. Loss of energy, pain, and potential side effects of medications can keep you from enjoying an active social life, playing with your kids, or having a healthy sex life.\n\n【26】Get Help\n--------\n\n【27】You may find you feel better when you talk to other people with your condition. Your doctor can give you information about support groups in your area.\n\n【28】About half of those with ME/CFS develop depression at some point. Some symptoms of depression are similar to your condition, so it can be hard to tell the difference. “Red flags” for depression could include feelings of hopelessness, sadness, guilt or worthlessness, or thoughts of suicide and death.\n\n【29】If you think you are depressed, tell your doctor. Medications and talk therapy for depression can help with physical and emotional symptoms. If you have thoughts of suicide, call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or go to the emergency room.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:59:37", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:59:46", "cost": 8.942}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:59:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:59:36"}

Why?\n\n【3】*   **Breast cancer** **risk is up:** The lifetime risk of a woman getting breast cancer in the U.S. was around 5%, or 1 in 20, in 1940. Now it’s 12%, or more than 1 in 8.\n*   **Finding breast cancer earlier boosts your survival odds:** Women who have breast cancer screening mammograms are much less likely to die from the disease. This depends on:\n    *   The quality of the test\n    *   Getting screened as often as you need to\n    *   Following your treatment plan if you get diagnosed\n\n【4】Self-Exams, Doctor’s Clinical Breast Exams\n------------------------------------------\n\n【5】It's a good idea to know how your breasts normally look and feel so you can notice any changes.\n\n【6】Medical organizations have different recommendations for breast self-exams, though. The American Cancer Society, for example, states that research has not shown a clear benefit of doing regular breast self-exams. Talk with your doctor to get a better sense of what's right for you.\n\n【7】Learn more about how to do a breast self-exam.\n\n【8】A clinical breast exam is done by your doctor, to feel for lumps or other changes. It’s part of your regular checkup. Your doctor will feel both breasts, one at a time. They’ll also check the underarm and collarbone areas. If they notice suspicious lumps, they may say you should get other tests. Your doctor will also examine the breasts visually for any rashes or anything else that looks unusual. And they may lightly squeeze your nipples to see if any fluid comes out.\n\n【9】Mammograms\n----------\n\n【10】A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. It can show breast lumps up to 2 years before they can be felt. Different tests help determine if a lump may be cancer. Ones that aren’t cancerous tend to have different physical features than ones that are. Imaging tests such as mammograms and ultrasounds can often see the difference.\n\n【11】Screening mammograms are those that are looking at your breasts when you don’t have a specific lump or other concern.\n\n【12】Diagnostic mammograms focus on a specific area or areas that you or your doctor is concerned about, such as where you have a suspicious lump, breast pain, discharge from a nipple, changes in size or shape of the breasts, or certain skin changes on the breast.\n\n【13】When and if you need screening mammograms is a personal decision between you and your doctor. Most women don’t start having screening mammograms until they’re at least 40. If you’re at higher risk for breast cancer, your doctor may want you to start at a younger age.\n\n【14】Read about how digital mammograms can give a clearer picture.\n\n【15】Breast MRI\n----------\n\n【16】This test combines several images of your breast into one to create a detailed picture. It’s more often used after you’re diagnosed to see how far cancer has spread, but your doctor might combine it with a mammogram as a screening test if:\n\n【17】*   You’re at a high risk for breast cancer.\n*   You have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   Your breasts are dense (there are a lot of ducts, glands, and fibrous tissue, but little fat) and mammograms didn't find a previous breast cancer.\n*   You have dense breasts, a strong family history of breast cancer, and you’ve had precancerous breast changes like atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.\n*   You have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.\n*   You had radiation treatments to your chest area before you were 30.\n\n【18】Know more about MRI to diagnose breast cancer.\n\n【19】Breast Ultrasound\n-----------------\n\n【20】Your doctor is most likely to use this if you have dense breasts. It’s also an option if you’re at high risk for breast cancer and you can’t have an MRI or if you’re pregnant so you aren’t exposed to X-rays from a mammogram.\n\n【21】Get more details on what happens during a breast ultrasound.\n\n【22】Screening Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n【23】For women at average risk, the American Cancer Society recommends that women ages:\n\n【24】*   **45 to 54:** Get yearly mammograms\n*   **55 and older:** Can switch to getting a mammogram every other year or continue getting yearly mammograms\n*   **40 to 44:** It’s OK to start a yearly mammogram.\n\n【25】The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammograms every other year for women ages 50-74. The decision to get a mammogram every other year from age 40 to 49 is up to you and your doctor.\n\n【26】How Do Doctors Diagnose Breast Cancer?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【27】The only way to confirm cancer is for a doctor to do a needle aspiration or surgical breast biopsy to collect and test tissue for cancer cells.\n\n【28】Find out what to expect with a breast biopsy.\n\n【29】If It’s Cancer\n--------------\n\n【30】If you’re diagnosed with breast cancer, you and your doctor will need to know what type it is and how advanced it is. A check of your lymph nodes can tell if the disease has spread. Other tests give an idea of what treatments may work best for you, and still others predict how likely it is that your cancer will come back after treatment.\n\n【31】Your doctor can help you understand all of these tests, and together you’ll decide on the best treatment plan for you.\n\n【32】Get more information on what to do after a breast cancer diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:20:05", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:21:45", "cost": 100.494}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:37:00", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:21:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:20:04"}

Your doctor may suggest you start with medication and lifestyle changes. If your condition gets worse, you can turn to centers that specialize in treating heart failure for more options, like surgery.\n\n【1】Medicines\n---------\n\n【2】It's important to keep up with your medications and take them the way your doctor tells you to. Common types of drugs that treat heart failure are:\n\n【3】*   Aldosterone antagonist\n*   ACE inhibitors\n*   ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers)\n*   ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors)\n*   Beta-blockers\n*   Blood vessel dilators\n*   Calcium channel blockers (unless you have systolic heart failure)\n*   Digoxin\n*   Diuretics\n*   Heart pump medication\n*   Potassium or magnesium\n*   Selective sinus node inhibitors\n*   SGLT2 Inhibitors\n\n【4】Surgery and Medical Device Options\n----------------------------------\n\n【5】The goal of surgery is to make your heart work better.\n\n【6】**Bypass surgery**. Routes blood around a blocked artery. Learn more about heart bypass surgery.\n\n【7】**Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).** When your heartbeat is off-kilter, it can make heart failure worse. This treatment uses a pacemaker that sends timed electrical impulses to both of your heart's lower chambers (the left and right ventricles) so they pump better and more in sync. Your doctor may call it a biventricular pacemaker. They could also pair it with an ICD 删除6:<u>(see below)</u>. Read more on CRT, also called biventricular pacing, for heart failure.\n\n【8】**Heart transplant.** This is done when heart failure is so severe that it doesn't respond to any other treatments. Get more information on heart transplant for heart failure.\n\n【9】**Heart valve surgery.** If a faulty heart valve causes your heart failure, your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing it. A surgeon can repair or replace the valves. Find out more on heart valve disease.\n\n【10】**Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).** This device is similar to a pacemaker. It's put under your skin in your chest. Wires lead through your veins and into your heart to keep track of your heart rhythm. If your heart starts to beat at a dangerous rhythm, or if it stops, the ICD tries to pace your heart or shock it back into normal rhythm. An ICD can also act as a pacemaker and speed your heart up if it's going too slow. Learn more about ICDs for heart failure.\n\n【11】**Infarct exclusion surgery (modified Dor or Dor procedure).** When a heart attack happens in the left ventricle (the lower left chamber of your heart), a scar forms. The scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat, forming what's called an aneurysm. A heart surgeon can remove it.\n\n【12】**Ventricular assist device.** The doctor puts it into the abdomen or chest and attaches it to your heart to help it pump blood to the rest of your body. VADs are most often used in the heart's left ventricle, but they can also be used in the right ventricle or in both ventricles. Read more on the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for heart failure.\n\n【13】How Can I Keep My Heart Failure From Getting Worse?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Monitor your symptoms. Check for changes in how much fluid builds up in your body by weighing yourself every day. Check for swelling, too.\n\n【15】See your doctor regularly. They'll make sure you're staying healthy and that your heart failure isn't getting worse. They'll ask to review your weight record and list of medications.\n\n【16】If you have questions, write them down and bring them with you to your appointment. Call your doctor if you have urgent concerns.\n\n【17】Tell all the doctors you see about your heart failure, the medications you take, and any restrictions you have. Also, tell your heart doctor about any new drugs prescribed by another doctor.\n\n【18】How Can I Prevent Further Damage?\n---------------------------------\n\n【19】*   If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit.\n*   Keep to a healthy weight.\n*   Control your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes.\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Don't drink alcohol.\n\n【20】Your Heart Failure To-Do List\n-----------------------------\n\n【21】**Eat a healthy diet.** Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. Eat foods high in fiber and potassium. Cut back on things high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. If you need to drop some weight, reduce the number of calories you eat.\n\n【22】**Exercise regularly.** A regular program that's OK'd by your doctor will improve your symptoms and strength and make you feel better. It may also slow your heart failure.\n\n【23】**Don't overdo it.** Plan out your activities and include rest periods during the day.\n\n【24】**Prevent lung infections.** Ask your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines.\n\n【25】**Take your medications as prescribed.** Don't stop taking them without first asking your doctor. Even if you have no symptoms, the drugs help your heart pump better.\n\n【26】**Get emotional or psychological support, if you need it.** Don't face things alone. Get the backing you need from social workers, psychologists, clergy, and support groups. Ask your doctor to point you in the right direction.\n\n【27】Be the Star of Your Team\n------------------------\n\n【28】It takes a team to manage heart failure, and you are the key player. Your heart doctor will prescribe your medications and manage other medical problems. Other team members, including nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, exercise specialists, and social workers, will also lend a hand. But it's up to you to take your medicine, change your diet, live a healthy lifestyle, keep your follow-up appointments, and be an active member of the team.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:18:52", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:19:05", "cost": 12.952}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:19:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:18:52"}

It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. Dolutegravir is an integrase inhibitor while rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Both drugs block the virus from growing and infecting more cells.Dolutegravir/rilpivirine is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms /dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes , and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【2】### How to use Juluca\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start using dolutegravir/rilpivirine and each time you get a refill.

It causes the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. Each year, approximately 1,000 people in the U.S. get meningococcal disease, which includes meningitis and septicemia (blood infection).\n\n【1】Meningococcal meningitis can be fatal or cause great harm without prompt treatment; as many as one out of five people who contract the infection have serious complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control, even with antibiotics, 10 to 15% of those infected will die and about 1 in 5 of those who survive are left with long-term disabilities that include deafness, brain damage, neurological problems, and even loss of a limb.\n\n【2】Here's what you need to know about the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis and ways to prevent and treat it.\n\n【3】What Causes Meningococcal Meningitis?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【4】Bacteria and viruses are the two main causes of meningitis. The bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, also called meningococcus, causes meningococcal meningitis. In children and teens, meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. In adults, it is the second most common cause.\n\n【5】Meningococcal bacteria may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. For unknown reasons, the bacteria may then spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system. When it gets there, it causes meningococcal meningitis. Bacteria can also enter the nervous system directly after severe head trauma, surgery, or infection.\n\n【6】Your risk for meningococcal meningitis increases if you are exposed to the bacterium that causes it. Your risk also increases if you've had a recent upper respiratory infection. Babies, children, teens, and the elderly are at greatest risk.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms of Meningococcal Meningitis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis may vary from case to case. The more common signs and symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   General poor feeling\n*   Sudden high fever\n*   Severe, persistent headache\n*   Neck stiffness\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Discomfort in bright lights\n*   Drowsiness or difficulty awakening\n*   Joint pain\n*   Confusion or other mental changes\n\n【10】**A reddish or purple skin rash (**known as petechiae) is a very important sign to watch for. If it does not turn white when you press a glass against it, the rash may be a sign of bacteremia, or a bacterial infection in the bloodstream. This is a medical emergency.\n\n【11】Meningococcemia is a serious type of blood poisoning caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. A significant rash can develop as the infection damages blood vessels throughout the body. This infection is in an 11-year-old boy and is characterized by the star-like rash that is cherry red with a bluish tint.\n\n【12】Other symptoms of meningitis or bacteremia may include:\n\n【13】*   Tense or bulging soft spot (in babies)\n*   High-pitched or moaning cry (in babies)\n*   Stiff, jerky movements or floppiness (in babies or toddlers)\n*   Irritability\n*   Fast breathing\n*   Lethargy or excessive sleepiness\n*   Blotchy skin, turning pale or blue\n*   Shivering, or cold hands and feet\n*   Seizure\n\n【14】What's the Treatment for Meningococcal Meningitis?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Meningococcal meningitis can cause death or serious complications, such as brain damage, paralysis, gangrene, or deafness. To prevent these problems, it's important to act quickly. Do _not_ wait. Seek immediate medical attention. Go to an emergency room or call 911 if:\n\n【16】*   You notice symptoms of meningococcal meningitis.\n*   Symptoms do not improve with treatment.\n*   You think you have been exposed to meningococcal meningitis.\n\n【17】Tests can confirm a diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. The doctor may start antibiotics, such as penicillin or ceftriaxone, by an IV, or intravenous line. You or your child may also need other medication to treat problems related to increased spinal fluid pressure. Doctors sometimes prescribe steroids.\n\n【18】If you or someone you love has come into close contact (via saliva or other oral secretions) with someone who has meningococcal meningitis -- such as at school, day care, work, or home -- it is very important to get antibiotics to prevent infection.\n\n【19】Are There Vaccines for Meningococcal Meningitis?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Meningococcal meningitis is a serious disease -- even with treatment. That's why prevention is a far better approach. The meningococcal vaccine can prevent meningitis infection. In the U.S. three types of meningococcal vaccines are used:\n\n【21】*   **Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4)** -- One of these vaccines, Menactra, is approved for people ages 9 months to 55. The other, Menveo, is used in those ages 2 through 55. \n*   **Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4)** -- This vaccine was approved in the 1970s and protects against most forms of meningococcal disease. This vaccine used is for people as young as 9 months and older than age 55.\n*   **Serogroup B Meningococcal B (MenB) -** There are two MenB vaccines. Trumenba (MenB-FHbp) and Bexsero (MenB-4C). Both are licensed for ages 10-24 but can be used in older patients.\n\n【22】Although they cannot prevent all types of meningococcal disease, both vaccines can prevent many types of the disease. Both are effective in nine out of 10 people. MCV4 tends to give longer protection and is better at preventing transmission of the disease.\n\n【23】Doctors recommend a dose of MCV4, which is given as a shot, for children at age 11, and then a booster shot at age 16. If the first dose is missed, the MCV4 can be administered between ages 13 and 15, followed by a booster dose between ages 16 and 18.\n\n【24】People ages 16-18 who are not high risk should also get a MenB vaccine. The vaccine is also designed for people ages 10-24 who are at high risk. It can be used in older adults.\n\n【25】Other people at risk should also consider getting a vaccine. That includes:\n\n【26】*   People who think they've been exposed to meningococcal meningitis\n*   College students living in dorms\n*   U.S. military recruits\n*   Travelers to areas of the world, such as Africa, where meningococcal disease is common\n*   People with a damaged spleen or with terminal complement component deficiency, which is an immune system disorder\n*   Lab personnel who are often exposed to the meningococcal bacteria\n\n【27】A second dose is recommended for everyone.\n\n【28】Wait to get vaccinated if you are very ill at the time you're scheduled for the shot. Avoid the vaccine if you:\n\n【29】*   Have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose\n*   Have a severe allergy to any vaccine component\n*   Have ever had Guillain\\-Barre Syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis\n\n【30】Mild pain or redness at the injection site is common and should not be a problem. But call your doctor right away if you have a strong reaction to the vaccine. This includes a high fever, weakness, or signs of an allergic reaction, such as trouble breathing, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:58:06", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:59:05", "cost": 59.045}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:59:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:58:06"}

It does not shrink the prostate , but it works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and the bladder . This helps to relieve symptoms of BPH such as difficulty in beginning the flow of urine, weak stream, and the need to urinate often or urgently (including during the middle of the night).Alfuzosin belongs to a class of drugs known as alpha blockers.Do not use this medication to treat high blood pressure .\n\n【2】### How to use Uroxatral\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking alfuzosin and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Take this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually once daily after a meal. This medication works best when taken with food. Taking alfuzosin on an empty stomach may make it not work as well.\n\n【5】Swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush or chew the tablets. Doing so can release all of the drug at once, increasing the risk of side effects.\n\n【6】Alfuzosin may cause a sudden drop in your blood pressure , which could lead to dizziness or fainting , usually within a few hours after you take it. This risk is higher when you first start taking this drug or if you restart treatment after you stop taking it. During these times, avoid situations where you may be injured if you faint.\n\n【7】To avoid injury from dizziness or fainting, your doctor may tell you to take your first dose of alfuzosin with food at bedtime so that your body can get used to its effects.\n\n【8】Take this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it after the same meal each day.\n\n【9】Tell your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens.\n\n【10】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【11】Dizziness or lightheadedness may occur.

Also known as the vestibulocochlear nerve, it connects the inner ear with the brain and has two different parts. One part is involved in transmitting sound; the other helps send balance information from the inner ear to the brain.\n\n【1】Acoustic neuromas -- sometimes called vestibular schwannomas or neurilemmoma -- usually grow slowly over a period of years. Although they do not actually invade the brain, they can push on it as they grow. Larger tumors can press on nearby cranial nerves that control the muscles of facial expression and sensation. If tumors become large enough to press on the brain stem or cerebellum, they can be deadly.\n\n【2】Acoustic Neuroma Symptoms\n-------------------------\n\n【3】The early symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often subtle. Many people attribute the symptoms to normal changes of aging, so it may be a while before the condition is diagnosed.\n\n【4】The first symptom is usually a gradual loss of hearing in one ear, often accompanied by ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or a feeling of fullness in the ear. Less commonly, acoustic neuromas may cause sudden hearing loss.\n\n【5】Other symptoms, which may occur over time, include:\n\n【6】*   Problems with balance\n*   Vertigo (feeling like the world is spinning)\n*   Facial numbness and tingling, which may be constant or come and go\n*   Facial weakness\n*   Taste changes\n*   Difficulty swallowing and hoarseness\n*   Headaches\n*   Clumsiness or unsteadiness\n*   Confusion\n\n【7】It's important to see your doctor if you experience these symptoms. Symptoms like clumsiness and mental confusion can signal a serious problem that requires urgent treatment.\n\n【8】Acoustic Neuroma Causes\n-----------------------\n\n【9】There are two types of acoustic neuroma: a sporadic form and a form associated with a syndrome called neurofibromatosis type II (NF2). NF2 is an inherited disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system. Acoustic neuromas are the most common of these tumors and often occur in both ears by age 30.\n\n【10】NF2 is a rare disorder. It accounts for only 5% of acoustic neuromas. This means the vast majority are the sporadic form. Doctors aren't certain what causes the sporadic form. One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation, especially to the head and neck.\n\n【11】Acoustic Neuroma Treatments\n---------------------------\n\n【12】There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma:\n\n【13】*   Observation\n*   Surgery\n*   Radiation therapy\n\n【14】**Observation** is also called watchful waiting. Because acoustic neuromas are not cancerous and grow slowly, immediate treatment may not be necessary. Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms.\n\n【15】**Surgery** for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor.\n\n【16】There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:\n\n【17】*   Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear. This procedure is used for tumors larger than 3 centimeters. The upside of this approach is that it allows the surgeon to see an important cranial nerve (the facial nerve) clearly before removing the tumor. The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss.\n*   Retrosigmoid/sub-occipital, which involves exposing the back of the tumor by opening the skull near the back of the head. This approach can be used for removing tumors of any size and offers the possibility of preserving hearing.\n*   Middle fossa, which involves removing a small piece of bone above the ear canal to access and remove small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal, the narrow passageway from the brain to the middle and inner ear. Using this approach may enable surgeons to preserve a patient's hearing.\n\n【18】**Radiation therapy** is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas. State-of-the-art delivery techniques make it possible to send high doses of radiation to the tumor while limiting expose and damage to surrounding tissue.\n\n【19】Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways:\n\n【20】*   Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in which many hundreds of small beams of radiation are aimed at the tumor in a single session.\n*   Multi-session fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FRS), which delivers smaller doses of radiation daily, generally over several weeks. Early studies suggest multi-session therapy may preserve hearing better than SRS.\n\n【21】Both of these are outpatient procedures, which means they don't require a hospital stay. They work by causing tumor cells to die. The tumor's growth may slow or stop or it may even shrink, but radiation doesn't completely remove the tumor.\n\n【22】Other types of radiation therapy have also been used. Your doctor will explain your options to you.\n\n【23】Selecting the right treatment depends on a number of factors, including:\n\n【24】*   Size of the tumor\n*   Whether the tumor is growing\n*   Your age\n*   Other medical conditions you may have\n*   Severity of your symptoms and their impact on your life", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:26", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:27:30", "cost": 4.109}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:30", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:27:25"}

Just remember that what helps your friend or neighbor may not work for you. You may need to try out different approaches to get the relief you need.\n\n【1】Carpal tunnel syndrome tends to come on slowly and get worse with time. But if you treat it early on, you can slow it down or stop it in its tracks. Early treatment can also make for a shorter recovery time.\n\n【2】Typically, you start with basic remedies, like wrist braces. For more severe cases, though, you might need surgery.\n\n【3】Self-Care\n---------\n\n【4】To help ease the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, you may want to put ice on your wrist or soak it in an ice bath. Try it for 10 to 15 minutes, once or twice an hour.\n\n【5】You can also gently shake your wrist or hang it over the side of your bed for pain that wakes you up at night.\n\n【6】Some experts suggest you put your hand in warm water, around 100 F, then gently flex and extend your hand and wrist. Try it 3-4 times a day.\n\n【7】Another way to get relief: Rest your hands and wrists as much as possible. Give them a break from things that trigger your symptoms.\n\n【8】To ease pain, take over-the-counter meds like aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\n\n【9】While these methods can help, keep in mind that they don't cure carpal tunnel syndrome. At best, they may give you short-term relief as you try other treatments.\n\n【10】Wrist Braces\n------------\n\n【11】Braces are generally best when you have mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. They don't work for everyone, but there are no side effects either, so it doesn't hurt to try one. Make sure to give it a good 3-4 weeks for your symptoms to improve.\n\n【12】Your doctor will likely suggest that you wear a brace when you go to bed. That's because most people bend their wrists when they sleep, which can make your symptoms worse. You can also try a brace during the day, especially when you do activities that trigger flare-ups.\n\n【13】Tweak Your Activities\n---------------------\n\n【14】Carpal tunnel syndrome often gets set off when you hold your hand and wrist in the same position for a long time. It can be made even worse if you have to keep your wrist bent either up or down, so it's best to keep it in a straight, neutral position. If your work makes that hard to do, you may want to:\n\n【15】*   Take a break for 10-15 minutes every hour and stretch your hands.\n*   Talk to your manager to see if you can change your desk, tools, or workstation setup.\n*   Try to alternate which hand you use for your tasks.\n*   Use only as much force as you need. Don't hold your tools too tightly or pound away at your keyboard.\n*   Watch your posture. Try not to roll your shoulders forward, which sets off a chain reaction that makes wrist problems even worse.\n\n【16】Steroids\n--------\n\n【17】Corticosteroids, such as cortisone, are strong drugs that can lessen swelling. You can sometimes take these medicines as pills. It's also possible your doctor gives it to you as a shot in your wrist that goes right into the carpal tunnel. It can give you temporary relief from pain and swelling, but it's not a long-term solution.\n\n【18】Physical and Occupational Therapy\n---------------------------------\n\n【19】An occupational or physical therapist can help in a couple of ways. They may give you exercises to stretch and strengthen your hand and wrist muscles. They can also show you how to change your routine motions in a way that eases stress on your hands and wrists. That can be especially helpful when it comes to tasks related to work or your favorite hobbies.\n\n【20】Alternative Medicine\n--------------------\n\n【21】Some people with carpal tunnel syndrome have success with alternative or complementary medicine. Always check with your doctor before trying it. Some options are:\n\n【22】**Yoga**. Research shows that it eases pain and boosts grip strength.\n\n【23】**Ultrasound therapy**. This treatment uses sound waves to raise the temperature in your hand and wrist. The heat can relieve pain and help with healing. Results from studies are mixed, but some people find it useful.\n\n【24】**Acupuncture**. Again, research hasn't clearly shown that acupuncture helps with carpal tunnel syndrome, but people in some studies found it helpful.\n\n【25】Surgery\n-------\n\n【26】If other treatments haven't improved your symptoms in 6 months, your doctor might suggest carpal tunnel release surgery. There are two main types. In open surgery, your surgeon makes an opening about 2 inches long that goes from your wrist to your palm. With endoscopic surgery, you get two smaller openings, and your doctor uses a small camera to guide the operation.\n\n【27】In both surgeries, your doctor cuts the ligament atop the carpal tunnel to take pressure off the median nerve and relieve your symptoms. After surgery, the ligament comes back together, but there's more room for the nerve to pass through.\n\n【28】Both surgeries have similar results. Most of the time, carpal tunnel syndrome gets cured and doesn't come back. If you have a severe case, surgery can help, but your symptoms may not go away completely.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:12:55", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:13:21", "cost": 25.095}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:13:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:12:55"}

Unlike many other forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus, osteoarthritis does not affect other organs of the body.\n\n【1】The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joints after repetitive use. Joint pain is usually worse later in the day. There can be swelling, warmth, and creaking of the affected joints. Pain and stiffness of the joints can also occur after long periods of inactivity, for example, sitting in a theater. In severe osteoarthritis, complete loss of cartilage causes friction between bones, causing pain at rest or pain with limited motion.\n\n【2】Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from patient to patient. Some patients can be debilitated by their symptoms. On the other hand, others may have remarkably few symptoms in spite of dramatic degeneration of the joints seen on X-rays. Symptoms also can be intermittent. It is not unusual for patients with osteoarthritis of the hands and knees to have years of pain-free intervals between symptoms.\n\n【3】Osteoarthritis of the knees is often associated with obesity or a history of repeated injury and/or joint surgery. Progressive cartilage degeneration of the knee joints can lead to deformity and outward curvature of the knees referred to as \"bow legged.\" Patients with osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joints (like the knees) can develop a limp. The limping can worsen as more cartilage degenerates. In some patients, the pain, limping, and joint dysfunction may not respond to medications or other conservative measures. Therefore, severe osteoarthritis of the knees is one of the most common reasons for total knee replacement surgical procedures in the U.S.\n\n【4】Osteoarthritis of the spine causes pain in the neck or low back. Bony spurs that form along the arthritic spine can irritate spinal nerves, causing severe pain, numbness, and tingling of the affected parts of the body.\n\n【5】Osteoarthritis causes the formation of hard bony enlargements of the small joints of the fingers. Classic bony enlargement of the small joint at the end of the fingers is called a Heberden's node, named after a British doctor. The bony deformity is a result of the bone spurs from the osteoarthritis in that joint. Another common bony knob (node) occurs at the middle joint of the fingers in many patients with osteoarthritis and is called a Bouchard's node, named after a French doctor who studied arthritis patients in the late 1800s. The Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes may not be painful, but they are often associated with limitation of motion of the joint. The characteristic appearances of these finger nodes can be helpful in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis of the joint at the base of the big toes leads to the formation of a bunion. Osteoarthritis of the fingers and the toes may have a genetic basis, and can be found in many female members of some families.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:40:29", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:40:36", "cost": 6.609}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:40:36", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:40:29"}

Most can't spot HIV right away because it takes time for your body to make antibodies or for enough of the virus to grow inside you.\n\n【3】Importance of HIV Testing\n-------------------------\n\n【4】If you have the virus, finding out quickly means you can start treatment right away so you can feel better and live a long, full life. You can also take steps so you don't pass HIV to other people.\n\n【5】Pregnant women should get tested because early treatment means you probably won’t pass it to your baby.\n\n【6】Who Should Get an HIV Test?\n---------------------------\n\n【7】The CDC recommends that everyone in the United States between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once.\n\n【8】You should be tested more often -- at least once a year -- if you’re at higher risk of getting HIV, including if you:\n\n【9】*   Have had several sexual partners since your last HIV test\n*   Had unprotected sex with someone who is or could be HIV-positive, including someone whose sexual history you don't know\n*   Injected drugs using a needle, syringe, or other device that someone else used first\n*   Have had or are getting tested for tuberculosis, hepatitis, or any sexually transmitted disease, including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, or herpes\n*   Are a sex worker\n*   Had sex with someone who has a history of any of these things\n\n【10】How Do HIV Tests Work?\n----------------------\n\n【11】There are two basic ways to get HIV test results:\n\n【12】**Laboratory tests.** For these tests, a technician takes a sample of your blood and tests it. You’ll get results within a few days.\n\n【13】**Rapid tests.** These tests provide results in about 20-30 minutes. You can get them done in a community clinic or take them at home.\n\n【14】When to Get Tested\n------------------\n\n【15】If you’ve had a high-risk exposure to HIV very recently, go to the emergency room or call your doctor right away. Examples include unsafe sex with someone who has HIV or if you were sexually assaulted. Emergency drugs called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may prevent HIV infection. You need to take them within 72 hours (3 days) after exposure. The sooner you start, the better.\n\n【16】If you don't get to a doctor in time to get PEP, ask your doctor about getting tested for HIV. For most types of HIV tests, you’ll need to wait 2 weeks or more after exposure to get an accurate result. You can infect others soon after you're exposed, so practice safe sex and take other precautions in the meantime.\n\n【17】Almost everyone who is HIV-positive has detectable levels of antibodies at 3 months. So if you test negative a month or two after your exposure, your doctor may want you to retest after 3 months to be sure.\n\n【18】What Is a Window Period?\n------------------------\n\n【19】Every HIV test has a different “window period.” That’s how long you need to wait after exposure until you can expect an accurate result. No HIV test can tell if you have the virus just after you’ve been exposed.\n\n【20】If you get tested too soon, you may get faulty results. But if you wait too long to learn if you’re HIV-positive, you can miss out on early treatment and also unknowingly spread the virus to others.\n\n【21】HIV Testing Types\n-----------------\n\n【22】**Standard HIV blood test**. This test uses blood that a technician takes from your vein and sends to a lab. It can find antibodies (proteins your immune system makes when you’ve been exposed to the virus) 23-90 days after infection.\n\n【23】**Rapid blood test**. This test looks for antibodies using a drop of blood from a prick of your fingertip. It’s about as accurate as the original antibody test, but its window period could be longer -- between 18 and 90 days. Your health care provider can do this test, or you can buy a kit that lets you mail your sample in for testing.\n\n【24】**Antibody/antigen test**. These tests look for both antibodies and an antigen, a substance the virus makes before your immune system can start making antibodies. An antibody/antigen test that uses blood taken from a vein can find HIV 18-45 days after you’re exposed to the virus.\n\n【25】Newer antigen/antibody combination tests (you might hear them called “fourth generation” tests) can find HIV in 99% of people who are tested within 13-42 days of exposure. This test has become the standard HIV blood test in most labs.\n\n【26】A rapid antibody/antigen can also be done using blood from a prick of your fingertip. A health care provider can do this test. Or you can use a mail-in kit. The window period for this test is 18 to 90 days.\n\n【27】**Rapid oral test**. You can do this quick, easy test at home. Just swab the area between your gums and teeth to collect a sample of oral fluid (it isn’t the same as saliva) for antibodies against HIV. If you’ve had the virus for a while, the rapid oral test is highly accurate. But if you have a new infection, even if you got it in the past few months, the test won’t be as reliable. The window period is 23 to 90 days.\n\n【28】**Urine test.** These also look for HIV antibodies, but they aren’t as accurate as other tests that check either your blood or oral fluid. Because it’s an antibody test, its window period is similar to that of a standard HIV test.\n\n【29】**Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**. These tests look for HIV at around 10-33 days after infection. They screen for signs of the virus itself, not antibodies to it. You may also hear this called an HIV RNA or a viral load test. It uses blood taken from a vein. You probably won’t get this expensive test unless you have symptoms and the doctor thinks you have a recent infection. It’s most often used to see how people who already have HIV respond to treatment.\n\n【30】What to Expect With HIV Testing\n-------------------------------\n\n【31】For a lab test, you might need to call your doctor to schedule it. Some public health clinics take walk-ins.\n\n【32】A technician will take a small blood sample and send it to a lab. Some immunoassay tests check your urine or fluids from your mouth (not saliva), but there aren't as many antibodies in these, so you may get false negatives.\n\n【33】With home blood tests, you prick your finger to get a small blood sample that you send to a lab. You call to get your result, and you don't have to give your name. If it's positive, the lab will also do a follow-up test to double-check.\n\n【34】With home oral fluid tests, you swab your upper and lower gums and test the sample in a vial. About 1 in 12 people who are infected get a false negative from this test. If it’s positive, get a lab test to confirm.\n\n【35】**How long does it take to get HIV results?**  This depends on what kind of test you had. Rapid tests provide answers in less than a half-hour. With a standard blood test or antibody/antigen test, you should expect results in a few days. It may take several days to get results from an NAT test. Urine test results could take up to 2 weeks.\n\n【36】HIV Test Results\n----------------\n\n【37】Some tests are anonymous, meaning your name isn’t tied to the result. Others are confidential: Your information is attached to the result, but it’s protected by privacy laws.\n\n【38】**Positive test results.** A positive test result means there are traces of HIV in your body. Health care providers never diagnose HIV based on a single test result. If you had a rapid test, get a standard lab test to confirm it. If you had a lab test, more detailed tests of your blood can confirm your diagnosis:\n\n【39】*   Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay\n*   Antibody differentiation between HIV-1 and HIV-2\n\n【40】A positive HIV test doesn’t mean you have AIDS, the most advanced stage of the disease. HIV treatment can keep you from getting AIDS, so talk to your doctor right away about starting medications called antiretroviral therapy (ART). These drugs lower the amount of the virus in your body, sometimes to a point where a test can’t spot it. They also protect your immune system so your HIV infection doesn’t become AIDS.\n\n【41】**False-positive test results**. Some HIV tests have a very slight chance of giving you false results. A “false-positive” result means the test shows you have HIV when you don’t. This occasionally happens when your test detects antibodies but they’re antibodies to another infection or substance – not to HIV. Rarely, a false positive can result from a lab mix-up or misinterpretation.\n\n【42】The rapid oral fluid test is more likely to give you a false-positive result than other tests. If you get a positive result on a rapid oral test, your doctor will give you a blood test to confirm your diagnosis.\n\n【43】**Negative test results.** If your result is negative, you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV. They include practicing safe sex and taking medicine called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\n【44】Even if your test is negative, your partner can still have the virus. Talk with them about getting tested.\n\n【45】It could take as long as 6 months for you to have enough antibodies to get a positive result on some tests. If it’s been 3 months or less since you might have been infected and your test result is negative, get another test at 6 months to be sure.\n\n【46】**False-negative test results**. It’s also possible to get a “false-negative” result. That means the test says you don’t have HIV, but you do. This may happen if you get tested before or early in the window period for your particular test.\n\n【47】It also sometimes happens in people taking antiretroviral medicine for PrEP or PEP.  Otherwise, it’s very rare to get a false negative after the window period.\n\n【48】Where to Get Tested\n-------------------\n\n【49】Where you get tested for HIV depends on what’s available in your area, how much you can spend, and your preferences. Among the places that offer testing are:\n\n【50】*   Health clinics and community health centers\n*   County health departments\n*   STD and sexual health clinics\n*   Family planning clinics\n*   Substance abuse treatment and prevention programs\n*   LGBTQ+ health centers\n*   VA medical centers\n*   University health centers\n*   Pharmacies\n*   Private doctors’ offices\n\n【51】Testing through local health departments and college health centers is often free. Some nonprofits also offer free or low-cost testing.\n\n【52】If you test positive, these organizations can help you get treatment. If you test negative, they can tell you about ways to prevent HIV infection.\n\n【53】At-home testing kits are available online and at pharmacies without a prescription. They generally offer you access to telephone counseling before and after testing.\n\n【54】To find out where you can get tested, check hiv.gov or gettested.cdc.gov, or call 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636).\n\n【55】Barriers to HIV Testing\n-----------------------\n\n【56】Research has shown that some people avoid getting an HIV test because they fear others’ negative attitudes about HIV. This stigma results largely from fear, outdated beliefs about how HIV is transmitted, and value judgments about people who have it.\n\n【57】People may think an HIV diagnosis could:\n\n【58】*   Affect their relationships with friends and family\n*   Cause problems with housing, employment, or school\n*   Keep them from getting health care or health insurance  \n\n【59】Other barriers to HIV testing include economic, cultural, and social issues such as:\n\n【60】*   Lack of access or transportation to testing\n*   Homophobia\n*   Racism\n*   Discrimination against trans people\n\n【61】And, of course, it’s common to be afraid of getting a positive test result. But learning your status can relieve the anxiety of uncertainty.   \n\n【62】If you don’t feel comfortable going to your regular doctor, consider testing by a nonprofit group or community health center. Some serve particular populations, such as LGBTQ+ people. They may even offer mobile testing vans. Or you may prefer to self-test in the privacy of your home.\n\n【63】HIV Home Tests\n--------------\n\n【64】You can also take the test at home yourself. Here’s how to do it and what you should know about self-testing.\n\n【65】**HIV Home Test Kits**\n\n【66】Home Access HIV-1 Test System: With this over-the-counter kit, you prick your finger and put a drop of blood on special paper. You then mail the sample to a testing lab. You need to wait about a week before you call a toll-free phone number for your results using your anonymous personal identification number. You’ll also be offered counseling by telephone if you need it.\n\n【67】OraQuick In-Home HIV Test: You can buy this test online or at a pharmacy. This quick-result test checks for HIV antibodies in a sample of saliva. You swab your upper and lower gums with a test stick. You then insert the sample into a vial filled with a fluid and wait 20-40 minutes and read the result.\n\n【68】**HIV Home Test Accuracy**\n\n【69】The Home Access HIV-1 Test System is extremely reliable. Studies show that it will detect HIV antibodies more than 99.9% of the time. When your sample gets a positive result, the lab will confirm it with another test before you can call for your result.\n\n【70】The test is also 99.9% accurate if your results are negative, meaning that you don’t have HIV. So you can be highly confident of either answer.\n\n【71】The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test is less accurate. This test will find HIV antibodies 92% of the time. That means it will miss an HIV infection in 1 of 12 people who have it. OraQuick rarely gives false positive results, meaning that it’s unlikely to say you have HIV if you don’t.\n\n【72】But experts recommend that if you test positive on OraQuick, you should view the results as preliminary. You should confirm it with a second test from your doctor or a medical clinic so that you can get the care you need.\n\n【73】For both of these tests, if you test negative, you may want to get tested again if you’ve done anything recently that could have exposed you to the virus. That’s because it can take 3-6 months for your body to make HIV antibodies, so taking a test before or during this window period may miss an infection.\n\n【74】**Best HIV Test for You**\n\n【75】Should you get screened for HIV at a clinic or your doctor’s office, or take the test yourself? And which home test is best for you? The answers to these questions may help you decide:\n\n【76】*   How important is it that no one else knows that you’re taking the test or its results?\n*   How important is accuracy?\n*   Are you willing to get a follow-up test if needed?\n*   How quickly do you want to get your results?\n*   How do you want to receive your results?\n\n【77】If you’re at risk for HIV, any test is better than no test. A study of men who have sex with men who received self-tests in the mail found that they were likely to be screened for HIV more often. So the tests caught more HIV infections. The men who tested positive also shared the information with others they knew.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【54】To find out where you can get tested, check hiv.gov or gettested.cdc.gov, or call 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636).", "content": "【0】What Is HIV Testing?\n--------------------\n\n【1】HIV testing, also called HIV screening, is the only way to know if you have the virus.\n\n【2】Several types of tests check your blood or other body fluids to see whether you're infected.

If you’ve had the virus for a while, the rapid oral test is highly accurate. But if you have a new infection, even if you got it in the past few months, the test won’t be as reliable. The window period is 23 to 90 days.\n\n【28】**Urine test.** These also look for HIV antibodies, but they aren’t as accurate as other tests that check either your blood or oral fluid. Because it’s an antibody test, its window period is similar to that of a standard HIV test.\n\n【29】**Nucleic acid tests (NAT)**. These tests look for HIV at around 10-33 days after infection. They screen for signs of the virus itself, not antibodies to it. You may also hear this called an HIV RNA or a viral load test. It uses blood taken from a vein. You probably won’t get this expensive test unless you have symptoms and the doctor thinks you have a recent infection. It’s most often used to see how people who already have HIV respond to treatment.\n\n【30】What to Expect With HIV Testing\n-------------------------------\n\n【31】For a lab test, you might need to call your doctor to schedule it. Some public health clinics take walk-ins.\n\n【32】A technician will take a small blood sample and send it to a lab. Some immunoassay tests check your urine or fluids from your mouth (not saliva), but there aren't as many antibodies in these, so you may get false negatives.\n\n【33】With home blood tests, you prick your finger to get a small blood sample that you send to a lab. You call to get your result, and you don't have to give your name. If it's positive, the lab will also do a follow-up test to double-check.\n\n【34】With home oral fluid tests, you swab your upper and lower gums and test the sample in a vial. About 1 in 12 people who are infected get a false negative from this test. If it’s positive, get a lab test to confirm.\n\n【35】**How long does it take to get HIV results?**  This depends on what kind of test you had. Rapid tests provide answers in less than a half-hour. With a standard blood test or antibody/antigen test, you should expect results in a few days. It may take several days to get results from an NAT test. Urine test results could take up to 2 weeks.\n\n【36】HIV Test Results\n----------------\n\n【37】Some tests are anonymous, meaning your name isn’t tied to the result. Others are confidential: Your information is attached to the result, but it’s protected by privacy laws.\n\n【38】**Positive test results.** A positive test result means there are traces of HIV in your body. Health care providers never diagnose HIV based on a single test result. If you had a rapid test, get a standard lab test to confirm it. If you had a lab test, more detailed tests of your blood can confirm your diagnosis:\n\n【39】*   Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay\n*   Antibody differentiation between HIV-1 and HIV-2\n\n【40】A positive HIV test doesn’t mean you have AIDS, the most advanced stage of the disease. HIV treatment can keep you from getting AIDS, so talk to your doctor right away about starting medications called antiretroviral therapy (ART). These drugs lower the amount of the virus in your body, sometimes to a point where a test can’t spot it. They also protect your immune system so your HIV infection doesn’t become AIDS.\n\n【41】**False-positive test results**. Some HIV tests have a very slight chance of giving you false results. A “false-positive” result means the test shows you have HIV when you don’t. This occasionally happens when your test detects antibodies but they’re antibodies to another infection or substance – not to HIV. Rarely, a false positive can result from a lab mix-up or misinterpretation.\n\n【42】The rapid oral fluid test is more likely to give you a false-positive result than other tests. If you get a positive result on a rapid oral test, your doctor will give you a blood test to confirm your diagnosis.\n\n【43】**Negative test results.** If your result is negative, you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV. They include practicing safe sex and taking medicine called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n\n【44】Even if your test is negative, your partner can still have the virus. Talk with them about getting tested.\n\n【45】It could take as long as 6 months for you to have enough antibodies to get a positive result on some tests. If it’s been 3 months or less since you might have been infected and your test result is negative, get another test at 6 months to be sure.\n\n【46】**False-negative test results**. It’s also possible to get a “false-negative” result. That means the test says you don’t have HIV, but you do. This may happen if you get tested before or early in the window period for your particular test.\n\n【47】It also sometimes happens in people taking antiretroviral medicine for PrEP or PEP.  Otherwise, it’s very rare to get a false negative after the window period.\n\n【48】Where to Get Tested\n-------------------\n\n【49】Where you get tested for HIV depends on what’s available in your area, how much you can spend, and your preferences. Among the places that offer testing are:\n\n【50】*   Health clinics and community health centers\n*   County health departments\n*   STD and sexual health clinics\n*   Family planning clinics\n*   Substance abuse treatment and prevention programs\n*   LGBTQ+ health centers\n*   VA medical centers\n*   University health centers\n*   Pharmacies\n*   Private doctors’ offices\n\n【51】Testing through local health departments and college health centers is often free. Some nonprofits also offer free or low-cost testing.\n\n【52】If you test positive, these organizations can help you get treatment. If you test negative, they can tell you about ways to prevent HIV infection.\n\n【53】At-home testing kits are available online and at pharmacies without a prescription. They generally offer you access to telephone counseling before and after testing.\n\n【54】To find out where you can get tested, check hiv.gov or gettested.cdc.gov, or call 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636).\n\n【55】Barriers to HIV Testing\n-----------------------\n\n【56】Research has shown that some people avoid getting an HIV test because they fear others’ negative attitudes about HIV. This stigma results largely from fear, outdated beliefs about how HIV is transmitted, and value judgments about people who have it.\n\n【57】People may think an HIV diagnosis could:\n\n【58】*   Affect their relationships with friends and family\n*   Cause problems with housing, employment, or school\n*   Keep them from getting health care or health insurance  \n\n【59】Other barriers to HIV testing include economic, cultural, and social issues such as:\n\n【60】*   Lack of access or transportation to testing\n*   Homophobia\n*   Racism\n*   Discrimination against trans people\n\n【61】And, of course, it’s common to be afraid of getting a positive test result. But learning your status can relieve the anxiety of uncertainty.   \n\n【62】If you don’t feel comfortable going to your regular doctor, consider testing by a nonprofit group or community health center. Some serve particular populations, such as LGBTQ+ people. They may even offer mobile testing vans. Or you may prefer to self-test in the privacy of your home.\n\n【63】HIV Home Tests\n--------------\n\n【64】You can also take the test at home yourself. Here’s how to do it and what you should know about self-testing.\n\n【65】**HIV Home Test Kits**\n\n【66】Home Access HIV-1 Test System: With this over-the-counter kit, you prick your finger and put a drop of blood on special paper. You then mail the sample to a testing lab. You need to wait about a week before you call a toll-free phone number for your results using your anonymous personal identification number. You’ll also be offered counseling by telephone if you need it.\n\n【67】OraQuick In-Home HIV Test: You can buy this test online or at a pharmacy. This quick-result test checks for HIV antibodies in a sample of saliva. You swab your upper and lower gums with a test stick. You then insert the sample into a vial filled with a fluid and wait 20-40 minutes and read the result.\n\n【68】**HIV Home Test Accuracy**\n\n【69】The Home Access HIV-1 Test System is extremely reliable. Studies show that it will detect HIV antibodies more than 99.9% of the time. When your sample gets a positive result, the lab will confirm it with another test before you can call for your result.\n\n【70】The test is also 99.9% accurate if your results are negative, meaning that you don’t have HIV. So you can be highly confident of either answer.\n\n【71】The OraQuick In-Home HIV Test is less accurate. This test will find HIV antibodies 92% of the time. That means it will miss an HIV infection in 1 of 12 people who have it. OraQuick rarely gives false positive results, meaning that it’s unlikely to say you have HIV if you don’t.\n\n【72】But experts recommend that if you test positive on OraQuick, you should view the results as preliminary. You should confirm it with a second test from your doctor or a medical clinic so that you can get the care you need.\n\n【73】For both of these tests, if you test negative, you may want to get tested again if you’ve done anything recently that could have exposed you to the virus. That’s because it can take 3-6 months for your body to make HIV antibodies, so taking a test before or during this window period may miss an infection.\n\n【74】**Best HIV Test for You**\n\n【75】Should you get screened for HIV at a clinic or your doctor’s office, or take the test yourself? And which home test is best for you? The answers to these questions may help you decide:\n\n【76】*   How important is it that no one else knows that you’re taking the test or its results?\n*   How important is accuracy?\n*   Are you willing to get a follow-up test if needed?\n*   How quickly do you want to get your results?\n*   How do you want to receive your results?\n\n【77】If you’re at risk for HIV, any test is better than no test. A study of men who have sex with men who received self-tests in the mail found that they were likely to be screened for HIV more often. So the tests caught more HIV infections. The men who tested positive also shared the information with others they knew.", "index": 10733, "show": true, "start": 10733, "end": 10847, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:00:53", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:01:28", "cost": 34.338}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:59", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:01:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:00:53"}

A single blister like that is usually easy to treat at home, but if you see signs of infection, it's time to call your doctor.\n\n【1】What Causes Blisters?\n---------------------\n\n【2】**Friction.** You can get blisters when something rubs against your skin, like a tool handle or a new pair of shoes. Unlike corns and calluses, which show up after rubbing that's gone on for a long time, friction blisters come from brief, intense contact on a small area.\n\n【3】**Burns**. You can get a blister from getting too close to a flame or steam, or if you touch a hot surface. A severe sunburn can also cause blisters.\n\n【4】**Cold.** An extremely low temperature on your skin can cause blisters. For example, you might get one if your doctor freezes off a wart.\n\n【5】**Irritants or allergy triggers**. Your skin may blister if you come in contact with certain chemicals, cosmetics, and many plant allergens. You may hear your doctor call this problem irritant or allergic contact dermatitis.\n\n【6】**Drug reactions**. Sometimes your blisters may be a reaction to a drug you take. When your doctor prescribes a new medicine, always let them know about any drug reactions you've had in the past. And call your doctor if you get a blister after taking a medication.\n\n【7】Autoimmune diseases. Three diseases that curb your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- can cause blisters:\n\n【8】*   Pemphigus vulgaris, a possibly life-threatening skin disease, causes painful blisters in the mouth or skin. They become raw and crusted over after they burst.\n*   Bullous pemphigoid causes less severe blisters that heal faster and are not life-threatening. It mostly happens in elderly people.\n*   Dermatitis herpetiformis causes small, itchy blisters. It's a long-term condition that usually starts when you're a young adult. It's linked to gluten sensitivity.\n\n【9】**Infection**. Blisters are a common symptom of conditions like chickenpox, cold sores, shingles, and a skin infection called impetigo.\n\n【10】**Genes**.There are rare genetic diseases that cause the skin to be fragile and to blister.\n\n【11】How to Treat Your Blisters\n--------------------------\n\n【12】If you leave your blister alone, it often gets better in 1 or 2 weeks. While it's healing, stay away from the activity that brought on the blister.\n\n【13】Some steps you can take to help the healing process:\n\n【14】**Put on a loose bandage.** It protects your blister while it heals.\n\n【15】**Keep it padded.** If your blister rubs up against your shoe, you can stop it from getting worse by using padding underneath the bandage.\n\n【16】Usually, there's no need to drain your blister, but you may want to if it's large and hurts a lot. If you decide to do it, use a small needle that you've sterilized with rubbing alcohol. Then pierce the edge of the blister. Afterward, wash the spot with soap and water and cover with petroleum jelly.\n\n【17】When to Call Your Doctor\n------------------------\n\n【18】Be on the lookout for signs that your blister is infected. Call your doctor if it gets more painful or you notice:\n\n【19】*   Pus leaking out\n*   Swelling\n*   Redness", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:57:51", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:59:44", "cost": 112.783}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:59:41", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:57:47"}

They do know that if you have the illness, the trouble starts in some of your brain cells.\n\n【1】In an area of your brain called the substantia nigra, cells that make the chemical dopamine start to die. Dopamine has an important job to do. It acts like a messenger that tells another area of your brain when you want to move a part of your body.\n\n【2】When the cells that make dopamine start to die, your dopamine level drops. When it gets too low, you can't control your movements as well and you start to get Parkinson's symptoms.\n\n【3】No one knows what triggers the death of those cells. Scientists think it's your genes and environment working off of each other in a way we don't understand.\n\n【4】What Role Do Genes Play?\n------------------------\n\n【5】Your genes are like your body's instruction book. So if you get a change in one of them, it can make your body work in a slightly different way. Sometimes, that means you're more likely to get a certain disease.\n\n【6】There are several genetic mutations that can raise your risk for Parkinson's, each by a little bit. They have a part in about 1 in 10 cases.\n\n【7】If you have one or more of these changes, it doesn't mean you'll get Parkinson's. Some people will, but many won't, and doctors don't know why. It may have to do with other genes or something in your environment.\n\n【8】Can Parents Pass Parkinson's to Their Kids?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【9】They can, but it's rare and only affects a small number of families. About 1 in 100 people with Parkinson's get it this way.\n\n【10】How Does Environment Come Into It?\n----------------------------------\n\n【11】Your environment is a hard one to pin down. Partly, that's because it covers a lot of ground. It's everything that's not your genes, which could mean where you live, what you eat, chemicals you've come into contact with, and more.\n\n【12】Not only that, but it could take years for the effects from something in your environment to show up. So far, doctors have a lot of clues but no smoking gun. So you could have people who live or work in an area around chemicals tied to Parkinson's, but many of them don't get it.\n\n【13】Some research shows links between Parkinson's and:\n\n【14】*   Agent Orange, a chemical used to destroy trees and crops in the Vietnam War.\n*   Certain chemicals used in farming, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides.\n*   Some metals and chemicals used in factories, such as manganese, lead, and trichlorethylene (TCE).\n\n【15】These can come into play based on where you live, what you do for work, or if you served in the military. Sometimes, these chemicals seep into well water, so that's one more way they can affect you.\n\n【16】What Raises Someone's Risk for Parkinson's?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】It's a complex picture, but you may be more likely to get Parkinson's based on:\n\n【18】**Age.** Since it mostly affects people 60 and older, your risk goes up as the years go by.\n\n【19】**Family history.** If your parent, brother, or sister has it, you're a little more likely to get it.\n\n【20】**Job.** Some types of work, like farming or factory jobs, can cause you to have contact with chemicals linked to Parkinson's.\n\n【21】**Race**. It shows up more often in white people than other groups.\n\n【22】**Serious head injury.** If you hit your head hard enough to lose consciousness or forget things as a result of it, you may be more likely to get Parkinson's later in life.\n\n【23】**Gender.** Men get it more than women. Doctors aren't sure why.\n\n【24】**Where you live.** People in rural areas seem to get it more often, which may be tied to chemicals used in farming.\n\n【25】What Else Do We Know?\n---------------------\n\n【26】As scientists try to learn what's at the root of Parkinson's, they're looking far and wide to pick up clues where they can.\n\n【27】They've found that people with Parkinson's tend to have something called Lewy bodies in their brain. These are unusual clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein itself is normal, but the clumps are not. And they're found in parts of the brain that affect sleep and sense of smell, which could explain some symptoms of Parkinson's not related to movement.\n\n【28】Your gut may also have a part in it, as some of its cells make dopamine, too. Some doctors think that this might be where the earliest signs of Parkinson's show up, but that idea needs more research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:05:46", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:05:58", "cost": 11.282}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:05:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:05:46"}

Still, some people may not be sure exactly what's safe and what's not.\n\n【1】It's true that HIV is a virus, like a cold or the flu -- but it doesn't spread the same way. In fact, it's a lot harder to catch. You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body.\n\n【2】So, how does that happen?\n\n【3】From a Hug?\n-----------\n\n【4】No. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (secreted from penis before ejaculation), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Hugging and shaking hands are safe.\n\n【5】From Kissing?\n-------------\n\n【6】It's possible, but it hardly ever happens. HIV isn't spread through saliva.\n\n【7】But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood\\-to-blood contact.\n\n【8】From Someone's Cough or Sneeze?\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】No, the virus doesn't travel through air.\n\n【10】From Someone's Tears, Sweat, Vomit, or Pee?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Not like that. Sweat and tears don't carry HIV. And even though they might have a trace of blood, there have been no reported cases of HIV from vomit or pee.\n\n【12】From Vaginal Sex?\n-----------------\n\n【13】Yes, and either partner can get it!\n\n【14】Women can get HIV through the tissue that lines their vagina and cervix. The virus can get into men through the opening of their penis or through a small cut or sore on it. Women are at higher risk if they are the one being penetrated.\n\n【15】Effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) will greatly reduce the chances that an HIV infected person can give HIV to their partner in this way. However, even when HIV drugs are used, use a condom to cut your chances of the virus passing between you, as well as getting any other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【16】From Anal Sex?\n--------------\n\n【17】Yes. Either partner can get it from the other, but ther person being penetrated is at higher risk.\n\n【18】And while condoms work to protect you if they stay in place, they're more likely to break during anal sex.It is smart to use a condom-safe lubricant (that is not oil-based) to reduce friction and the risk of condoms breaking.\n\n【19】Again, effective antretroviral therapy in the HIV-infected partner will reduce the chances of passing HIV. However, condoms should be used to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【20】From Oral Sex?\n--------------\n\n【21】It's much less likely than when you have anal or vaginal sex. Still, it can happen.\n\n【22】The person who ends up with semen or vaginal fluid in their mouth is at greater risk. Again, use a condom, latex barrier, or dental dam.\n\n【23】From a Toilet Seat or Water Fountain?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【24】No, for several reasons. First, there's not likely to be the right kind of body fluid on public surfaces. And if there were, the virus would probably die before you got to it; it can't live long outside a body. And it would still have to get through your skin or into you somehow.\n\n【25】From Drinking Out of the Same Glass?\n------------------------------------\n\n【26】That's not a problem. Sharing dishes, glasses, and eating utensils is safe. Remember, HIV isn't in saliva, and it dies quickly once it's outside the body.\n\n【27】From Eating Food Made by a Person With HIV?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Probably not, even if there are traces of blood or another fluid in it. The virus can't survive the cooking process or your stomach acid.\n\n【29】Passing HIV through eating has happened only in rare cases, when children ate food that was already chewed by someone with the virus.\n\n【30】From Mosquitoes or Ticks?\n-------------------------\n\n【31】Nope, not through insects.\n\n【32】From Sharing Needles?\n---------------------\n\n【33】Yes, and it's not just the needles. Any of the supplies for preparing drugs for injection -- syringes, bottle caps, spoons, or containers -- could have the virus if someone with HIV used it first.\n\n【34】From a Tattoo or a Body Piercing?\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】In theory, yes, if the needles were used on someone with HIV before you and then not sterilized. But the CDC says no cases have been reported of someone getting the virus this way.\n\n【36】From a Blood Transfusion?\n-------------------------\n\n【37】Again, theoretically yes, but in the U.S. there's little risk. Careful testing makes sure that blood bank supplies are HIV-free.\n\n【38】From Touching an Open Wound on Someone Who Has HIV?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Maybe. Body fluids like blood can pass through broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes. But it's very rare.\n\n【40】If Someone With HIV Bites, Scratches, or Spits on You?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】It's _possible_ if a bite or scratch breaks your skin, but (yes, again) it's extremely rare. And if your skin doesn't break, there's no chance.\n\n【42】Getting spit on is unpleasant and messy, but not a danger as far as catching HIV.\n\n【43】From Your Mom (If You're a Baby)?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】Women infected with HIV can pass the virus to their child during pregnancy or while they are giving birth, or through their breast milk. The chances are greatly reduced, however if the mother is taking effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) throughout their pregnancy, labor, and delivery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:31:13", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:31:39", "cost": 25.522}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:31:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:31:13"}

In short, yes. Experts recommend that everyone 6 months old and older get a COVID-19 vaccination to protect against the coronavirus. While the original vaccines were developed for adults, thousands of health care provider offices, pharmacies, and health centers now also provide a pediatric version of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【1】Doctors can’t always tell which children are more likely to become seriously ill from COVID-19. A vaccine will lower their chances of serious complications. Experts found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children aged 5-11. Now that vaccines are available to younger children, the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines can help more people. If younger people are vaccinated, it’ll also help protect older adults who are high risk.\n\n【2】Vaccine Trials for Children\n---------------------------\n\n【3】After successful clinical trials, the FDA granted emergency use authorization of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for those 6 months old and older. Children 6 months to 4 years old will get a third dose after at least 8 weeks from their second dose.\n\n【4】Children under the age of 5 will get three 3-microgram doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Kids ages 5-11 will receive two 10-micrograms doses. The vaccine for people 12 years old and older includes two 30-micrograms doses.\n\n【5】Experts studied the Pfizer vaccine’s safety in about 3,100 kids aged 5-11. The children received the COVID-19 vaccine and didn’t show any serious side effects. The FDA continues to collect and study data from children.\n\n【6】The FDA also updated the emergency use authorization for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Now, those 6 months to 17 years old (in addition to people 18 and older) can get this vaccine.\n\n【7】Children under the age of 6 can get two 25-microgram doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Those 6-12 years of age will get two 50-microgram doses. If you’re 12 years and older, you’ll receive two 100-microgram doses.\n\n【8】The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is for those 18 and older.\n\n【9】Experts suggest that all kids over the age of 5 years old get a booster shot. They can get it at least 5 months after their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【10】Why Vaccines for Children Took Longer\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】Children weren’t a part of the original clinical trials because they’re generally not as vulnerable as adults. The majority of the deaths during the pandemic -- 92% -- have been people aged 55 and older.\n\n【12】This doesn’t mean that children are immune to COVID-19. They simply have a lower chance of serious complications from the virus.\n\n【13】Another reason that trials focused on adults first was speed. There are more levels of protection when children are involved in clinical trials. So it made sense to study an adult vaccine first to move quickly.\n\n【14】Scientists also needed more time to research children’s vaccines because their immune systems change fast. This means that a child’s body might respond differently to a vaccine depending on their age. It took experts longer to study these differences to make sure the vaccines were safe.\n\n【15】The CDC says adults can take the COVID-19 vaccine without regard to the timing of other vaccines. This means that you don’t have to wait a certain amount of time before you take another type of immunization, like experts previously thought. If you want to get the COVID-19 vaccine on the same day that you receive other vaccines, talk to your doctor first.\n\n【16】Similarly, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) found that there’s no need for children aged 12-15 to wait between the COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines. They can receive their routine immunizations at the same time as their COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【17】We don’t yet know if children aged 5-11 can take a COVID-19 vaccine with another type of immunization.\n\n【18】Here’s what you can do in the meantime to keep your child safe, especially if they’re in a high-risk group:\n\n【19】*   Make sure everyone in your family gets a flu vaccine.\n*   Make sure all eligible adults who spend time with your child get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n*   Continue to practice social distancing, wear masks, and wash your hands often.\n\n【20】Side Effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Kids\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The FDA says all known and potential benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks.\n\n【22】Common side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine reported in clinical trials included:\n\n【23】*   Injection site pain or a sore arm\n*   Redness and swelling\n*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Muscle or joint pain\n*   Chills\n*   Fever\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n*   Nausea\n*   Lowered appetite\n\n【24】In a clinical trial for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, side effects for children aged 6 to 23 months old included:\n\n【25】*   Irritability\n*   Less of an appetite\n*   Fever\n*   Pain\n*   Tenderness\n*   Redness and swelling where the needle went in\n\n【26】In addition to these, some kids aged 2-4 also had headaches and chills after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【27】In a clinical study for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, experts found that the most common symptoms in children 6-36 months old included:\n\n【28】*   Irritability and crying\n*   Sleepiness\n*   Loss of appetite\n\n【29】In kids 37 months to 5 years old, experts found that the Moderna vaccine may cause:\n\n【30】*   Fatigue\n*   Headache\n*   Chills\n*   Joint stiffness\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Nausea/vomiting\n\n【31】More kids showed side effects after the second dose compared to after the first. These symptoms tended to happen within 2 days after the vaccination and were mostly mild to moderately severe. Most of the side effects went away within 1-2 days.\n\n【32】Experts previously found that there was a higher risk of myocarditis (inflammation of your heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding your heart) after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, specifically after the second dose.\n\n【33】Because of this, the FDA created a benefit-risk assessment to look at how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, people sent to the intensive care unit (ICU), and deaths that the COVID-19 vaccine would prevent in children 5-11 years old. They compared this to the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths that the vaccine might cause.\n\n【34】Their model predicts that the overall benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks in children 5-11 years old.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:31:53", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:32:17", "cost": 24.018}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:32:16", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:31:52"}

It will have a big impact on your life and your family. But you don’t have to handle it alone. Counseling and support groups can be great outlets if you feel you need help dealing with fear, anger, or stress.\n\n【1】The decision to seek counseling is an important step. Too often, people don't get help because they feel ashamed or guilty. But when you get assistance, you make the choice to feel better and improve your life. A trained mental health care provider can help you choose the right therapy that meets your needs.\n\n【2】How Do I Start?\n---------------\n\n【3】Ask the doctor treating your Alzheimer's to refer you to a few mental health professionals. They might include family therapists, social workers, psychologists, or psychiatrists.\n\n【4】When you have your first visit with the counselor you choose, they’ll ask you why you want counseling, what symptoms you have (emotional, mental, and physical), and your medical history. You might get a survey to fill out with these questions.\n\n【5】Your answers will give the counselor a better idea of the best way to help you. You can discuss:\n\n【6】*   The best type of counseling for you\n*   The best place to have it (counselor's office, outpatient clinic, hospital, residential treatment center, telemedicine visit)\n*   Who will join in your treatment (you alone, your family members, other people who are living with a condition like Alzheimer’s)\n*   How often you should have sessions\n*   How long counseling may last\n*   Any medications that might help you\n\n【7】Types of Counseling\n-------------------\n\n【8】There are many different kinds of support that can help you handle your Alzheimer’s diagnosis. You might use them together or alone, depending on your treatment plan.\n\n【9】*   **Crisis intervention counseling.** If grief or despair becomes an emergency, a counselor can help you get through the crisis and refer you for more counseling or medical care, if you need it. You can find these services through community health agencies, help lines, and hotlines.\n*   **Individual counseling.** You meet one on one with a counselor, usually in the privacy of their office. This arrangement works well when you want to work on your thinking patterns and habits, or if your problems are very personal and hard to talk about in front of others. This may be a good option for you if you’re facing depression, anxiety, or grief in dealing with your Alzheimer's.\n*   **Family therapy.** A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can affect the entire family. You may need to make tough choices about your finances or who will be in charge of your care. These everyday strains combined with the emotional effects of the diagnosis can be a lot for your loved ones to handle. Family therapy can help all of you resolve issues together. You can also learn new ways to support each other.\n*   **Group therapy.** You’ll join with other people to discuss problems together, guided by a counselor. Members in the group often are dealing with the same problem you’re facing, but not always. The session offers a place where you can confide in others who understand and share your struggles.\n*   **Long-term, residential treatment.** In this case, you get therapy while you live at a treatment center. A program can last more than a year or just a week or two. You’ll focus mainly on your problem and on getting well. Other activities, such as work, family, and hobbies, take a back seat during this time. In most programs, you’ll get counseling daily and join in regular group therapy. You may need more counseling after residential treatment is over.\n*   **Self-help and support groups.** These let you connect with other people who have Alzheimer’s and their families and caregivers. You can offer each other understanding and advice on the challenges of the disease. You’ll meet regularly without a therapist or counselor.

Some people with lupus suffer only minor inconvenience. Others suffer significant lifelong disability.\n\n【2】Lupus affects people of African, Asian, or Native American descent two to three times as often as it affects whites. Nine out of 10 people with lupus are women. The disease usually strikes between age 15 and 44, although it can occur in older individuals.\n\n【3】There are two kinds of lupus:\n\n【4】*   Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)\n*   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\n【5】DLE mainly affects skin that is exposed to sunlight and doesn’t typically affect vital internal organs. Discoid (circular) skin lesions often leave scars after healing of the lesions.\n\n【6】SLE is more serious: It affects the skin and other vital organs, and can cause a raised, scaly, butterfly-shaped rash across the bridge of the nose and cheeks that can leave scars if untreated. SLE can also affect other parts of the skin elsewhere on the body.\n\n【7】Aside from the visible effects of systemic lupus, the disease may also inflame and/or damage the connective tissue in the joints, muscles, and skin, along with the membranes surrounding or within the lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain. SLE can also cause kidney disease. Brain involvement is rare, but for some, lupus can cause confusion, depression, seizures, and strokes.\n\n【8】Blood vessels may come under attack with systemic lupus. This can cause sores to develop on the skin, especially the fingers. Some lupus patients get Raynaud's syndrome, which makes the small blood vessels in the skin contract, preventing blood from getting to the hands and feet -- especially in response to cold. Most attacks last only a few minutes, can be painful, and often turn the hands and feet white or a bluish color. Lupus patients with Raynaud’s syndrome should keep their hands warm with gloves during cold weather.\n\n【9】What Causes Lupus?\n------------------\n\n【10】No single factor is known to cause lupus. Research suggests that a combination of genetic, hormonal, environmental, and immune system factors may be behind it. Environmental factors, ranging from viral and bacterial infections to severe emotional stress or overexposure to sunlight, may play a role in provoking or triggering the disease. Certain drugs, such as the blood pressure drug hydralazine and the heart rhythm drug procainamide, may cause lupus-like symptoms. High estrogen levels resulting from pregnancy may aggravate lupus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:26:07", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:26:13", "cost": 6.155}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:26:13", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:26:07"}

Or maybe you know someone who swears by acupuncture for their back pain or herbal teas for colds. More and more, people use practices like these from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to not only fight disease, but also prevent it.\n\n【1】TCM is an ancient system of health and wellness that’s been used in China for thousands of years. Western medicine focuses mainly on treating disease. But TCM looks at your entire well-being.\n\n【2】Is it safe to try and will it work? With a little background on how it’s used, you can make more informed choices to improve your health.\n\n【3】What’s the Idea Behind TCM?\n---------------------------\n\n【4】Western medicine tends to view the body a lot like a car. It has different systems that need the right inputs and outputs. It’s very concrete and logical.\n\n【5】TCM, on the other hand, doesn’t focus on science and medicine. Instead, it’s based on balance, harmony, and energy. There are two central ideas behind TCM:\n\n【6】**Qi:** This is also called life energy or vital energy. The belief is that it runs throughout your body. It’s always on the move and constantly changes. TCM treatments often focus on ways to promote and maintain the flow of qi.\n\n【7】**Yin and Yang:** These are opposites that describe the qualities of qi.\n\n【8】*   Yin: night , dark, cold, feminine, negative\n*   Yang: day, light, warm , positive, male\n\n【9】The belief is that everything in life has a little bit of its opposite, too, and balance is the key. For example, a drug from your doctor might heal disease. But it’s dangerous if you take too much of it.\n\n【10】According to TCM, these ideas play out in our bodies. When you balance the yin and yang of Qi, you feel healthy and well. If they’re out of whack, you feel sick. TCM aims to create harmony and a healthy flow of qi.\n\n【11】What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use?\n------------------------------------\n\n【12】What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use?\n\n【13】Several. They include:\n\n【14】*   Acupuncture: very fine needles placed gently in the skin\n*   Cupping: heated cups that create suction on your skin\n*   Herbs: teas, powders, and capsules made mostly from plants\n*   Meditation: a way to sit quietly and calm your mind\n*   Moxibustion: dried herbs burned near the skin\n*   Tai chi: exercise with slow movements and focus on the breath\n\n【15】Is It Safe?\n-----------\n\n【16】Experts believe it’s safe, if you go to someone who knows what they're doing. This is especially true of acupuncture, tai chi, cupping, and moxibustion.\n\n【17】Herbs can be a little trickier. They don’t go through the same FDA process as drugs. That means there’s not as much research on them, and it can be hard to know exactly what’s in them. Plus, herbs can have side effects or impact other medicine you’re taking. Again, it’s important to go to someone who really understands their practice. And always check with your doctor first.\n\n【18】Does It Work?\n-------------\n\n【19】TCM is an approach that covers a lot of ground, and results vary. The practices haven’t been studied in the same way as Western medicine. More research has been done on herbs and acupuncture than other treatments. But studies show a lot of promise:\n\n【20】*   Acupuncture is commonly accepted as a treatment for a number of conditions, including pain relief and limiting side effects from chemotherapy.\n*   A number of herbs used in TCM are also used at well-respected, Western medicine clinics to treat anything from trouble sleeping to arthritis to menopause.\n*   Tai chi seems to improve balance in people with Parkinson’s disease.\n*   Cupping may help relieve pain from shingles.\n\n【21】Who Should Use It?\n------------------\n\n【22】That’s a personal decision. People use TCM for anything from carpal tunnel syndrome to lowering stress. Sometimes they use it along with Western medicine. It may be a good choice if you:\n\n【23】*   Have a lot of different symptoms with no clear cause\n*   Need to treat side effects from drugs\n*   Have tried Western medicine but didn’t get results\n*   Want to prevent illness\n\n【24】Who Should Avoid TCM?\n---------------------\n\n【25】In general, doctors suggest you don’t use it to totally replace Western medicine, especially if you have a serious condition like cancer or liver disease.\n\n【26】They also urge caution, especially with herbs, if you’re:\n\n【27】*   Elderly\n*   Pregnant or breastfeeding\n*   Scheduled for surgery (some herbs could lead to bleeding problems or prevent drugs used during surgery from working)\n*   Taking other medicine as well\n*   Treating a child\n\n【28】What Do Traditional Doctors Think of TCM?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】They want to see proof that something is safe and works well before they suggest you try it. That often makes it hard for them to recommend TCM. But on the whole, research and interest in TCM is on the rise.\n\n【30】You can also find many leading health care centers, like the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins offering TCM practices such as acupuncture and herbal treatments.\n\n【31】How Do I Find Someone Who Practices TCM?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Your best bet is to find someone certified by the Accreditation Committee for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). They accredit schools that teach TCM, and you can check their website to find someone.\n\n【33】Another option is to get in touch with a school of Oriental medicine. They can sometimes refer you to their alumni.\n\n【34】Check with your family and friends as well -- just do your research to make sure you go to someone you can trust.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:08:44", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:08:57", "cost": 13.802}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:08:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:08:43"}

It’s actually made up of several bones with special joints between them. This allows it to expand so your brain has room to grow. Normally, the skull bones come together only after your head reaches its full size.\n\n【2】But with this syndrome, the plates join together too early. The skull can’t expand as the brain grows, which affects the shape of the head and face.\n\n【3】There are three types of Pfeiffer syndrome. All of them affect a child’s appearance, but types 2 and 3 are more severe. They can cause delays in development, as well as other issues with the brain and nervous system.\n\n【4】Treatment starts soon after birth. Because the condition varies among people, the right care depends on your child’s signs and symptoms.\n\n【5】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【6】Pfeiffer syndrome is caused by a glitch in the genes that control how certain cells grow and die.\n\n【7】It can be passed from a parent to child, but in most cases, the parents don’t have the syndrome. The baby’s genes have a change that seems to happen out of the blue.\n\n【8】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【9】They vary based on the type and how severe it is. It can affect the head and face, fingers and toes, and a number of other areas.\n\n【10】**Head and face:** Signs of it often show most clearly here. This is partly because the skull can’t expand as it typically does. But Pfeiffer syndrome also affects bones in the mid-face, from the eyes to the mouth, which don’t grow as far forward as usual.\n\n【11】When your child has the condition, you might see:\n\n【12】*   A beaked-shaped nose\n*   Crowded, crooked teeth\n*   Eyes that appear larger and set wider apart than normal\n*   A head that’s short from front to back\n*   A high forehead\n*   A very small upper jaw\n\n【13】**Fingers and Toes:** It’s also common for children to have:\n\n【14】*   Short fingers and toes\n*   Thumbs and big toes that are wider than normal and bend away from the other fingers and toes\n*   Webbed fingers and toes\n\n【15】**Other Problems:** More than half of children have hearing loss. Some also have:\n\n【16】*   Dental problems\n*   Acid reflux\n*   Sleep apnea (when you briefly stop breathing or take shallow breath many times a night)\n*   Vision problems\n\n【17】Types 2 and 3\n-------------\n\n【18】Children with Pfeiffer syndrome types 2 and 3 often have delayed development and other issues with the brain and nervous system.\n\n【19】Without early treatment, they’re also more likely to have life-threatening health problems.\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【21】A doctor can often tell whether your child has Pfeiffer syndrome from a physical exam as they check the skull, thumbs, and big toes.\n\n【22】To make sure it’s Pfeiffer and not something else, your doctor may also order:\n\n【23】*   X-rays or imaging, like a CT scan, to check the skull\n*   Genetic tests (taking a blood or saliva sample to check for the gene glitch that causes it)\n\n【24】Treatments\n----------\n\n【25】Your child's treatment depends on the signs and symptoms. You might need a team of specialists that includes doctors, surgeons, psychologists, speech and language therapists, and more.\n\n【26】Surgery tends to play a key role in treatment.\n\n【27】**Skull surgery:** Most children have the first surgery to reshape their skull before they’re 18 months old.\n\n【28】For children under 3 months, this can be done with very small openings in the head. For older children, doctors use traditional surgery. Typically, children will need two to four skull surgeries over the course of their lives.\n\n【29】**Midface surgery:** Some children may need it to correct problems in their jaw and bring their midface bones forward. Children are usually at least 6 before this surgery is done.\n\n【30】**Treatment for** **breathing problems****:** Some children have blockages that make it hard for them to breathe. This leads to problems such as sleep apnea.\n\n【31】To correct these problems, your doctor may suggest these:\n\n【32】*   Your child can wear a special mask while sleeping. It’s called a “continuous positive airway pressure mask” -- CPAP for short. This is a standard treatment for sleep apnea.\n*   Midface surgery can help remove blockages.\n*   A surgeon can remove the tonsils or adenoids (tissues in the back of the nose that help fight infection).\n\n【33】For severe cases, doctors may do a surgery called a tracheostomy.\n\n【34】The doctor creates an opening in the child’s neck directly to the windpipe to allow for easier breathing. It’s done for children too young to have other surgeries to correct breathing problems.\n\n【35】**Other treatments:** Your child may also need:\n\n【36】*   Dental work to help with issues such as an underbite and teeth that are out of position\n*   Surgery to correct finger and toe problems\n*   Therapy to help with speech and language learning", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:40:55", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:41:04", "cost": 8.8}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:41:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:40:51"}

As many as 90% are benign (not cancerous).\n\n【3】Most meningiomas occur in the brain. But they can also grow on parts of the spinal cord.\n\n【4】Often, meningiomas cause no symptoms and require no immediate treatment. But the growth of benign meningiomas can cause serious problems. In some cases, such growth can be fatal.\n\n【5】Meningiomas are the most common type of tumor that originates in the central nervous system. They occur more often in women than in men.\n\n【6】Some meningiomas are classified as atypical. These are not considered either benign or malignant (cancerous). But they may become malignant.\n\n【7】A small number of meningiomas are cancerous. They tend to grow quickly. They also can spread to other parts of the brain and beyond, often to the lungs.\n\n【8】Causes and Risk Factors of Meningioma\n-------------------------------------\n\n【9】The causes of meningioma are not well understood. However, there are two known risk factors.\n\n【10】*   Exposure to radiation\n*   Neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disorder\n\n【11】Previous injury may also be a risk factor, but a recent study failed to confirm this. Meningiomas have been found in places where skull fractures have occurred. They've also been found in places where the surrounding membrane has been scarred.\n\n【12】Some research suggests a link between meningiomas and the hormone progesterone.\n\n【13】Middle-aged women are more than twice as likely as men to develop a meningioma. Most meningiomas occur between the ages of 30 and 70. They are very rare in children.\n\n【14】Meningioma Symptoms\n-------------------\n\n【15】Because most meningiomas grow very slowly, symptoms often develop gradually, if they develop at all. The most common symptoms include:\n\n【16】*   Headaches\n*   Seizures\n*   Blurred vision\n*   Weakness in arms or legs\n*   Numbness\n*   Speech problems\n\n【17】Diagnosis of Meningiomas\n------------------------\n\n【18】Meningiomas are rarely diagnosed before they begin to cause symptoms.\n\n【19】If symptoms indicate the possibility of a tumor, a doctor may order a brain scan: an MRI and/or a CT scan. These will allow the doctor to locate the meningioma and determine its size.\n\n【20】A biopsy may sometimes be performed. A surgeon removes part or all of the tumor to determine whether it is benign or malignant.\n\n【21】Meningioma Treatment\n--------------------\n\n【22】If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, observation is often recommended. Regular brain scans will be performed to determine if the tumor is growing.\n\n【23】If the tumor's growth threatens to cause problems or if symptoms begin to develop, surgery may be necessary.\n\n【24】If surgery is required, a craniotomy will typically be performed. The procedure involves removing a piece of bone from the skull. This gives the surgeon access to the affected portion of the brain.\n\n【25】The surgeon then removes the tumor -- or as much of it as possible. The bone that was removed at the start of the procedure is then replaced.\n\n【26】The location of the meningioma will determine how accessible it is to the surgeon. If it can't be reached via surgery, radiation therapy may be used. Radiation can shrink the tumor or help prevent it from growing any larger.\n\n【27】Radiation can also be used to kill cancer cells if the tumor is malignant. It may also be used on the parts of a tumor the surgeon was unable to remove.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:30", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:38", "cost": 8.314}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:30"}

See also Side Effects section.\n\n【6】Uses\n----\n\n【7】This medication is used to treat blood clots (such as in deep vein thrombosis \\- DVT or pulmonary embolus-PE) and/or to prevent new clots from forming in your body. Preventing harmful blood clots helps to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack . Conditions that increase your risk of developing blood clots include a certain type of irregular heart rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ), heart valve replacement, recent heart attack, and certain surgeries (such as hip/ knee replacement ). Warfarin is commonly called a \" blood thinner ,\" but the more correct term is \"anticoagulant.\" It helps to keep blood flowing smoothly in your body by decreasing the amount of certain substances (clotting proteins) in your blood.\n\n【8】### How to use Jantoven\n\n【9】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking warfarin and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【10】Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor or other health care professional, usually once a day. It is very important to take it exactly as directed. Do not increase the dose, take it more often, or stop using it unless directed by your doctor.\n\n【11】The dosage is based on your medical condition, lab tests (such as INR), and response to treatment.

If you are trying to lose weight , check with your doctor before you try to go on a diet.\n\n【14】Since this drug can be absorbed through the skin and lungs and may harm an unborn baby, women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should not handle this medication or breathe the dust from the tablets.\n\n【15】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【16】Nausea , loss of appetite, or stomach / abdominal pain may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【17】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【18】This medication can cause serious bleeding if it affects your blood clotting proteins too much (shown by unusually high INR lab results). Even if your doctor stops your medication, this risk of bleeding can continue for up to a week.

This can lead to severe skin /tissue damage that may require surgery or amputation if left untreated. Patients with certain blood conditions (protein C or S deficiency) may be at greater risk. Get medical help right away if any of these rare but serious side effects occur: painful/red/purplish patches on the skin (such as on the toe, breast , abdomen ), signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), vision changes, confusion, trouble speaking, weakness on one side of the body.\n\n【21】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare.

These drugs may increase the risk of bleeding problems if taken during treatment with warfarin. Carefully check all prescription/nonprescription product labels (including drugs applied to the skin such as pain-relieving creams) since the products may contain NSAIDs or salicylates. Talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen ) to treat pain/fever.

Four out of five people experience back pain at some point, making it the second most common reason for visiting the doctor.\n\n【1】Back pain takes various forms, from a persistent dull ache to sudden sharp pain, and has many causes. Sometimes it results from a sprain, fracture, or other accidental injury. It can stem from a disease or medical condition, such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spinal canal through which the spinal cord runs). Many people develop back pain in part because they’re overweight or sedentary.\n\n【2】The good news is that most lower back pain usually gets better within a few days or weeks, and surgery is rarely necessary. What’s more, simple self-help strategies such as these can be surprisingly effective at preventing back pain and keeping it from returning:\n\n【3】**1\\. Get more** **exercise****.** If your back is hurting, you may think the best way to get relief is to limit exercise and to rest. A day or two of rest may help, but more than that may not help the pain. Experts now know that regular physical activity can help ease inflammation and muscle tension.\n\n【4】Ask your doctor or health club trainer about back-strengthening exercises. Also, some forms of yoga and tai chi may help you learn proper posture and improve strength, balance, and flexibility.\n\n【5】**2\\. Watch your weight.** Extra pounds, especially in your midsection, can make back pain worse by shifting your center of gravity and putting strain on your lower back. Staying within 10 pounds of your ideal weight may help control back pain.\n\n【6】**3\\. If you smoke, stop.** Smoking restricts the flow of nutrient-containing blood to spinal discs, so smokers are especially vulnerable to back pain.\n\n【7】**4\\. Sleep well.** If you’re prone to back pain, talk with your doctor about the best sleeping position. Sleeping on your side with your knees pulled up slightly toward your chest is sometimes suggested. Prefer to sleep on your back? Put one pillow under your knees and another under your lower back. Sleeping on your stomach can be especially hard on your back. If you can’t sleep any other way, place a pillow under your hips.\n\n【8】People prefer different things in their mattresses. If it’s too soft, many people will have backaches. The same is true for a very hard mattress. Many experts recommend a medium-firm mattress for those with chronic backache. It may take some trial and error to find what works for you. A piece of plywood between the box spring and mattress will stiffen a soft bed. A thick mattress pad will help soften a mattress that is too hard.\n\n【9】**5\\. Pay attention to your posture.** First, check your posture by standing with your heels against a wall. Your calves, buttocks, shoulders, and the back of your head should touch the wall. You should be able to slip your hand behind the small of your back. Now, step forward and stand normally. If your posture changes, correct it right away.\n\n【10】**6\\. Start with your seat.** The best chair for preventing back pain is one with a straight back or low-back support. Keep your knees a bit higher than your hips while seated. Your chair back should be set at an angle of about 110 degrees and should cradle the small of your back comfortably. If necessary, use a wedge-shaped cushion or lumbar pad. Prop your feet on a stool if you need to. If you must stand for a prolonged period, keep your head up and your stomach pulled in. If possible, rest one foot on a stool or box about 6 inches high -- and switch feet every 5 to 15 minutes.\n\n【11】**7\\. Check your desk.** To avoid straining your neck and eyes, center your computer monitor in front of you, about an arm's length away. The top of the monitor should be about 2 to 3 inches above your eye level. If you wear bifocals, it may be more comfortable to lower your monitor slightly.\n\n【12】Type at the right height. A lot of people put their keyboard directly on their desk, so it's just below chest level. But typing at that height for a long time limits circulation and stresses the joints and nerves in your arms, shoulders, and wrists. That can cause numbness and pain in those areas, as well as your back. It can even lead to long-term problems like carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【13】If you can, use a keyboard tray that's beneath your desktop. Your keyboard should be slightly below your elbows.\n\n【14】**8\\. Lighten up on laptop use.** Your laptop may be easy to carry around, but if you use it a lot, put it on a desk and type on a separate keyboard and use a mouse.\n\n【15】Using a laptop on your lap for long periods causes you to bend your head forward. That puts pressure on the bones called vertebrae at the top of your neck, which can trigger headaches and pain in your back and neck.\n\n【16】If you need to use a laptop on your lap, make sure the monitor is about 6 inches below your gaze. That position helps lessen how much you have to bend your neck to see. You can prop the laptop on a book or tray if your lap is too low.\n\n【17】Another tip: Limit your laptop use to half an hour at a time.\n\n【18】**9\\. Try not to type on your phone.** It's OK to send an occasional text or email on your phone. But remember, when you type on your phone, you're bending your head and curving your spine. If you do that for more than a few minutes, it will put stress on the delicate vertebrae in your neck.\n\n【19】The solution is simple. Save longer messages for when you can sit down at a computer with a straight spine.\n\n【20】**10\\. Take a lot of breaks.** Every 10 minutes, take at least 20 seconds to stop typing and stand and stretch. And every 20 minutes, even if you took a break in between, stand and spend at least 2 minutes away from your computer.\n\n【21】This gets your blood pumping and loosens up tight muscles and stiff joints. It also gives your eyes a chance to readjust, which can prevent computer-related vision problems.\n\n【22】**11\\. Be careful how you lift.** Don’t bend over from the waist to lift heavy objects. Bend your knees and squat, pulling in your stomach muscles and holding the object close to your body as you stand up. Let your legs do the lifting, not your back. Don't twist your body while lifting. If you can, push rather than pull heavy objects. Pushing is easier on the back.\n\n【23】**12\\. Avoid high heels.** They can shift your center of gravity and strain your lower back. Stick to a one-inch heel. If you have to go higher, bring along a pair of low-heeled shoes and slip into them if you become uncomfortable.\n\n【24】**13\\. Stash the skinny jeans.** Clothing so tight that it interferes with bending, sitting, or walking can aggravate back pain.\n\n【25】**14\\. Lighten your wallet.** Sitting on an overstuffed wallet may cause discomfort and back pain. If you’re going to be sitting for a prolonged period -- while driving, for example, take your wallet out of your back pocket.\n\n【26】**15\\. Pick the right handbag or briefcase.** Buy a bag or briefcase with a wide, adjustable strap that’s long enough to reach over your head. A messenger bag (like the ones bike messengers wear) is made to wear this way. Having the strap on the opposite shoulder of the bag distributes the weight more evenly and helps keep your shoulders even and your back pain-free. When carrying a heavy bag or case without straps, switch hands frequently to avoid putting all the stress on one side of the body. To lighten the load, periodically purge bags, cases, backpacks, and other carriers of things you don't need.\n\n【27】**16\\. Forget about back braces.** Various back supports are available, from elastic bands to special corsets. They can be helpful after certain kinds of surgery, but there is not much evidence that they help treat chronic back pain.\n\n【28】Workers who do a lot of heavy lifting are often required to wear lumbar support belts. There is also no proof that these belts prevent back injury. One study even found that these belts made injuries more likely", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:41", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:50", "cost": 9.552}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:40"}

Sometimes acanthosis nigricans is congenital (something a person is born with). It also can occur as a result of obesity or an endocrine (glandular) disorder. It is frequently found in obese people with diabetes or a tendency towards diabetes and is most common among people of African descent. There are many other possible causes of acanthosis nigricans, including:\n\n【3】Acanthosis nigricans. Also called Velvety plaques, this is a thickening of the outer layer of skin resulting in a discoloration of brown-to-black. They can develop in the folds of the armpit, groin and/or neck and can start showing up during childhood or adulthood. Seeing this condition suggests diabetes or simply obesity. In rare cases acanthosis nigricans occurring in other places, such the hands or lips, may indicate an internal malignancy.\n\n【4】*   Addison's disease, a condition caused by a deficiency of hormones from the adrenal gland\n*   Disorders of the pituitary gland within the brain\n*   Growth hormone therapy\n*   Hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone caused by decreased activity of the thyroid gland)\n*   Oral contraceptives\n\n【5】Most people with acanthosis nigricans have an insulin level that is higher than that of people of the same weight who don't have acanthosis nigricans. Eating too much of the wrong foods, especially starches and sugars, can raise insulin levels.\n\n【6】Rarely, people with certain types of cancer can also develop acanthosis nigricans.\n\n【7】How Is Acanthosis Nigricans Diagnosed?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【8】The condition can be diagnosed by a doctor through a medical history and physical exam.\n\n【9】How Is Acanthosis Nigricans Treated?\n------------------------------------\n\n【10】Eating a special diet can help reduce circulating insulin and may lead to some improvement of the acanthosis nigricans.\n\n【11】Other treatments to improve skin appearance include Retin-A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, topical vitamin D, and salicylic acid prescriptions. These are only minimally effective, however.\n\n【12】Acanthosis nigricans caused by a drug may go away once the medication is stopped.\n\n【13】Can Acanthosis Nigricans Be Prevented?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【14】When acanthosis nigricans is related to obesity, weight management is an important part of prevention. A diet that contributes to reduced insulin also can help prevent acanthosis nigricans.\n\n【15】Other preventive strategies include treating medical problems that are linked to acanthosis nigricans (such as hypothyroidism) and avoiding medications that tend to cause or worsen the condition (like birth control pills).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:06:48", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:06:53", "cost": 5.356}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:06:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:06:48"}

They help to prevent sunburn and premature aging (such as wrinkles , leathery skin ). Sunscreens also help to decrease the risk of skin cancer and also of sunburn-like skin reactions (sun sensitivity) caused by some medications (including tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine ).The active ingredients in sunscreens work either by absorbing the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation , preventing it from reaching the deeper layers of the skin , or by reflecting the radiation.Wearing sunscreen does not mean that you can stay out longer in the sun. Sunscreens cannot protect against all of the sun's radiation.There are various types of sunscreens available in many forms (such as cream, lotion, gel, stick, spray, lip balm). See the Notes section for information about selecting a sunscreen .\n\n【2】### How to use Total Block Lotion\n\n【3】Sunscreens are for use on the skin only. Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist .\n\n【4】Apply sunscreen generously to all exposed skin 30 minutes before sun exposure. As a general guide, use 1 ounce (30 grams) to cover your entire body. Reapply the sunscreen after swimming or sweating or drying off with a towel or if it has rubbed off. If you are outside for long periods, reapply sunscreen every 2 hours. If you are using the lip balm form, apply to the lip area only.\n\n【5】The spray form is flammable. If using the spray, avoid smoking when applying this medication and do not use or store it near heat or open flame.\n\n【6】When applying sunscreen to the face, be careful to avoid contact with the eyes . If the sunscreen gets in your eyes , rinse thoroughly with water.\n\n【7】Use cautiously or avoid use on irritated skin .\n\n【8】Do not use sunscreen on infants younger than 6 months unless the doctor directs you to do so. It is best for infants to stay out of the sun and wear protective clothing (such as hats, long sleeves/pants) when outdoors.\n\n【9】If you develop a serious sunburn , or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, get medical help right away.\n\n【10】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【11】Some sunscreen products (such as those containing aminobenzoic acid or para-aminobenzoic acid/PABA) may stain clothing.\n\n【12】Some ingredients of sunscreens can cause the skin to become more sensitive. If a sunscreen causes redness or irritation, wash it off and stop using it. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about using another sunscreen product with different ingredients.\n\n【13】If your doctor has directed you to use this medication , remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【14】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness , trouble breathing .\n\n【15】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【16】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【17】Before using a sunscreen , tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to any of its ingredients (such as aminobenzoic acid /PABA); or to some types of anesthetic drugs (such as benzocaine , tetracaine); or to sulfa drugs; or if you have any other allergies . This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\n【18】Interactions\n------------\n\n【19】Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. This document does not contain all possible drug interactions. Keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist .

If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing , call 911. Otherwise, call a poison control center right away. \n\n【25】Notes\n\n【26】The sun produces two types of ultraviolet (UV) radiation , UVA and UVB. UVA radiation causes skin damage, premature aging, and skin reactions to medications , soaps, cosmetics , and other chemicals. UVB radiation causes sunburn . Both UVA and UVB radiation increase your risk of skin cancer . Most sunscreens protect against UVB radiation, but you should use a sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection (broad-spectrum coverage). Products that protect against UVA include ingredients such as avobenzone, octocrylene, titanium dioxide , zinc oxide, and benzophenones such as oxybenzone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about selecting a product.\n\n【27】Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is a rating that tells how much protection a product provides against sunburn. The higher the number, the greater the protection. An SPF of at least 15 is recommended. Products with SPF 30 provide high protection against sunburn. The FDA states that products with SPF above 30 provide a benefit that is not much greater than SPF 30 products.\n\n【28】Water-resistant products provide protection for up to 40 minutes of water activity or sweating . Very water-resistant products protect for up to 80 minutes. Reapply sunscreen as often as necessary.\n\n【29】Remember that water, sand, and snow reflect the sun. You should protect yourself with sunscreen when in these surroundings. Apply sunscreen even on cloudy days because the sun's radiation is still present. In addition to sunscreen, wear protective clothing (such as hat, long sleeves/pants, sunglasses ) when outdoors, and stay in the shade when possible. Avoid prolonged sun exposure, especially between 10 AM to 4 PM when the sun's radiation is strongest.\n\n【30】Missed Dose\n\n【31】Apply sunscreens generously and often when outdoors.\n\n【32】Storage\n\n【33】Store at room temperature away from heat and light. Refer to the storage information printed on the package. Do not use a product after the expiration date on the container. If there is no expiration date, it is recommended that you replace sunscreens every year because over time they may lose the ability to protect you from the sun. If you have any questions about storage, ask your pharmacist . Keep all medications away from children and pets.\n\n【34】Do not flush medications down the toilet or pour them into a drain unless instructed to do so. Properly discard this product when it is expired or no longer needed. Consult your pharmacist or local waste disposal company.\n\n【35】Images\n------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:32:01", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:32:11", "cost": 9.866}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:58", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:32:11", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:32:01"}

It can permanently damage your body and can even be deadly.\n\n【2】People with bulimia will often eat large amounts of food, or binge, and then try to get rid of the calories in what is called a purge. This often involves vomiting, excessive exercising, or abuse of laxatives or diuretics. This cycle of behaviors can cause problems to all parts of your body.\n\n【3】Bulimia also affects your brain and is often linked to mental health problems like anxiety and depression.\n\n【4】But you can get help. There are many treatment options to stop the cycle of binging and purging. Just be sure to do them with the help of a doctor so that your recovery is safe.\n\n【5】The Physical Effects of Bulimia\n-------------------------------\n\n【6】The cycle of bingeing and purging takes a toll on your body. It can cause damage to everything from your heart and digestive system to your teeth and gums. It can create other problems as well, including:\n\n【7】*   **Dehydration.** Your body loses fluids when you throw up or overuse diuretics.\n*   **Electrolyte imbalances.** When you get very dehydrated, you lose electrolytes. These are chemicals such as sodium and potassium. They help your body keep the right amount of fluid in your blood vessels and organs. An electrolyte imbalance could lead to heart problems and even death.\n*   **Heart problems.** These can include a rapid, fluttering, or pounding heart (called palpitations) and an abnormal heart rhythm, which is called an arrhythmia.\n*   **Low blood pressure.** Your blood pressure might drop so low that you're at risk of fainting.\n*   **Trouble regulating body temperature.** When you don’t eat enough to fuel your body, your body temperature may drop. You might feel cold all the time.\n*   **Damage to your esophagus.** Forceful vomiting can cause tears in the lining of your esophagus, the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. If it tears, it can cause severe and life-threatening bleeding. This is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Bright red blood in your vomit is a symptom of this syndrome.\n*   **Burst esophagus.** Repeated forceful vomiting can also cause your esophagus to burst. This is called Boerhaave syndrome. It's an emergency and needs immediate surgery.\n*   **Acid reflux**. When the lower part of your esophagus gets damaged, stomach acid can come back up through it. That causes indigestion and heartburn.\n*   **Other digestive problems****.** Bulimia can permanently damage your stomach and intestines, causing other problems like constipation, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome.\n*   **Hormonal problems.** Reproductive issues, including irregular periods, missed periods, and fertility problems are common side effects when you have bulimia.\n*   **Diabetes connection.** If you have type 1 diabetes and an eating disorder, you may also have a condition that has been called diabulimia. The term describes people with diabetes who need insulin but deliberately take less than they're supposed to in an effort to lose weight. This can lead to serious health problems like stroke, coma, and death.\n*   **Tooth decay.** The stomach acid in vomit can damage tooth enamel, making your teeth sensitive to hot and cold.\n*   **Mouth problems**. Stomach acid can also discolor your teeth and cause gum disease. Throwing up from purging creates painful sores in the corners of your mouth and soreness in the throat. And bulimia can lead to enlarged salivary glands in your mouth.\n*   **Ipecac-induced myopathy, or muscle weakness.** While some people use their fingers to make themselves throw up, others may use ipecac syrup, which was once used to make people throw up when they had been poisoned. Drinking too much ipecac over time can cause permanent heart damage and even death.\n*   **\"Bulimia face.\"**Swollen salivary glands from too much throwing up can make your face and neck look puffy.\n*   **Hoarse voice.** When you vomit often, stomach acid may irritate your vocal cords and affect your voice.\n*   **Russell’s sign.** Regularly using your fingers to make yourself throw up can make the back of your finger joints discolored or callused. This skin condition is called Russell’s sign.\n*   **Hair, skin, and nail problems.** When you don't get enough nutrients, your hair, nails, and skin sometimes get dry. Your hair and nails may break off easily, and your hair can thin out. Vomiting might cause small broken veins on your face, red areas around your mouth, or a purple rash.\n*   **Pancreatitis.** This is an inflammation of the pancreas that can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting**.** Either malnutrition or purging can cause it**.**\n*   **Difficulties during pregnancy.** Bulimia raises your risk for having a miscarriage or a C-section. It also makes it more likely that your baby will be born prematurely, be small, or have a birth defect. And it increases the odds that you'll have depression after the baby is born.\n\n【8】The Mental and Emotional Effects of Bulimia\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Aside from the physical damage bulimia does to your body, it's also linked to mental health problems. Some of the issues that you could deal with include:\n\n【10】*   Anxiety\n*   Depression\n*   Low self-esteem\n*   Irritability\n*   Moodiness\n*   Self-harm (such as cutting)\n*   Obsessive-compulsive behaviors\n*   Guilt, shame, or embarrassment\n*   Drug or alcohol abuse\n*   Suicidal thoughts or actions\n\n【11】If you’re having any thoughts of harming yourself or committing suicide, call your doctor or 911 immediately. You can also call the free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. They are there to help you.\n\n【12】Recovery from bulimia can take a long time. But don’t let that stop you from getting help. If you're willing to seek treatment, there are many options that you, your family, and your doctor can discuss to create a plan that will work for you. Set goals, stick to your plan, and you can be on your way to overcoming this eating disorder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:56:05", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:57:49", "cost": 103.612}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:57:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:56:01"}

It is often referred to as the \"mini-pill\" because it does not contain any estrogen . Norethindrone (a form of progestin ) is a hormone that prevents pregnancy.While the \"mini-pill\" is more effective than certain other methods of birth control (such as condoms , cervical cap, diaphragm ), it is less effective than combination hormone ( estrogen and progestin ) birth control because it does not consistently prevent ovulation . It is usually used by women who cannot take estrogen. To reduce the risk of pregnancy, it is very important to take this medication exactly as prescribed.Using this medication does not protect you or your partner against sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV , gonorrhea , chlamydia ).\n\n【2】### How to use Errin\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start using this product and each time you get a refill.

If you begin taking it on any other day, use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms , spermicide ) for the first 48 hours to prevent pregnancy until the medication has enough time to work.\n\n【7】Continue taking one tablet every day. After taking the last tablet in a pack, start a new pack the next day. There is no break between packs, and you do not take any \"reminder\" tablets (tablets without medication). Your periods may be irregular, or heavier/lighter than usual. You may also have vaginal bleeding (spotting) between periods. Do not stop taking your pills if this happens.\n\n【8】Pregnancy is more likely if you miss pills, start a new pack late, or take your pill at a different time of the day than usual. If you miss a pill, or take it 3 or more hours later than usual, or have diarrhea , or vomit soon after taking a pill, use a back-up method of birth control (such as condoms , spermicide) every time you have sex for the next 48 hours.\n\n【9】Ask your doctor or pharmacist about how to switch from other forms of hormonal birth control (such as patch, other birth control pills ) to this product.

However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness , trouble breathing .\n\n【15】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【16】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【17】Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to norethindrone ; or to other progestins; or if you have any other allergies .

Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval.\n\n【25】A product that may interact with this drug is: fezolinetant.\n\n【26】Some drugs may cause hormonal birth control to work less well by decreasing the amount of birth control hormones in your body. This effect can result in pregnancy. Examples include griseofulvin , modafinil , rifamycins (such as rifampin , rifabutin ), ritonavir , St. John's wort, drugs used to treat seizures (such as barbiturates , carbamazepine , felbamate , phenytoin, primidone , topiramate ), HIV drugs (such as nelfinavir, nevirapine ), among others.\n\n【27】Tell your doctor when you start any new drug, and discuss if you should use additional reliable birth control. Also tell your doctor if you have any new spotting or breakthrough bleeding, because these may be signs that your birth control is not working well.\n\n【28】This medication may interfere with certain lab tests (such as sex hormone \\-binding globulin, thyroid ), possibly causing false test results. Make sure lab personnel and all your doctors know you use this drug.\n\n【29】Does Errin interact with other drugs you are taking?\n\n【30】Enter your medication into the WebMD interaction checker\n\n【31】Check Interaction\n\n【32】Overdose\n--------\n\n【33】If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing , call 911.

Consult your doctor for more details.\n\n【37】Missed Dose\n\n【38】Refer to the product package information for advice on missed doses. You may need to use back-up birth control (such as condoms , spermicide ) to prevent pregnancy. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.\n\n【39】If you often forget to take your pills as directed, contact your doctor to discuss switching to another form of birth control.\n\n【40】Storage\n\n【41】Store at room temperature away from light and moisture.

If the openings remain open, the clogs take the form of blackheads: small, flat spots with dark centers. If the openings are closed, the clogs take the form of whiteheads: small, flesh-colored bumps. Both types of plugged pores can develop into swollen, tender inflammations or pimples or deeper lumps or nodules. Nodules associated with severe cases of acne (cystic acne) are firm swellings below the skin's surface that become inflamed, tender, and sometimes infected.\n\n【3】Although acne remains largely a curse of adolescence, about 20% of all cases occur in adults. Acne commonly starts during puberty between the ages of 10 and 13 and tends to be worse in people with oily skin. Teenage acne usually lasts for five to 10 years, normally going away during the early 20s. It occurs in both sexes, although teenage boys tend to have the most severe cases. Women are more likely than men to have mild to moderate forms into their 30s and beyond.\n\n【4】Acne lesions are most common on the face, but they can also occur on the neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms.\n\n【5】Contrary to popular belief, acne isn't caused by a harmful diet, poor hygiene, or an uncontrolled sex drive. The simple truth is that heredity and hormones are behind most forms of acne. Swearing off chocolate or scrubbing your face 10 times a day won't change your predisposition to this unsightly, sometimes painful, and often embarrassing skin problem.\n\n【6】While acne usually pops up for teenagers, it is not uncommon in adults either with about 20% of cases occurring in adulthood. Photo credit: Moment/Getty Images\n\n【7】What Causes Acne?\n-----------------\n\n【8】The cause of acne is not fully understood. Though stress can aggravate acne, it clearly does not cause it.\n\n【9】**Hormones.** Common acne in teenagers starts with an increase in hormone production. During puberty, both boys and girls produce high levels of androgens, the male sex hormones that include testosterone. Testosterone signals the body to make more sebum, the oil produced in the skin's oil glands.\n\n【10】**Bacteria.** Excess sebum clogs the openings to hair follicles -- especially those on the face, neck, chest, and back. Bacteria grow in these clogged follicles. This makes blackheads or whiteheads, also known as ''comedones,'' form on the skin's surface. Sometimes, this clogging causes the follicle wall to break under the pressure of this buildup. When this happens, sebum leaks into nearby tissues and forms a pustule or a papule -- this is called inflammatory acne. Larger, tender pustules are called nodules.\n\n【11】Depending on the type of pill, oral contraceptives may trigger acne in some women but suppress it in others. Some injectable contraceptives and intrauterine birth control devices (IUD) may also cause acne. Steroids taken by some bodybuilders and other athletes can also lead to severe outbreaks.\n\n【12】Other triggers for acne may include stress, smoking, drugs, cosmetic products such as moisturizers, and seasonal factors. \n\n【13】Acne has many subtypes. Acne neonatorum and acne infantum occasionally affect newborns and infants, usually boys. A pimply rash appears on the face and usually clears within weeks with no lasting effect. However, acne infantum may last longer, be more severe, and cause scarring.\n\n【14】People who escaped their teen years almost pimple-free may develop persistent adult-onset acne as they get older. Despite the normal increase in androgen levels during puberty, some doctors believe that flare-ups of acne have less to do with androgen levels than with how a person's skin responds to an increase in sebum production or to the bacteria that causes acne. The bacteria _Propionibacterium acnes_ occurs naturally in healthy hair follicles. If too many of them accumulate in plugged follicles, they may secrete enzymes that break down sebum and cause inflammation. Some people are simply more sensitive than others to this reaction. Sebum levels that might cause a pimple or two in one person may result in widespread outbreaks -- or even acute cystic acne -- in another person.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:49:02", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:49:08", "cost": 6.363}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:49:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:49:02"}

This reaction is most likely to occur within 3 hours after an injection. Your doctor may decrease your insulin dose when you start pramlintide. Low blood sugar makes it hard to think clearly, drive a car, use heavy machinery, or safely participate in other activities that include a risk of hurting yourself or others. 删除6:<u>(See also Side Effects and Precautions sections.</u>\n\n【2】How to use Pramlintide Pen Injector\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start using pramlintide and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, consult your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Inject this medication under the skin of the thigh or abdomen just before each main meal. Do not use pramlintide if your blood sugar is too low, if you are planning to eat a small meal (less than 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate ), or if you are skipping a meal.\n\n【5】The liquid in the pre-filled injector is stronger than the liquid in the vial. Make sure you are using the correct product. Do not switch between products unless directed by your doctor.\n\n【6】Make sure you learn from your health care professional how to measure your dose and inject this drug. Always use a new needle for each injection. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. If you are storing this drug in the refrigerator, remove it and allow it to come to room temperature before injecting. Before using, check this product visually for particles or discoloration. If either is present, do not use the liquid. Before injecting each dose, clean the injection site with rubbing alcohol. It is important to change the location of the injection site daily to avoid problems under the skin . Never mix pramlintide and insulin in the same syringe or at the same injection site. Inject pramlintide in an area that is at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) away from your insulin injection site.\n\n【7】Your dosage is based on your medical condition, use of other medications , and response to treatment. To reduce the risk of nausea , your doctor may direct you to start at a low dose of pramlintide and gradually increase the dose. Your doctor may also direct you to lower your insulin dose and to check you blood sugar more often. Do not change your dosage without consulting your doctor. Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it.\n\n【8】Do not share your pen device with another person, even if the needle is changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Learn how to store and discard medical supplies safely.\n\n【9】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【10】Nausea , vomiting , tiredness, and upset stomach may occur as your body adjusts to the medication . Nausea can be reduced by starting at a low dose and increasing the dose slowly. Redness, swelling and itching at the injection site may occur and usually go away in a few days. If any of these effects last or get worse, contact your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【11】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【12】Though pramlintide does not cause low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) by itself, this effect can occur because it is used with insulin . This may also occur if you do not consume enough calories from food or if you do unusually heavy exercise . Symptoms of low blood sugar include sudden sweating , shaking, fast heartbeat, hunger , blurred vision , dizziness , or tingling hands/feet. It is a good habit to carry glucose tablets or gel to treat low blood sugar . If you don't have these reliable forms of glucose, rapidly raise your blood sugar by eating a quick source of sugar such as table sugar, honey, or candy, or drink fruit juice or non-diet soda. Tell your doctor right away about the reaction and the use of this product. To help prevent low blood sugar , eat meals on a regular schedule, and do not skip meals. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to find out what you should do if you miss a meal.\n\n【13】Symptoms of high blood sugar ( hyperglycemia ) include thirst, increased urination, confusion, drowsiness, flushing, rapid breathing, and fruity breath odor. If these symptoms occur, tell your doctor right away. Your dosage may need to be increased.\n\n【14】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing .\n\n【15】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【16】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【17】Before using pramlintide, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or if you have any other allergies . This product may contain inactive ingredients (such as the preservative metacresol), which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\n【18】Before using pramlintide, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: stomach /intestinal disorders (for example, digestion problems such as gastroparesis ), attacks of low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) that required treatment.\n\n【19】You may experience blurred vision , dizziness , or drowsiness due to extremely low or high blood sugar . Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires alertness or clear vision until you are sure you can perform such activities safely. Limit alcoholic beverages because alcohol can affect your blood sugar .\n\n【20】It may be harder to control your blood sugar when your body is stressed (such as due to fever, infection, injury, or surgery). Consult your doctor because this may require a change in your treatment plan, medications , or blood sugar testing.\n\n【21】During pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.\n\n【22】It is unknown if pramlintide passes into breast milk. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.\n\n【23】Consult your pharmacist or physician.\n\n【24】Interactions\n------------\n\n【25】Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects.

Affected products include antibiotics , birth control pills , pain relievers (such as acetaminophen ), among others. If you are using any of the those drugs, use them at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after your injection. If you have any questions about when to take your other medications, ask your pharmacist.\n\n【28】If you are using a medication that needs to be taken with food, take it with a small meal or snack (less than 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate ) at a time when you do not normally inject pramlintide.\n\n【29】Beta blocker medications (such as metoprolol , propranolol , glaucoma eye drops such as timolol ) may prevent the fast/pounding heartbeat you would usually feel when your blood sugar falls too low ( hypoglycemia ). Other symptoms of low blood sugar such as dizziness , hunger , or sweating are unaffected by these drugs.\n\n【30】Many drugs can affect your blood sugar , making it harder to control. Before you start, stop, or change any medication, talk with your doctor or pharmacist about how the medication may affect your blood sugar.

When you light them, they give out a warm, reddish-pink glow.\n\n【2】Sellers of these decorative pieces say they do more than light up a room. They claim the lamps can boost mood, improve sleep, ease allergies, help people with asthma breathe better, and clean the air, among other benefits.\n\n【3】The claims sound impressive. Yet the scientific evidence to back them up is scarce.\n\n【4】The salt in these lamps comes from the Himalayas, a mountain range that stretches about 1,500 miles across Pakistan, India, Bhutan, and Nepal.\n\n【5】True Himalayan salt lamps come from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan. The salt this mine produces has a reddish, pink, or off-white color.\n\n【6】There are plenty of fake ones sold online. The real versions are fragile and give off a dim light. The phony products are tough to break and glow brightly.\n\n【7】How Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Work?\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】Advocates say the lamps work in two ways:\n\n【9】**Pull in particles.** These lamps supposedly attract allergens, toxins, and pollutants to their surface.\n\n【10】**Possibly release negative ions.** Some people believe negative ions in the air have health benefits.\n\n【11】Ions are molecules that have undergone a change in charge. Negative ions have gained an electron. Positive ions have lost one.\n\n【12】Ions are all around us. Some come from particles from outer space that make their way to Earth. Others form closer to home, from radiation, sunlight, lightning, or the collision of water droplets in a waterfall.\n\n【13】Some people say they feel more refreshed and clear-headed after a storm, a feeling they believe is due to the amount of negative ions in the air. Commercial ionizers and purification systems also produce negatively charged ions to create cleaner and more comfortable indoor spaces.\n\n【14】Himalayan salt lamps supposedly produce negatively charged ions while water molecules from the air attract to -- and then evaporate from -- the warmth of its surface. Those who believe in the health benefits of these lamps give negative ions much of the credit.\n\n【15】Claims About Himalayan Salt Lamps\n---------------------------------\n\n【16】Although a few studies show some benefits from negative ions, the evidence that salt lamps improve health is lacking.\n\n【17】**Mood and** **sleep.** Some people believe that positive ions in the air increase anxiety, crankiness, and other unpleasant feelings. They say that negative ones ease stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve overall well-being.\n\n【18】Studies with mice and rats suggest that high amounts of negative air ions alter levels of serotonin, a chemical that contributes to feelings of well-being.\n\n【19】In some human studies, negative ions at high concentrations did lessen depression slightly, but they didn't have much of an effect on anxiety levels or sleep.\n\n【20】A very small study shows that people did better on thinking skills tests when they were in a room where the paint on the walls had a high concentration of total air ions (both positive and negative ions). But the paint had no effect on their general well-being.\n\n【21】**Asthma and allergies.** The notion that negative ions may improve breathing has led to a few studies on the topic. In most of them, negative ions didn't ease breathing or asthma symptoms. They also didn't lower inhaler use in children and adults with chronic asthma.\n\n【22】**Cleaning the air.** Negative ions do have some ability to clean harmful particles from the air. When ions build up on bacteria or pollen, they neutralize the pollutants. Studies suggest that negative and positive ions may kill germs, though exactly how isn't clear, and some experts say the germ-killing may be due to other reasons. In any case, there's no evidence salt lamps have this effect.\n\n【23】Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Have Health Benefits?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Though the claims sound promising, so far no one has proved that Himalayan salt lamps release negative ions, let alone enough to have any impact on health. Most of the research so far has used negative ions from other sources, not lamps.\n\n【25】In a couple of small studies on rats and mice, contact with a salt lamp had antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects. That doesn't mean the lamps would have the same effect on humans. Researchers would have to test the theory.\n\n【26】Though a small amount of pollutants in the air might stick to salt rock, these rocks don't have anywhere near the filtering ability of, say, charcoal, a common component of air filters.\n\n【27】A Himalayan salt lamp might bring a nice decorative touch and a warming glow to your space, but there's no research right now that says it will improve your health in a big way.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:30:48", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:30:54", "cost": 5.963}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:30:55", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:30:48"}

What Causes It?", "text": "【0】What Is Croup? What Causes It?\nCroup is a condition that irritates your baby’s upper airways and causes them to swell. As the airway below their vocal cords becomes narrow, your child will find it hard to breathe. Their breathing will be noisy and they’ll have a cough that sounds a lot like a high-pitched seal or dog bark. Their voice will also sound raspy and hoarse, especially when they cry.\n\n【1】Most often, croup is caused by an infection. There are two types of this condition -- viral and spasmodic. It’s also called laryngotracheobronchitis.\n\n【2】Croup Causes and Risk Factors\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Croup is more common in the fall and early winter. It’s more common in boys than in girls. Babies and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most at risk. The condition is contagious, especially in the first few days or until your child’s fever is gone.\n\n【4】Viral croup is caused by any virus that infects the voice box (also called the larynx) and windpipe (the trachea). The virus that most often causes croup is parainfluenza. The symptoms are mild at first but get worse.\n\n【5】Spasmodic croup is rare. It comes on suddenly, often in the middle of the night. Doctors believe it may be caused by an allergy or reflux from the stomach. That happens when contents from your baby’s stomach move back up into their esophagus.\n\n【6】Other things can also cause a cough that sounds like croup. Your child may have breathed in something with fine particles, like powder or flour. A food allergy can cause their throat to swell closed. If you suspect a food allergy, call 911 right away. Other infections, including epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis, have similar symptoms.\n\n【7】Croup Symptoms\n--------------\n\n【8】Croup might start out like a cold. But over time, your child will develop a “barky” cough. They also may make a high-pitched, wheezing sound in their lower airway when they breathe in. The croup sound in the upper airway is a harsh, loud sound known as “stridor.” There can be a low fever too.\n\n【9】Symptoms tend to be worse at night. Your baby might also have redness around their eyes, swollen lymph nodes, or a rash.\n\n【10】Any time your child has trouble breathing, retractions (when their skin pulls tight around their ribs), or stridor at rest, immediately call your doctor or 911. Stridor when crying, agitated, or playing, or a barky cough is not an emergency. But if you have any concerns, go ahead and call your baby’s doctor.\n\n【11】Croup Diagnosis\n---------------\n\n【12】A doctor can usually diagnose croup by examining your child and listening to their symptoms. But they may need tests to rule out other causes. Your child’s doctor may:\n\n【13】*   Listen to their breathing\n*   Look inside their throat\n*   Ask about any recent illnesses or breathing problems\n*   Take an X-ray to check for something stuck in their throat\n*   Test their blood oxygen level\n\n【14】Croup Treatment\n---------------\n\n【15】Most of the time, cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Try to soothe your child and keep them calm. Crying can make the coughing worse. Hold them upright.\n\n【16】Make sure your child has plenty to drink. Try over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to treat a fever.\n\n【17】It might make them feel better to breathe steam or cool mist.\n\n【18】Call the doctor if your child:\n\n【19】*   Looks sick\n*   Has trouble breathing\n*   Isn’t speaking or drinking\n*   Has noisy breathing even when not agitated\n\n【20】If they have to see the doctor, they may get a breathing treatment or a dose of steroids to bring down swelling in their throat and keep their airway open.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:04:10", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:04:27", "cost": 17.314}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:04:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:04:10"}

These treatments won't cure your ulcerative colitis, unless you have surgery that removes the colon and rectum, which is considered curative, but they can help ease your symptoms.\n\n【2】It's important to get treated for ulcerative colitis as soon as you start having symptoms. If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration, reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition.\n\n【3】Medications for Ulcerative Colitis\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics.\n\n【5】*   **5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).**Balsalazide, mesalamine, olsalazine, and sulfasalazine are the main medications used to treat ulcerative colitis. They come in pills and suppositories. Let your doctor know if you are allergic to sulfa before taking one of these drugs. They can prescribe a sulfa-free 5-ASA.\n*   **Corticosteroids.** These anti-inflammatory drugs can be used if 5-ASA drugs don't work for you or if you have a more severe disease. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5-ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period.\n*   **Immunosuppressants.** If corticosteroids or 5-ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus (Astagraf XL, Envarsus XR, Prograf).\n*   **Biologics.** This group of drugs includes adalimumab (Humira), plus adalimumab-atto (Amjevita) and adalimumab\\-adbm (Cyltezo), which are biosimilars to Humira; certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), golimumab (Simponi, Simponi Aria), infliximab (Remicade), infliximab-abda (Renflexis), infliximab-axxq (Avsola), infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade, infliximab-qbtx (IXIFI), ustekinumab (Stelara), and vedolizumab (Entyvio).\n*   **Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK inhibitors)**. These are oral medicines that can work quickly to get and maintain a remission in ulcerative colitis. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) is the first JAK inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.\n*   **Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators**. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral medication and is the first  sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator approved for patients with moderately to severely active UC.\n\n【6】Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators. These can be taken by mouth. Researchers think they may get around the anti-drug antibodies that sometimes form with medications given as a shot. Antibodies are proteins that cancel out viruses, bacteria, and other things your body doesn’t recognize.\n\n【7】Diet Changes for Ulcerative Colitis\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】While food doesn't appear to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, certain foods may cause more symptoms when your disease is active. Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. They may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements.\n\n【9】DID YOU KNOW\n\n【10】Newer medications being studied include a group called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators.\n\n【11】Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis\n------------------------------\n\n【12】Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications.\n\n【13】When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. They attach a bag there and bring the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time.\n\n【14】A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus.\n\n【15】A procedure called a continent ileostomy (Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation.\n\n【16】In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. Your surgeon removes your colon and rectum and creates an internal reservoir from your small intestine. They make an opening in your belly wall and join the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. To drain the pouch, you insert a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir.\n\n【17】Other techniques are also available. All surgeries carry some risk and complications. If you have been told you need surgery to treat ulcerative colitis, you may want to get a second opinion to make sure you get the best option for you.\n\n【18】When Should I Call My Doctor About Ulcerative Colitis?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Call your doctor right away if you have:\n\n【20】*   Heavy, persistent diarrhea\n*   Rectal bleeding with clots of blood in your stool\n*   Constant pain and a high fever\n\n【21】Complementary Treatments and Therapies\n--------------------------------------\n\n【22】You may consider these approaches in addition to what your doctor prescribes. But it’s important to talk to your medical team about any and all of them because some, like supplements, can interfere with treatments from your doctor. Let’s take a look at a few:\n\n【23】**Mind-body therapies:**Stress and anxiety are well-known triggers for many people with ulcerative colitis, so it is not surprising that mind-body relaxation techniques could help. These techniques help nurture a healthy connection between your mind and body as well as between you and the outside world. In some cases, they encourage behavior changes in your everyday life. They may be worthwhile if only to lessen anxiety and depression linked to UC and improve quality of life. In addition, there is some evidence that yoga, meditation, and gut-centered hypnotherapy could help with some physical symptoms or flare-ups of UC. Some of the techniques, like cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of psychotherapy) and patient support groups, have been so successful that they have slowly become a part of mainstream treatment for IBD.\n\n【24】**Vitamins and supplements:** Many people with ulcerative colitis may not absorb enough of some vitamins or minerals from food because of their disease. In these cases, your doctor may suggest taking certain supplements. Still, it’s important to speak with your doctor before you decide to take any on your own. Many of these substances can be unsafe, particularly if you have UC and you’re taking other medicines. Some people also take certain supplements in the belief that they help control UC symptoms. These might include:\n\n【25】*   Fish oil: In foods, the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, walnuts, flaxseed, and vegetable oils are good for your health. They lessen inflammation and help protect the heart, among other benefits. Some people with UC take omega-3 supplements in the form of fish oil capsules to lessen gut inflammation. Research has so far been unclear on whether this works. Too much fish oil may be bad for you and could be dangerous if you take it with blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin).\n*   Turmeric: This spice, commonly used in Indian and South Asian cooking, has a chemical called curcumin that may help lessen inflammation in some people. Some small studies show that it could help with UC flare-ups in capsule form, but scientists need to do more research to be sure of these results. Also, many of the studies used very pure curcumin compounds that may not be available in retail brands. Curcumin can also have side effects that include bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. It also thins the blood and has not been tested for safety in pregnant women.\n*   Probiotics: These are “good” bacteria found in many foods that add to the healthy balance of bacteria in your gut. In supplement form, some studies suggest they could help bring a UC flare-up to an end and keep it there, especially if you have a pouch (from J-pouch surgery) that is inflamed. Still, it’s important to take care. There are a wide variety of probiotic products on the market, and much more study is needed.\n\n【26】Keep in mind that the FDA doesn't regulate supplements, so claims on packaging may not be accurate. That’s yet another reason why it’s important to talk to your doctor before you start taking any supplements for your UC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:59:46", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:59:52", "cost": 5.648}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:59:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:59:42"}

You might want to know what symptoms you might have, when they’ll start, and how they’ll affect your life.\n\n【1】These are basic questions. But Parkinson’s is not a basic disease. It doesn’t move in a straight line, and it’s hard to pin down exactly how it’ll progress.\n\n【2】What Makes PD Hard to Predict\n-----------------------------\n\n【3】Parkinson’s comes with two main buckets of possible symptoms. One affects your ability to move and leads to motor issues like tremors and rigid muscles. The other bucket has non-motor symptoms, like pain, loss of smell, and dementia.\n\n【4】You may not get all the symptoms. And you can’t predict how bad they’ll be, or how fast they’ll get worse. One person may have slight tremors but severe dementia. Another might have major tremors but no issues with thinking or memory. And someone else may have severe symptoms all around.\n\n【5】On top of that, the drugs that treat Parkinson’s work better for some people than others. All that adds up to a disease that’s very hard to predict.\n\n【6】What You Can Expect\n-------------------\n\n【7】Parkinson does follow a broad pattern. While it moves at different paces for different people, changes tend to come on slowly. Symptoms usually get worse over time, and new ones probably will pop up along the way.\n\n【8】Parkinson’s doesn’t always affect how long you live. But it can change your quality of life in a major way. After about 10 years, most people will have at least one major issue, like dementia or a physical disability.\n\n【9】Motor Symptoms\n--------------\n\n【10】You might break these into mild, moderate, and advanced stages. But any stage can have lots of gray areas. A tremor in your right arm may sound mild, but if you’re right-handed and it’s severe, it can affect your quality of life.\n\n【11】**Mild stage.** Symptoms are a bother, but they usually don’t stop you from doing most tasks. And drugs usually work well to keep them in check.\n\n【12】You might notice:\n\n【13】*   Your arms don’t swing as freely when you walk\n*   You can’t make facial expressions\n*   Your legs feel heavy\n*   Posture becomes a little stooped\n*   Handwriting gets smaller\n*   Your arms or legs get stiff\n*   You have symptoms only on one side of your body, like a tremor in one arm\n\n【14】**Moderate stage.** Often within 3 to 7 years, you’ll see more changes. Early on, you might have a little trouble with something like buttoning a shirt. At this point, you may not be able to do it at all.\n\n【15】You might also find that the medicine you take starts to wear off between doses.\n\n【16】You can expect:\n\n【17】*   Changes in how you speak, like a softer voice or one that starts strong, but trails off\n*   Freezing when you first start to walk or change direction, as if your feet are glued to the ground\n*   Trouble swallowing\n*   Falls to be more likely\n*   Trouble with balance and coordination\n*   Slower movements\n*   Small, shuffling steps\n\n【18】**Advanced stage.** Some people never reach this stage. This is when medication doesn’t help as much and serious disabilities set in.\n\n【19】At this point, you likely:\n\n【20】*   Are limited to bed or a wheelchair\n*   Can’t live on your own\n*   Have severe posture issues in your neck, back, and hips\n*   Need help with daily tasks\n\n【21】Non-Motor Symptoms\n------------------\n\n【22】Almost everyone with Parkinson’s gets at least one of these. When severe, they’re more likely than motor issues to lead to a disability or make you move into a nursing home. These symptoms can show up almost any time, but they follow a general trend.\n\n【23】**What may show up early.** You may have these issues years before any classic motor symptoms like tremors:\n\n【24】*   Constipation\n*   Depression\n*   Loss of smell\n*   Low blood pressure when you stand up\n*   Pain\n*   Sleep issues\n\n【25】You also might get these symptoms later in the disease. And even if you have them, it doesn’t mean you have Parkinson’s. Scientists are still trying to understand the link.\n\n【26】You might also have mild issues with thinking and planning, like forgetfulness, a shorter attention span, and a hard time staying organized. Drooling and a more urgent need to pee are also common.\n\n【27】**What may show up later.** Dementia and psychosis are two serious mental health issues that usually take a while to show up. Psychosis is a serious condition where you see or hear things that aren’t there, or believe in things that aren’t based in reality. Dementia means you can no longer think, remember, and reason well enough to carry on your normal life.\n\n【28】As you age, you’re more likely to have both conditions the longer you have Parkinson’s.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:41:11", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:47:48", "cost": 396.847}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:47:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:41:10"}

The five types are:   \n\n【2】*   Ischemic stroke\n\n【3】*   Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n【4】*   Transient ischemic attack (mini-stroke)\n\n【5】*   Brain stem stroke\n\n【6】*   Cryptogenic stroke (stroke of unknown cause)\n\n【7】**What are the warning signs for a stroke?**\n\n【8】Think of the word F-A-S-T to help you spot stroke signs and know when to call 911 for yourself or someone else:\n\n【9】*   **Face drooping:** One side of the face droops or is numb. Your smile is uneven or lopsided.\n\n【10】*   **Arm weakness:** One arm is weak or numb. One arm drifts downward when you try to raise both arms.\n\n【11】*   **Speech difficulty:** Speech is slurred. You're unable to speak or hard to understand.\n\n【12】*   **Time to call 911:** If you have any of these signs, even if they go away, call 911 and get to a hospital immediately.\n\n【13】Ischemic Stroke\n---------------\n\n【14】An ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel supplying blood to your brain gets blocked by a blood clot. Most strokes are this type. \n\n【15】**Symptoms of ischemic stroke**\n\n【16】The symptoms depend on which parts of your brain are affected. They can include things like:\n\n【17】*   Sudden numbness or weakness of your face, arm, or leg, often on one side of the body\n*   Confusion\n*   Problems speaking or understanding others\n*   Dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking\n*   Vision loss or double vision\n\n【18】**Causes of ischemic stroke**\n\n【19】A fatty substance called plaque collects in your arteries and narrows them. This process is called atherosclerosis, and it slows the flow of blood. Plaque breaks off and lots of cells come to the rescue causing a clot and blocking blood flow through the artery.\n\n【20】Besides atherosclerosis, other things that can raise your chances of getting an ischemic stroke are:\n\n【21】*   Atrial fibrillation\n*   Heart attack\n*   Problem with your heart's valves\n*   Injury to blood vessels in your neck\n*   Blood clotting problem\n\n【22】**Types of ischemic stroke**\n\n【23】There are two main types of ischemic stroke:\n\n【24】*   **Thrombotic strokes**. They're caused by a blood clot that forms in an artery that supplies blood to your brain, also called an atherosclerotic stroke.\n\n【25】*   **Embolic strokes.** They happen when a clot forms somewhere else in your body and travels through the blood vessels to your brain. It gets stuck there and stops the flow of your blood. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clots forming in the heart that can then travels to the brain.\n\n【26】**Risk factors of ischemic stroke**\n\n【27】You're more likely to have an ischemic stroke if you:\n\n【28】*   Are over age 60\n*   Have high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, or diabetes\n*   Have an irregular heartbeat\n*   Smoke\n*   Have a family history of strokes\n\n【29】**Complications of ischemic stroke**\n\n【30】Sometimes you can get complications. A stroke damages your brain cells. The more damage that's done, the more problems you can have. That's why it's important to get medical help as soon as possible because there's a limited time for treating an acute stroke. If you don't get treatment, you could have trouble like:\n\n【31】*   Permanent weakness or numbness or garbled speech\n*   Seizures\n*   Problems with memory and understanding\n\n【32】Transient Ischemic Attack or Mini-Stroke\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Ischemic strokes also include something called a \"mini-stroke\" or a TIA (transient ischemic attack). This is a temporary blockage in blood flow to your brain. The symptoms usually last for just a few minutes or may go away in 24 hours.\n\n【34】**Symptoms of TIA**\n\n【35】The symptoms may be similar to an ischemic stroke. You might have:\n\n【36】*   Numbness/weakness on one side of your body\n*   Confusion\n*   Dizziness or loss of balance\n*   Trouble talking or understanding\n*   Problems with your vision\n*   Severe headaches\n\n【37】Causes and risk factors of TIA are the same as in an ischemic stroke. A TIA can sometimes be a warning sign that you'll have an ischemic stroke soon.\n\n【38】Don't take chances if you or someone you know has any symptoms that seem like a stroke. Get medical help in a hurry.\n\n【39】Hemorrhagic Stroke\n------------------\n\n【40】These happen when bleeding in your brain damages nearby cells. \n\n【41】**Causes and risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke**\n\n【42】The common factors are:\n\n【43】*   You are over age 65\n*   Have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes that isn’t under control\n*   Are obese\n*   Have had a stroke in the past\n*   Have a family history of strokes\n*   Smoke\n*   Eat unhealthy foods\n*   Don;t exercise\n*   Have been Injured\n*   Have a bleeding disorder\n*   Use cocaine\n*   Have abnormal blood vessels (AVMs)\n*   Have an aneurysm (a weak area in a blood vessel that breaks open)\n\n【44】There are two types of hemorrhagic stroke. Which kind you have is based on where the bleeding happens. \n\n【45】*   Subarachnoid hemorrhage means it happened in the area between your brain and skull. \n*   Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding inside the brain.\n\n【46】**Symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke**\n\n【47】Hemorrhagic stroke symptoms usually increase gradually over minutes or a few hours, although a subarachnoid hemorrhage may come on suddenly. You might notice:\n\n【48】*   Intense headache -- some people describe it as the worst headache they've ever had\n*   Confusion\n*   Nausea or throwing up\n*   Sensitivity to light\n*   Problems with vision\n*   Passing out\n\n【49】**Complications of hemorrhagic stroke**\n\n【50】A hemorrhagic stroke can cause complications like:\n\n【51】*   Seizures\n*   Memory and thinking problems\n*   Heart problems\n*   Swallowing problems and trouble eating and drinking\n*   Permanent neurologic disability\n\n【52】Brain Stem Stroke\n-----------------\n\n【53】This type happens in your brain stem. It can affect both sides of the body. If this happens, you’re left in a “locked in” state where you’re unable to speak or move below the neck.\n\n【54】**Symptoms of brain stem stroke**\n\n【55】It can be hard to recognize when someone is having a brain stem stroke. They may have some symptoms without the hallmark sign of weakness on one side of the body. Symptoms of brain stem stroke include:\n\n【56】*   Vertigo, dizziness and loss of balance\n*   Nausea and/or vomiting\n*   Double vision\n*   Slurred speech\n*   Passing out\n*   Trouble with central nervous system functions like blood pressure and breathing\n*   “Locked in” syndrome -- you can only move your eyes\n\n【57】**Causes and risk factors of brain stem stroke**\n\n【58】Causes include:\n\n【59】*   Blood clots\n*   Hemorrhages\n*   Injury to an artery due to sudden head or neck movements (these are rare)\n\n【60】Risk factors include:\n\n【61】*   Smoking\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Diabetes\n*   Atrial fibrillation\n*   Heart Disease\n\n【62】What makes this stroke unique is the location. It's in a very tight small spot that controls vital functions so the consequences are often devastating, including high risk of death.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:41:12", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:41:26", "cost": 14.154}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:41:26", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:41:12"}

It is also used to treat high levels of iron in people with a certain blood disorder who do not require blood transfusions (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia). It works by binding to iron, allowing the body to pass extra iron out in the stool. Deferasirox belongs to a class of drugs known as iron-chelating agents.Frequent blood transfusions are often needed in certain types of blood diseases (such as sickle cell disease , anemia ). Blood transfusions have very helpful benefits, but they can cause the body to hold on to too much iron. The extra iron can build up in the body and cause problems such as heart failure , liver disease , and diabetes . Getting rid of extra iron can decrease the risk of these diseases.\n\n【8】### How to use Exjade\n\n【9】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking deferasirox and each time you get a refill.

These are under your tongue and on each side of your jaw below the jawbone. But it also can occur in other parts of your mouth and throat or other areas of your body, such as your sweat glands or tear glands.\n\n【1】Of the 1.9 million people who get cancer each year in the U.S. about 1,300 of them have adenoid cystic carcinoma. It affects more women than men, and it can happen at any age typically between your teens and your 80s.\n\n【2】It tends to grow slowly, so it sometimes can spread to other parts of your body before you notice any symptoms. It can come back in places where it's been treated before or spread to your lungs, liver, or bones, where it's more serious.\n\n【3】Doctors don't know what causes adenoid cystic carcinoma. It may be linked to some carcinogens, like pollution or asbestos.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The first sign may be a lump inside your mouth under your tongue or inside your cheek. These lumps usually grow slowly and don't hurt. You might have some trouble swallowing, or your voice might sound hoarse.\n\n【6】This type of cancer can spread along nerves, so you might have some pain or numbness in your face. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【8】If your doctor thinks you might have adenoid cystic carcinoma, the first step is often a biopsy. They'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer.\n\n【9】These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster.\n\n【10】Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests:\n\n【11】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images.\n*   CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information.\n*   PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images.\n\n【12】Treatment\n---------\n\n【13】The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments.\n\n【14】When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. They'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor.\n\n【15】Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them.\n\n【16】Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area.\n\n【17】Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed.\n\n【18】If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if they're worried the cancer has spread somewhere they haven't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds:\n\n【19】*   External beam radiation focuses high-energy X-rays or protons on cancer cells to destroy them. Your doctor will try to do as little damage as possible to the surrounding parts of your body.\n*   Internal radiation therapy is also known as brachytherapy. Your doctor will put small radioactive \"seeds\" at or near the tumor. This is often used when cancer has spread to the lungs. The radioactivity of the seeds lessens after a few weeks.\n*   Neutron therapy can target small tumors by heating up the cells with 100 times more energy than regular radiation treatment. That often kills cancer cells while letting the normal cells around them recover.\n\n【20】Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth. Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what they can do to help you with them.\n\n【21】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【22】It can be hard to get rid of the cancer entirely. Tumors may come back years later, either in the same place or, more likely, somewhere else -- usually in your lungs. Almost 90% of people who have adenoid cystic carcinoma live at least 5 years after their diagnosis.\n\n【23】After your treatment, you'll need regular checkups to look for signs of new tumors. This can involve X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, depending on your diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:13:11", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:14:32", "cost": 80.578}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:14:32", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:13:11"}

They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth, nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form.\n\n【2】Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications.\n\n【3】Types of Autoimmune Blistering Disorders\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】Autoimmune blistering disorders are broken down into different types. These are some of the main ones:\n\n【5】**Pemphigus** is a group of disorders that cause blisters to form on the skin and inside the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They are soft and can break open easily.\n\n【6】**Pemphigoid** is another group. It has three main types:\n\n【7】*   **Bullous pemphigoid** usually affects people between the ages of 60 and 80. It causes itchy blisters to form on the arms, thighs, and belly.\n*   **Mucous membrane pemphigoid** affects the lining of the mouth, eyes, nose, throat, and genitals.\n*   **Pemphigoid gestationis** affects women during pregnancy or just after their baby is born. It starts as a bumpy rash on the belly, arms, and legs. Then the bumps turn into blisters.\n\n【8】**IgA mediated bullous dermatoses** are disorders in which the immune system makes a lot of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a type of antibody that fights bacteria, toxins, and viruses. It comes in two types:\n\n【9】*   **Dermatitis herpetiformis** affects people with celiac disease (who are sensitive to the wheat protein called gluten). It causes clusters of itchy blisters to appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks.\n*   **Linear IgA disease** causes new blisters to form a ring around old ones on the skin. This is sometimes called a “cluster of jewels.” This type affects mucous membranes, too.\n\n【10】**Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita** mostly affects middle-aged and older adults. It makes the skin so fragile that blisters form from minor injuries.\n\n【11】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Symptoms\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals.\n\n【13】They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore.\n\n【14】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Causes\n-------------------------------------\n\n【15】When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders.\n\n【16】Erythema multiforme minor appears as symmetrical rings of red, raised skin that look like targets. Erythema multiforme can appear anywhere on the body. It is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus but has been associated with fungal infections or reactions to medications.\n\n【17】Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters.\n\n【18】Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as:\n\n【19】*   Ultraviolet light from the sun\n*   Chemicals used to kill pests\n*   Hormones\n*   Infection\n\n【20】Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include:\n\n【21】*   Diuretics and other medicines for high blood pressure\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis medications\n*   Antipsychotic medicines\n*   Antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Moxatag), ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro), and penicillin\n\n【22】Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them.\n\n【23】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Complications\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Blisters can cause long-term problems if they form in certain parts of the body or break open.\n\n【25】*   Blisters that pop open can cause infections.\n*   After they heal, they can leave scars.\n*   In the throat or lungs, they can make it hard to eat, swallow, or breathe.\n*   In the mouth, they can cause gum disease and tooth loss.\n*   In the eyes, they can affect sight.\n\n【26】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Diagnosis\n----------------------------------------\n\n【27】You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed.\n\n【28】You might get one or more of these tests:\n\n【29】*   **Blister** **biopsy****.** Your doctor removes a piece of the blister and looks at it under a microscope. A biopsy can show where the skin layers have separated.\n*   **Direct immunofluorescence.** A chemical is placed on the skin biopsy sample. Then it is tested for antibodies. The type of antibodies in your skin can show which type of blistering disorder you have.\n*   **Blood test.** Your doctor tests a sample of your blood for antibodies. This test can show how severe your condition is. It can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working.\n\n【30】Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including:\n\n【31】*   Genetic blistering disease, a group of disorders caused by changes in a gene needed for healthy skin\n*   Grover’s disease, a rare skin disorder that can cause small red lesions and blisters\n*   Other skin conditions that cause blisters, such as erythema multiforme or impetigo\n\n【32】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Treatment\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs:\n\n【34】*   **Corticosteroids**, such as prednisone (Deltasone, Prednicot, Rayos), that also ease inflammation\n*   **Immunosuppressive medicines**, such as azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept)\n*   **Biologic drugs,** such as rituximab (Rituxan), also used in some cancer treatments\n\n【35】For more serious cases, your treatments might include:\n\n【36】*   **Intravenous immunoglobulin G (****IVIG****).** This is a blood product you get through a needle into a vein. IVIG is an antibody found in plasma -- the liquid part of blood. It's taken from thousands of donors and pooled together. IVIG treatment gives you healthy antibodies to take over for the unhealthy ones that caused your disorder.\n*   **Plasmapheresis****.** This treatment removes the harmful antibodies from your blood. The part of blood that's removed is replaced with blood from a donor that contains healthy antibodies.\n\n【37】Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection:\n\n【38】*   Antibiotics\n*   Antiviral drugs\n*   Antifungal drugs\n\n【39】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Home Care\n----------------------------------------\n\n【40】To prevent infections and help you stay more comfortable, take care of your blisters. Keep them clean the way your doctor recommends. Try not to pop them. This can leave scars. If a blister is in an uncomfortable place such as your foot, your doctor can release the fluid with a clean needle. Also:\n\n【41】*   **Wash your sheets, towels, and clothes often.** Make sure everything that touches your skin is clean.\n*   **Care for your** **teeth****.** If you have blisters in your mouth, ask your dentist how to brush your teeth and gums without causing pain and more damage.\n\n【42】Each person with autoimmune blistering disorders is different. Some people have only mild blisters that go away on their own. Others have more severe skin problems that are harder to treat. Talk to your doctor about your situation.

This condition happens when you are exposed to temperatures below the freezing point of skin.\n\n【2】The condition has long been recognized. A 5,000-year-old pre-Columbian mummy discovered in the Chilean mountains offers the earliest documented evidence of frostbite. More recently, Napoleon’s chief surgeon, Baron Dominique Larrey, provided the first description of the mechanisms of frostbite in 1812, during his army’s retreat from Moscow. He also noted the harmful effects of the freeze-thaw-freeze cycle endured by soldiers who would warm their frozen hands and feet over the campfire at night only to refreeze those same parts by the next morning.\n\n【3】Although frostbite used to be a military problem, it is now a civilian one as well. Most people who get frostbite are males ages 30 to 49. The nose, cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes (your extremities) are most commonly affected. Everyone is susceptible, even people who have been living in cold climates for most of their lives.\n\n【4】Frostbite Causes\n----------------\n\n【5】Your body works to stay alive first and to stay functioning second.\n\n【6】*   In conditions of prolonged cold exposure, your body sends signals to the blood vessels in your arms and legs telling them to constrict (narrow). By slowing blood flow to the skin, your body is able to send more blood to the vital organs, supplying them with critical nutrients and oxygen, while also preventing a further decrease in internal body temperature by exposing less blood to the outside cold.\n*   As this process continues and your extremities (the parts farthest from your heart) become colder and colder, a condition called the hunting response is initiated. Your blood vessels are dilated (widened) for a period of time and then constricted again. Periods of dilatation are cycled with times of constriction in order to preserve as much function in your extremities as possible. However, when your brain senses that you are in danger of hypothermia (when your body temperature drops significantly below 98.6°F), it permanently constricts these blood vessels in order to prevent them from returning cold blood to the internal organs. When this happens, frostbite has begun.\n*   Frostbite is caused by 2 different means: cell death at the time of exposure and further cell deterioration and death because of a lack of oxygen.\n    *   In the first, ice crystals form in the space outside of the cells. Water is lost from the cell’s interior, and dehydration promotes the destruction of the cell.\n    *   In the second, the damaged lining of the blood vessels is the main culprit. As blood flow returns to the extremities upon rewarming, it finds that the blood vessels themselves are injured, also by the cold. Holes appear in vessel walls and blood leaks out into the tissues. Flow is impeded and turbulent, and small clots form in the smallest vessels of the extremities. Because of these blood flow problems, complicated interactions occur, and inflammation causes further tissue damage. This injury is the primary determinant of the amount of tissue damage you will have in the end.\n    *   It is rare for the inside of the cells themselves to be frozen. This phenomenon is only seen in very rapid freezing injuries, such as those produced by frozen metals.\n\n【7】Frostbite Symptoms\n------------------\n\n【8】A variety of frostbite classification systems have been proposed. The easiest to understand, and perhaps the one that gives the best clues to outcome, divides frostbite into 2 main divisions: superficial and deep.\n\n【9】*   In superficial frostbite, you may experience burning, numbness, tingling, itching, or cold sensations in the affected areas. The regions appear white and frozen, but if you press on them, they retain some resistance.  \n\n【10】*   In deep frostbite, there is an initial decrease in sensation that is eventually completely lost. Swelling and blood-filled blisters are noted over white or yellowish skin that looks waxy and turns a purplish blue as it rewarms. The area is hard, has no resistance when pressed on, and may even appear blackened and dead.  \n\n【11】*   You will experience significant pain as the areas are rewarmed and blood flow reestablished. A dull continuous ache transforms into a throbbing sensation in 2-3 days. This may last weeks to months until final tissue separation is complete.  \n\n【12】*   At first the areas may appear deceptively healthy. Most people do not arrive at the doctor with frozen, dead tissue. Only time can reveal the final amount of tissue damage.\n\n【13】When to Seek Medical Care\n-------------------------\n\n【14】A doctor must be able to see and examine the affected area. A simple telephone call is probably not sufficient in all but the mildest cases of cold injury to hands and feet. You need to see a doctor for care.\n\n【15】At the time of initial evaluation, it is very difficult to categorize the injury as superficial or deep, and even more difficult to ascertain the amount of tissue damage. Therefore, all people should be seen by a doctor, who will supervise the rewarming process, attempt to classify the injury, and further guide the treatment process. Someone with frostbite will need evaluation for, and possible treatment of, hypothermia and dehydration.\n\n【16】Exams and Tests\n---------------\n\n【17】The doctor will take a history in order to gather information on the events of the exposure and the medical condition prior to the cold injury.\n\n【18】*   The doctor will take note of the vital signs, including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate in order to exclude or treat any immediate life threats such as hypothermia or severe infection.  \n\n【19】*   X-rays may be performed, but they probably will be deferred until weeks later when they are more useful to the treatment team.  \n\n【20】*   The doctor will collect data in order to classify the injury as superficial or deep and the prognosis as favorable or poor.  \n    *   A good prognosis is heralded by intact sensation, normal skin color, blisters with clear fluid, the ability to deform the skin with pressure, and the skin becoming pink when thawed.  \n\n【21】    *   Blisters with dark fluid, skin turning dark blue when thawed, and an inability to indent the skin with pressure indicate a poor prognosis.\n\n【22】Frostbite Treatment - Self-Care at Home\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】*   First, call for help.  \n\n【24】*   Keep the affected part elevated in order to reduce swelling  \n\n【25】*   Move to a warm area to prevent further heat loss.  \n\n【26】*   Note that many people with frostbite may be experiencing hypothermia. Saving their lives is more important than preserving a finger or foot.  \n\n【27】*   Remove all constrictive jewelry and clothes because they may further block blood flow.  \n\n【28】*   Give the person warm, nonalcoholic, noncaffeinated fluids to drink.  \n\n【29】*   Apply a dry, sterile bandage, place cotton between any involved fingers or toes (to prevent rubbing), and take the person to a medical facility as soon as possible.  \n\n【30】*   Never rewarm an affected area if there is any chance it may freeze again. This thaw-refreeze cycle is very harmful and leads to disastrous results.  \n\n【31】*   Also, avoid a gradual thaw either in the field or in the transport vehicle. The most effective method is to rewarm the area quickly. Therefore, keep the injured part away from sources of heat until you arrive at a treatment facility where proper rewarming can take place.  \n\n【32】*   Do not rub the frozen area with snow (or anything else, for that matter). The friction created by this technique will only cause further tissue damage.  \n\n【33】*   Above all, keep in mind that the final amount of tissue destruction is proportional to the time it remains frozen, not to the absolute temperature to which it was exposed. Therefore, rapid transport to a hospital is very important.\n\n【34】Medical Treatment\n-----------------\n\n【35】*   After initial life threats are excluded, rewarming is the highest priority.\n    *   This is accomplished rapidly in a water bath heated to 40-42°C (104-107.6°F) and continued until the thaw is complete (usually 15-30 minutes).\n    *   Narcotic pain medications may be given because this process is very painful.\n    *   Because dehydration is very common, IV fluids may also be given.\n\n【36】*   After rewarming, post-thaw care is undertaken in order to prevent infection and a continuing lack of oxygen to the area.\n    *   Small clear blisters are left intact. Large, clear blisters may be removed while bloody ones are often drained but left intact so as not to disturb the underlying blood vessels and to decrease the risk of infection.\n    *   A tetanus booster is given if needed.\n*   People with frostbite are hospitalized for at least 1-2 days to determine the extent of injury and to receive further treatment.\n    *   Aloe vera cream is applied every 6 hours, and the area is elevated and splinted.\n    *   Ibuprofen may be given to combat inflammation, and an antibiotic may be given if an infection develops.\n    *   For deep frostbite, daily water therapy in a 37° to 39°C (98.6° to 102.2°F) whirlpool bath will be performed in order to remove any dead tissue.\n\n【37】*   A number of experimental therapies exist, many of which aim to further treat the inflammation or decreased blood flow seen in frostbite.\n\n【38】Next Steps - Follow-up\n----------------------\n\n【39】Symptoms follow a predictable pathway. Numbness initially is followed by a throbbing sensation that begins with rewarming and may last weeks to months. This is then typically replaced by a lingering feeling of tingling with occasional electric-shock sensations. Cold sensitivity, sensory loss, chronic pain, and a variety of other symptoms may last for years.\n\n【40】The treatment of frostbite is done over a period of weeks to months. Definitive therapy, possibly in the form of surgery, may not be performed for up to 6 months after the initial injury. Therefore, establish a working relationship between you and your doctor that will continue throughout the healing process.\n\n【41】Prevention\n----------\n\n【42】The first step in preventing frostbite is knowing whether you are at increased risk for the injury.\n\n【43】*   Many cases of frostbite are seen in alcoholics, people with psychiatric illness, car accidents or car breakdowns in bad weather, and recreational drug misuse.\n*   All of these conditions share the problem of cold exposure and either the unwillingness or inability of a person to remove themselves from this threat.\n*   Tobacco smokers and people with diseases of the blood vessels also are at increased risk because they have an already decreased amount of blood flow to their arms and legs.\n*   Homelessness, fatigue, dehydration, improper clothing, and high altitude are additional risk factors.\n\n【44】Although people don't always know or acknowledge these dangers, many of the dangers can be reduced or prevented.\n\n【45】*   Dress for the weather.\n*   Layers are best, and mittens are better than gloves (keeps your warm fingers together while warming each other).\n*   Wear 2 pairs of socks, with the inner layer made of synthetic fiber, such as polypropylene, to wick water away from the skin and the outer layer made of wool for increased insulation.\n*   Shoes should be waterproof.\n*   Cover your head, face, nose, and ears at all times.\n*   Clothes should fit loosely to avoid a decrease in blood flow to the arms and legs.\n*   Always travel with a friend in case help is needed.\n*   Avoid smoking and alcohol.\n\n【46】People with diabetes and anyone with vessel disease should take extra precautions, as should the very young, very old, and unconditioned.\n\n【47】Be especially wary of wet and windy conditions. The \"feels like\" temperature (windchill) is actually much lower than the stated air temperature.\n\n【48】Outlook\n-------\n\n【49】A common saying among surgeons who have treated people with frostbite is \"frostbite in January, amputate in July.\" It often takes months before the final separation between healthy and dead tissue may be determined. If surgery is performed too early, the risks of removing tissue that may eventually recover or leaving behind tissue that may eventually die are great. Some radiographic techniques currently are being investigated that may be able to make this division much sooner, thus permitting earlier definitive treatment. In some cases, bone scans are used to help predict the viability of tissue.\n\n【50】Beyond this waiting period, 65% of people will suffer long-term symptoms because of their frostbite. Common symptoms include pain or abnormal sensations in the extremity, heat or cold sensitivity, excessive sweating, and arthritis.\n\n【51】Synonyms and Keywords\n---------------------\n\n【52】frostbite, frostnip (often used to refer to the precursor of frostbite), trench foot, chilblains, pernio, dead skin, dead tissue, cold weather, extremities", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:49:26", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:49:43", "cost": 16.879}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:49:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:49:26"}

People with cystic fibrosis produce thick, sticky mucus that can plug up the tubes, ducts and passageways in the lungs . This can result in serious breathing problems and infections in the lungs . Tobramycin belongs to a class of drugs known as aminoglycoside antibiotics . Tobramycin works by stopping the growth of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that commonly infect the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. This effect decreases lung infections and damage, and helps to improve breathing.\n\n【2】### How to use Tobramycin Capsule\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet and instruction sheet if available from your pharmacist before you start using tobramycin and each time you get a refill. Learn how to use the inhaler properly. Children may need help from an adult to use this medication properly. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Do not swallow these capsules by mouth . Use the special inhaler to inhale the powder in the capsules. Inhale this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually twice daily (12 hours apart). Each dose is usually 4 of the 28-milligram capsules. Inhale 2 times per capsule to make sure you inhale all of the drug. Do not breathe out into the mouthpiece at any time. Each dose takes approximately 2 to 6 minutes.\n\n【5】Inhaled tobramycin is usually given for 28 days, followed by a 28-day break when you do not inhale any tobramycin. Then if directed by your doctor, you may start another 28-day course of inhaled tobramycin. Do not use this medication for more than 28 days at a time. Keep track of the days that you use this medication.\n\n【6】After each dose, wipe the mouthpiece with a clean, dry cloth. The inhaler should never be washed with water. Keep it dry and store it in its case. Use a new inhaler every week.\n\n【7】Do not inhale any other medications at the same time you inhale tobramycin. If you are taking other inhaled medications or doing chest physiotherapy, your doctor will let you know which order you should receive your treatments. Inhaled tobramycin should always be the last treatment.\n\n【8】If you are using a quick-relief inhaler (such as salbutamol, albuterol ), you should inhale it 15 to 90 minutes before inhaling tobramycin. This will help you inhale and absorb the tobramycin.\n\n【9】For the best effect, use this antibiotic at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, use this medication at the same time(s) every day.\n\n【10】Continue to use this medication until the full prescribed amount is finished, even if symptoms disappear after a few days. Stopping the medication too early may result in a return of the infection.\n\n【11】Tell your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens.\n\n【12】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【13】Hoarseness, cough , dry mouth , difficulty speaking, change in taste, and changes in voice may occur.

It causes irritation, inflammation, and ulcers in the lining of your large intestine (also called your colon).\n\n【2】There’s no cure, and people usually have symptoms off and on for life. But the right treatments can help you keep a handle on the disease.\n\n【3】Ulcerative Colitis Causes and Risk Factors\n------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Ulcerative colitis happens when your immune system makes a mistake. Normally, it attacks invaders in your body, like the common cold. But when you have UC, your immune system thinks food, good gut bacteria, and the cells that line your colon are the intruders. White blood cells that usually protect you attack the lining of your colon instead. They cause the inflammation and ulcers.\n\n【5】Doctors aren’t sure why people get the condition. Your genes may play a role; the disease sometimes runs in families. Other things in the world around you may make a difference, too.\n\n【6】Things that can affect your risk of getting ulcerative colitis include:\n\n【7】*   **Age.** It’s most likely if you’re between 15 and 30 years old or older than 60.\n*   **Ethnicity.** The risk is highest in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\n*   **Family history.** Your risk could be up to 30% higher if you have a close relative with the condition.\n\n【8】Food and stress don’t cause it, but they can trigger a flare of symptoms.\n\n【9】Types of Ulcerative Colitis\n---------------------------\n\n【10】The type of ulcerative colitis you have depends on where it is in your body:\n\n【11】*   **Ulcerative proctitis** is usually the mildest form. It’s only in the rectum, the part of your colon closest to your anus. Rectal bleeding may be the only sign of the disease.\n*   **Proctosigmoiditis** happens in your rectum and the lower end of your colon (you may hear the doctor call it the sigmoid colon). You’ll have bloody diarrhea, belly cramps, and pain. You’ll have the urge to poop, but you won’t be able to. (Your doctor may call this tenesmus.)\n*   **Left-sided colitis** causes cramps on that side of your belly. You’ll also have bloody diarrhea, and you might lose weight without trying. You’ll have inflammation from your rectum up through the left side of your colon.\n*   **Pancolitis** often affects your entire colon. It can cause severe bouts of bloody diarrhea, belly cramps, pain, fatigue, and major weight loss.\n*   **Acute severe ulcerative colitis** is rare. It affects your entire colon and causes severe pain, heavy diarrhea, bleeding, and fever.\n\n【12】Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms\n---------------------------\n\n【13】The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is bloody diarrhea. There might be some pus in your stools, too.\n\n【14】Other problems include:\n\n【15】*   Cramping belly pain\n*   Sudden urges to poop\n*   Not feeling hungry\n*   Weight loss\n*   Feeling tired\n*   Fever\n*   Dehydration\n*   Joint pain or soreness\n*   Canker sores\n*   Eye pain when you look at a bright light\n*   Too few red blood cells, called anemia\n*   Skin sores\n*   Feeling like you haven’t completely emptied your colon after you use the bathroom\n*   Waking up at night to go\n*   Not being able to hold your stool in\n*   Pain or bleeding with bowel movements\n\n【16】Your symptoms can flare up, go away, and come back. You might not have any for weeks or years.\n\n【17】Ulcerative Colitis vs. Crohn’s Disease vs. Irritable Bowel\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Other gut diseases can have some of the same symptoms.\n\n【19】*   Ulcerative colitis affects only your large intestine and its lining.\n*   Crohn’s disease causes inflammation, but it affects other places in your digestive tract.\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome has some of the same symptoms as UC, but it doesn’t cause inflammation or ulcers. Instead, it’s a problem with the muscles in your intestines.\n\n【20】Ulcerative Colitis Diagnosis\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Your doctor will use tests to tell if you have UC instead of another gut disease.\n\n【22】*   **Blood tests** can show if you have anemia or inflammation.\n*   **Stool samples** can help your doctor rule out an infection or parasite in your colon. They can also show if there’s blood in your stool that you can’t see.\n*   **Flexible sigmoidoscopy** lets your doctor look at the lower part of your colon. They’ll put a bendable tube into your lower colon through your bottom. The tube has a small light and camera on the end. Your doctor might also use a small tool to take a piece of the lining of your lower colon. This is called a biopsy. A doctor in a lab will look at the sample under a microscope.\n*   **Colonoscopy** is the same process as flexible sigmoidoscopy, only your doctor will look at your whole colon, not just the lower part.\n*   **X-rays** are less common for diagnosing the disease, but your doctor may want you to have one in special cases.\n\n【23】Ulcerative Colitis Treatment\n----------------------------\n\n【24】UC treatment has two main goals. The first is to make you feel better and give your colon a chance to heal. The second is to prevent more flare-ups. You may need a combination of diet changes, medication, or surgery to reach those goals.\n\n【25】*   **Diet.** Some foods can make your symptoms worse. You might find that soft, bland food doesn’t bother you as much as spicy or high-fiber dishes. If you can’t digest the sugar in milk called lactose (meaning you’re lactose intolerant), your doctor may tell you to stop eating dairy products. A balanced diet with plenty of fiber, lean protein, fruits, and veggies should provide enough vitamins and nutrients.\n*   **Medicine.** Your doctor may prescribe a few different kinds of drugs, including:\n    *   **Antibiotics.** These fight infections and let your large intestine heal.\n    *   **Aminosalicylates.** These drugs have something called 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) that fights inflammation and helps control symptoms. You might get pills to swallow or an enema or suppository to put in your bottom.\n    *   **Corticosteroids.** If aminosalicylates don’t work or your symptoms are severe, your doctor might give you these anti-inflammatory drugs for a short time.\n    *   **Immunomodulators.** These help stop your immune system’s attack on your colon. They can take a while to take effect. You might not notice any changes for up to 3 months.\n    *   **Biologics.** These are made from proteins in living cells instead of chemicals. They’re for people with severe ulcerative colitis.\n    *   **Janus kinase inhibitors (****JAK inhibitors****)**. These are oral medicines that can work quickly to get and maintain a remission in ulcerative colitis.\n    *   **Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators**. This is an oral medication for patients with moderately to severely active UC.\n    *   **Loperamide.** This can slow or stop diarrhea. Talk to your doctor before taking it.\n*   **Surgery.** If other treatments don’t work or your UC is severe, you might need surgery to remove your colon (colectomy) or colon and rectum (proctocolectomy). If you have a proctocolectomy, your doctor might make a small pouch out of your small intestine and attach it to your anus. This is called ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). It lets your body expel waste normally, so you don’t need to wear a bag to collect stool.\n\n【26】Ulcerative Colitis Complications\n--------------------------------\n\n【27】Complications of ulcerative colitis can include:\n\n【28】*   **Bleeding.** This can lead to anemia.\n*   **Osteoporosis.** Your bones might become weak because of your diet or if you take a lot of corticosteroids.\n*   **Dehydration.** You might need to get fluids through a vein (intravenous, or IV) if your large intestine can’t absorb enough.\n*   **Inflammation.** This can affect your joints, skin, or eyes.\n*   **Fulminant colitis****.** If your UC attack is severe, your colon might burst, or infection could spread through your body. Your intestines stop moving waste, and your belly swells.\n*   **Megacolon.** Fulminant colitis can cause your large intestine to swell or burst. This is a dangerous complication, and you’ll probably need surgery.\n*   **Liver disease****.** Your bile ducts or liver could become inflamed, or you could get scar tissue in your liver.\n*   **Colon cancer.** Ulcerative colitis puts you at higher risk of getting colon cancer, especially if your whole large intestine is affected or if you’ve had UC for a long time.\n\n【29】Ulcerative Colitis Questions to Ask Your Doctor\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Whether you’re worried your symptoms are UC, or you already have the condition and want more information, here are questions to ask your doctor:\n\n【31】*   Are my symptoms a sign of ulcerative colitis (UC) or another condition?\n*   Are there different kinds of UC? Do they have different symptoms?\n*   What tests will I need?\n*   If I have ulcerative colitis, what will my treatment plan be?\n*   Will changing my diet or lifestyle help ease my symptoms?\n*   How serious is my ulcerative colitis?\n*   If I take medication for ulcerative colitis, will there be side effects?\n*   Should I take nutritional supplements like probiotics?\n*   How often will I need to come in for checkups?\n*   What should I do if my symptoms suddenly get worse?\n*   How do I know if my ulcerative colitis is getting worse?\n*   How do I know if I should change my ulcerative colitis medication?\n*   Should I consider surgery? What does surgery involve?\n*   What is my risk of getting colon cancer?\n\n【32】Ulcerative Colitis Prognosis\n----------------------------\n\n【33】For most people, ulcerative colitis is a chronic, or long-term, condition. You’ll have flares and periods with no symptoms at all (your doctor will call this remission). A small number of people have one attack and are never troubled again.\n\n【34】A few people, about 10% of those with UC, have their first attack and quickly get worse, with serious complications. In many people, the disease spreads to the large intestine over time. This can turn into colon cancer, but about half the people who get it survive if doctors catch the disease early enough and remove their colon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:30:44", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:31:02", "cost": 18.612}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:57", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:31:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:30:44"}

In Barrett's esophagus, normal tissue lining the esophagus -- the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach -- changes to tissue that resembles the lining of the intestine. About 10% of people with chronic symptoms of GERD develop Barrett's esophagus.\n\n【1】Barrett's esophagus does not have any specific symptoms, although patients with Barrett's esophagus may have symptoms related to GERD. It does, though, increase the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a serious, potentially fatal cancer of the esophagus.\n\n【2】Although the risk of this cancer is higher in people with Barrett's esophagus, the disease is still rare. Less than 1% of people with Barrett's esophagus develop this particular cancer. Nevertheless, if you've been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, it's important to have routine examinations of your esophagus. With routine examination, your doctor can discover precancerous and cancer cells early, before they spread and when the disease is easier to treat.\n\n【3】What Is GERD and How Does It Relate to Barrett's Esophagus?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】People with GERD may experience symptoms such as heartburn, a sour, burning sensation in the back of the throat, chronic cough, laryngitis, and nausea.\n\n【5】When you swallow food or liquid, it automatically passes through the esophagus, which is a hollow, muscular tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle at the end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach, keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus.\n\n【6】The stomach produces acid in order to digest food, but it is also protected from the acid it produces. With GERD, stomach contents flow backward into the esophagus. This is known as reflux.\n\n【7】Most people with acid reflux don't develop Barrett's esophagus. But in patients with frequent acid reflux, the normal cells in the esophagus may eventually be replaced by cells that are similar to cells in the intestine to become Barrett's esophagus.\n\n【8】Does GERD Always Cause Barrett's Esophagus?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【9】No. Not everyone with GERD develops Barrett's esophagus. And not everyone with Barrett's esophagus has GERD. But long-term GERD is the primary risk factor.\n\n【10】Anyone can develop Barrett's esophagus, but white males who have had long-term GERD are more likely than others to develop it. Other risk factors include the onset of GERD at a younger age and a history of current or past smoking.\n\n【11】How Is Barrett's Esophagus Diagnosed?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】Because there are often no specific symptoms associated with Barrett's esophagus, it can only be diagnosed with an upper endoscopy and biopsy. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association recommend screening in people who have multiple risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus. Risk factors include age over 50, male sex, white race, hiatal hernia, long standing GERD, and overweight, especially if weight is carried around the middle.\n\n【13】To perform an endoscopy, a doctor called a gastroenterologist inserts a long flexible tube with a camera attached down the throat into the esophagus after giving the patient a sedative. The process may feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn't painful. Most people have little or no problem with it.\n\n【14】Once the tube is inserted, the doctor can visually inspect the lining of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus, if it's there, is visible on camera, but the diagnosis requires a biopsy. The doctor will remove a small sample of tissue to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory to confirm a diagnosis.\n\n【15】The sample will also be examined for the presence of precancerous cells or cancer. If the biopsy confirms the presence of Barrett's esophagus, your doctor will probably recommend a follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to examine more tissue for early signs of developing cancer.\n\n【16】If you have Barrett's esophagus but no cancer or precancerous cells are found, the doctor will still most likely recommend that you have periodic endoscopies. This is a precaution, because cancer can develop in Barrett tissue years after diagnosing Barrett's esophagus. If precancerous cells are present in the biopsy, your doctor will discuss treatment and surveillance options with you.\n\n【17】Can Barrett's Esophagus Be Treated?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】One of the primary goals of treatment is to prevent or slow the development of Barrett's esophagus by treating and controlling acid reflux. This is done with lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes include taking steps such as:\n\n【19】*   Make changes in your diet. Fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, spicy foods, and peppermint can aggravate reflux.\n*   Avoid alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and tobacco.\n*   Lose weight. Being overweight increases your risk for reflux.\n*   Sleep with the head of the bed elevated. Sleeping with your head raised may help prevent the acid in your stomach from flowing up into the esophagus.\n*   Don't lie down for 3 hours after eating.\n*   Take all medicines with plenty of water.\n\n【20】The doctor may also prescribe medications to help. Those medications may include:\n\n【21】*   Proton pump inhibitors that reduce the production of stomach acid\n*   Antacids to neutralize stomach acid\n*   H2 blockers that lessen the release of stomach acid\n*   Promotility agents -- drugs that speed up the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines\n\n【22】Are There Treatments That Specifically Target Barrett's Esophagus?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】There are several treatments, including surgery, that are designed specifically to focus on the abnormal tissue. They include:\n\n【24】*   Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses radio waves delivered through an endoscope inserted into the esophagus to destroy abnormal cells while protecting the healthy cells underneath.\n*   Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a laser through an endoscope to kill abnormal cells in the lining without damaging normal tissue. Before the procedure, the patient takes a drug known as Photofrin, which causes cells to become light-sensitive.\n*   Endoscopic spray cryotherapy is a newer technique that applies cold nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas, through the endoscope to freeze the abnormal cells.\n*   Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) lifts the abnormal lining and cuts it off the wall of the esophagus before it's removed through the endoscope. The goal is to remove any precancerous or cancer cells contained in the lining. If cancer cells are present, an ultrasound is done first to be sure the cancer hasn't moved deeper into the esophagus walls.\n*   Surgery to remove most of the esophagus is an option in cases where severe precancer (dysplasia) or cancer has been diagnosed. The earlier the surgery is done following the diagnosis, the better the chance for the cure.\n\n【25】It's important to keep several facts in mind:\n\n【26】*   GERD is common among American adults.\n*   Only a small percentage of people with GERD (less than one out of every 10) develop Barrett's esophagus.\n*   Less than 1% of those with Barrett's esophagus each year go on to develop esophageal cancer.\n\n【27】A diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is not a cause for major alarm. Barrett's esophagus, however, can lead to precancerous changes in a small number of people and has an increased risk for cancer. So, a diagnosis is a reason to work with your doctor to be watchful of your health", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:07:20", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:07:34", "cost": 13.818}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:07:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:07:19"}

Some researchers believe that such energy is real and measurable. Others believe humans pick up on anger, sadness, and other negative emotions that others project. We are good at reading those through verbal and nonverbal cues even when they aren't openly expressed. \n\n【6】**Negative Environments**\n\n【7】You may have experienced feeling very comfortable in some environments and uncomfortable in others. Sometimes this is because of the experience that you associate with the place. You're unlikely to be as comfortable in the dentist's office as in a friend's home. But there is also evidence that the physical details of your surroundings can impact your mood. Clutter, for example, can create stress and even interfere with your sleep. Environments that make you uncomfortable may be described as having negative energy. \n\n【8】**Negative Self-Talk**\n\n【9】Self-talk is the flow of mostly unspoken thoughts that run through your head. Negative thoughts can harm your health and well-being. Positive thinkers are less susceptible to colds and have better cardiovascular health. They are less likely to be depressed and likely to live longer. Being a positive thinker doesn't mean that you ignore problems. Instead, being one can better your ability to deal with them. \n\n【10】Signs of Negative Energy\n------------------------\n\n【11】If you have been experiencing negative energy in the form of people or places, or if you have been engaging in negative self-talk, you may experience these signs and symptoms:\n\n【12】**You're Critical**\n\n【13】Being critical of others is a way to blame your discomfort on someone or something else. Although criticizing others may make you feel better at first, it seldom feels good later, especially if you have been critical in front of an audience. \n\n【14】**You Complain a Lot**\n\n【15】Complaining occurs when we express the negative talk in our heads out loud. Complaining can become such an ingrained habit that you don't realize when you are doing it. When you complain, you are putting your negative energy out where it can affect others.\n\n【16】**Your Health Is Suffering**\n\n【17】Negative emotions can cause stress, which in turn impacts your health. Stress can destroy your body's hormone balance, impair the immune system, and drain your positive brain chemicals. Negative energy in the form of poorly expressed anger can cause dysfunction of the heart and digestive system.  \n\n【18】**You Can't Sleep**\n\n【19】Repeated negative thoughts are associated with poor sleep quality. It's unclear whether the lack of sleep triggers negative thinking or whether the negative thoughts keep you awake. Maybe the combination of negative thoughts and poor sleep creates a vicious cycle in which each element makes the other worse.\n\n【20】Dealing With Negative Energy\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Whether your negative energy comes from other people, your environment, or yourself, you can take these four steps to reduce it:\n\n【22】**Deal With Negative People**\n\n【23】You'll be happier if you associate with positive people, which may mean rethinking your social circle. It may not be possible or desirable to remove all the negative people from your life. However, you can find ways to maintain positive energy in their presence. One is to imagine an aura of positivity surrounding you like a shield.  Another is to use humor to create positive energy.\n\n【24】**Create a Positive Environment**\n\n【25】Decluttering your home and workspace can get rid of negative energy. Hold on to useful things and the items you love, and get rid of the rest. When you are tempted to buy more stuff, remind yourself that things don't bring happiness. \n\n【26】**Work on Yourself**\n\n【27】Experts have a long list of practices that can get rid of negative energy. Some of their suggestions include:\n\n【28】*   Get regular exercise\n*   Eat a healthy diet\n*   Spend time in nature\n\n【29】You might find value in meditation or a mindfulness practice. One study found that being mindful can make mundane tasks like dishwashing into positive experiences. Whether or not you meditate, repeating a calming mantra can keep your positive energy flowing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 16:38:01", "endTime": "2024/08/21 16:38:14", "cost": 12.541}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 00:38:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 00:38:01"}

It causes your airways to get inflamed and narrow, and it makes it hard to breathe. Severe asthma can cause trouble talking or being active. You might hear your doctor call it a chronic respiratory disease. Some people refer to asthma as \"bronchial asthma.\"\n\n【2】Asthma is a serious disease that affects about 25 million Americans and causes nearly 1.6 million emergency room visits every year. With treatment, you can live well. Without it, you might have to go to the ER often or stay at the hospital, which can affect your daily life.\n\n【3】What Does Asthma Feel Like?\n---------------------------\n\n【4】Asthma is marked by inflammation of the bronchial tubes, with extra sticky secretions inside the tubes. People with asthma have symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus.\n\n【5】There are three major signs of asthma:\n\n【6】*   **Airway blockage.** When you breathe as usual, the bands of muscle around your airways are relaxed, and air moves freely. But when you have asthma, the muscles tighten. It’s harder for air to pass through.\n*   **Inflammation**. Asthma causes red, swollen bronchial tubes in your lungs. This inflammation can damage your lungs. Treating this is key to managing asthma in the long run.\n*   **Airway irritability.** People with asthma have sensitive airways that tend to overreact and narrow when they come into contact with even slight triggers.\n\n【7】These problems may cause symptoms such as:\n\n【8】*   Coughing, especially at night or in the morning\n*   Wheezing, a whistling sound when you breathe\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Tightness, pain, or pressure in your chest\n*   Trouble sleeping because of breathing problems\n\n【9】Not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You may not have all of these symptoms, or you may have different symptoms at different times. Your symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild during one and severe during another.\n\n【10】Some people with asthma may go for long periods without having any symptoms. Others might have problems every day. In addition, some people may have asthma only during exercise or with viral infections like colds.\n\n【11】Mild asthma attacks are generally more common. Usually, the airways open up within a few minutes to a few hours. Severe attacks are less common but last longer and require medical help right away. It is important to recognize and treat even mild asthma symptoms to help you prevent severe episodes and keep asthma under better control.\n\n【12】**When to see your doctor**\n\n【13】Get medical help right away if you have serious symptoms including:\n\n【14】*   Fast breathing\n*   Pale or blue face, lips, or fingernails\n*   The skin around your ribs pulls inward when you breathe in\n*   Trouble breathing, walking, or talking\n*   Symptoms that don’t get better after you take medication\n\n【15】What Is an Asthma Attack?\n-------------------------\n\n【16】An asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle around the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed, and the cells lining the airways make more and thicker mucus than normal.\n\n【17】All of these things -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as trouble breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and trouble with normal daily activities.\n\n【18】Other symptoms of an asthma attack include:\n\n【19】*   Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out\n*   Coughing that won't stop\n*   Very rapid breathing\n*   Chest pain or pressure\n*   Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\n*   Difficulty talking\n*   Feelings of anxiety or panic\n*   Pale, sweaty face\n*   Blue lips or fingernails\n\n【20】An asthma attack can get worse quickly, so it's important to treat these symptoms right away.\n\n【21】Without immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, it will become harder to breathe. If you use a peak flow meter at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50% of your usual or normal peak flow reading. Many asthma action plans suggest interventions starting at 80% of normal.\n\n【22】As your lungs continue to tighten, you won’t be able to use the peak flow meter at all. Your lungs will tighten so there is not enough air movement to wheeze. You need to go to a hospital right away. Unfortunately, some people think that the disappearance of wheezing is a sign of improvement and don’t get emergency care.\n\n【23】Without proper treatment, over time, you may be unable to speak and will get a bluish coloring around your lips. This color change, known as cyanosis, means you have less and less oxygen in your blood. It can cause a loss of consciousness and death.\n\n【24】If you have an asthma attack, follow the \"Red Zone\" or emergency instructions in your asthma action plan right away. These symptoms happen in life-threatening asthma attacks. You need medical attention right away.\n\n【25】How Is Asthma Classified?\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Doctors rank how bad asthma is by its symptoms:\n\n【27】1.  **Mild intermittent asthma.** Mild symptoms less than twice a week. Nighttime symptoms less than twice a month. Few asthma attacks.\n2.  **Mild persistent asthma.** Symptoms three to six times a week. Nighttime symptoms three to four times a month. Asthma attacks might affect activities.\n3.  **Moderate persistent asthma.** Daily asthma symptoms. Nighttime attacks five or more times a month. Symptoms may affect activities.\n4.  **Severe persistent asthma.** Ongoing symptoms both day and night. You have to limit your activities.\n\n【28】Your asthma may be getting worse if:\n\n【29】*   You have symptoms more often and they interfere more with your daily life.\n*   You have a hard time breathing. You can measure this with a device called a peak flow meter.\n*   You need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often.\n\n【30】Types of Asthma\n---------------\n\n【31】There are several:\n\n【32】*   **Adult-onset asthma.** Asthma can start at any age, but it's more common in people younger than 40.\n*   **Status asthmaticus**. These long-lasting asthma attacks don’t go away when you use bronchodilators. They’re a medical emergency that needs treatment right away.\n*   **Asthma in children****.** Symptoms can vary from episode to episode in the same child. Watch for problems like:\n    *   Coughing often, especially during play, at night, or while laughing. This may be the only symptom.\n    *   Less energy or pausing to catch their breath while they play\n    *   Fast or shallow breathing\n    *   Saying their chest hurts or feels tight\n    *   A whistling sound when they breathe in or out\n    *   Seesaw motions in their chest because of trouble breathing\n    *   Shortness of breath\n    *   Tight neck and chest muscles\n    *   Weakness or fatigue\n*   **Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.** You might hear this called exercise\\-induced asthma. It happens during physical activity, when you breathe in air that’s drier than what’s in your body, and your airways narrow. It can affect people who don’t have asthma, too. You’ll notice symptoms within a few minutes after you start to exercise, and they might last 10 to 15 minutes after you stop.\n*   **Allergic asthma****.** Things that trigger allergies, like dust, pollen and pet dander, can also cause asthma attacks.\n*   **Nonallergic asthma.** This type flares in extreme weather. It could be the heat of summer or the cold of winter. It could also show up when you’re stressed or have a cold.\n*   **Occupational asthma****.** This usually affects people who work around chemical fumes, dust, or other irritating things in the air.\n*   **Eosinophilic asthma.** This severe form is marked by high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. It usually affects adults between 35 and 50 years old.\n*   **Nocturnal asthma****.** Your asthma symptoms get worse at night.\n*   **Aspirin****\\-induced asthma.** You have asthma symptoms when you take aspirin, along with a runny nose, sneezing, sinus pressure, and a cough.\n*   **Cough-variant asthma.** Unlike with other types, the only symptom of this kind of asthma is a long-term cough.\n\n【33】Asthma Causes and Triggers\n--------------------------\n\n【34】When you have asthma, your airways react to things in the world around you. Doctors call these asthma triggers. They might cause symptoms or make them worse. Common asthma triggers include:\n\n【35】*   Infections like sinusitis, colds, and the flu\n*   Allergens such as pollens, mold, pet dander, and dust mites\n*   Irritants like strong odors from perfumes or cleaning solutions\n*   Air pollution\n*   Tobacco smoke\n*   Exercise\n*   Cold air or changes in the weather, such as temperature or humidity\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Strong emotions such as anxiety, laughter, sadness, or stress\n*   Medications such as aspirin\n*   Food preservatives called sulfites, found in things like shrimp, pickles, beer and wine, dried fruits, and bottled lemon and lime juices\n\n【36】Asthma Risk Factors\n-------------------\n\n【37】Things that might make you more likely to have asthma include:\n\n【38】*   Things in the world around you before you’re born or while you’re growing up\n*   Whether your parents have asthma, especially your mother\n*   Your genes\n*   Your race. Asthma is more common in people of African American or Puerto Rican descent.\n*   Your sex. Boys are more likely to have asthma than girls. In teens and adults, it’s more common in females.\n*   Your job\n*   Other conditions like lung infections, allergies, or obesity\n\n【39】Asthma Diagnosis\n----------------\n\n【40】If you think you have asthma, see your doctor. They may refer you to a lung doctor, called a pulmonologist, or a specialist in allergy and immunology.\n\n【41】The doctor will start with a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history.\n\n【42】You’ll have tests to see how well your lungs work, which may include:\n\n【43】*   **Spirometry****.** This simple breathing test measures how much air you blow out and how fast.\n*   **Peak flow**. These measure how well your lungs push out air. They’re less exact than spirometry, but they can be a good way to test your lungs at home, even before you feel any symptoms. A peak flow meter can help you figure out what makes your asthma worse, whether your treatment is working, and when you need emergency care.\n*   **Methacholine challenge.** This and similar tests involve using triggers or challenges. Adults are more likely to have this test than children. You might get it if your symptoms and spirometry test don’t clearly show asthma. During this test, you inhale a chemical called methacholine before and after spirometry to see if it makes your airways narrow. If your results fall at least 20%, it is possible that you have asthma. Your doctor will give you medicine at the end of the test to reverse the effects of the methacholine.\n*   **Exhaled nitric oxide test.** You breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath. Your body makes this gas normally, but levels could be high if your airways are inflamed.\n\n【44】Other tests you might get include:\n\n【45】*   **Chest X-ray.** It isn’t an asthma test, but your doctor can use it to make sure nothing else is causing your symptoms. An X-ray is an image of the inside of your body, made with low doses of radiation.\n*   **CT.** This test takes a series of X-rays and puts them together to make a view of your insides. A scan of your lungs and sinuses can identify physical problems or diseases (like an infection) that may cause breathing problems or make them worse.\n*   **Allergy tests****.** These can be blood or skin tests. They tell if you’re allergic to pets, dust, mold, and pollen. Once you know your allergy triggers, you can get treatment to prevent them -- and asthma attacks.\n*   **Sputum eosinophils**. This test looks for high levels of white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mix of saliva and mucus (sputum) that comes out when you cough.\n\n【46】Asthma Treatment\n----------------\n\n【47】Many asthma treatments can ease your symptoms. Your doctor will work with you to make an asthma action plan that will outline your treatment and medications. They might include:\n\n【48】*   **Inhaled corticosteroids****.** These medications treat asthma in the long term. That means you’ll take them every day to keep your asthma under control. They prevent and ease swelling inside your airways, and they may help your body make less mucus. You’ll use a device called an inhaler to get the medicine into your lungs. Common inhaled corticosteroids include:\n    *   Beclomethasone (QVAR)\n    *   Budesonide (Pulmicort)\n    *   Fluticasone (Arnuity Ellipta, Armonair Respiclick, Flovent)\n*   **Leukotriene modifiers.** Another long-term asthma treatment, these medications block leukotrienes, things in your body that trigger an asthma attack. You take them as a pill once a day. Common leukotriene modifiers include:\n    *   Montelukast (Singulair)\n    *   Zafirlukast (Accolate)\n*   **Long-acting beta-agonists.** These medications relax the muscle bands that surround your airways. You might hear them called bronchodilators. You’ll take these medications with an inhaler, even when you have no symptoms. They include:\n    *   Formoterol (Perforomist)\n    *   Salmeterol (Serevent)\n*   **Combination inhaler.** This device gives you an inhaled corticosteroid, a long-acting beta-agonist, and sometimes another type of bronchodilator together to ease your asthma. Common ones include:\n    *   Budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort)\n    *   Fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus, AirDuo Respiclick)\n    *   Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo)\n    *   Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\n    *   Mometasone and formoterol (Dulera)\n*   **Theophylline.** It opens your airways and eases tightness in your chest. You take this long-term medication by mouth, either by itself or with an inhaled corticosteroid.\n*   **Short-acting beta-agonists.** These are known as rescue medicines or rescue inhalers. They loosen the bands of muscle around your airways and ease symptoms. Examples include:\n    *   Albuterol (Accuneb, ProAir FHA, Proventil FHA, Ventolin FHA)\n    *   Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)\n*   **Anticholinergics.** These bronchodilators prevent the muscle bands around your airways from tightening. Common ones include:\n    *   Ipratropium (Atrovent FHA)\n    *   Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva)\n\n【49】You can get ipratropium in an inhaler or as a solution for a nebulizer, a device that turns liquid medicine into a mist that you breathe in through a mouthpiece. Tiotropium bromide comes in a dry inhaler, which lets you breathe in the medicine as a dry powder.\n\n【50】*   **Oral and intravenous corticosteroids.** You’ll take these along with a rescue inhaler during an asthma attack. They ease swelling and inflammation in your airways. You’ll take oral steroids for a short time, between 5 days and 2 weeks. Common oral steroids include:\n    *   Methylprednisolone (Medrol)\n    *   Prednisolone (Flo-Pred, Orapred, Pediapred, Prelone)\n    *   Prednisone (Deltasone)\n\n【51】You’re more likely to get steroids injected directly into a vein if you’re in the hospital for a bad asthma attack. This will get the medication into your system more quickly.\n\n【52】*   **Biologics.** If you have severe asthma that doesn’t respond to control medications, you might try a biologic:\n    *   Omalizumab (Xolair) treats asthma caused by allergens. You get it as an injection every 2 to 4 weeks.\n    *   Other biologics stop your immune cells from making things that cause inflammation. These drugs include:\n        *   Benralizumab (Fasenra)\n        *   Mepolizumab (Nucala)\n        *   Reslizumab (Cinqair)\n\n【53】Tezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire) is a first-in-class medicine for add-on maintenance treatment of adults and children 12 and older. Taken as a shot, it targets a molecule that causes inflammation in the airways.\n\n【54】**Home remedies**\n\n【55】Medication will probably be key to getting your asthma under control, but you can do some things at home to help.\n\n【56】*   Avoid asthma triggers.\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Stay at a healthy weight.\n*   Take care of conditions that can trigger symptoms, such as GERD.\n*   Do breathing exercises to ease symptoms so you need less medication.\n*   Some people use complementary treatments such as yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, or supplements like vitamin C and ding chuan tang. Talk to your doctor before trying any of these.\n\n【57】Asthma Complications\n--------------------\n\n【58】When it’s not under control, asthma can cause problems with your daily life, such as:\n\n【59】*   Fatigue\n*   Lack of exercise and weight gain\n*   Hospital or ER visits\n*   Missing work\n*   Time away from school or trouble focusing on schoolwork\n*   Mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression\n\n【60】Asthma can also lead to serious medical conditions including:\n\n【61】*   Pneumonia and other complications from common infections like the flu\n*   Early delivery or the loss of a pregnancy\n*   Permanently narrowed bronchial tubes in your lungs\n*   Lung collapse\n*   Respiratory failure\n\n【62】Asthma Attack Prevention\n------------------------\n\n【63】Your action plan will include different ways to keep your asthma under control and prevent attacks. These might include:\n\n【64】*   Know your triggers, and stay away from them.\n*   Follow your doctor’s instructions on taking your asthma medications. Let them know if you notice that you’re using a quick-relief inhaler more often.\n*   Keep track of your condition and learn the signs that it might be getting worse. A peak flow meter can help.\n*   Know what to do if you think your asthma is getting worse.\n*   Talk to your doctor about vaccines to lower your chances of certain conditions. You might get vaccinations for COVID-19, flu, pneumonia, shingles, or whooping cough (pertussis).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 17:50:25", "endTime": "2024/08/21 17:51:56", "cost": 90.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 01:51:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 01:50:25"}

But ongoing research shows many reasons could be at play, including your genes, where you live, and even the air you breathe.\n\n【1】Though some things, like emotional trauma and infection, can worsen MS symptoms, there is no evidence to suggest that anything you do could cause the disease or stop its natural progress.\n\n【2】Your Immune System Goes Awry\n----------------------------\n\n【3】MS is an autoimmune condition. Doctors don’t know why, but something tells your immune system to attack your body. With MS, the focus is on myelin, a fatty substance that covers the nerve fibers in your brain and spinal cord. Its job is to protect them like the plastic that wraps around the wires in your phone charger. When myelin is messed up, your nerves can’t send messages back and forth the way they should. Without their protective coating, your nerves can get damaged, too.\n\n【4】You might be more likely to get MS if you have another autoimmune condition like inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid disease, or type 1 diabetes.\n\n【5】The Environment Raises Your Odds\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】MS is more likely to affect people who live in certain places and belong to specific ethnic groups. It’s especially common in cooler climates like Scotland, Scandinavia, and throughout northern Europe -- places that are farther from the equator. People who live close to the equator are least likely to get it. In the U.S. it affects white people more than other racial groups.\n\n【7】If you move from a place where MS is rare to a place where it’s common before you’re a teenager, you’ll also be more likely to get it. This suggests that something about the place you live before puberty raises your odds of getting MS. It could be the amount of sunlight in a day. There’s evidence that vitamin D, which your body makes when it’s exposed to sunlight, helps protect you from immune-related diseases.\n\n【8】Are you a smoker? Then you’re also more likely to get MS. And you’ll probably have a worse case that progresses faster than cases for nonsmokers. Quitting can slow the disease down, though, whether you do it before or after you’re diagnosed.\n\n【9】If you smoke and you have clinically isolated syndrome -- a first instance of MS symptoms that lasts for about 24 hours -- you have a greater chance of a second episode and an MS diagnosis.\n\n【10】Is Multiple Sclerosis Hereditary?\n---------------------------------\n\n【11】No. You don’t get it from your parents. But the risk factors could be in your genes. If your parents or siblings have it, you’re far more likely to get it, too.\n\n【12】Researchers believe there’s more than one gene that boosts your odds of getting MS. Some think you’re born with something in your genes that makes you more likely to react to triggers in the world around you. Once you’re exposed to it, your immune system responds. New ways to identify genes may help answer questions about the role genetics plays in MS.\n\n【13】Do Sex Hormones Play a Role?\n----------------------------\n\n【14】There’s growing proof that hormones, including sex hormones, can affect and be affected by your immune system. For example, estrogen and progesterone, two important female sex hormones, may suppress your immune system. When these hormone levels are higher during pregnancy, women with MS tend to have less disease activity. Testosterone, the primary male hormone, may also suppress the immune response. Men’s higher levels of testosterone may partly account for the fact that more than twice as many women as men have MS.\n\n【15】Can Viruses Cause MS?\n---------------------\n\n【16】Some studies have shown that two viruses from the herpes family might be linked to MS triggers. Almost all people who have the disease have proteins in their spinal fluid also found in people with a nervous system disease caused by a virus.

It's a symptom of altitude sickness, which happens when you go to higher elevations.\n\n【1】The problem usually starts when you're 8,500 feet above sea level. About a quarter of all people get a headache when they reach that height.\n\n【2】Causes\n------\n\n【3】It's not exactly clear what causes altitude headaches. There's less oxygen as you go higher, and your body may not get enough to nourish all your tissues, a condition called hypoxia. Although hypoxia is part of altitude sickness, doctors still aren't sure if and how it relates to symptoms like headache.\n\n【4】What experts do know is that the higher you go, the greater the odds of getting a headache. You can cut your chances if you gradually get your body used to the higher elevation. For example, if you live at sea level, you're more likely to get a headache when you travel to 8,500 feet than someone who already lives at the base of the mountain at, say, 5,000 feet.\n\n【5】How fast you go up a peak matters, too. An 8-minute ski lift to the top of the mountain is more likely to give you a headache than a leisurely hike over several days that climbs to the same height. Just beware of pushing yourself too hard at higher altitudes, as with running, climbing, or skiing, which also raises your headache risk.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】Moderate headache pain typically starts as you get up to around 8,500 feet, most often on both sides of the head. You might notice that it worsens as you go higher or when you cough, push yourself hard, or bend over. Another clue that higher altitude caused your headache is that it goes away within 24 hours of getting back below 8,200 feet.\n\n【8】Headache is the most common sign of altitude sickness, and one may happen without other symptoms. But there are other typical problems with this illness. You may also feel tired, weak, dizzy, nauseated, and have trouble sleeping.\n\n【9】Prevention\n----------\n\n【10】If you're headed to a higher elevation, the best way to prevent an altitude headache is to go up slowly. You're much more likely to get sick when you go up more than about 1,600 feet per day, especially if your body is working hard.\n\n【11】It helps to drink plenty of water, 12 or more cups a day, as you head to higher elevations, and to increase the carbohydrates in your diet to around three-quarters of your calories. Tobacco and alcohol make it harder for your body to get used to higher altitudes, as can medications like barbiturates and sleeping pills. Talk to your doctor about your medicine if you're unsure.\n\n【12】Treatment\n---------\n\n【13】Getting to a lower elevation is the best treatment for altitude headache and altitude sickness in general. In more serious cases, it may help to breathe in some oxygen, which you can carry with you in small canisters, until you can get to a lower elevation.\n\n【14】If you tend to get altitude headaches, you may be able to help prevent them if you take medications like furosemide, acetazolamide (Diamox), or corticosteroids before you get to high altitudes. You'll need a doctor's prescription for these drugs.\n\n【15】Over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or aspirin might help both before and after the headache starts. The migraine medicine sumatriptan also helps some people.

Blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis, as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis.\n\n【2】X-rays of the affected joints are the main way osteoarthritis is identified. The common X-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage, narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones, and bone spur formation. Simple X-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist the decision-making as to when surgical intervention should be considered.\n\n【3】Arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. During arthrocentesis, a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. Joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout, infection, and other causes of inflammatory arthritis. Removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis may help relieve pain, swelling, and inflammation.\n\n【4】Arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. Abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. If successful, patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery.\n\n【5】Finally, a careful analysis of the location, duration, and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. Therefore, Heberden's nodes and Bouchard's nodes of the fingers and bunions of the feet can help the doctor make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:06:57", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:07:03", "cost": 5.679}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:07:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:06:57"}

People with asthma experience symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus. Common asthma symptoms include:\n\n【2】*   Coughing, especially at night\n*   Wheezing\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest tightness, pain, or pressure\n\n【3】Still, not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You may not have all of these symptoms, or you may have different symptoms at different times. Your asthma symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild during one and severe during another.\n\n【4】Some people with asthma may go for extended periods without having any symptoms, interrupted by periodic worsening of their symptoms called asthma attacks. Others might have asthma symptoms every day. In addition, some people may only have asthma during exercise, or asthma with viral infections like colds.\n\n【5】Mild asthma attacks are generally more common. Usually, the airways open up within a few minutes to a few hours. Severe attacks are less common but last longer and require immediate medical help. It is important to recognize and treat even mild asthma symptoms to help you prevent severe episodes and keep asthma under better control.\n\n【6】**See More:** **10 Worst Smog Cities in America**\n\n【7】Know the Early Symptoms of Asthma\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】Early warning signs are changes that happen just before or at the very beginning of an asthma attack. These signs may start before the well-known symptoms of asthma and are the earliest signs that your asthma is worsening.\n\n【9】In general, these signs are not severe enough to stop you from going about your daily activities. But by recognizing these signs, you can stop an asthma attack or prevent one from getting worse. Early warning signs of an asthma attack include:\n\n【10】*   Frequent cough, especially at night\n*   Losing your breath easily or shortness of breath\n*   Feeling very tired or weak when exercising\n*   Wheezing or coughing after exercise\n*   Feeling tired, easily upset, grouchy, or moody\n*   Decreases or changes in lung function as measured on a peak flow meter\n*   Signs of a cold or allergies (sneezing, runny nose, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, and headache)\n*   Trouble sleeping\n\n【11】If you have these warning signs, adjust your medication, as described in your asthma action plan.\n\n【12】Know the Symptoms of an Asthma Attack\n-------------------------------------\n\n【13】An asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle surrounding the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed and the cells lining the airways produce more and thicker mucus than normal.\n\n【14】All of these factors -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and difficulty performing normal daily activities. Other symptoms of an asthma attack include:\n\n【15】*   Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out\n*   Coughing that won't stop\n*   Very rapid breathing\n*   Chest pain or pressure\n*   Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\n*   Difficulty talking\n*   Feelings of anxiety or panic\n*   Pale, sweaty face\n*   Blue lips or fingernails\n\n【16】The severity of an asthma attack can escalate rapidly, so it's important to treat these asthma symptoms immediately once you recognize them.\n\n【17】Without immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, your breathing will become more labored. If you use a peak flow meter at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50%. Many asthma action plans suggest interventions starting at 80% of normal.\n\n【18】As your lungs continue to tighten, you will be unable to use the peak flow meter at all. Gradually, your lungs will tighten so there is not enough air movement to produce wheezing. You need to be transported to a hospital immediately. Unfortunately, some people interpret the disappearance of wheezing as a sign of improvement and fail to get prompt emergency care.\n\n【19】If you do not receive adequate asthma treatment, you may eventually be unable to speak and will develop a bluish coloring around your lips. This color change, known as cyanosis, means you have less and less oxygen in your blood. Without aggressive treatment for this asthma emergency, you may lose consciousness and eventually die.\n\n【20】If you are experiencing an asthma attack, follow the \"Red Zone\" or emergency instructions in your asthma action plan immediately. These symptoms occur in life-threatening asthma attacks. You need medical attention right away.\n\n【21】For more detail, see WebMD’s article Asthma Attack Symptoms.\n\n【22】Know the Asthma Symptoms in Children\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】Asthma affects as many as 10% to 12% of children in the United States and is the leading cause of chronic illness in children. For unknown reasons, the incidence of asthma in children is steadily increasing. While asthma symptoms can begin at any age, most children have their first asthma symptoms by age 5.\n\n【24】Not all children with asthma wheeze. Chronic coughing with asthma may be the only obvious sign, and a child’s asthma may go unrecognized if the cough is attributed to recurrent bronchitis.\n\n【25】For more detail, see WebMD’s Asthma in Children.\n\n【26】Know About Unusual Asthma Symptoms\n----------------------------------\n\n【27】Not everyone with asthma has the usual symptoms of cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Sometimes individuals have unusual asthma symptoms that may not appear to be related to asthma. Some \"unusual\" asthma symptoms may include the following:\n\n【28】*   rapid breathing\n*   sighing\n*   fatigue\n*   inability to exercise properly (called exercise-induced asthma)\n*   difficulty sleeping or nighttime asthma\n*   anxiety\n*   chronic cough without wheezing\n\n【29】Also, asthma symptoms can be mimicked by other conditions such as bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction, and even heart failure.\n\n【30】It's important to understand your body. Talk with your asthma doctor and others with asthma. Be aware that asthma may not always have the same symptoms in every person.\n\n【31】For more detail, see WebMD’s article Unusual Asthma Symptoms.\n\n【32】Know Why Infections Trigger Asthma Symptoms\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Sometimes a virus or bacterial infection is an asthma trigger. For instance, you might have a cold virus that triggers your asthma symptoms. Or your asthma can be triggered by a bacterial sinus infection. Sinusitis with asthma is common.\n\n【34】It’s important to know the signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections and to call your health care provider immediately for diagnosis and treatment. For instance, you might have symptoms of increased shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or wheezing with a bronchial infection. In people who don’t have asthma, the bronchial infection may not trigger the same debilitating symptoms. Know your body and understand warning signs that an infection might be starting. Then take the proper medications as prescribed to eliminate the infection and regain control of your asthma and health.\n\n【35】For more detail, see WebMD’s article Infections and Asthma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 09:34:01", "endTime": "2024/08/22 09:34:17", "cost": 15.619}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 17:34:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 17:33:58"}

But we don’t always know which vaccines our children should get and when.\n\n【1】The most current recommendations for some -- but not all -- childhood immunizations from the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (AICP) include:\n\n【2】*   One rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq), recommended in a three-dose schedule at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Another vaccine (Rotarix) requires two doses, given between 8 weeks and 16 weeks. The first dose of either vaccine should be given before the child reaches 15 weeks old.  Children should receive all doses of rotavirus vaccine before they turn 8 months old. Rotavirus vaccination should not be initiated for infants more than 15 weeks old and should not be given after age 32 weeks (8 months old).  Both vaccines are given by putting drops in the child’s mouth.\n*   Rotavirus is the most common cause of infectious childhood diarrhea and has historically one of the biggest reasons for childhood hospitalizations for dehydration in the U.S. although widespread use of the rotavirus vaccine has reduced the numbers. Both vaccines carry a small increased risk of intussusception -- a rare condition in which the small bowel folds back inside another part of the intestine, causing a bowel obstruction.\n*   The influenza vaccine, or flu shot, is now recommended for all children ages 6 months and older.\n*   The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine should be first given at ages 12 to 15 months and a recommended second dose should be given at ages 4 to 6 years.\n*   The human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) is recommended in a three-dose schedule, with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. Routine vaccination with HPV is recommended for males and females aged 11 to 12 years of age. The vaccination series can be started as young as age 9 years; and a catch-up vaccination is recommended through 26 years for those who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the full vaccine series. HPV is associated with cervical cancer and genital warts.\n\n【3】The Importance of Vaccines for Children\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】Vaccines are the best way we have to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Next to sanitation and clean drinking water, vaccines have been called the greatest public health intervention in history. Many diseases that were once prevalent in the U.S. are now at their lowest levels in decades, thanks to vaccines.\n\n【5】Why Do We Need a Childhood Immunization Schedule?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Because of a child's developing immune system, doctors have found that vaccines work best when they are given at certain ages.\n\n【7】For example, measles vaccine is not usually given to children until they are at least a year old. If it is given earlier, it might not work as well.\n\n【8】Also, some vaccines require multiple doses before complete immunization occurs. For these to be effective, it is important that the doses are not given too close to one another. This is why doctors have developed schedules for immunizations for your children. However, if a child misses a recommended dose at a given age, they can catch up later.\n\n【9】It is important that you maintain accurate records of your child's vaccinations. Proof of childhood immunization is required for public school and many day care programs.\n\n【10】Childhood Vaccine Precautions\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】Today, vaccines are regarded as safe and very important to your child's health. If a child has any moderate or severe illness on the day a vaccine is scheduled, it should probably be delayed until the child feels better. However, your child should not skip a scheduled vaccine if they have a cold or minor illness.\n\n【12】Sometimes, minor side effects can occur with some vaccines, such as swelling or irritation at the injection site or a low-grade fever. Tylenol or ibuprofen given around the time of the vaccination can usually prevent this.\n\n【13】There have been some widely circulated reports that vaccines are somehow linked to autism spectrum disorders. A recent, wide-ranging scientific investigation conducted by the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no association between autism and vaccines. In fact, the original journal article previously linking autism and vaccines has been retracted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/22 10:01:03", "endTime": "2024/08/22 10:01:09", "cost": 6.519}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-20 23:36:56", "update_time": "2024-08-21 18:01:09", "grab_time": "2024-08-21 18:01:02"}
